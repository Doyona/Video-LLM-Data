Just so you’re not watching in suspense - please know that Nate is officially cancer free, and we are so grateful 🙌🏻 He just has a hefty wound that’s taking awhile to heal, and has to get checked yearly for the rest of his life 😅  Wear your sunscreen 😎 Don’t forget your ears 👂🏻 and remember you are not alone in your struggles. We all have ups and downs. You are so loved and appreciated.  Thank y’all so much for the ongoing love and support 💞
Watching this after Kara's epilepsy diagnosis, you guys are so blessed and so are we by being able to watch your story. Thank you so much for sharing ❤
Love that quote. I developed Guillain-Barre from a flu shot that I got as part of a requirement for being a nurse. Prior to that, I ran marathons, and rock climbed, etc... Now I live vicariously through yall's adventures bc it unfortunately ruined my balance and coordination and I can't run or jump or stand on my toes. I was 32 when I got it. You just never know. I preach SPF to my boys religiously bc when I grew up, parents didn't send you out with SPF. I am still interested in your gut health phenomenon.  I know y'all drink the AG one but I tried it and my gut biome was destroyed by antibiotics that my doctor over-prescriped not knowing what she was even treating. Please do a video on it. Your gut is as important as your brain, in fact, they call it your 2nd brain. And I have watched y'all morph your guts into tolerating a lot of different foods. Please think about it.
My hubby had the same thing on the top of his head in 2010.  Day before Thanksgiving the doctor said he needed it removed and so he did. He has been perfectly healthy ever since. Better to remove it and be safe. Hope you are doing well.

It’s strange, I’m a 56 yr old grumpy Englishman who is about as emotional as a lump of wood, unless it’s one of my kids yet this story still upsets me even though I’ve watched this about 4 times. Love you guys, keep loving each other and your families and I hope to see many more crazy videos 😊😊
I admire you guys put so much personal info on social media. Making awareness and help to relate and knowing where to go for help is wonderful
I have Skin cancer I've had 20 bouts of SRT radiation and now have melanoma
I have a mole check done every single year. I’ve lost part of my left ear to Basil cell carcinoma and I have multiple scars from having pre cancerous moles removed.  I’m an 80s child. Sunscreens wasn’t a thing, it was baby oil, AND I’ve found out I’m highly allergic to most sunscreens so that’s been fun.
Omg I just now saw this video 3 years later I’m so glad that you are okay! ❤
I know it all worked out, years later.  I have had multiple basal cell operations.  Kind of "benign" but a big paid.  A couple on the face, made for it to be real difficult to hide and you get "are you ok", :"what happened"
Thank you thank you so much for talking about it. I was diagnosed with skin cancer and had it through covid. It's been a hard 2 years.
41 years ago my mother had her first skin cancer removed and is now 86 and has lost count of how many times she's had this procedure done again over the years
Nate, you were strong which is what you needed to do. I am impressed with you.
Nate I know this video was 2 yrs ago. As I am just watching it,  I'm in tears,  I went through skin cancer last year Melanoma. I'm old enough to be your Momma, so these are Mom tears. I'm so glad you're ok. We did it!!
Heavenly Father,  in the mighty name of   J e s u s. C h r I s t.  I lift a   p r a y e r   for every soul watching this video and commenting under it and every soul in general.  Break all generational curses and w I t c h c r a f t curses from, Dear L o r d and  Dear Father G o d.  Cure them of their    c a n c e r   and destroy every single cell,  Dear God, in the mighty name of J e s u s C h r i s t and in his pure, holy, precious blood.  Blood he shed for us on the cross.  I trust in you G o d.  I believe in you G o d.   have faith in you G o d.  I decree and declare it is done.  Amen.  I love you Fathers.

Tips to beating cancer and other diseases:  1. Only drink water and drink 2-3l a day. 2. Eat mainly root vegetables that are organic. (especially turnips) 3. Do what almost no one is able to do, and that is eat your 3 meals in a 6 to maximum 8 hour window a day. (start meal to end meal, in order for the body to repair itself much faster) 4. Totally leave:sugar/sweeteners/normal cheap unhealthy fats. Cancer lives of sugar.  That will make it a lot easier for you guys.  Good luck.
Welp! Had to come back and rewatch this, had the same type cut out today.  Not a lotta fun.  Thanks for sharing.
R.I.P.!
How are you doing today 😊😊😊?.
They say it's always because of the sun damage? Pretty strange how skin cancer has gone off the charts since the "JABS" ? Stranger yet is the Millions if not Billions of other humans on this planet who have little access to SPF creams, lotions or medications as well as protective clothing and don't get or have cancer issues??  Stranger yet is how many people who after getting the "JAB" developed allergic reactions to medications they had no issues with before getting poked and a lot of these reactions caused serious problems with the skin!!
You should be ashamed of yourselves I really did have Cancer! Chemo and radiation surgery's etc
I don't really consider this to be that urgent! They told you it wasn't ever going to metastasize! so what was the reason for this over 12 minute video? I had both Uterine and Breast Cancer! E+ Progesterone+ needed both Chemo and 2 and a half months of radiation you try that and to be sure I always worry and walk the line!!! You have no idea what it's like to have Cancer I had to have a complete  Overectomy They cut out my ovaries and tubes all of it
I love how they always push eachother out of their comfort zones no matter how big or small outside it is
That is the worst first 10 seconds of audio I've ever heard in a YouTube video, lol, good mic work.
Hi Kara and Nate,  I live in South Africa. The sun is always shining here and there is always the risk of developing skin cancer if you have a light skin. I developed a growth on the lower eye lid of my right eye. I do not know if it is cancer or just a benign growth but I went on a high nutrition diet for about two months and the growth have shrunk noticeably.   I would like to share the diet with you.  The soup Ingredients: - two handfuls of Chopped broccoli, one chopped onion (purple), two bags of green tea, two pinches of mixed herbs, two sticks of cut celery, Two handfuls of frozen and crushed spinach or kale, half a table spoon of crushed garlic, Three shakes of black pepper, seven shakes of turmeric, two tablespoons full of apple cider vinegar (with the mother), one bag of white onion powder soup for flavour, a hand full of cooked red speckled beans and a handful of cooked mince meat.  Just add all the ingredients in a pot, add boiling water and switch the stove on high till the water boils. Then lower the heat until the water simmer, Let the soup simmer for an hour. The soup is now ready.  I would only drink water in the morning. At 12h00 I would start eating the soup. There will be about two helpings that you can eat in the 12h00 to 18h00 time frame. I also ate a fruit salad every day in the 12h00 to 18h00 time frame.  (Note: Apparently turmeric reduces the effect of some chemotherapy drugs and thus should not be taken during chemotherapy.)  During the rest of the week I would also eat food that contains vitamin D like avocado’s, mushrooms, liver and eggs in the 12h00 to 18h00 time frame.   It seems to be working for me, maybe it will also work for you.  I pray to God the Father in the name of Jesus Christ that Nate will be cancer free. Amen.  Best regards   Chris  “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life”. John 3:16 (King James Version Bible)  Jesus Christ is the only begotten Son Of God the Father.
I literally just went through EVERYTHING you went through in this video.  Basal cell and had it cut outta my shoulder/neck.  From one Tennesseean to another….solidarity brother. 💪🏻✊🏻
I m a shame of my contry for peper spray😢🤦
Nate I'm so glad you took care of it. I had a tiny mole on my back my whole life .My husband said "it looks funny". I had it checked & it was melanoma. It was biopsied on that Fri, following Friday it was removed. So glad I did because below the surface it was huge. I get checked now EVERY 3 months. I've since had basil cell & squamous cell. It's so important to always be checked. So glad you are ok. More importantly so glad you did it.  ❤
My dad was diagnosed years ago with Basal Cell Carcinoma.   He is 84 and doing great.  Once in a while he has to go in and get a spot burned off.  He is religious with his sunscreen but loves the outdoors.  So glad you caught it early and can now take all the precautions while continuing to do all the things you love. I have definately been more careful all my life knowing my family is prone.
Why don't you change the title of your video to "i don't have skin cancer"?
Does AG1 really work to improve your health. The fore most creators who advocate for it two of them have cancer. Is AG1 the one causing the cancer. I dont know but someone should investigate this. Maybe the FDA
Why live in a bubble meet up with other races in humanity who live van life...
I had an aggressive internal cancer 12 years ago. No chemo or conventional treatment by my choice. The fact that I am alive is nothing short of a miracle.  When your faced with a death diagnosis it  takes you to places you never thought possible and forces you to confront life and death through different lenses.  My real miracle wasn't that I was healed (although grateful), my miracle was that I had someone who walked with me through every step of my journey giving me peace and comfort that is hard to describe but that was so tangible I knew whether I lived or died, I was going to be ok.  My Creator Jesus has given me life that is real and cannot be taken away by any disease or darkness that comes my way. No amount of wealth or the best of what this world has to   offer compares to a relationship with Him.
Slowing making my way through your 900+ videos and been avoiding this one until now. I'm glad you are doing well and your next coffee is on me. Stay strong and keep making content. Thank you for the great videos and the inspiration to travel. Take care!
Time for your booster vaxtard, gotta grow that tumor big and strong.
Absolutely happy for you that you have the all Clear !!The message from Kara, where she mentioned how not to take your health for granted and the crown that sick people can see on healthy  individuals , really resonate ! I was active , enjoying trip by plane and transatlantic …now i have 1 auto-immune condition and pots syndromes with really debilitating symptoms ..and each summer and holidays i see people  being free and enjoying their time outside … its almost impossible to accept it …just wanting to share …
Little jab'll do ya!
I found you guy's not even a month ago. I and my son have been watching your adventures as if they where potato chips. # 0r four at a time.  I'm happy you are both healthy.  I am surprised not more people showed their good wishes for you both.
Just been through this myself. All the best guys and remember hats and sunscreen.
Geez! How on earth did I miss this. I'm glad Nate ha recovered. Safe travels. ❤❤
This is life threatening it always comes back. Please be your own advocate and get scans every three months. The recurrence rate of coming back is almost one hundred percent. If you keep on top of it you will be fine but if you ignore it........ I wish you the best of luck on your journey
POV they have never worn SPF in their entire life and are shocked as to how this could happen ?? like seriously
Bald spot gang For different reasons but yea.
I don’t know who will see this or when. But I came back to this video because tomorrow I have having the same treatment. Watching this again has calmed my nerves and made me feel much better about the whole situation. Thank you so much Nate, and Kara for sharing this again!
i am so sorry! praying for you and anyone else that needs a prayer😢💙💜❤️💜💙
Happy you’re fine now. 🙏
Hey Kara and Nate. Sorry you had to go through this. My brother had Stage 3 Blood Cancer when he was 5 and it was super scary, not knowing he was going to live. 6 months of kemo therapy and he is now 20 and cancer free! I’m glad that everything is ok with you and that the cancer is gone!😊
Basal Cell! O had Squamous that took up my hand and n place on arm . its BASAL!i
You will be at risk for more skin cancers so you need to wear a sun hat on that head not a baseball cap.
Praise the Lord!❤️🙏🏻
NOOB
I tell the loved ones "attitude is altitude"Your sunny outlook( in general) will really help!
The same thing happend to me and I’m 11
people will really dislike anything 💀
I have fought skin cancer for more than 30 years. Basal cell. Just wear sun screens. A hat. Sleeves if the sun is intense. Take care. Many blessings
Only came across your videos today, and noticed this one. What a relief for you both that Nate is safe, and a reminder to me not to take my health for granted either. Best wishes.
First I want you both to know that I recently have been watching your videos and how much they have blessed me! You are both such an inspiration and beautiful young couple. You're Beautiful smiles bring such joy. I am so glad to hear that you are cancer-free and thank you for being so transparent by sharing something so personal  with us. I am so thankful to have found these videos 💜
My grandad has skin cancer
I had early stage of skin cancer, but I got it removed. I'm just grateful I wasn't in the late stage and I was going to have to fight it
Kyrgyzstan is Central Asia. But keep at it. You can fight it, dude.
Skin cancer blows just because it's the ultimate scare that could legit be the end game or just two trips to the doctor and you're done. Mostly unecessary anxiety but on the other hand very justified anxiety lol.
What color is your bugatti
If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.  For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.Romans 10. 9-10  so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many; and he will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him.Hebrews 9. 28
Skill issue ⚠️
Hope your fine.
Glad you are okay! you guys are such an amazing couple <3
That first dermatologist!? How can a dermatologist miss something so serious? I hope you switched doctors. I am very happy you are ok!
Love you guys....Congrats Nate #cancerfree🙏🏾🙌🏾💪🏾👏🏾❤️
Basal cell cancers are quite common and are only called cancer in name only.  They are basically benign tumors.  My mother in law has very far skin and has had them for years.  You just remove them and voila.  I am glad for you.  Melanoma would have been quite a different animal.
i am glad for you to
sending u good energy ♥
Onwards and upwards! Wishing you only good health from here on in. Take care xxx
It is not the sun. Remember you visited and spend in Chernobyl and this is the most probable reason. Wish you speedy recovery. 🥺🥺
Ive had to go through a surgery myself, not for cancer but something else, the scariest part for me was getting the full anesthetic, the needle hurt and the breathing mask was strange but i stood through it and I hope to never experience it again.
Bro I though this said 11 hours O_O smh
Nate,  My 1st basal cell was when I was about your age. Now decades have passed and Ive had many more MOHs and non MOHs procedures to remove basal cells in various parts of my face and body over the years.They are not life threatening as long as you attend to them. Let them go, and they can be very problematic. I wear sunscreen every day now whether indoor or outdoors. My suggestion to you is have a total dermatological skin check at least twice a year. I was an avid cyclist so I had too much sun exposure in my youth. The consequences of this is, later in life, skin cancer can show up. I have skin checks every 3 months now.   Regards and best wishes, Jeff
Im so sopry for you but i think. the mud from the death sea helps if you wanna fly to there
I just came across your channel and I love your videos!!  My boyfriend was diagnosed with Melanoma 2 years ago.  He had a black mole of the side of his face for about 6 months prior and I finally convinced him to get it checked.  Glad I did.  We got it just in time!!  We were told that although Melanoma is serious and can be fatal, if you catch it in time, it's treatable and reoccurrence is fairly low.  Well, it's been 2 years and he is cancer free!!  He will have to go to the dermatologist every 3-6 months for the rest of his life but I think we like that option better than the alternative!! Glad you got through this!!  Happy and safe travels!!😀
God Bless
I just had my second Basal cell cancer removed. I hate needles and any kind of invasive procedure but it’s best to get it done as early as possible because then they don’t have to go as deep. Both of mine were only one layer needed. The first one was five years ago on the bridge of my nose and the second one was on my back just below my shoulder. I’m still waiting to get the stitches out …one more week before I can go swimming woo hoo. Glad to hear it’s just a basal cell and not the M word.
Take organic antioxidants!!!
You mat have saved millions of people's lives through sharing your experience, Nate. God bless Nate and Kara, you two are precious ❤️
This popped up on my homepage this morning, and my heart really sank - glad to hear all is OK now!
PRAY FOR YOUR QUICK AND FULL RECOVERY 💪
What color is your butgatti
Thank you Dr emuakhe from Africa.this is my third time of experiencing the effectiveness of your great herbs for the immediate relief of Cancer.i will place order for my old mom.more grace to your able sir...
It’s no fun man. I had 3 removed in 2019. 1 on my back and 2 on my face. Was horrible. You got this.
Life is for living - thank you for sharing
Such a great reminder for us outdoor sunshine adventures!  Glad you are ok Nate!  Thanks for sharing!
Thanks for this video. I had what I thought was a bad spider bite  I saw the spider known as a white tale crawl out from my sheets...it didn't heal... covid rolled in and it still would bubble scab dissappear then repeat and I avoided going to the doctor because of covid and this video was what got me to the dermatologist. .luckily it was basal cell and 'small' ..although  I now have two large slices down my shoulder blade that cost 6000 dollars to remove  .So 2 lessons  for me wear a rash shirt if you can't put sunscreen on properly and get insurance.let's hope that is it for both of us .take care.
So glad Nate is all clear of skin cancer, kara and Nate is the best channel ever
Eat blackberries  and  boysenberry  to ellimate skin cancer !
It's okay Nate i have had brain cancer for 5 years now
Wow thanks for posting this! 💛 currently in a similar situation and actually helped so much to feel less alone. Y’all are rad!
When I watched your packing video, and you mentioned Nate getting skin cancer removed, I wondered if he has got what I've got. And low and behold, it's the same type of skin cancer as mine. The skin doctor reassured me it's not melanoma. And that it's normal to have basal cell carcinoma. I told him that my father (God rest his kind soul) had melanoma which progressed to his liver.  This video also gave me a reminder/more of a push to book in to have it removed.    I'm glad to hear that yours has been removed, Nate as you and Kara are both a lovely couple and deserve plenty of health and happiness for years and years and years and years to come!
if you have skin cancer that is what you get from wearing sunscreen!
Skin cancer is super, super  common, especially among outdoors people. Most people get skin cancer in their life, most skin cancer isn’t life threatening unless it’s melanoma. Just go to the dermatologist and get cut out. Skin cancer for clicks, a lot of drama for basal cell. Glad you got it off but not a cancer to worry about. It’s not breast cancer.
DR OBELA ON YOUTUBE CURED ME TOTALLY ( #drobela )..
Whoa! What’s up with you van lifers? Bec just had chemotherapy, a lumpectomy and radiation! I’m happy you’re well!
I love y’all dearly but I wish this video was titled something that gave away the end results.  Maybe like “ i had  skin cancer removed” the title “I have skin cancer”  was really scary to read. I wish you nothing but great health in the future and I am very glad to hear you’re doing okay!!
I really appreciate the way Nate reassured us right at the start that all ends well. It goes to show how much he cares about the well being of his fans because he didn’t want to stress us out by keeping us in anxious suspense, it wasn’t used as a money making opportunity (they always advertise better health anyway and it’s definitely a well placed advert anyway). Kara stayed strong especially for him because she always cried but she forced herself to be brave to reduce his fear. They are a beautiful couple, I’m so glad they have each other. Looking forward to watching then continue to thrive and make the most of life. Our whole family loves u guys (myself and my 6 kids) and despite being a disabled single mum I’ve been utterly inspired by yourselves and others like you and I’m working towards van life within the next few years. Thankyou for your inspirational videos and also I’d love to read a book of how you made your dreams a reality, how to actually manage financially to start with and extra stories we haven’t seen plus lovely pictures. It would be fab. Ok take care guys, much love from me (💎 Gem) and the gang xxx
How did it turn out? Really hope he deteriorated, really do. Any news on him.
I'm glad to see hes okay the channel wouldn't be the same would it kara?
I was just in Nashville 2 weeks ago I also had skin cancer stage one melanoma on the back of my leg all good they got everything best of look to you. Every year I go to dermatologist they have taken other spots out that if no ot removed would turn to cancer I check myself all the time and sunscreen every day .
There's no such thing as cancer free my friend. Your very likely to get it again, especially if your constantly traveling via flights, look up radiation you get from flights. Good luck though!
Hugs Nate🙏💕 Thank you both for sharing 💕💕
Why do all the van lifers have cancer?!?
Rich people problems. Why did YouTube’s algorithms send me this?
Che sintomi ha avuto
Che sintomi ha avuto
You are so brave nate.
🙏🙏
If you get cancer, basal cell would be the one I’d pick if i could pick what type. My Mom just had basal and squamous cell (2 times) and I just had melanoma. You’ll probably be good. I wish you the best!!!
Congrats Nate. My buddy had the same thing on his eyebrown. Missed school 1 day to fet it removed. Came back looking like a mummy. Never a good thing to hear you have cancer but its toleratible when its not fast spreading.
I am so happy that she covered his eyes when showing how big of a chunk out of his head and how she didn't want him to be scared
Spf should be your best friend. Along with hats ect.. you do so much outdoors stuff please protect yourself.
I too just had basil skin cancer in my face- I now have stitches from my mouth to my jaw! Don’t wait people go get checked
This video was very Casey neistatesk
Dr Darrell Wolfe!!! He is in Mexico
Recently diagnosed with melanoma.
Just randomly stumbled upon this video. Please look into the Gerson therapy, I cannot recommend it enough. Millions of people have cured themselves of cancer and other diseases with this natural, holistic treatment protocol. I know two people personally who've cured themselves of terminal cancers following the Gerson therapy. The book by Charlotte Gerson is a good place to start. Best wishes.
Thank you for sharing! I just relived my Mohs surgery through you. Almost identical scenario except mine was on my nose. They had to dig it out and used bovine cells to fill the crater they left. It looks pretty good. Nobody even notices it. Thanks for raising awareness, use sunscreen and make regular visits to your dermatologist. Wishing you all the best!
🙏❤️🙏
So glad you are OK and look forward to many more of your travel vlogs. enjoy Canada 🇨🇦
When you come to Australia both of you could get a full skin check. We are the melanoma capital over here and have some awesome specialists. I just got something removed and can recommend an awesome Dr. Happy that you have it all sorted. X
Don't use sunscreen with "oxybenzone" that's been linked to cancer and naturally its in 70% of all sunscreens
You are a Cancer Warrior now Nate! I have to also state that Kara is also in the group since she is your spouse. I have had 3 types of cancer and can tell you that a spouses job is so hard. You have a warrior at your side and she is fighting this with you. Please take precautions now that you are susceptible for additional.
My mom has skin cancer and she’s better now Nate you will be okay you have millions of people supporting you you are not alone🥰
You guys should travel to Temple Texas its a great place and its just a good commitment in general!
So pleased to hear the good news
Well done brother, that must have been scary, there is no such thing as a minor cancer, they are all very very serious.
If it doesn’t mesta.... spread  ..... that is fabulous news!
just found you guys. always get 2nd opinion. hope you were able to. it's been a while since this video so not sure where you are at. all the best. ok watched more and congrats you are cancer free. I still stick with my advice if you ever run into this again.
Stop using that full of chemicals Sun block
I had Moh's surgery done on my face for the same thing.  A sore that just would not go away, I didn't even pick at it, and it just was always there.  Mine, unfortunately was right between my eyes closer to my right eye.  They didn't get it all the first time, so I had to go back in for more.  I was very self conscious after surgery, and didn't want to make eye contact with anyone.  I remember a little girl looking at me like I was some kind of freak show.  I'm much older than you, but can't believe how I've gone from a complete sun worshipper to a spokesperson for sunscreen, hats, and long sleeves.  I'll have a noticeable scar for the rest of my life, but hey I'm cancer free too.  Thank you for sharing your story
In sickness and in health, for richer, for poorer, better or worse...I think you’re the loveliest couple, married and unmarried, I’ve ever seen.
May is skin cancer month….wear your SPF 🧴
I had it on my forehead it was absolutely a bloody mess and I sprayed it from spraying it with peroxide and it's gone now
FaceTime I have you I’m gonna be all right God loves you
Loved karas reaction and face and how he couldn't even tell if she was okay or not she's such an amazing wife I'm so glad he's okay
lol

Oh man! I know how you feel! I've had many mohs surgeries thanks to the Southern Utah summer sun! I grew up playing outside sunbathing etc! I'm paying for it big time now. My first mohs was on the top of my head, size of a nickel scar. Others: my back, both sides of nose, above my eyebrows, left nostril was the worst ever! With skin draft off my ear. My right shoulder and forearm, many on my chest one was squamous cell. Some close to my nipple so that explains some skinny dipping back in the day. One squamous on my leg. Most of mine were basal cell also. I have to be checked often but the older I get the less are coming on. Most happened from late 30's to 50 years old.
Dr Oiwoh on YouTube is not just a herbal doctor but an educated and intellectual dr who cares about human lives, thank you for curing my cancer..

Always good to talk about and spread awareness

I went through something similar. Thank you for your important video. I wonder what health planning they advised you of? I am fair skinned and avoid the sun and always use sunscreen but was told after my op to knuckle down on this. Take care.
Thanks for sharing your story. After watching it I talked to my doctor about a suspicious mole on my arm. After a biopsy, it turns out it was skin cancer. Having it removed this week. ❤️
Sorry to be late posting.. I fully understand your anxiety..  so far, I've had all 3 -- basal, squamous and melanoma.  It just comes with the territory of being outside.  It's a pain in the rear, yes, but you're going to rock this.  So far I've had close to 80+ surgeries so please stay diligent!

This was a hard one to watch. We just started the cancer journey and it’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done. It’s one of those things that you hear about so much that it almost becomes routine. But then when it happens to you it takes the breath right out of your soul. I’m so glad to see you are cancer free. Your videos make me forget for a bit. If you see this, maybe send some of your good fortune vibes our way. ❤️
I have been a sun worshiper my whole life and at age 69 I am facing what I have done to my skin. I had one spot cut out last Wed. I have previously had several spots cut out and others frozen. The surgery you had does hurt like hell for a few days I'm limping around this week realizing my sun days are OVER. It makes me sad, but I am grateful that mine, like yours, has not been life threatening, yet!
I’ve been watching your videos for years but today was most poignant. I had Mohs Surgery today and have been rewatching your videos to get my mind off the discomfort and came across this particular video. I agree the burning flesh smell was the worst. Glad you have mended, me I’ll need a few days. Jamie
Here's 2 good health.  Thanks 4 posting it, it helps us deal.
Greetings , I have enjoyed watching the two of you on your journey my husband and I are in the process of building out our van. We are about 80% done and hope to be on the roads this summer. I am Happy to see that you had a positive outcome on your healing process. I also had a basel cell scare a few years ago. I started out with the traditional healing methods and the spot was first froze but within a few months it grew back. So I went back to the doctor and they did a topical surgical scraping. They told me if it grew back again they would have to go in and surgically scoop it out. Again it started to grow back within a few months. I started to do my own research because that wasn't an option for me so I searched out alternative methods and I ended up using a method that I discovered through the Edgar Cayce Foundation. I Figured I didn't have anything to lose and it was a topical method using pure cold pressed castor oil and baking soda made into a paste. The castor oil has a high molecular structure and is known to penetrate the skin into the body and the baking soda alkalizes the area. Castor oil has a long history and is known for its healing properties. In ancient times it why is referred to as the  palm of Christ. I applied a pea sized amount under a Band-Aid fo every day for for a period of 5 weeks and it disappeared completely and has never grown back.  I Also had a mole  since I was a little girl and that got bigger over the years. But magically disappeared on its own by going within myself and discovering the cause, which was connected to guilt and releasing that. It blew my whole world view at the time and really discovered the miraculous ability that we have to heal ourselves. My family can testify that was there and then gone. It's amazing how powerful our minds can be when we are aligned to the source of power within us. I'm not opposed to using traditional methods We all have our healing Journey and all of our answers are found within the self and the God within. Gratitude to both of you for inspiring me on my path to create more joy in my life . God bless you both
Thank you for this video! I had a bump on my head that I was ignoring. Because of your video, I went to the dermatologist and got it checked. Pre-Cancer, and they caught it soon enough to get it liquid nitrogen froze off.  Thanks again for your inspirational and fun videos!
sending you love!!
Good job 😊
Thanks for posting this. I have had a couple of skin cancer surgeries in the past and know that I should pay attention to changes. I have had a hard spot on my scalp that I would forget to tell my doctor about. Today, I mentioned it because I had seen you video. It needed removed and now I am good. Thanks.
Poor Nate...
All thanks to doctor Alued on YouTube who cure me from Cancer🇺🇸🌱
All thanks to doctor Alued on YouTube who cure me from Cancer🇺🇸🌱
Happy you are ok, I lost my mom to cancer and its an ugly thing. My sister has cancer and had a biopsy a week ago and she has to do radiation. Glad they were able to get all your cancer out, and hope for the best for your future. Love your videos and boy I would love to book all your travel.
Thank God he's great.
Omg what is happening all my fav youtubers have cancer. Take care man.
when I saw this I started freaking out one of my favorite YouTubers had gotten skin cancer I know am five months late but I still freaked out I'm really happy that he's okay :)
Join the Club Nate I had one for about 10 years before it was conveniently seen while I was in the hospital for pneumonia and like yours easily removed. I hope neither of us suffers another lesion, but we're in good company, Hugh Jackman, 'the greatest showman' has had nine removed. The skin of my neck and right shoulder felt tight for a week. Oh, and the first Post-surgery inpatient's appointment was two weeks later, at least with the quick onsite test they could call you back while you were having lunch. Thank you for sharing this Nate. I know it isn't something that many would like to highlight.
Glad your well Nate! As a 3 time melanoma survivor i know the relief of hearing that the Doctor got it all! May you both continue to have your health, moving forward!
come on dude, 90% of skin cancers are not deadly.
Avoid Cancer by taking 3 or more Soya Lecithin Softgel with a full glass of water from CVS corner drug stores.
💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
Congrats on the great outcome. The mohs procedures are amazing. You'll do fine.
Glad Nate is better now stay safe😃
This reminds me of what Eamon and Bec are going through right now.
So infuriating that a dermatologist would misdiagnosed and send you one your way. Especially without telling you to come back in a week if it hadn't healed yet
Thank you for sharing your story.  I came across this video today as I am recovering from MOHS surgery for a squamous cell carcinoma lesion removed yesterday.  It is so important to remind everyone of the risk of skin cancer, no matter your age. Glad you are okay and you were able to have the entire lesion removed. Stay well!
RE: treating your cancer "Not medical advice. Consult with your doctor." Do your own research. What I would do if I had cancer: 1 pound of cannabis flower consumed over 4 - 5 months ($300 - 400 per month) has shown very promising results (run from the cure documentary) reversing advanced stage cancer. Other treatments I would consider if I had cancer: Vitamin D: - to strengthen and modulate immune function.   - Safe sun exposure: 30 - 45 min of full body, mid-day sun exposure 5 days per week. During weeks with no sun exposure,, take 10000 iu vitamin D for no more than 3 weeks. Then 5000iu daily after. - get blood work every 6 months to be sure  Vit. D is 60 - 100 ng/dL.  - Low Protein diet: No animal products. No protein powders, or foods high in protein such as beans, lentils, peas.  - Avoid added sugar. - cancer feeds on sugar.  - gcMAF therapies: Bravo probiotic.  - vitamin C: 2000 mg every 2 hours.  - juicing vegetables daily.  - Sodium bicarbonate: orally (check correct dose) - to alkalize the body. Take away from food - 2 hours to not neutralize stomach acid needed for digestion. - OR - 1.5 - 2 cups in a bath for 20-30 min 5 days per week.  Eat organic foods.  Bentonite clay body mask or bath - to absorb toxins: full body mask - 30 min., then shower. OR bath - Add 2 cups to bath for 30 min. - 3 - 5 days per week. Digestive detox: Activated charcoal: 8 - 10 caps daily - away from food and sodium bicarb.:  4 - 5 days per week. "Not medical advice. Do your own reasearch" Don't wait. Start NOW.
So glad you are ok!! Massive hugs and lots of love xxx
Being diagnosed with Breast cancer has been a major loss of money and has caused major problems in my immune system, But when I came across Dr Ogoh on YouTube, after taking his herbal medication I was cured completely of cancer disease. Thanks to Dr Ogoh↕️
❤️ 🙏
It's not surprising with just how much time yall spend running around outside in the sun for the past 5+ years. Glad it was localized and easy to fix
Please look into Black seed oil, using it topically and internally.
My mom just got a large sized bit of skin cancer removed from her lip last month. Unfortunate placement as it has left a permanent scar/deformity but its gone and that's what matters! Even though you hear skin cancer, and know its not the "worst" kind... its still a scary feeling to hear the word cancer in any capacity. It also took years for hers to get removed and it kept growing. Glad both her and you are cancer free and healthy now!
Basal cell carcinoma is extremely common and has a 100% survival rate at 5 years. Light-skinned folk know this well... as we often have "pre-cancerous" moles/growths removed, as you saw--in the office, using topical anesthetic. Use sun screen peeps.
Thanks for this. I had testicular cancer. I'm almost at the 5 year clear mark. I know how hard this can be. So glad you're alright.
Puasay
All of my favorite YouTubers like You guys, and Eamon and Bec are having medical problems, wich makes me so sad to hear.
Skin cancer is the easier to fix  .   1)  avoid chemicals    2)   ATP   vitamins    3)  and yellow   foods ...    turmeric has over 500 studies  with proof ...
Oh wow! Thank you for sharing this very personal experience with us, and I am so so relieved that you are ok!! I have traveled a lot too and currently live in Abu Dhabi where it is always very sunny and hot, SPF 50+ is my best friend and goes everywhere with me, it's so so important!! You were both so brave, I understand this must have been an incredibly worrying time for you and I am so thankful that you have both shared this with us, you unknowingly may save many people from going through similar experiences (or worse) from this awareness. Stay safe and strong and keep smiling your beautiful smiles xxx
With the help of #Druromi herbal supplement I was able to beat my cancer permanently.
Just started watching the vlog. Ran into this episode and was on the edge of my seat 🥺. Overjoyed to hear the good news and pray for continued health and well being for you both!
big ahh forehead
All my prayers🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Not nate and bec:((((
Haha dats what u get 😝
I love how you guys love each other
Omg worst bandage ever!
If it was suspicious and you were going to be busy travelling they should have done a removal straight up. Save messing u around and delaying. Also saving you $$
Too many transitions in here
I've had skin cancer many times on my face and over the years have needed 4 surgeries and have 1 more coming up. I'm so glad Nate is cancer free but please have your skin checked every 6 months as mine has resurfaced approx every 5 months over the last 4 years. Always wear a hat and sunscreen and thanks for sharing your story!!!! Stay healthy!
Im so happy for you Nate! that it didnt turn out bad and its gone for good. I wish my  type 1 diabetes could be removed like that lol
Have been fighting stage 3 Melanoma for 4 years now. No remission for me yet, but I am in a new trial. Lots of new things out there so anyone with Melanoma there is hope. Catch it early, everyone should see a dermatologist once a year. Catching it early will save your life.
Why are all the people with youtube channels playing the cancer card?
So heartwarming that Nate immediately checks in with Kara to see if she is okay. What a selfless man. Glad you’re on the mend Nate ❤️
🧢🧢🧢
May god bless u d ur family with better and beautiful healthy and good life ahead.. be cured soon
So glad you are feeling better now Nate. You two are so strong and inspiring. Sending so much love from the bottom of our hearts ❤
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Very happy for you guys God is good 😊
Nate....First off, so happy for you and Kara for the outcome of this event. It's natural to have reacted the way you did and you should feel no embarassment what-so-ever. As a retired airline pilot who has had repeated high altitude radiation exposure for over 40 years, I too have had basal cell skin cancers. 10+ of them. That "Cancer" word is scary at first, but when dealing with the kind you and I have had you find while it isn't fun, it isn't too big a deal. For thoughs who may experience this themselves, in my expreience having had most of mine on my head and neck I can honestly share with you that only the first stick to numb the area hurts and only for a few seconds as the medicine works quickly. I think Nate will agree with me that most of the biopsy and even the Moh's surgery itself is painless and the recovery is more uncomfortable than painful. Fortunately for you Nate and for me as with many others the Melanoma word has never been uttered. That is the much more serious form of skin cancer. Glad you are done with this and hopefully it will be a one-off experience. Look forward to more of your's and Kara's videos!
So glad this ended well!! What a hell you just must have been going through. Stay well you two!!
the Eamon bec couple lol ,sorry no need to bring your personal life on you tube if you got cancer is your business
I was so worried but thanks to god u r alright n Kara u r so strong 😘... 👍 You guys are lyk family🙂
Wow I’m sooooo sorry to hear what you went through but also so happy to hear that they got it all out … God Bless you Nate  stay well !!!!!! And we all need to use sunscreen everyday and put it on your ears 👂 always …..and wear hats 👒 🧢🥳🎩🎓🤠👷‍♂️👩‍🍳🧑‍🌾🕵️‍♀️
Hey guys I'm Newish to your channel a month or so but I've watched so many of your vids binge days haha but I think you showing this is such a positive step especially for anyone who might have something similar an might see you going thru all this an think ye I'm gonna go an see the doctor an that's thanks to you Nate for showing it ❤❤❤
And don't put your cell phone up to your head.  Notice which side Nate uses his phone on?  No coincidence...
Melanoma.  Now that is one you want to avoid.  See a Dermatologist every couple years.  Get a skin screening- especially watch those moles (melanocytes).
Oh wow guys! So very glad you are ok. My dad worked in the sun all his life and delt with skin cancer himself. He got to the where he never went outside without a long shirt on and lots of sunscreen. Please take care of yourselves while you are out there having adventures and keep up the great videos for those of us that can't be doing what yall do.
where is Kara in the video
Pomegranate Juice Apricot Juice (cancer) Tumeric Gummies Eldenberry Vegan Pills Dragon Fruit Juice/Powder
I know this was 3 months ago but I’m really sorry to hear you have skin cancer. It’s not fun when you’re hurting emotionally and physically
Thanks to my doctor who cured me of cancer that almost get rid of my life.
By the tittle I was deeply sad. I thank you for letting us know at the very beginning that the prognostic was good. That experience proves how both of you guys are. I can only imagine how hard it is for both, and it is amazing how strong you guys are supporting each other. Amazing. Happy for both of you. Sorry you have been through this.
Bless y'all 😊
Been there, done that 3 times. Be regular about your checkups and you're golden!
Whew!
God Bless you and your family and hope you get better.🙏🏼❤️
I know that feeling I’ve had two places removed luckily benign but ur still scared out of ur wits.
Glad your fine god bless
I have had melanoma twice and very scary. Thanks for sharing. Glad your good so Am I !
So crazy that I stumbled across this without looking for it. Hubby and I have an eerily similar story, only on his cheekbone. His was removed yesterday, also ended up being basal cell. So he is hurting right now and not happy about his bandage, but we are grateful and have been enjoying your travel videos, especially the Antarctica ones!
Thank you so much for sharing this story,I found your channel becauseI was looking for life after the death of my partner of 18 years,she had stage 4 cancer. I so related to how it feels to have to wait for THAT phone call and how scary it is to watch someone you love go through something serious. You all are inspiring me to go on with my life so much. Like you our lives together were based on always going on the next adventure and she would want me to keep going on the next adventure even though she isn’t here.
❤❤❤
You are both incredible
It’s so crazy how I just started watching you guys vlogs and became so invested that I’m literally binge watching them! When I came across this video I couldn’t help but to tear up 🥺! Cancer sucks!! I’m so happy you’re cancer free!!
This title is clickbate. Yuck.
Glad you're all clear my dad has had four cancerous lumps removed over last three years on his head so I know how hard and worrying it is.
Happy to hear you got the all clear Nate.  I have recently been diagnosed with cancer myself.  It’s been the toughest thing I’ve had to deal with in my life so I completely understand how scared you must have been feeling.    My cancer has a high cure rate, but I have to say the treatment has been very hard on me.  I’m about to get my 2nd cycle of chemo and have had 14 radiation treatments.  I can’t wait for it all to be over.   ~David
All good man. I had the same problem on my back. We removed it and all we need now it’s once or twice per year go for a screening. Stay strong 💪
People with fair skin who are active outdoors a lot in the sun need to be extra careful and have yearly check-ups with a skin specialist. Everyone needs to observe the safety precautions when being active outdoors under the sun.
Thank god he is fine now!
here i am again catching up on your videos but yea i figured something was up i noticed his skin on his head was changing but im not there in person to be like: dude you have to make a video about this you didn't have to do that but im glad you did yes the video ended well on a good note but im still emotional about it, see in 2015 i won a free plane ticket from my city here in ca im like cool i get to be like kara and nate i'll become a traveling man but god had a different plan for me  see because the plane got so high up it caused a brain tumor to grow then (i decided to fly to vegas) but once the plane landed i passed out once i came to drs at a hospital there said: we know you came here for a visit but you need to go home you have a brain tumor and you've been having seizures i thought they were joking i hate those mri machines but that's been part of my life taking meds and getting mri's ofton yea they put me under for that sugary like you nate i had to wait a while then they called me to return to get the stitches out of my head ( 8 across my head) believe me i know you felt im 38 man that's why im still hoping to find a funny women like kara and get married it's very hard to keep your mind off stuff like that they even asked if i had a problem having the surgery at 6am im like no let's do it let's get this over with i mean sure friends and family came to see me but i noticed if your married they don't get you out for visiting !!
I have the. Corona virus
Skin cancer runs in my family, we live in Florida and do the beach pretty hard plus travel 5-6 times a year … you guys had me tearing up. Happy for you Nate
Glad all was ultimately okay. Just keep on top of six month check ups.
come on we can do this... i had blood cancer and know that if you2 need support then im yours... Jim from UK
“Good health is a crown 👑 on a well man’s head that only the sick can see”   I love that!
I think this video is an example of hour a real, raw relationship is like. Kara standing there during the entire surgery, making sure he knew she was there, and then being there in every single second and feeling everything as if it was her own health shows how you want to find a partner in life that goes with you for the good, the bad and the ugly. A real relationship. ❤️
Me to
Feeling happy for you man.... Great success 👍
God Bless you both with Good health.
Truth: "Good health is a crown on a well man's head, that only the sick can see."  Thanks for sharing this wise quote. Love your channel! Wishing you both all the best in the new year!
I did too and I sprayed it with t Hydrogen peroxide a few times and it killed it.  Everybody laughed but you might want to try it
I have about 25 Basel cell surgeries….I am older and so just hereditary and too much sun as a kid.  Some are worse than others but nothing awful except the recovery
Andrà tutto bene.
I've had 5 basel cells spots removed and one squamous cell spot - it's never pleasant but the basel cell spots are rarely a problem.  Just keep an eye open for little spots that don't heal, or go away and come back - especially if there is a little bleeding.  It does get much easier.  Hang in there and take care.  love your videos.
Been dealing with cancer since I was 18.  Cancer free 60yr old now, but I had to kick it's butt a few times.  Just discovered you guys.  You had me  laughing till I cried.  To be able to do that about something like this..or life in general...PRICELESS.
From a person who works in dermatology, BCC is the least aggressive and most common. I’m sorry that you had to go through this . this is extremely common😭 happy you are doing well.
My grandfather has had skin cancer my whole life and he’s now 87 and he’s the healthiest person I know. You will be good promise.!!!   just keep sunscreen above 50 spf  on and wear a hat and keep covered up and you’ll have more spots come up if your in the sun to much and they’ll have you come in and remove it.
You should drive to the Hippocrates Health Center in florida  to learn how to eat to beat cancer
Hi guys sorry to here the news.... i had can a few years and  i am sure that you may always know this and its important to try and stay strong and i wish you well both of you.... if you fancy popping over  to uk it would be my pleasure to see you around  Jim
God bless you both. 🙏🏿💜
Modern medicine is wonderful.   Stay strong.
PTL! Glad to know all is well...but please take care of your health moving forward. Take care.
My Dad has had many BCCs taken off his body.  His dermatologist told him this was sun damage done in his childhood, which is kinda funny to us, because he grew up in Scotland.  He told the doctor, "But I grew up in Central Scotland...We had no sun, there!" But turns out that being that far north made the sunshine even more dangerous, than where his children (my sister and myself) grew up (South East Asia.)  If you need to have further lesions taken off in the future, especially if they are in very visible places on your body or on your face, look into a provider of PDT (photo dynamic therapy.) The liquid part of this process was actually a treatment for eczema in the past; they apply the liquid to your skin, cover it up to allow it to soak in for an hour or so, but bandage the area so as to completely exclude light, before bringing you back in for light treatment.  During this period where the liquid is soaking into your skin, it will be absorbed only by the cancerous cells.  Then, when exposed to the light, the (cancerous only) cells containing the liquid will explode!  And only the cancerous cells.  This limits the damage to the non-cancerous cells around it and they don't need to take away a large margin of healthy, non-cancerous tissue, like with excision.  The skin will blister and be quite sore.  My Dad has large areas covered, sometimes and likens it to really bad sunburn, but no huge scabs, no stitches, but sometimes more than one treatment will needed for the larger BCCs or malignant melanomas. But this is sometimes the case for excision, too.  It is a much quicker healing process, as well as leaving much less scarring. Hope you never need to have anything like this taken off again, but wanted to give you some info, just in case, for consideration in the future.  All the best to you both!  I always wear a hat and SPSF factor 50, especially on my face and ears and also the tops of my feet, because I like to wear sandals where I live, in sunny Cyprus.
Sending u all the love from India Goa. .. Godbless
I have had a scab/dry skin spot on my head that has been there at least 18 years. I will be making an appointment with a dermatologist asap.
Thank god you are cancer free Sir
Wishing you a fast recovery from this man...sending love and good vibes ✌️❤️💪🏽
glad you're okay !! wish you both all the happiness, health and love ❤️
the title "i have skin cancer" did you mean "i had skin cancer" much love from here my grandma also just finished cancer treatment so this video hit me kinda hard
I sincerely hope you recover and never receive it again, I wish you all the luck.  May God be with you
Been there-------done that more times than I can remember.  I was a sunbather as a teen and early years and I have been paying for that for many years now.  Note, be glad all is well and basal cell is what I get.  Mine are mostly on my legs, so those shapely, pretty legs I once had are gone.  The last one I had removed was a tiny little spot on the side of my nose and like you, I had to go back to have more removed.  I walked out of that office all alone, tears rolling down my cheeks driving home with half my face bandaged and people staring at me.  My face was cut from the corner of my eye down to my smile line and I had 49 stitches.  I looked like a monster.  Then to make things worse, my sister had two different moles on her back that I looked at and insisted she get to her dermatologist.  They were both malignant carcinoma and she has two holes that I can put my fist in.  That is how deep it was.  She is lucky to still be alive.  SUNTAN LOTION IS A MUST AND WEARING A HAT THAT SHADES YOUR FACE ALSO.  I was pleased to know your caught yours early enough.
Take care, will pray for good health
Do you guys live in A house now?
0:00 to 0:51 is very silent
Lol
God bless you, a lovely couple.
Wow, I have just had Basel cell cut out in two places on my body…my nose and back of thigh…. It affected me emotionally more than I thought….  Cancer is still cancer…that word breaks the strongest person x..
Im so proud of you man. YOU ARE DOING 👍 GREAT
Ive had that done my grade 11 year not fun. the thing i hated the most was being able to feel the stitches when i talked or moved and getting them out not fun either. glad you are okay. ❤
Thank you for sharing, I found that when I was obviously going through cancer/chemo, people would try to show love and support by telling me their personal stories and usually they were sad stories. What I wanted/ needed to hear were positive stories like this. The second your diagnosed you know the odds are not in your favor and survival stories can give you that little bit of hope. People please don't walk up to someone with any obvious issue and tell them about someone who died from their same issue, try to find a positive thing to share.
This type of clickbate is kinda disgusting
It's a pretty gross procedure - its like getting your scalp scooped out with a sharp  Mellon baller  the smell is the worse, what ever you do don't accept  "no not needed"for an answer --- get blood work done  in 3 or 4 months  CGU/ FISH/ IHC/ GEP, even if you have to pay out of pocket .
I am so happy for you both that Nate came through OK.       💚💛🧡❤️💙💜
You guys are awesome!
❤️
Probably from Chernobyl…. Wish you the best man. You guys are the best
Do make sure you get checked regularly. I have had exactly the same thing - twice. You are more likely to have it again if you have had it once. But it isn't generally life threatening, as you have obviously been told. Sometimes called a "rat bite ulcer" because that is what it looks like if left untreated for a few years.
I love your channel and what a great couple you are.  But please consider slowing it down a bit, so you have some left for when you are old.
I am relieved for you, for the best part of the last 5 months I have had 3 separate colonoscopy due to inconclusive and abnormal biopsy results. I was terrified I had cancer that had spread to my liver due to high bilirubin levels. I was very lucky to recieve my results a week ago to he told I only have chrons disease and gilberts syndrome. Which although not great the way it could of went terrified me, and to be able to hide your feelings so well on camera is remarkable. While I was waiting for my results I was having the worst anxiety attacks which I've never had. I was also lucky to have very understanding friends and family to what was going on. It is the unknown what causes the worry. So happy for you and hope you have more success in the future!
I got skin cancer before and the smell of the skin burning is bad
I love y’all so much. Nate I’m so happy you’re okay! You two can really just make someone forget about anything they are going through even if it’s only for one video!
Also there is more reef ,ocean safe sunscreen being developed and from Hawaii, as well as SPF clothes and hats for future everyday and travels. Blessings to you and all.
my dad survived cancer he removd a foot 🦿He was around 18 years old
Thank you Jesus you are cancer free Nate! I got a little worried before I started watching this video. I am porcelain white and must wear sunscreen 50+ if I’m out in the sun. Doesn’t take long for me to roast.
Thank you for sharing. I am so glad Nate is ok.
Amazing repeat of my journey. My Derm Doc said for two years (2018-2020)  that an unhealed scalp wound was a skin disorder. Finally in 2020 a biopsy confirmed basel cancer. Seven cm huge patch cut off (too big for mohs)- in OR surgery in July by a scalp specialist.. Cuts ruptured so it's still healing in Nov.  I did find out sores that do not heal with normal treatment are often cancerous! Glad  it was basel and we're both recovering.
Sorry to hear but you will be fine. Anyway, you have a beautiful house and i assumed thats the fruits of your labor from travelling. Congratulations, you both deserved it.
I'm happy you are fine 🙏  I was told that I have breast cancer in July. I go on treatments and pray that I will be cancer free soon.
I’m very happy you’re cancer free Nate. My husband had the same cancer a couple of years ago, only his grew in the middle of his forehead and looked like a horn trying to poke out but he had it removed and no signs since. Safe and happy travels Kara and Nate. ❤️
Hope you guys wear your sunscreen
I started watching you guys on Facebook about 3 days ago and absolutely fell in love with y’all. We love you Nate.
Pair of drama queens. Anything for a click! 😐
Thank God your Ok..❤❤
I just want to let y’all know I’ve been watching all your stuff non stop the past couple days and just saw this video just now and I’m so happy he’s ok, love the vibes yall give off, keep killing it!
We went through this exact thing with my 11 yr old about 3 years ago, right when he started 6th grade, it was so scary to hear the word 'cancer'. But 3 years later at 14, he is doing great, though he does have a quarter sized bald spot on the back of his scalp. Lucky for him the way his cowlicks grow, his hair covers it well.  All the best to you both and hope Nate heals quickly!! Sunscreen and hats for life!
glad he all clear i been through the same in may, in my head to unfortunately its come back so just waiting love your videos
My brother was diagnose with Hudgekins Lymphoma March last year, then the pandemic hits our country (Philippines). He file a leave of absence when he started the chemo, so we don't have any money to support the medication. But God was really Good, He touched a heart of a lot of people, friends and family that help us to buy all his meds and finish his chemo therapy . And now, we thank God, because he's Cancer Free ☺️☺️☺️☺️ by God's Grace ❤️   Thank you for sharing your story with us ❤️❤️❤️ take care always Kara and Nate ❤️ God Bless
I’m glad Nate is going to be okay and hope he feels better now or is almost better and it never comes back ever
Praying for you buddy 🙏
This is so disrespectful to those who actually have cancer!!! I have to take chemo at least once a year (sometimes twice!!) All that's required of you is staying out of the sun!!! I've had similar "basal" cells which "could have " been carcinogenic but it never metastasized!!! Neither shall yours!!! But it's highly disrespectful for you guys to use such clickbait tactics... This is grossly undermining nit only the disease, but also the people who have it... How despicable of you guys to use this to INCLUDE PAID PROMOTIONS and think about earning money through a  downright sick way!!! I really enjoyed your content but now I can see through the shallowness of your filthy ideology!!! I hope you never have to go through what all the people with cancer have to just so they could live normally for another 6 months.. it's a terrible disease and I hope no one has it!! But what you did here is just disgusting mate!!! You're horrible people!!! You're trying to fool the world but you're not fooling anybody with those fake calls (notice how there's a cut in the continuity of the video before the lady announces your test results!!!) Sooner or later your charade will be up while people like me still have to endure!!! You are horrible people... I was so shocked to hear about this but now I don't even pity you!!! You're horrible people!!!
What a relief! So glad Nate is well and that he will get screened once a year. The fact that this type of cancer does not metastize (sp?)is hugh.
I literally just read this headline in my fb stories. Made me stop. I’m so sorry you had to go through this and so relieved all is clear. StaySafe ❤️
I have this worry now, appointment has been booked
Thinking of you! Stay well!❤️🙏
I love how the love in Kara's eyes for Nate shines and how when he asked are you ok... all her reassurances to him I could feel was hard for her. I love you guys so much even though we have never met. You opened your lives and heart to so many and I pray God bless you and heal you now and into the future. if anything you are healed already and may that continue to be with you both always. Sending you lots of love, well wishes and prayers. Take care and thank you for sharing this. People don't realise everyone has challenges and all we can do is be kind and there for each other in whatever way.
Wow….my stomach flipped when I saw your post on FB.  I am so happy you are now cancer free and can get back to traveling.  So many of us live vicariously through you and Kara!!  Wishing you both continued good health and many more adventures together! ❤️
Damn that's hard
My heart stopped when I saw the Facebook update and rushed over to YouTube. I am so happy for you guys. This hits home as I have a follow up tomorrow with my GP regarding a nasty on my back xx.
There is nothing you two can’t get through together!!!
❤️
So happy to hear Nate is well! Love the quote you shared from his grandfather!
Yo Kara and Nate, get with #TeamSeas already!!!
Glad you’re ok🤗
So glad your okay❤️❤️
I am so sorry your adventures hearts had to go through this I hope the recovery is going well. Love you guys 🥰🤍😇
Ooooohh god my heart just sankkk when i saw this !! i am soo happy Nate is fine!! God bless you both!
This is WHY you've gotten where you are. You too are living a life, not just a dream - that's important to acknowledge for both you and us. Keep it real- it can only make you stronger.
You two are meant for each other. You don't have a choice. You both got to live healthy, wealthy, and very happy life together for so many more decades. Truly. You two are the meaning of "Love". Simple as that 💙💑💙
My cousin has skin cancer, and he is terminally ill, and depressed. I showed him this vid, and told him to have strength. You convinced him to fight and stay strong, and he did. Now he has recovered from the cancer and is happy and healthy all thanks to you guys. Thank you so much and God bless you.
Made the silly decision to watch this while at work and started crying like a baby I am so happy that Nate is fine I wish you the very best love you guys you are amazing 💘💘💘
So happy and grateful Nate is well!! 🙏🙏💖💖
Keep ur head up Brotha! I was having a very bad day and I came across ur vids on YouTube awhile back y’all made my day with ur energy and adventures! Coming from Guam USA where America’s day Begins
Don’t want to detract from what this is about but…. Nate, very sneaky sneaky with the foreshadowing the next episode with a shirt in one scene lol. I’m catching up on episodes I missed
I hate cancer. Seeing someone 2 months younger than me really hits home. Helps having a strong woman!
phew .... glad you are all clear buddy....best from UK
Speaking of ears, I had the top of mine cut off for a basal cell carcinoma in my 60s. It’s always shocking the first time you get a disease diagnosis. My first one was 40 years ago when I was diagnosed with Crohn’s Disease. Then Type 2 diabetes at 50. In some ways, facing your mortality early in life is a good thing…you learn not to take life for granted!  Be well, Nate. ❤️
I also had what the doctor said was an infected hair follicle in my hairline. A year later, it was still there and turned out to be a multi focal basal cell carcinoma and had to have 2 surgeries on it. I have had so many cut out and burnt off but this one was the most traumatic. Hats are so important as you don’t put sunscreen in your hair and the UV rays can get through. Glad all turned out well for you Nate. ❤️
My mom had skin cancer on her nose. She’s extremely embarrassed about the huge un natural looking spot on her nose. I know how hard it can be I’m glad to hear you’re doing great. ❤️
Glad you’re all good to go. 🤓
Glad you are doing good
You can do it don’t give up
Hi Nate, I just wanted to tell you to keep a positive attitude through this.  I had large B cell lymphoma about 2 years ago. My chemo was ruff but I kept a positive attitude always. Strangely, a strong mental positive in itself is good medicine. I am now in remission and because of watching your vlogs, am thinking of walking tha Appalation Trail to raise money for the American Cancer Foundation. I am praying for your complete healing now. It was my Wonderful God who healed me. Oh, you two keep on because you are an adventure waiting for a place to happen and your stories are a blessing not only to me but soooo many others. I am 74 years in age and you have made a big difference in my life to inspire that 2200 mile hike. God bless you in great measure my friend.
I am so glad he's okay now.
👏🙏❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
its easily cured with full extract cannabis oil. your doctors dont know and wont tell you this but many have cured it but eating it and putting it on the skin where the cancer is at. check it out you can learn to make it on your own.

I stopped watching you a while ago but I am happy to hear you were able to overcome this scary experience, wishing you health for the future.
i just discovered your channel a couple of days ago, and I really enjoy you sharing your travel experiences.  I am so glad this went well, and good on you for espousing SPF, hats etc.
Prayers for healing and comfort🙏🙏
Slather your skin in sunscreen both of you! It's wonderful Nate that you are cancer free. I applaud you! Clap clap...yay...whoohoo!!
dude!!! Nate!!!!! you're a LEGEND!!!, I'd PEE!!!! myself, then pass out, then maybe do it again, get well soon, and good to have a supportive wife like Kara, stay awesome you both and YAY!!!! I see you came to Canada!!! and my province too!!! in one of your vids, LOVE IT!!!!
Nate relax. The first time you hear the word cancer it is scary but basil and squama cell are no big deal. They have been cutting those off me for over 35 years now. I have lost count on the number that have been removed. Not to mention I have had literally thousands of cryo's . Melanomas are the ones to be nervous about. I am about to turn 60 and have 100-150 cyro's a year and 3-4 cancer spots cut out of me.. Wear sun block and enjoy life
You got this Nate we love you and send u love and thoughts, I know it is hard but u got this🥺😇🥰
I just discovered your channel! I am so enjoying your vlogs. You guys have taken me along on many adventures! Thanks! Kara just makes me laugh with her over the top enthusiasm!! It looks like you are a perfect match! Nate makes coffee!!   He’s a keeper!
I recently have gone threw the same thing.   Skin cancer diagnosis and removal.  I thank you Nate for sharing your story.  I could  completely relate and it was nice to see someone else with a relatable experience.   Glad you are ok!
REALLY Glad you received a great diagnosis and prognosis Nate!!  Our wonderful friend had something similar and wasn't as fortunate.  It's perfect you passed along your doctors preventative skin cancer tips for others!  Skin cancer is so frequent.  I think it would be a great idea if you can go over what they think caused - just sheer sun exposure to no hats? To drill this seriousness home to others...  LASTLY, I think you need to unpack Grandpa's great quotes one video at a time!  That one was so deep!
so glad you're ok🥺🤍
So glad you are cancer free!   I can not imagine how hard it has been for you both, dealing with this for the past few months.
Thanks for sharing and I’m glad it turned out well.
Kate I know that feeling you had for nate when it came to Nate's health cuse I lost my mom and grandpa on my dads side and my Grammy on my moms side to cancer . It made me cry when I seen your reaction to Nate's BIG C STUFF  thank god he is ok !! Luv you guys keep making the content that you have been making luv the helloutta both you guys !!
❤❤
Glad you got the all clear. Thanks for being vulnerable and sharing your story so others know they’re not alone 🙏🏼 Found you through Eamon & Bec and have enjoyed checking out your videos.
They actually have a house? Other than that I’m so happy that you are feeling good gl
Cannabis slowed mine from popping up so frequently. Went from having at least 3 bcc's a year to maybe one every 2-3 years. Something to look into.
Best of wishes to you Nate and same to Kara for being so supportive
Just don’t put yourself in those positions to get cancer. It’s pretty simple.
sending love ❤️
As someone who's been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a leak in my cerebral spinal fluid, and binary pulmonary embolism all within the last 18 months, I certainly understand the comments from Nates' grandfather about good health being a crown only the sick can see. You really really just don't understand how huge of a blessing is that we all take for granted until it's gone.
Cannot believe I am crying 😢
Be well Both of you and thanks for Nate’s Granpas kind and inspiring words😘😘💕😩
My dad actually just got his taken out and got Stitches about 2 weeks ago and it was scary so proud of you Nate I promise you’ll be okay his was by his ear so he also said he felt like he had a facelift
After 15 skin cancers most on the skull we did radiation which slowed down the cancers but was not a cure all. I’m waiting now to have the skull bone partially removed and a piece of my thigh placed on my head. Any minor skin area that does not completely heal in a few weeks with the scab falling off and nice pink skin remaining please see a dermatologist. A continuous long term scab is more then likely shin cancer. And more then likely very curable!!! Do not wait if you can’t get an appointment with a Dermatologist right away call another dermatologist don’t wait.
Of course I hope you will be lucky to overcome this but I people who died within 1,5 years after they were diagnosed with skin cancer...
I am so glad you are going to be ok. I have a cancer scare too. Found within the last month. Thank you for the link. X
I had Mohs surgery earlier this year for basal cell too! it was on my forehead though so I've got a scar on my face! little harder to cover up. They ALSO told me I won the award for youngest patient of the day. haha. It must be one of those things they say. Happy it's over with!!
6:59 damn.
💪💪💪
💪💪💪
So happy for you Nate, most importantly on the last results outcome. I wish y'all excellent future health. Y'all got a lot of adventure ahead and the world has a lot to offer. #godisgreat #godisgood #speedyrecovery #health #couple #karraandnate
I'm so happy to hear that you're OK and I the clear. I became so worried when I saw the bandage in your Eamon & Becks Van Swap video, then even more again when I saw this title. 🙏🏽 for your speedy recovery
Thanks for sharing! My dad has a bunch of these removed.
last year i had a pimple under my eye that didn't go away. an old Thai doctor looked at it and said - looks like a basal tumor - no problem. i looked for a beauty surgeon, made an appointment and 2 weeks later she removed this tumor under local anesthesia. a week later i received the expected laboratory result - benign basal cell tumor. no scar on the face and every morning i wear a light sunscreen. I paid $ 250 for everything. these biopsies are pure moneymaking. the tumor has to be operated on, then off to the laboratory and that's it.
To say my heart dropped and stomach turned is an understatement. I wanna take a moment to really say that Kara and Nate you’ve both been such a huge part of my life the past three years that I can’t express in words. You’ve been light in my dark days, put smile on my face when in a period of daily crying and became the friends I needed without even knowing so. And I believe there are many out there that you’ve done the same for and from all of us I say thank you so much. You’re videos have been warm hugs for me and many others these past years. Hope to meet you at least once this lifetime and wishing you the best health. You’ll always be in my prayers ❤️
WOW WOW WOW! Your love for each other and outlook on life when times get tough is truly inspiring!
Nate and Kara, We are here in Canada and are sending you both big prayers from treaty 6 territory (Saskatchewan). PS. Love the quote. <3 <3
Watching how this is shot is so funny haha  Idk if I want to talk about this hahah😂😂🤣
So glad all is ok now! <3
Sending lots of hugs and love your way
❤️
watched you on Eamon & Bec...now subscribed on your lovely channel😊 So happy for you that you are cancer free. I can relate to your worry and wish you the very best. I had a melanoma over 3 years ago... I worry about being in the sun and have tried several non toxic sun creams, but sadly they don't seem to give the required protection... is there a sun cream you reccomended? ☀️ the sun is beautiful & I don't want to live in fear of it..... Thank😍You for sharing your story
Click bait titled me man
Glad you are fine.
Nate’s grandfathers quote just about made me cry. Also so happy for you Nate - benign or not both of your fears and anxiety through it all is valid just glad you got through it❤️❤️
I am glad that you are cancer free Nate.
f
Prayers for you and your family
thank you guys for sharing this! i wish you lots of health and love! 🤍🤍
My mom has had Basil cancer in a few spots on her face, but after having them removed they haven’t been a problem since.
🎊🎊🎊🪅🪅🪅🎉🎉🎉🎈🎈🎈🎈🎏🎏🎏🎏
I’m sorry I had heard about this I am just now finding you video I know what you are feeling I’ve not had any skin issues but I’ve had breast issues… but I am so happy all was ok you have to know you were in everyone’s thoughts and prayers god speed ❤️❤️❤️🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🚐🚐🚐
❤️
Haven’t watched the vlog for awhile, my apologies because it’s not a vlog to miss! But I am beyond great full that you’re okay! I couldn’t go on without my favorite YouTube couple! Life just wouldn’t be the same for any of us, and of course it’s always the most undeserving, whole hearted, never harm a soul people! This will pass and all will be well! Much love guys!
Skin cancer is no joke. I wish you well.
I wondered about that bandage on the back of Nate's head in one of the previous videos. Glad everything is ok!
Solar panels !!!
Yea walk off the skin cancer
I have having a spot get checked out in almost the exact same spot. Noticed a couple bumps that are not going away. Hopefully it is nothing serious. Glad you are ok Nate! We are too young to be worrying about this stuff.
Glad to hear your cancer free Nate. Big fan of you both. Stay Safe.
Take care you guys
Take care you guys
I'm a retired school bus driver. I wore the most spf they had 35 the 50. and I got skin cancer 2 places above my right eye brow, and one on my drivers arm that took across the whole arm. I have a very big scar from that. Can you image how much skin cancer I would of got if I hadn't work sun screen!!!!!!??????   I'm retired now sense 2012 and I still wear sun screen now.they have 100 % I wish they had it then. WEar it when its cloudy!!!! also
Big hugs to you two! I'm so glad they got it all and you are cancer free.  As a breast cancer survivor, early detection is vital. Get regular check ups, please! I was one of the lucky ones, I had a double mastectomy, but I didn't need chemo or radiation. My mother never went to the doctor. She died if ovarian cancer, a little over a year from diagnosis. The Dr said her tumors had probably been growing at least 10 years. Had she had regular check ups, it might have been caught earlier.  Take care of each other. You two are so cute. I love watching your adventures. Safe travels.
Wow... You guys are so amazing... so weird as right before this happened to you I find it so crazy my hubby sadly had to be rushed into ER for a high blood pressure of 240 over 112.   I am like you guys in praising God that he did not die or have a stroke that night as he was supposed to just get his inhaler for asthma, but when they took his vitals and he rang me to tell me to pick him up from the doc immediately, I found myself running from our everyday relaxing evening at home to the ER with him instead...   I find it a miracle he didn't even feel unwell and was wondering why everyone was rushing around him like crazy.  Thankfully they were able to bring it down with meds and not have to have surgery -  he is trying very hard to have a healthier life style all the time, which is why we found this so confusing with all the excersise he was doing - but they said to watch hypertension as that is why they call it "the silent killer".  Please get yourselves a BP machine as well even while travelling as no one knows when these things can creep up on them - even when you thought you were being healthy.  So sorry you had to go through this, but I am so glad to see Nate is okay and I love that quote your grandpa says ❤ That is diamond!  I hope and pray this cancer stays away guys - please stay safe! 🙏💖🤗 love ya both! ❤
Even though it’s reality
That’s such a clicbate caption
Nate, kudos to you for pointing out how YT and social media are curated highlights of what others want to share. It's too easy to get depressed comparing the totality of our own lives to the wonderful adventures we see others having online. Be well, and wear hats. :-) Welcome to the survivors' club.
I can't imagine getting up to set up cameras. Only to get back into bed and pretend to get up again. Either I'm in bed or I'm not. Lol
Thank God for the good news.
And I really appreciate that you promote therapy... It's awesome and many many people has to reach there, but they don't know about these opportunities! Keep promoting them!!!
Thank God Nate!!! I was scared also at the start of this video but life is this also... We should treasure every moment, every person that we have aside. I am really happy for you that you are cancer free... Please stay healthy and Kara the same. I want to see your videos till I am old and wrinkled, to laugh about the fact that you can't go around anymore, but not bcz of old age, but bcz you have too many grandchildren
I am so sorry but so happy that you are safe guys❤️❤️❤️
My Mom Had Breast cancer she had chemo and radiation i think it was stage 3 she stayed strong and got out of it so that's good.p.s. i love your guys videos and get well soon Nate
Thats so awesome that you are now cancer free. Im praying for an amazing recovery for your wound, Nate. Im also praying that this cancer will NEVER return to your body! Have a blessed trip and a blessed mood. ❤❤
Nice !!!!!!!
That “good health” quote just made me explode with tears. Like I instantly went from perfectly dry eyed to full-on crying. Wow. What a poignant statement. Go Nate’s grandpa.
I remember my first one. I say that as I essentially get something cut off mostly every year. Now that it is done, please make sure you go to get annual check-ups.
It’s such a hard story to tell, but you did it beautiful!!! All the best for the recovery and stay strong mate!!!♥️
I was in tears watching this video I’ve lost so many good people because of cancer including my mother thank god for the outcome good luck to you both
So happy that you are doing good Nate!  You both make an awesome couple and I love how supportive you are to one another.  PS... Kara you are a terrible liar lol.  You could definitely see in your face that you were worried.  ;)  <3
Nate, you are one lucky human being dude. Not only for the great news about your diagnosis and post surgical prognosis,  but because of the woman sitting next to you in life.  I'm a 55 year old disabled person who has never in my entire life,  been loved the way Kara obvious loves you and if I'm honest,  I've never met a woman who I felt THAT way about and in my condition,  I never will. In fact, its so horrible to be on the "other" side of the love coin that I've begun the process of going to Zurich in May of 2022 to do a doctor assisted end of life.  I just wanted to let you guys know that while its also very painful to watch (pure green monster jealously), its also a great part of my day to watch your guys' videos that are so full of pure love for one and the other. Just smashingly beautiful to witness. Without really trying,  you two spread so much positivity and love amongst the world and my admiration for you both can't be described verbally.  Thank you for doing what you do. Sharing such an amazingly blessed life with the world, especially THIS world, is pure medicine for the soul.  🙏🖖💜
Guys made me cry you guys take care
First bec from Eamon and Bec but in the end she didn't have cancer NOW YOU
I finally find your YouTube channel (after following you on FB for a year) and this is the first video I see. Glad that everything is OK for you Nate! This brings me back to a number of years ago when I had a suspicious spot on my head removed that hadn't been healing either. Came back benign thankfully, but the dermatologist that treated me didn't even stitch it up or wrap my head.. . so yours must have been a lot larger. Hope you're healing well.
I’m so happy for you both. 😀
This makes me glad that I don't even go outside anymore.  I have a night shift job, so I sleep most of the day anyway.  With Covid everywhere, my outside time was cut down even more.  Most skin cancers are caused and/or accelerated by exposure to the Sun.  Now that I've seen this I will definitely not be spending time outdoors.  The same thing happened to my grandmother, but her cancer was on her face.  Thank you for posting this story so that everyone can see even famous people, who are very health-conscious, can suffer from overexposure to the Sun and outdoors.  If I have not choice but to be outside I want to be covered from head to tow AND wear sunblock.
I hope for the best
I'm graduating 8th and I have been going to therapy since I was in 3rd grade
Awww Nate sending strength and courage to you. Your a great man
You disgust me! how dare you make this "problem" a clickbait for your chanel!!                                                                                                            You are not the superstar you think you are,  you are a bad actor and a poor example of suffering.......shame on you!
Happy to hear all went well! Feel better ! I had MOHS procedure done in 2020 on my nose! Took 3 scrapes to get all the cancer out. Felt like Jimmy Durante for a few days with my nose bandaged, the healing process took a few weeks but all is well now.
idc
It's so amazing how you two coparate when one of you is having a hard time I love watching your videos <3
As a doctor in Australia where we see a HUGE amount of skin cancer including Melanoma , thanks for sharing to your very popular channel - be really aware of your skin protection and SPF every day !!
I feel like you to are almost family and you did amazing getting your head cut off.   Yes always wear sunscreen and for sure spray your head with sunscreen and or wear and DO NOT FORGET LIPS AND EARS!
I'm so sorry Nate
Praise God they got it all!
I guessed after your last video and was so happy to hear it was basal cell and not melanoma. Wear a hat. Wear sunscreen.Thank God  for every day. And stop scaring Kara.
Basal cell, my doctor says, "if you are going to have cancer it is the best kind to have."  I have had it a few times.  I'm still alive, well, and kicking.  You are all good.  Bless you.  For the future:  see your dermatologist at least once a year.  Get in right away anytime you suspect anything.  Earlier found, it is MUCH less invasive to remove it.
You guys are beautiful couple and I’m so sorry your dealing with this but at least it was a best case scenario as far as cancer goes.
Hey nate I don't usually comment on yt videos cause I don't have much to say but I recently lost a family member to cancer I'm glad your gonna be on good health and I hope ya head recovery goes well safe travels to Canada 🙏💝💝
Nate thanks for sharing this journey.  I too have gone through the journey with cancer.  No matter the type and diagnosis it is a life changing event that can be worrisome.  And the diagnosis phase certainly not a fun process and can sometimes be frustrating.  My continued prayers for you, Kara and the family.  Looks like you have a wonderful support group around you.
Sending y'all all the love. My partner and I just sold our house preparing to travel full time and I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer a week later. Almost three months later, I'm out of treatment and so ready to be traveling again. Glad you got treatment and are recovered!
Absolutely don’t forget the ears! My husband had to have a second Mohs surgery on his ear (first was on his nose) three weeks ago. His surgery was a bit longer as the first cut didn’t get it all. The doctor said it grows like an iceberg, it’s small on the skin and spreads through the cartilage. He lost a chunk behind his ear the size of a quarter. It’s healing great, even though it has been a pain to take care of daily. I’m so glad to hear that Nate is doing well after his surgery. The best to you both!
i love  you guys stay blessed !!!!!!!
Good job and thank God, guys! But lets not forget spf/hat/ protect ears!! Take care  NandK !! 🙂
We really enjoyed watching you.  You are full of life.  Hope you feel better.  John From NC. Originally from Ankara Turkey
Hello! New subscriber here❤️❤️❤️Keep safe always & God bless you always ❤️
God bless you....stay healthy and enjoy:)   honestly, I think third person - therapy is not needed at all... all of us can spend at least 5 minutes a day and chant or meditate  calmly (may be walk in the yard  and enjoy the breeze...close your eyes in the shower and feel that water running(without wasting much water though)...write 5 good thoughts...draw something simple...arrange one drawer or cabinet and take a picture of it, chant God's name , etc  ) and think about our position in this great universe-how we are a part of this great cosmos , the chance we have been given to better ourselves each day...each day above the ground, is a day to redeem ourselves from our mistakes and to cherish the good in and around us....  each moment is a moment to share the kindness, each time we get angry and we want to rant or yell, take a step back and attempt to be calm, it is therapy in itself... when we honk at others, show rage, etc  our health and mental state gets affected....we need to make sure that we are calm and composed and learn to handle things in a better way, so all of our lives can be better each day... God bless all...keep calm and carry on :)   praying for all to be healthy, kind and compassionate no matter what, for we are worth it... other peoples' actions must not determine our quality...we are created good, let us make our day better and lead the best life possible inspite of hardships along the way:)
This brought back all the memories of my day in the dermatologist's chair several years ago.  I too had a basal cell spot removed with Moh's surgery.  It was originally the size of an eraser on the end of a pencil and the hole left afterwards was larger than a quarter.  We left one week later for a trip in Spain and Portugal.    Scary but I'm glad I had it taken care of.    Glad that you are okay.   Yes, sunscreen, sunscreen and don't forget your ears everyone.
Thanks god. Nate is fine
So happy that you are ok Nate, and Kara, you are a super trooper being brave and calm throughout all of this. Take care guys!
I am so glad you shared. I'm proud of you both. You handled that amazingly. My 86 year old father was diagnosed with skin cancer in January this year (2021). My mother has breast cancer, her father had cancer of the Esophagus. My dad and mom are doing better. I see so many folks sunburnt and I'm so scared to death for people. We all take for granted our health when we are young then suffer so much as we age. I'm glad the doctor encouraged you to tell folks to wear sunscreen. I was going to say that here. But also stay out the sun for the most dangerous hours when the sun is the highest. Here in Texas that's (well hell we're an inferno) but between 10 - 3. Thank you for sharing the most intimate parts of your lives. You bring me happiness. I was super angry I was at Buccees the day before you and live in Austin. Was sad I missed you.  I get over excited watching y'alls videos. My son says mom it's not that exciting their not your friends. lol you are and I love you both. 💕 Take care
We love you guys!! thanks for giving us something to look forward to watching!. Grateful it all turn out the way it did ! God bless you and keep you!
He kind of looks like Cristiano Ronaldo without the hat
❤️
Thank you for sharing this journey with us! I have had a scab on the back of my neck for quite some time now and I didn’t think twice about it. Just messaged my doctor to have it checked out! Thank you 🙏🏼
I had the same type of cancer a couple of years ago from a mole that was never healing. It’s terrifying to hear those words and glad you are doing well and cancer free.
This sponsor showed up at the perfect moment for me. Nate I am super glad that you shared with us about your diagnosis and I am relieved that it does not seem to be very serious. Hope healing is speedy and that you don't have any issues in the foreseeable future.
❤️❤️❤️
I love you.  . I know you are gonna be fine soon ,💓
So sorry you had to go through this. But love you guys.
K n N I've been following since day 1. So happy for you both that the results were positive. Of course we, your followers, don't see everything you experience. You are human after all with everyday ups and downs. Thank you for allowing us to join you on your journey(s). Safe travels💖🌈💖🌈💖🌈
So great to see that you guys donated the proceeds of this sponsored video with 1.2 MILLION views and counting to cancer research. Thank you so much!!!   Edit: My apologies. Apparently you didn’t donate to any cancer related charity.
Congratulation. Happy for you both.
Prayers to continued health!!
Basal Cell carcinoma is the least of the skin cancers, so he will be fine. Wear your sun screen and a sun protective hat. Also wear your sun screen even in winter, people forget that the sun can damage your skin no matter the outside temperature or cloud cover. Do not forget the back of your hands if you drive a lot as the windscreen has no tint. So happy for you Nate.
Thank you Jesus for Your protection!! Thanking the Heavenly Father for His mercy, grace, and that you both are well.
I know how it feels to have skin cancer. I have it. Whenever I go out sunblock.
I’m 13 and I got diagnose with leukaemia when I was 11 and when that did happen I past out on my stairs in to my dads arms
Hmm maybe I should get the scab on my scalp checked out. It seems to never heal.
U guys are family and it's gr8 you guys are coping up !
Honestly… who on God’s good earth gave this … 1.5k thumbs down ?? Really !🤔😤😤😭 Thank you for sharing Kate & Nate . Keep well both of you 🥰😁😄😃
This is why we wear hats in Australia
How s it possible that there are 1.2 K thumbs down? how screwed up can you be to give thumbs down. These are definitely disturbed individuals....period.
Glad Nate is doing better.
I’ve been watching you both for a year now and I find your travels very entertaining . You are both positive and love to see you go to these great parts of the world. However this was you best video. I realized that it’s not the places that you go that I love but actually both of you. Happy to hear that you are cancer free. Thank you for sharing your story.
Thank you so much for sharing this very human video! You two rock! Stay safe out there and keep us posted! Congratulations on the final outcomes! Thanks for the great reminder about SUNSCREEN always all seasons everywhere! Cheers!
lmao
Whew! Glad he's ok! Remember you need to buy new sunscreen every twelve months so there's no reason to be stingy with it :)
I started watching your channel some years ago as a result of a cancer scare & I needed a distraction whilst waiting for my appointment & results. Your videos were the answer & helped me so much at the time but I totally immersed myself in your beautiful videos. I have loved you ever since & I wish you both every success in your future  you are a lovely couple to watch & clearly have so much love between you which is so nice to see these days. Take care & thank you for you for the joy & love that you share with us it is so much appreciated.
My all wishes are with you guys. Lots of love and a healthy life. Keep traveling and inspiring. Love you guys.😀😀
Yes I agree With Kara and Nate we all go through ups and downs in life thank you 🙏 for sharing this
So happy to hear everything turned out ok 👍 Everyone wear your sunscreen year round even if it’s cloudy!
oh my god my jaw dropped when I saw the title, I hope everything goes well.
I want to share the medical medium books, especially Life Changing Foods book by Anthony William, or Cleanse to Heal by Anthony William (but really he's not the author but the messenger). There God has revealed to me some of the amazing foods that we can incorporate into our lives to protect us from illness as well as help heal many conditions. If you look in the index you can find what pages relate to cancer fighting/protective foods. Hope you check it out! These books have been a real blessing in my life, and I hope they will be for you too <3 (The info in there comes from above... which is the best part!)
My mom had similar skin cancer and I went through all these emotions at Kara went through. It’s so nice to see more into your guys lives
Thank you so much for sharing! As part of a MOHS surgery team the power of knowledge is half the battle.
This was a really beautifully done video on a sensitive topic. I am glad Nate is well and thank you for continuing to share so many aspects of your lives with the world. I wish you both continued health and wellness, and a speedy recovery for Nate!
God is good
I also had one, but mine was on my face. It was removed about 4 weeks ago, and I now have a 2 1/2" scar running from my eye down to almost my lip.  Not a pretty site for a woman, but hey I am 62 and not really searching for a date anyway.  LOL.     I am glad you are ok and glad you got it taken care of
Sending hugs to you Kara and Nate. Keep safe always!
Sending you love and strength from England
WISH YOU THE VERY BEST HEALTH
Soooo happy that Nate’s okay, this video definitely made my heart sink and I cried when you got the results! Something I’m always looking out for with my hubby as well living in the harsh Hawai’i sun
Glad everything turned out okay! Praying for you guys
So good that it was fairly simple for you all.  Mohs does hurt.  I had to go back 3 x's...   It's so good to hear the raw truth... sending healing hugs.
So sorry to hear that you guys went through this and it does seem surreal hearing it. I am glad it was of the lesser severity and Nate is ok. Things like that just sometimes present itself so we always re-evaluate the meaning of life. Kara you are wonderful cheerleader!
Thank goodness that Nate is okay. I am sending prayer’s for you and him.❤️🙏🏻
My mom had the same thing and just beat it! Hope all goes well for you guys!
Geez, and some people saying that stress doesn't make you look older. Kara from 18yo girl after hearing about skin cancer turned into 19yo. Glad that everything is okay.With love from Kharkiv, Ukraine. You're awesome, guys
Both of you are the couples that I admire from a  long time,  seeing you with each other made me learn about being the good partner. Love and Lot of  Prayers for Nate and You from India. Please keep inspiring us .
I am glad you are ok,I agree about wearing a hat outside,it’s one of the first things I do when going outside even if it’s not sunny,I even wear a bandanna under my bike helmet,learnt the hard way ,got severe sunburn on head after cycling all day!!!!!
😍 so cool guys!
God bless
Nate - so thrilled you are ok and that it was discovered in time.  So sorry you had to go through this.  My family has been impacted with skin cancer with 3 different family members.  Two had Mohs surgery, the third had skin cancer behind his ear and skin had to be grafted from his cushy backside to cover about two inches of skin removed.  Behind the ears, top of head, and face have be slathered in SPF.  Prevention is life saving.  Thanks for sharing that this happens to young people.
Well I just cried for about 8 mins straight, glad your ok Nate, xx sending hugs to Kara. Xx
Happy to hear you’re feeling much better Nate
Thanks for sharing. Kara is a great support!❤
❤❤❤❤
Get well soon... good to know he is fine now
Sending our love all the way from the UK! ❤❤
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏❤️
The title and thumbnail scared the beejeebus out of me brother Nate, God Bless, so glad You are ok bud.
We are with you!...You're going to fine As always..love from Kurdistan ❤
Glad to hear that you are doing something proactive about this. I had a BCC (basal cell carcinoma) on my upper lip, some 30 years ago. A Surgeon excised it and all was good. It was interesting, as I was on anticoagulants at the time, rather messy. You should be OK Nate.
So glad things worked out; and glad you shared your story.  This ‘little thing’ can lead to bad things if ignored.  Hope all the followers listen and learn to take care of themselves if they may be ignoring ‘little skin’ conditions that might be more serious!  Aka you may have just saved a life!  Praying for you both that this stays resolved!   Having a sun freckle on my cheek; I had to have a biopsy and I definitely know the pain.  Thankfully mine is just a freckle but will be monitored going forward.
Been there, done that and  know exactly how you feel 👍
Been there, man. No fun. Glad you’re good.
You guys are so awesome.
Thank you Kara and Nate for posting this!!! I saw your video this past monday and Nate perfectly described a spot I had on my face. By yesterday I was in the derm office having it looked at. They ended up freezing it and another spot they were concerned about. I go back in 2 weeks for a follow up and full body check.   If I had waited longer it would have turned to cancer and if it werent for you both, I would have never went. I can’t thank you both for sharing this and raising awareness for skin cancer. I was a lifeguard for 10 years and sun junky. If I could have done it over again I would have been more strict with putting sunscreen on.
Kara, you had me crying at 4:00 mins.. I know you all are down to earth and good people. But being positive through this as much as possible will help someone out. Thank you Kara & Nate ❤️❤️
Thank you for sharing ❤️
Love your channel! Please research how toxic sunscreen is and do not recommend others smear toxic stuff on their largest organ. That doctor is trained by pharmaceutical funded medical schools who do not know anything about real health.
Thank you for sharing. Cancer is horrible no matter what. Love that you are both strong humans and support each other. Btw…..I’m such a “Kara” and cried the whole time 😢
Nate, how do you know what a tight pony tail feels like??? 😂So happy to hear you're all good and thanks for sharing your story. Blesses your way :)
crazy that you can go in and get skin cancer removed as casually as an annual check up. mind blown.
We love Nate!
I am so glad it was Basal Cell, and they were able to get it all with the 1 surgery! I am sure you and Kara will find some enjoyment in doing the body checks for suspicious moles. :) May is Skin Cancer Awareness month, our ribbon is Tan.
Ahh Kara you’re the sweetest wife🥺☺️love how strong you stayed for Nate. And for Nate, you’re a warrior! Love watching you guys.
Handled this like a champ Nate.  Sending you a ton of hugs, well wishes and many years of continued adventures.  Hugs to Kara too, we know support isn't easy XO
My 96 year old dad just went thru this. You did fine. LOL!
I'm so glad he was cancer free ! I have a friend that has gone through this as well more than once. They may want you back in a yr to check on you. Please be safe, we never do what we're supposed to , we should alway use sun screen. But times we forget. As a contractor i always wear a hat but forget about my ears ... Thank you so much.
1.1 Mil Views - Nate you broke the internet.  You are so loved. Kara, too.  We are glad this scary time is behind you.  We're all supporting you .. and that's A LOT of support.
Nate:  You are even more of a trend setter than you know:  Rachel Maddow followed your lead a couple of days later!    😀          https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn_VVYv68ug
Hi guys. That quote from Nate's grandfather... would you add it to the video description or add it as a comment.  Want to reread that and think about it!!!
So so happy you're cancer-free and healthy Nate! God bless you!
Lies.
Pog
We love you Nate!! Glad you are okay!
So glad for the results and even happier you were your own advocate to push forward. Please monitor yourself over the coming years. It's important to question then pass it off. Our family has experienced this road. Appreciate you sharing, you may have gotten someone else to question and helped them.
I was very sad to hear about this! Do you think there is a chance that the radiation you received in Chernobyl affected your skin cancer? Your head was the only part of your body (other than your hands) that was exposed, and where did you find cancer?! your head.
Watching this video is a heart wrenching for me when our doctor called telling my husband that he has Glioblastoma multiforme grade 4,  an aggressive type of brain cancer and a year after my husband's death anniversary, I was diagnosed with breast cancer.  I can feel how you guys are feeling, I have been there but with my strong faith in God, I am living one day at a time.  take care and God bless you both.
Oh my gosh I can not believe Nate had skin cancer I hope that Nate and Kara are ok and good
You are lucky to only have one go with your Moh's, I recently had 2 rounds on my cheek. Like you, it was a happy ending. This was my 3rd time, I go to the dermatologist every 3 months. Paying for the sins of my youth, and too much beach time in Australia, Saudi, and Thailand. C'est la vie as an expat.
Is that true?
relieved hes cancer free now
I am glad everything turned out for the best. I know Bec, Emmons better half, went through through a similar experience. I know you guys are going to see them.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Wish you good health bro
This prooves that social media is a fake place, people only put out the best of theirs life out there
God bless you 🙏🏼❤️❤️❤️
I'm happy and felt relieve that Nate is okay now. The skin cancer is not malignant and it has  been removed. I cried watching this video, tears of happiness for Nate, and tears of worrying and scared of the hard lump that I have on my head, frontal area specifically. I just notice this when I had my first child. I really can't remember when I got this lump. I can't remember if I had this when I was a kid. I asked my 70 year old mom, she can't even remember if she saw this before on me. Until now, I am still scared to go to the doctor and ask about this lump. I got scared to undergo surgery, I got scared thinking that they will gonna open my head. I am a nurse way back in our country. Right now I am a full time mom of three. I know that I am must got and  see a doctor about this lump that I have, but thinking what will happen to me? I have three kids. I am scared. If something happen to me, what will happen to my kids without me?  Seeing this video helps me a little bit of optimism that like Nate, I am gonna be okay. My lump is not growing, It stays the same size since I notice this way back 2012 and it is hard to touch. it is like my skull bulge or something. I do hope and pray that someday, it will remove and everything is gonna be okay.
Foodies!!! DIET is a key weapon in the fight against cancer. Maybe you could somehow integrate that into your food reviews Kara and Nate?!!   I know you love all foods but to fight cancer we have to eat organic and plant-based!! Sounds boring at first but it can be really interesting from a food perspective too!!   Avoid external intoxicants and make sure internal intake is healthy!!
Can't believe I haven't found you two lovely peeps yet! I found Eamon and Bec last year, then Kinging it recently with Eamon and Bec and now you guys!!! I feel like the trifecta of awesome Van Lifers is complete. Glad to see you're on the mend Nate! Amazing video guys! Kara and I are like two peas in a pod. Crazy and always laughing and smiling! And being strong for the team. Sending love to you both.
Thanks for sharing such personal info & happy all good. And well done talking about social media and what is seen/shared. Great msg you guys should take on the road to teach young kids!
So glad it all turned out well!
This gave me Netlfix documentary kinda vibes
Glad you got it taken care of Nate.  I've had basal and squamous cell carcinomas removed.  Nothing to it.
We love you Nate ! Wishing you well ❤️ stay strong
Hey there I'm a doc from India.  I would have anyday took BCC over all other ones.  Just do review yearly
Just caught up on the news. Go smash it Nate 💪
I love you two! So glad you're doing better!
Oh my god  I feel so sorry for you kide
You're lucky first try, and I'm so happy for you both.   Mine took 4 sessions, 4 hours stuck in the office. For a pencil lead size spot it turned into a silver dollar size deep area on my forehead. As with you cancer free
Glory be to God that he put a wonderful and knowledgeable woman in your life to get you onto the doctor. I am happy you’re doing much better and that y’all are in high spirits. Thank you for sharing and remember to thank God for every breath you take.
glad to hear your better and recovering, i had cancer twice and beat it thankfully. generally us guys hate going to the drs but eary detection is key to getting it beat. Enjoy watching the unusual and great places you and Kara stay at. keep up loading content and above all stay safe and well, both of you.
First of all - I'm so glad that Nate is OK. Second of all - I am still watching your videos in chronological order from start to finish, and have just hit Antarctica (Feb 20) and have tried to be strict with myself, i.e. not watch any of your new videos until I catch up to real life in order but this is the first video, that with that title, that I just had to watch, to see that you were OK.
I’ll keep you in my prayers,
I know some people can see this as totally unrelated to the video.... but wear Sunscreen everyone!
God is so good, God answers prayer.
So happy that Nate is fine and recovering.   I know it can be scary since I am one of those people that is missing the top cartledge of my ear!   As your doctor says...carry your sunscreen everywhere.   Excited to watch your next adventures!!
I have Basal skin cancer at the back hoping to remove it next by next year
May you two live healthy and prosperous life… lots of love form Pakistan 🇵🇰❤️
No! Please don't say that :'( The caption made me cry!
As we say in Norwegian, god bedring. I hope it heals well and that you remain cancer free for the rest of your life.
Your life is just too perfect and blessed that it is balanced with this cancer , but God blessed you again , this video is for me to know that the current bad part of my life should be balanced with a good part soon hopefully .

GOT THE SCARE OUT OF MY LIFE...... glad nate is cancer free <3
I’m so relieved that you’re okay! Which also makes me realize that things could’ve went south & that life is so unpredictable. Do you have a personal relationship with Christ? How’s your walk with the Lord? Jesus saves when we turn our hearts to him ❤️❤️❤️ Much love.
I am so happy Nate is all good! Blessings Kara and Nate. Stay strong and keep posting more fun videos!, I will continue watching you!
As an Australian it's great to see you shining a light on Sun Cancer ( pun not intended ) ☀️💪
Jesus loves you
I hope you are okay!
I had the same thing 20 years ago on the back of my head, I thought it was a mole and when I would get my hair cut I would tell the hair dresser to watch it and I thought that they would hit it and the mole kept coming off. wrong it was a scab/sore and went in and it was a basil carcinoma just like what you have. It healed pretty quickly after they took it off, I still have an indention on my scalp from the surgery lol
Bless you guys so happy for you guys thanks God you are all clear stay blessed and healthy 🙏🏼🙏🏼
Sending positive vibes towards a full and speedy recovery Nate.  Kara you're a trooper. Love you both. 🙏
Love the ending of what the doc wanted to say!
take baking soda and dont eat fast food
Omg wow I am so so happy everything’s okay I’m smiling from ear to ear right now as you got that news! Also omg Nates grandpa’s quote!!! I’ve written in down that is so so amazing. Did he come up with that himself or hear it somewhere? Wow just love it
I'm sure it's hard, but thanks for sharing. At least it was easily treatable, happy you're both safe and healthy :)
Glad to hear Nate is better 🙋🏼‍♀️
Glad that things turned out well, Nate.  With your Celtic complexion (just like mine and all the other folks with British and Irish ancestors), you should listen to your docs and protect your skin from the sun. 🤕🌞 Keep up with regular skin surveillance checks for any new lesions too.
Glad to know that you got that problem taken cared of. Stay healthy you both!
I am so happy to hear your ok nate just a misleading title
I'd be smashing some Chick-fil-A whilst waiting for news like that as well. Good news Nate
alright, I'm going to a dermatologist. thx for posting
My dad had skin cancer melanoma and I was so scared because it was the more serious Version I hope you are doing better
I have liked and respected you both a lot before this video. But this left a bad taste in my mouth, with the point where the commercial came in.  If you couldn’t tell this story without being influencers, maybe you should have kept it private. Tasteless. But I do wish you both the best
It sucks that cancer is so prevalent in this day and age.
Glad you are ok Nate...
Thank you for sharing your story. Prayers to you for quick healing and health in the future.
I watched the video of your visit to Chernobyl just before this. I’m never going to visit Ukrainian ever, hard pass for me.
That saying by Nate’s grandfather about “Health is a crown that the heathy wear but only the sick can see” was a saying by Imam Shafi’i who was an Arab Muslim theologian, writer, and scholar, who was the first contributor of the principles of Islamic jurisprudence (Uṣūl al-fiqh who Often referred to as 'Shaykh al-Islām', al-Shāfi‘ī was one of the four great Sunni Imams.
Glad you are ok! I can tell you from experience it’s a great feeling once it’s removed and you have clear margins! Fellow basal cell cancer survivor here. Mine was on the side of my forehead.
Clickbait BS. I’ve been a subscriber since the beginning and now you’re videos are mostly overlong clickbait vids. Tons of putting down the camera and speaking to the audience like an episode of blue’s clues.
Great News to hear Nate glad your OK!
After watching your gas leak video i'm suprised you didn't try curing your cancer by repeatedly banging your head against a wall.
I have…. Clickbait….
Good to hear all's well...take it as a warning and be smart about it. Wear a hat. Sunscreen even in the winter. Welcome to Red-Head-Life! :D
Feel that buddy! Had it on my shoulder and then flew to England for a weekend with a backpack! #feelthepain
This hits home. I also had skin cancer at a young age (22 at the time) and it was not a fun experience. Thankful, like you, they were able to remove it all but I’ll have a scar for life. So glad to hear everything went well for you!  Wear sun screen! Especially if you have fair skin or a genetic history!
So glad you finally got it checked out and was able to get it all removed! Love grandpa's quote!
It’s so fun watching your marriage grow during your crazy adventures but what a gift to learn from the way you love one another during low moments too. So blessed by you!
Great that you're ok Nate.  I've had Mohs surgery 3 times and am ok.
Praying for you Nate! You got this!
Thank you for sharing this part ofyour lives! Actually your videos in general always bring a smile to my face and gives me hope. Thank you for everything and congrats on being cancer free!
i like that you censored your last name the first go around and but forgot to censor your last name the second go around
So glad he is okay. Love the quote by his grandfather. So glad he is okay.
I am so glad that everything is fine with you, and with my own health condition, I understand how important it is to be healthy. Please stay safe!
Kara and Nate much blessings health and strong much love Ana Maria from San Juan Puerto Rico
Glad you had a positive outcome, phew!  Scary for sure and so happy things will be okay.
For me they have to numb really good the area.
my cousin had skin cancer on her forehead... definitely a nasty scar but glad your ok!!
I was crying at the end of this and so glad for you both it had a happy outcome! Xx Hi from Manchester UK! Xx
I’m so glad you’re okay ❤️ After following You and Kara for so many years I truly look up to both of you. Thank you for sharing with us.
Praying for your speedy recovery, the recovery process can suck.  My one piece of advice is don't start thinking of yourself as a 'Cancer Survivor'  if you broke an arm you wouldn't start thinking of yourself as a 'broken bone survivor' years later you would just think, oh yeah I broke my arm.....  In  1999 I had cervical cancer, they operated and thought they got it all, they didn't.  In 2000 I had uterine cancer and had to have a radical hysterectomy in my early 30s.  That time they got it all.  I don't identify myself as a 'cancer survivor' it was just something that happened, I lived and it's just a puzzle piece in the jigsaw my past.  I have  a friend who had cancer on a similar timeline as mine (only she just had it once and they got it all).  She refers to herself  as a cancer survivor.  It has become a part of the fabric of her life.  I wish instead she had chosen to celebrate her LIFE instead of identify herself as a cancer survivor (she even goes to, 'cancer survivor picnics--they are very depressing'.)  I can't wait to see your next adventures.  You guys are rays of sunshine in a crazy world.  Oh and one more thing it doesn't surprise me that you guys were nominated in the couples category.  The love and care you have for each other is evident in EVERY video you do.  You choose each other above anything while still encouraging your partner to step outside of their comfort zone.  Thank you for the videos you put out.
I know it's hard and cannot imagine how it'd be with you, but we are with you no matter what! K&N gang forever! Get well soon!
I know how you feel Nate. 3 years ago I had cancer removed from my face and it was also basal as well. Glad to hear you are doing better 😊
Cancer free!!! Yay!!!
I literally cried.. I never knew I would be so concerned about a person I’ve never met .. We love u guys.
Both of you are so cute....! Congratulations....!  And Nate, you are blessed to have a very sweet sweet companion and soul mate.. Kiss her often.
Yes, thank you for sharing the whole of your adventures, good and bad, as that is how life is. It’s makes everyone more relatable. Sadly skin cancer is so prevalent that when filling out health forms they will ask if you have ever had cancer, but they say do not include skin cancer, it’s just too common. That’s not a good thing of course, but it shows how common it is. I am sure they have told you that you will need to be more careful with head coverings and sunscreen in the future. Wishing you a speedy recovery and years of good health ahead!
I hope Nate is feeling better. I admire your resilience and your ability to live your dreams. You are my adventure heroes. Big hugs in this super weird times 🐻
I'll go have my mole checked now, thanks!  #spf it
Thank god you're fine 💜✌️
Very glad you r right, thats why lately your wife's exspressions were a Little bit sad ♥️♥️♥️
Thank you Nate for having the courage to post this (and to Kara for probably helping with editing.) I found your channel pretty recently and have been binge watching all your videos, its given me hope that someday I can travel the world too. But I did start to think "with my luck, health and financial problems, there's no way I'll ever be able to achieve a life like that."  This video showed me that although there is going to be a LOT of struggles along the way, and it is going to be very hard, it's still possible.  Throughout all of this, you guys still did it! You're accomplishing your dreams and still focusing on the good. I just hope that I can do the same.  If you guys actually see this comment, I wanted to ask for a piece of advice for an 18 year old. I'm terrified I'll be working 99% of my life and only be able to travel for 1% of it, and that the bad days will outweigh the good ones. or just that I won't have enough energy to push myself to see the good ones. Any advice? Thank you for taking the time to read this <3
So glad you are ok! I love you guys! ❤
The blessings are that you were the youngest patient which means you guys were pro active and responsible and taking care of this cancer early so it wouldn’t get worse. I’m glad y’all are healthy and safe.
You two are the sweetest couple.  I aspire to be as good of a husband as Nate is :)
Glad they got you fixed up!
So glad you are okay Nate!!!!
Cancer research has evolved a lot... there are many options now... Its your fighting spirit which will be your true friend Nate... wish you all the best!!!
Thank you for sharing your story. Glad Nate is ok.
Dear Kara, dear Nate,  when I read the title of this vlog, it really scared me. I am really glad that everything went well so far and hopefully this nightmare is over.  Let me tell you this way that you guys are doing an incredibly great job in my eyes.  My wife and I have not been following your channel for very long, but are absolutely fascinated by what you are doing and sharing with us.  You always manage to capture fantastic images and perspectives with your camera. I find it especially touching when you find special people and give them space in your clips.  Especially for people who may be sick, or too afraid, or have other reasons not to look at the world with their own eyes, you make an enormously important contribution. A special thanks for that.  At the same time you always remain authentic, credible and, above all, just super likeable. Especially the fact that you keep your privacy and don't share everything publicly shows me that you are two special people with your hearts in the right place. I just have a huge joy following your vlog.  Please by all means stay as you are.  Above all, please stay healthy in these crazy times!  Love from Germany
Take care Nate!!
Title “had”.
hope you will be ok....by the way....who tf clicks on dislike on this video?! idiots!
Awww man I love you guys… God got you Nate 🤞🏽
I hope your ok
So glad you’re ok.  Thanks for sharing.
Yay cancer free! I’m so happy it was treatable! I think people who share real life events are more relatable than the everyday perfection we tend to see on social media. Thank you for sharing your diagnosis and recovery story with us!!
❤️
Right on god bless!
Thank you for sharing, I'm happy everything turns out well for you! I especially appreciated the part of your video where you state that what everybody shows on social media is the part of their life they want to share, usually only the exciting stuff. Great message, I'm going to discuss it with my 14 year old daughter. Thank you for your great videos, keep traveling!
Having had 3 cancerous bumps/lumps removed over the last 5 years- one on my arm, back, and leg and 3 more borderline lesions removed take-back, head, and chest. 2 were squamous cell carcinoma, one was basal cell. They basically said it was down to being relatively pale and not using sunscreen as a kid when I lived in South Africa. The scars are small and heal well and just add to the more serious scars I have. It's certainly an unusual feeling having them removed via the mohrs surgery. But now I have annual checks, outside the pandemic and anything suspicious gets whipped off. And remember all Slip on a shirt, slap on a hat, slop on the suncream. Heal well Nate.
Take care
this makes me worried about the mole on the side of my head
I’m soo sorry for you Nate 😢😢
Bruh
Good bless, best wishes
😭😭😭
Kara and Nate, may both of you be strong.
So glad to hear that Nate is doing well and cancer free!!
I am so grateful for all my vicarious adventures through you two. Thank you for doing this one for me! The “C” word is still highly threatening, but your nobility and grace and teamwork made this episode supremely poignant and powerful. Thank you so very much for sharing it with us all.
Ok, I’ll be the the bad guy in the comment section. You probably had a far more chance of dying from your Colorado bike ride or your Longs Peak hike than you did from basil cell carcinoma. Yes it is cancer and yes it needs to be addressed, but it is not an immediate danger and certainly not worthy of the drama. Hey guys, I’m a huge fan. My wife and I watch religiously. But I’m also a 3 time malignant melanoma survivor, with multiple surgeries on basil cell and squamous cell carcinomas, and multiple severely atypical displastic nevi. If this caused you the degree of distress that it appeared to, just think about the little kids in the world who deal with cancer every day and show far more strength than you guys.
So scary!! Glad Nate is okay❣️
I am so happy you are ok,  But it was crazy to hear how difficult it was to get your biopsy results.  I never understand the US health system.  Why can't your doctor, who got paid a lot of money to remove the skin cancer, call you directly?  Why do you have to jump through so many hoops when you are already stressed out.  It's really not the way it should be
Im so happy that your fine
Wow. Thank you for sharing. What a wild ride. Glad to hear you're doing ok.
Super proud of you for getting checked out and NOT just ignoring it! Praying for you!
Best wish for u...May Allah Bless both of yours! 💙
good :)
So relieved to hear you’re going to be ok.  This is a good reminder for me that your health can turn on a dime.  Need to appreciate life.  Safe travels!
we are glad you are ok! Your channel as inspired us to start a travel vlog channel :)
click bait
Praying for you guys
Firstly, thank you for sharing this with all of us. Congratulations on the wonderful test results. Seeing your video pop up in the feed made my heart drop, but watching it made me realise you made it through safely. Take care, and stay safe. Best wishes to both of you and to your families.
I am so Glad is is now Cancer free !!! To anybody who reads this comment I wish you the best in life!
What a scary time for the both of you. It is great news that Nate is cancer free.
gwss
Omg this is so sad… i can’t watch this RIp
I'm so glad he's OK.  Stay healthy.
We are glad to hear that you're again on safe side, we sometimes really need the energy you're bringing to us. At 1:30 you reminded me again that you're an absolutely reasonable people, that's what I am missing on YT and surrounding more and more. I looking forward to new inspirations. ;)
Get well soon
Wish you all the best
I'm so glad you're cancer free!! I can't imagine what it's been like dealing with this, I'm so happy for you that it's over.  On another note, now I'm concerned about the wound I have on my head that won't heal. But I pick at it, though 🤦
Dear Kara and Nate, glad you guys are well. Love and Hugs from Malaysia 🇲🇾🥰😎🙏
I am so glad that at the end everything was good!! We love you!!
Life is short , Life is precious
Did anyone else tear up ALOT watching this???
I’m so glad you’re ok Nate 💕 I started watching your videos during my own cancer treatment in 2018 and your reactions reminded me so much of my own. And don’t worry, check up’s become like a regular flu shot or dentist appointment; just something you put in the diary 😘
Man your lucky you got someone in your life.
I love you guys
I’m quite a bit older than Nate and have had several suspicious spots. The time I called the dermatologist to see if they can rule out skin cancer, it took 4 months to get an appointment.
I love you guys, thank you for sharing ⭐
So grateful that you decided to share your experience and that Nate is cancer free  you are both amazing people and I love watching your videos and your story thanks so much for sharing what must have been a very stressful time for you both
Omg I was like 😰🥺 what would happen then that call litreally like made me happy tell that Nate is cancer free congratulations karaandnate
I was wondering in the other videos what the band aid was. Glad they had it all removed !!! Pls come to Hawaii Soon !!!
Bruh why don’t you share important things instead of sharing stupid stuff sometimes
Stay strong Nate! You doing great!
Yaall take it easy now!  you hear? get off the road relax a bit. You owe it to yourselves. May Allah be with you always
Oh man Nate my goodness the smile that puts in the heart is great 👍👍
I'm sorry for what you're going through but I turned it off after a few minutes as there are some things that are private. You are huge influencers...so show people that some things don't need to be shared on social media or we end up living in a world where everyone expects a piece of you....big brother is always watching.  I wish you well on your health journey but I won't be watching as uts something you and your gf should face without the whole world watching
Could it be an after effect of you visiting Chernobyl? Love your videos..get well soon❤️
I ❤️ u guys!!!
Hope u all are better!
How do people click the dislike button on videos like this. Unless they are clicking it because they dislike that you had to go through this.
I had MOHS surgery, once to remove a huge cancerous lump behind my ear, another time a sore that would not heal in the middle of my forehead also cancer.  Thank goodness both benign.  All day procedures, checking with lab until all cancer cells were removed.  Vancouver, Canada  my home & fortunate we have these specialist here. A surprising thing was the surgeon that did the procedure just completed his course in MOHS surgery & was going back to his home city Boston to continue his work in this specialized surgery.  Happy for you Nate it turned  out great for you.
I understand it completely I’ve had about 4 moles biopsies done two that where on my head that I then had get fully removed and one on my stomach that was cancerous:(
Completely mummified.... but healthy and cancer free!  So glad to hear!   I wondered what the white spot/bandaid was on Nates head in the last video.
Suncreen has a lot of chemicals that's bad for your entire body ... glad you are better bud
They have froze some off and cut some off.Not to painful because they numb it.Better than them growing bigger.
I've had skin cancer in different places on my skin from too much sun exposure.I lost a part of my nose from skin cancer because I couldn't find a plastic surgeon to operate on me who would take the Medicaid card .So my nose cancer kept getting bigger.I need to make an appointment to the Doctor because I've got some more places on my skin.
you will always b in my prayers Nate ! love you guys 🤎! stay happy n safe 🥰!
I have my oncologist appt. on the 11th. I am a survivor of Fibromyxoid sarcoma on my left calf (2016) and found another bump on my right leg this year. 🤞🏽🤞🏽
Take care yourself Nate, stay safe Kara 🙏❤️
God bless you and may god bring you healing ❤️‍🩹
So glad you are cancer free Nate!  I went through this with a mole on my chest and did it all by myself, which was tough!!  Luckily after the second "dig out" everything came back negative for cancer :) And I actually had my annual full body check today at the dermatologist!!!
Nate and Kara, you guys are some of the most genuine people we know online. Yes we only see what you show us but after 100s of videos, and watching you over several years, you can’t fake niceness. In India we believe in Karma, you get what you put out. You’ve put out so many smiles, they’re all going to come back over the next multiple years. This is going to be a small blip and take it that way. I know it’s easier said than done, we could see Kara trying to be really strong ☹️, but we’re sending out prayers that things will be fine soon, and our fav couple are back doing things they love. Together. Lots of love.
I’m super relieved you are good Nate.  I discovered y’all’s channel (I’m from Texas) within the past few months after I was laid off of my job after 18 years with them. You and Kara have given me hours and hours of entertainment by living through your travels. Prayers for healing and good health for both of you!
So glad to hear you are cancer free.   I bet your relieved it's over.   😀
I started having teary eyed when I saw the title. My mind kept on saying "omg Kara might not stop crying" I'm so happy Nate is okay 🤗♥️
👍👍👍
My 10 year old daughter introduced me to you both and we watch an episode every night together before bed. This one immediately had me praying. I work in oncology and know how scary those 3 words can be. Congratulations on being Cancer-Free!!!  We love you both and so enjoy you letting us into your amazing and fun life!!!
Thank God you're fine. Both of you are so sweet ❤
💪🏼💪🏼. Much love for you two from Singapore!
People in developed countries are enjoying a great healthcare system, I am not trying to share negativity here but am trying to tell you how I was leaving with a cardiovascular disease that I can't treat in my country. Quick recovery @Nate.
Nate! So sorry to hear y’all have been going through it all this time. Wish we could’ve been here for you and supporting you sooner, but I respect your decision to wait on sharing. Feel better asap!  Sidenote: before bed, I was actually looking at a mole on my arm that started looking weird a few months ago. Then I get on YouTube and see this. Maybe I should make an appointment…  Love to y’all! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
God bless you mate, really glad that you’re fine. Stay strong as always!!
Sending love!!!
I’m so glad to hear you are okay💕
Mohs is the best way to treat this.  My grandfather just had the same and he is doing great.
It’s soo true.. one never know what others are truly dealing with, that’s why compassion, & compassionate behavior toward others is soo so important .
Amazing u shared this with us!
Kara was being so strong! And she loves him so much!!!😔🥰 So nice to see y'all doing real life too... it's in these difficult moments that we realize what and who is truly important!
Blessings. You will heal. Love and light surrounds you and your family. Stay positive.
So glad you’re doing better day by day!! Glad you’re cancer free❤️❤️❤️
So sad to hear this news Nate, but really happy for a good outcome!
Im HungrY - I'm CominG - GivE Me FooD...
I had a basal cell on my head, a face full of pre-cancerous areas, and a squamas cell stage 2 on my arm.  The basal cell was neither unusual nor particularly worrisome, and they cut it right out.  The one on the arm was more worrisome, but I keep an eye on it and there haven't been any problems in the years since.  A LOT of people get basal cells, and I hope sharing my story assures you that you'll be fine.  Just wear a hat all the time, limit your sun exposure in the middle part of the day, and wear sunscreen!
Im HungrY - I'm CominG - GivE Me FooD....
Im HungrY - I'm CominG - GivE Me FooD...
OMG i feel you. I hate needles, shots, being touch with medical stuff, scans, etc. 🤮 I think I would die on that chair 😅  you did well! Thanks for the share, glad you are okay.
Just got diagnosed with stage IIIb malignant melanoma myself. Hope you both are doing fine. The headline really made my heart drop.
So glad you are ok.  I had skin cancer twice on my right leg (behind my knee and lower calf)- they had to do both twice to clear the margins.  Argh!   Make your derm appts everyone!
Good thing it was slow growing!  I mean 3 years is a very long time. I had colon cancer and if  they waited that long I would be dead. Glad it was slow growing for you.
I found out by fluke I had Cll Chronic Lympomic Leukemia, a slow-growing blood cancer, I was diagnosed in Dec of 2017  , I am ok right now, but I had to make the hard call to my mom as she was not well and could not come with me to the appointment, my dad was with me and he sobbed in the car, I am in no hurry for treatment, but I know one day it will come, there is no cure but only treatment. I wish you all the best.
Praying for you Nate and Kara daily 🙏🏻 ❤  with hope and strength we will overcome 🙏🏻
Very similar story here, was living in Japan, and I had a lesion that would not heal. 2 years later, after many ointments prescribed by the MD, I had to beg for a biopsy. It was basal cell, which they removed. 10 years later all good. So no worries :)
I hope you feel better
Thanks for sharing Nate... Prayers to you and Kara bro :)
I know that horrible emotional wave only too well
Your video got my fiancé to FINALLY set up a dermo appt to get his body checked out for skin cancer. THANK YOU for sharing.
One of cure of cancer is colloidal silver  give it a try  you won't believe how effective it is  and it has zero side effects
Glad you are OK and you were proactive in getting it checked out! I had atypical cells found for melanoma and have to get checked every six months. It’s a good idea for everyone to go get a skin screening with your dermatologist.
you can’t dislike this video, should be illegal
You shouldnt really upload personal things like this. Dont you value privacy at all? I often wonder about the people who expose everything about themselves online.
YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I can only imagine what you went through, I went through the same thing myself and still fighting 💪 Take care guys, life is so precious, even though we underestimate it it quite often and take it for granted. ♥️💯
I lost my husband to lung cancer 5 years ago. Hallelujah that Nate is ok. Prayers were answered!
Well ,if you have to have a skin cancer basal cell is the best one to have. I hope you both have learned to wear sunscreen SPF 50 , a hat and sunglasses. Oh and don't forget to reapply every 2 hours,365 days a year! Your friendly Canadian Derm nurse! I'm glad you had Moh's sx!
So glad you're okay Nate! Maybe Kara should've driven after your surgery though.
I'm so glad things went well for you Nate. Also just watched your Canada visit!  With Eamon and Bec!!!  You 4 are my favourites adventurers!!!  Hope your are both safe and well....thank you for sharing your life...take care of eachother! !I've from 🇨🇦🇨🇦
It would be cool if you 2 hung out with the vanwifes in Canada
Awww....So Relieved to know all is well..I love you both yet I've never even known you personally...I feel as though we go way back.. 😂😆 I'm so thankful for a full recovery and Love You Nate and Kara🤪 your always so strong and comforting ❤️Love you two🤗🙏 may we all care for ourselves a little more and appreciate all we are* and have!
Get well soon!  I hope you guys are okay.  Have fun in Canada!!
I am glad everything is good. Just found y’all a few months ago so glad I did. I have gone to the beginning and just started on year 2 at polo. Really enjoy watching y’all. Oh I am from North Carolina so I have a lot of y’all in my vocabulary. Love y’all
Not the greatest thing to title the video "I have skin cancer" and then have promotions in your video. Where's the moral compass?
Nate and Kara. Sending love and healing your way. I so appreciate Nate sharing his recent scarier than shit stuff. Life is tenuous and precious, and we all take it for granted, no matter what age we are. Listen to your bodies, and please don’t ignore weird shit. Go to your doctor! Peace and positivity to you all. ❤️
Thank you for sharing this story! That took guts and I am glad to see that not everything on YouTube is all roses and no thorns! You guys rock and I am glad you guys got up to enjoy more of Canada! I think you need to return out to Banff in Alberta and maybe head up to Jasper too! It is a beautiful place no matter what season you choose to visit!
I had tears in my eyes the whole time even though I knew you'd be ok with the basal cell. It's never easy to hear the word cancer, even one that has a high cure rate. I have had a basal and squamous cell cancer removed. Sadly I continued to sunbathe despite being a nurse and knowing the odds. In June of this year I had two melanoma's removed. They got it all and I'm fine other than finally I'm shaken. I share this only to say that I hope, unlike me, you'll make sure you're lathered in sunscreen and reapply it every two hours!!! I actually wear UPF 50 tops and pants now. Bayleaf has great affordable options and can be found on Amazon. I have no affiliation. I just enjoy your adventures so much and want you two to keep doing them for a long, long time to come. Cheers!
Nate both of you are in my prayers. God will cure you.
LIAR!
LIAR!
May as well make a headline THAT IS A LIE SO YOU CAN MAKE $$$$$$$$$ !! THE LOVE OF MONEY IS THE ROOT OF ALL KINDS OF EVIL.
So thankful it wasn’t worse and happy you have each other and your health.
I'm happy your doing good. Wonderful you have no cancer. Thanks for sharing your journey.
Nothing like Cancer to get a bit of likes and revenue eh.. The bible says "its easier for a camel to pass through an eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God".. All these YouTubers are only interested in money..
All is well that ends well, Nate...and God is a good and faithful God ... 😁💕😉
lmao
I worried about watching your videos as a nurse. You love your outdoor life, hats, sunscreen and continue to live your love so we can continue to watch you grow, have adventures and love one another!
I just found out today that I also have Basal Cell.  Gotta say, I'm terrified
God bless you both always.
Can't imagine the stress you guys went through, hope you and Nate are doing well!!!
This just breaks my heart. Please be take care you two.
I have to have two pretty invasive leg surgeries in a few weeks and I am not trying to compare myself to you, but I want you to know that you are not alone I can understand the stress and anxiety that you are going through. Stay strong!
I had my 1rst Mohs surgery over 20 years ago. I just had my 8th Mohs today. My best advise is to try to stay out of the sun as much as possible
I’m glad you are better Nate
Did you guys get a new house?
I got a Basal Cell Carcinoma removed from my nose, close to my tears bag in 2019. The waiting part to find out how much it had spread and not telling my parents about it until i knew for sure it was ok caused me anxiety and I had episodes of panic attacks but people wouldn’t know because I kept smiling all the time. So thank you for sharing. Power to SPF 🧴 🙏🏻
💗💗💗
Congratulations on being cancer free, Nate! Enjoy life and I hope to see many more awesome videos of your travels. I've started following this channel this summer and catching up on all  your vlogs. Just watched the St Lucia's vlog of your 15 day cruise 3 years ago (vlog #449)! 😀😀
First thing first.  THANK YOU for telling people that what they see on YT is just a "Highlight" reel and not to compared your life to theirs.  Now,  on to this vid... THANK YOU again for sharing this,  you could save someone's life.  Rock on you two!!!!
So glad you are OK Nate x
Going to have almost exactly the same surgery next week. Up until the point about the „they didn‘t numb it all“ and „the smell of burnt flesh“ thingy i was totally cool with the upcoming surgery, but now im pooping my pants! thanks Nate 😅 But glad you are all fine and in good health ✌🏻
Thank you for sharing this
Oh, man. I am so sorry you went through this. Glad to hear you're cancer free.
Just made an appointment for a physical while watching this! Thank you and I am so happy you are well!
Feeling better to hear the good news in the end   Wish you good health 👍
God is with you Nate ❤️❤️❤️...Our prayers are with you cheer up & give thanks to the lord always ❤️❤️❤️
Clickbait video for the views.
I had it twice on my nose and skin graft.  They performed  Mohs surgery, and you don’t feel anything. It was what I looked like after the surgery and days to follow since it was on my face. It was years of no suntan as a young adult.
You really appreciate sunshine when it starts raining. I am happy that it's going to be good, Nate.
I love you Nate!!! I don't know you but believe the love and the prayers for your continued health are reallllll!!!!!   I adore Kate as well:)
This month is two years post Malignant Melanoma pT1a diagnosis myself. Ticking down that 5-year post-diagnosis timeline.
yo when i get cancer i better get a zillion views too
Are you a glass half full kinda guy? At least it's not covid 😅 Wish you safe and fast travels down your road to recovery!
I had full tears rolling until Kara went ‘let’s see what webMD has to say about it’. This isn’t a funny video, but that got me I can’t lie,
Nate, thanks for posting this video.  As a lover of the outdoors, I'll admit I didn't always use sunscreen.  I later found out I had a malignant melanoma. Fortunately, we found it very early.  I also had a basal cell on the side of my head and, like you, underwent the MOHS procedure.  I preach the use of sunscreen now to anyone who'll listen.  But, with your large number of subscribers, you've done a great public service by being so open with this.  All the best to you and Kara!
Live your life in a fashioned way,you are able to hold your heads up high. Good luck!
Its such a relief to know nate is cancer free, i have been watching you guys for a long while now and everytime i watch your video's its like im there with you guys i couldn't imagine what i would have done without you guys, please stay well and wear your sunscreen!    Cant wait for a new travel video!
You are a champion sending love from the uk
Thats what you get when you run a marathon. Did i missed something?
It happens to the best of us Nate
Yay!!!!! Love some good news in this crazy, upside down world.  😎✌️🤙🤘😎
Hope you get better
Hey you guys,  Oh poor Nate ! Your anxiety was sky high .The heroic acts you preformed on YouTube, you and Kara can out do supperman or supperwoman in a 💓 beat!    Can I encourage you to wait till you have something to worry about before getting so anxious.🥲 I have had umteen baselcells froze off ,cut off , your more likely to die from some freak accident !  Maybe a time to chill out is in the works for y’all .   Have   Totally enjoyed all your videos ,now fortunately I’m also in love with Eamon and Bec, as well as   Kinging It ! All are Hilarious ,funny 😂🤣🤣👏👏👏👏👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
take care get well soon , so sad to hear that
I only cried when Kara cried! Congratulations to you both. To many more years!
I pray that Nate will continue to be cancer free. Good luck guys!
I genuinely do not understand why someone would sponsor a cancer reveal video. I can understand sponsorship of a living or dealing with cancer video where you direct your audience to tools you think they will find helpful as well. But to have a brand name incorporated into what is otherwise a very personal and intimate revelation seems discordant. This is such a slippery slope, my friends.   Be safe, and wishing you the best on your continued road to recovery nonetheless.
I had a basal cell on my head removed when I was 6. I've had 2 others elsewhere in the 90s. I get a check every year and haven't had anything since.
Glad you’re healed 🙏🙏🙏
"Good health is a crown on a well man's head, that only the sick can see" - Nate's grandfather. Wow
Therapy online *sure kids*
God bless you both..
Well I went to the largest Buc-Cees last night, watched this video this morning and then ran thru an airport to barely catch my flight. I feel like I have definitely channeled K&N today. I am so glad that you are ok, Nate!!
So glad Nate is healing well. Love his grandfather’s quote. 💕
Stay healthy and stay blessed and happy may God give us great life and great health.
So happy to hear you’re okay! You’ve shown great strength in your vulnerability, and make an excellent point that we don’t get the full picture on someone’s life just from what they share.  Hoping for a speedy recovery! Definitely gonna remember to put spf on my ears from now on
My hats off to you both to share something so personal. This video will remind me to NOT skip sunscreen (which I only would put on about 50 percent of the time) Thank you for doing this.
I love you guys💛
God bless you both ❤️
Just happened to me 2 months ago..  basil cell skin cancer under my left eye.. 16 stitches and and bad scar later.. it is gone..   glad you are good my guy !!!
Thank you for sharing this with us.  I'm so glad things turned out for the good!
Guys u just gave a serious heat attack!
Be in good health for ever.. We Love you
I'm praying for you
Nate got lucky.
I've been thru 2 different types of cancer and am currently in remission...I know the feelings and it sucks but glad to hear all is good
What a blessing that all turned out well. All praise goes to God for he is always good
So glad it all worked out for the best! And great story telling…as usual!! 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Im glad to hear all is well and keep getting better, I just subbed to you both recently and I wish you both all the best.
Our Lord Messiah Heal is miracle .Jehovah father Be with you nate nothing will be a stress and any sickness in His beloved son name .Lord Jesus .Amen
I'll be praying for you!
Wish you super quick recovery mate..!! Do well!
Glad things turned out fine for the both of you
I had a basal cell spot removed from my cheek a few years ago. Just make sure you keep up the sun screen and annual (or at first biannual) dermatology appointments.
7:42 He really should not be driving right after something like that!!!!????
Thank you for the honesty in this video. It's important to remember social media is everyone's highlight real. Also the skin cancer risk reminder is excellent. Active outdoor lifestyles are overall excellent for health but it's easy to forget to take care of your skin when out in the sun.
Really interesting to see the process
I had a small red spot on my forehead that ended up being basal cell skin cancer. They had to remove so much and now I have a massive scar. Now about 2 years later I have another spot next to my eye close to the previous spot. I'm worried they're gunna have to cut out even more.
My derm said BCC is the best kind of cancer you can get if you're going to get skin cancer. I know that sounds like an oxymoron, but it's so easily treatable. I'm glad you had it taken care of! I had BCC on my nose that required six plastic surgeries to repair. It could have been much worse!
As a cancer survivor I could feel your deep seated fear of the unknown. You have proven that your love for each other is a true blessing, no matter what Life throws at you. Your courage is such a gift expressed for others to see that we are never alone in good times or bad. Sending love your way from Victoria,BC🇨🇦
LOL!!
Congrats on your skin cancer!
Guys! Glad it turned out the way it did. That time period waiting on results is so heavy
Hey my wife and I met you on the Canadian border in Niagara Falls. Thank God that the cancer was cured! We’re so happy to meet you guys.
Hey buddy.  I understand you not wanting to share this until now.  But know that many, many of us have had to go through this and we are all here to support you.  The initial diagnosis hits you like a ton of bricks but over time you realize that this is something very curable.  As long as you keep up with your follow up checks so they catch anything that comes up early then you are going to be absolutely fine!!  Hang in there.
I's so sorry 🥺🥺 hope you recover soon :)
I wish you a good recovery! Warm regards from the Netherlands....
I'm new here😊😊
Hoping there are no future issues. Cancer really sucks!
I commented on your facebook post before watching this but just wanted to add thank you for raising awareness than skin carcinoma can happen at all ages (and Kara your miming describing the biopsy was rather funny, sorry Nate!) Much love to you.
Oof
What would you rather have to witness.....  Another lost soul speaking the word "transphobia"!?....  Or a literal turd plopping out of somebody's mouth!?....
Didn't ask+Ratio
I’m so glad that Nate is cancer free my heart sank when I heard the news I hope you are feeling loads better, all my love guys xxxxxx
Sending love to you guys from Singapore. You handled it so well. Nate does look badass with that bandage now though!
I am so glad everything is ok 👍🏻
Stay strong man! I will be praying for you!
OK this is Click bait-He does not have cancer and is Cancer Free-No need to Joke about this topic
Get well soon.
I've probably had 25 biopsies over the years, some basal cell, some squamous cell, some displastic, some benign. Couple deep stitches to dig everything out. Not too bad.  Now if it was melanoma, you don't mess with that.
lol you won’t be meditating this one off
You guys are amazing, love your videos, are so inspiring and real. You are so courageous to come out and speak about your private life and what happens behind the scenes.Hat off ....keep up the good energy...God bless you and wish quick healing to Nate and power to Kara to support him.
God bless you brother 🤗
Happy to know you're now cancer free, stay safe
Good things only happen to good people, u are a good hearted person sir,  glad that nate sir is alright.happy health. 🙏👍
Fantastic  i am so excited think I'm going to order a pizza
Glad Nate's OK! Might just be me having a whinge, but I don't know how I feel about having paid ads in a video like this.
I’m a malignant melanoma survivor and one of the things that really upsets me is when people say, “It’s *just* skin cancer..’ Skin cancer kills people. A dear friend lost her fight with melanoma last year. A common sign of skin cancer is when a sore doesn’t heal, moles that are itchy or changing colors. Black color in a mole is a definite sign to get it checked by a dermatologist who specializes in skin cancers, not all of them do. Lastly, Nate, I’m thankful you got clean margins. God bless y’all!
Positive vibes, keep smiling and step forward one day at a time. Well done for tackling it, and getting sorted, but be mindful not to delay things should there be symptoms of anything in future. Take care and be well x
This is past already. It should be had not have.🤔😳.
The cure is out there
Rip
God bless you both he is great and I love your both Not because the fun you have together on social media, or where you travel. It’s because you believe in each other and truly love one another which is so rare.. But I’ll be 52 October 11 so maybe I am old school bless you both safe travels always and I’ll be watching to experience countries I’ll never be able to go to but I love seeing through your eyes.. ♥️😘
I Pray to Allah, that you get cured soon.
Feels like you waited for the results to long :/
All the things people do for clicks and views... :-( #Fuckcancer
Nate, i've survived kidney cancer and am curently battling thyroid cancer. Heres a quote that gets me by "Never forget...That no matter how dark it gets, or how far you fall, you are never out of the fight"....Marcus Luttrell  We (cancer survivors) have a saying "no one fights alone"! Best wishes for a speedy recovery!
Typical BCC presentation. Dermatology should have diagnosed it away in 2018. Been there, done that.
Kara I feel you. Tris had a wound that wouldn't heal on the side of his nose. Long story short after several other Drs saying you're young and healthy it's unlikely, I kept pushing and eventually they did a biopsy - it was a BCC. Hearing those words - your partner has cancer is awful. But he is now 9 years cancer free and all good. Also good at his sunscreen! Big love to you both!
So do I but no one cares
Wow!  There have been over one million views in less than two days!  That is incredible.  I am glad all is looking good for Nate!  I do understand that this type of cancer is reasonably straightforward to deal with.  If you _have_ to have cancer, this was a reasonable "choice"!  I am mixed about sharing that my late wife, Katherine, succumbed to ovarian cancer a little over a year ago after 6.25 years.  Diagnosed in April 2014:  surgical removal of (eight pounds of) tumors and tissue in June 2014.  Chemotherapy in July through September 2014 (six treatments spaced four weeks apart.)  All tests indicated she was "in remission" until June 2016 where cancer recurred.  Next series of treatment used a different mix of chemotherapy drugs:  six treatments spaced every four weeks leading to "remission" again.  These drugs caused her to go bald revealing a beautiful scalp.  Recurrence of cancer was in early 2018.  Yet another chemotherapy formulation commenced around April 2018, six sessions spaced every three weeks.  Few signs of cancer until late 2019 but not all was going so well.  She needed a pair of nephrostomies in February 2019 and a colostomy November 2019.  She opted for hospice services (at home) beginning February 2020 which succeeded in controlling pain without her being gorked out better than 95% of the time.  Intestinal disruptions and worse leading to her preferred death at home, surrounded by her closest friends and me holding her hand as she slipped into total bliss.  We skied at Lake Tahoe one glorious four-day trip in January 2018 then four days/three nights in Yosemite. We climbed Yosemite Falls and other amazing sights which she had long intended to revisit since she had been there at 19 years old.   In July 2019, she chose for us to vacation in northeastern Oregon at a wilderness luxury resort which required a 9 mile (and 2500 vertical feet) hike in and another one to exit.  Afterwards we stayed three nights at Wallowa Lake Resort; did the Wallowa Lake Tramway to the Eagle Cap Wilderness with spectacular vistas of forests and lakes.   There were family-oriented resort trips in Central Oregon with serious stargazing, bicycling, horseback riding, climbing walls, etc in 2019.  Plus there were two trips to the Oregon Coast with many friends for a long weekend (each).  We did a trip to Montana for backpacking and hiking.  Spent a day in Walla Walla.  Camped in the Oregon mountains for 4-5 nights for the 2017 solar eclipse.  Snowshoed around Crater Lake each January for our anniversary, usually with laser snow tubing one night and maybe snowmobiling around Diamond Lake a day.  Multi-day bicycle trips throughout Oregon on several occasions.  Christmas markets at either the Oregon Garden or in Austria/Switzerland.  "Girls Gone Sloth" where she and her 3-4 closest friends lounged in Las Vegas in 2016.  In 2015, we did the Seattle to Portland (204 mile) bicycle ride in one day.  Kara & Nate:  enjoy and embrace the company your loving partner provides which deeply enhances your lives and makes it so much more worthwhile!  In the minute to minute  it is so easy to do (and might even seem trite), but when circumstances limit choices, you will have the deep memories of being wonderfully close partners through time.
I think we can all agree cancer should just f*ck off. Hope you get well soon.
I’m so sad, I watched this wonderful couple literally from the start. They are amazing. The entire world loves them. I, happy he is doing well and cancer free.
God bless you ❤️❤️
Here is how to cure cancer from ancient remedy https://youtu.be/8B58nxWsFi8
Hay vale, lo siento mucho!!! Cuidate mucho por favor y espero que lo,puedas superar y salir bien de esta enfermedad.   Saludos!!!
My husband had a basal cell carcinoma right next to his nose. Yes they are easily treated. But they can grow back. He had it removed a second time a few years later.  The worst thing was the burning flesh smell and the ELEVEN shots of novacaine. He doesn't numb well.  But it is easily treated and you will have a good long life. Enjoy!
Great news, but having a rock at your side is the real win.
So glad your on the mend nate. All the best for your continued health and wellbeing guys xx. Yay Canada 🍁
i hope you get better and me and my family will pray for you everyday
"so let me milk it for views"
Thank you guys for sharing this! Very important issue to be aware of and something that we can combat daily by just doing easy things!  I know that must’ve been scary for you both and still sending prayers and love!  I honestly feel like you are family bc I’ve watched you for so long.  All my love.  Jenn
My heart dropped!! So glad you are okay❤️❤️
Sending love from Myanmar.... We'd love to see more creation....
You'll never know who life you may have impacted by sharing your skin cancer story. Hopefully it's inspired people to go get checked. I too had skin cancer and had I not gone to my dermatologist for a full body check it would have been missed. And I'm fine today.  Thank you for sharing your story. Everyone go get checked!
Oh thank you god. I was in shock just by reading the title of the video. With my MIL being diagnosed this year this was the last thing I wanted to watch. I am so glad Nate is all fine. Kudos to Kara too for being so strong for Nate. God bless u both ❤
I'm glad it's behind you and that everything's fine, keep going around the world and keep showing us magical places and amazing experiences. Warm greetings, Tel Aviv, Israel 😃
This made me tear up and got me worries as as I saw the video. I'm so glad that Nate is fine now, please be careful and stay safe always kara and nate! You guys bring so much joy to all of us! I really really enjoy your videos that made me feel I have traveled the whole world! God bless you guys!
❤️❤️❤️
Nate, all the best for the recovery and here’s to future health. Eat more fresh vegetables and less meat. And remember, animal proteins should be eaten separately from carbohydrates. Drink water and any liquids separately from food. 10 minutes before meals. And of course, the skin should always be protected when you are in the sun. And you will be healthy.
sending much love  to  you nate and Kara
Thank God you are ok!! The video title scared me
I actually prayed that this all would be fake and at the end you would say .. hey this is promotion ad campaign for making people realize that apply sunscreen.. lots of hugs .. kara and Nate 🤗🤗.. I actually watched the entire episode at a stretch and prayed immensely that you give some good news in the end.. it’s actually saddening and I love your channel since i discovered it last year .. I love you both .. I love you Kara and Nate
Staying sun smart is the only way.
stay strong & happy pooh, don’t let it take over 🤍
Wishing you a speedy recovery 🙏
Had Mohs surgery too. It’s a great thing.  And yes, cauterized flesh is not pleasant odor.
I hope you get better I Love first video you’re inspiring me to go every day
Well I watched to the end and no you don't have cancer!!! I'm 73 and spent years on the beach in the sun. In recent years I've has a number of BCC's (Basal Call Carcinomas) removed, forehead, temple, shoulder. All good now! I even had a tiny melanoma on the leg. But it's removed and no reoccurrence. My dermatologist is very good. He photographs moles and lesions and keeps an eye on them 6 months later to see if there's any change! Go to a good skin cancer specialist who knows what they're doing it's worth it! The fierce sun here in Australia does do damage.
Such a roller coaster worth of emotions! Glad to hear Nate is cancer free!
So happy you guys! May God Continue to bless you Nate 🙏,  so happy you ❤ are healthy and free of the big C , 😊👍💕💕💕
@kara and Nate... Change the title to I """had"""skin cancer"..
Rip sorry to see you go
Oh my. Why am I just now seeing this? I am so relieved and thankful that your worry and waiting is over Nate. I will be praying for your total healing and that your head isn't still hurting too badly. I'm glad you and sweet Kara don't have to live with this worry every day. Thank you for being brave enough to share your story with all of us. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
So basically like at the barber but they took waaay of the top :P
I was diagnosed with skin cancer last year in May.  In April, I saw what seemed to be a strange bite or pimple on my hand.  It itched a bit, was painful to the touch and started growing, fast.  I contacted my PCP (primary care physician), sent photos and he didn't respond.  So I contacted an advice nurse with my insurer and was immediately referred to a dermatologist.  At about 4 weeks, it was quite painful and about the size of a quarter and maybe a centimeter or so tall.  I had done my research and was pretty sure I knew what type of cancer it was.   After having it removed, plus a bit extra at my insistence, it was confirmed as a squamous cell carcinoma.  It's a bit more aggressive than basal cell.  Nate, you're a young guy and I'm an old one (71 when this happened).   Don't wait to take care of yourself.  I've met a few young people that got melanoma that barely survived, and only because they didn't wait.  It's okay to be afraid.  Just don't put off anything having to do with your health.    I enjoy the videos because you and Kara keep them upbeat, for the most part, and find joy in the world you explore.  Love it.  I don't mind when you get real.  It shows your humanity.   My best wishes to you both.  Health and wisdom.
Protect Kara and Nate at all cost
Glad Nate is ok & cancer free!! As a redhead, hats & sunscreen always! ❤️
Literally almost lost it but my concern for Nate kept me watching!
Yooo I never heard of u but stay strong
Will include you Nate in my daily prayers for a full recovery, Have a healthy healing and please take care of yourself
🤍
Good luck to your skin cancer I love your videos

Check out Italian Dr. Simoncini, he uses 5% Lugols iodine topically for skin cancers.  Easy, cheap, typically no side effects.  (Though you may want to monitor your iodine levels, even though many people are deficient in this element according to online research)
You should come and visit ladakh in india, i just had an idea and wanted to tell you but everytime i saw anyone of your videos i would forget to tell you about it, ladakh is even better than Switzerland, no offense to the people living in Switzerland.
What type was it?  Basal, squamous, melanoma?  Did they do Mohs on it?
I'm sorry
Oh no stay safe 😞
Glad you are AOkay! Stay safe and be well!
You clickbaiters…I’ve faithfully watched and subscribed and followed you for two years now and you released this pathetic clickbait video.
Hey Nate and Kara, I am sooo happy for the outcome! Our family loves you so much and when Inread the title of your video, it felt like hearing that my little brother hd skin cancer….  I am sorry, don’t want to sound creepy! You two have been a part of our lives for the past 3-4 years.  Many prayers for your continued good health, happiness, and shared adventures!!  Also Kara, I feel like I cry every time tht you do. I love your sensitive loving heart!!!
Thank you for sharing! Please know you are loved all around! I’ll pray for you! Take care of yourself we all need and love you!
My husband and mother both have the same. He had a four layers mohs and an 11 hour procedure. My moms is scheduled for 10/19. I was the wound manager for my husband. His was large on his lip. Now awaiting reconstruction. It’s hard. Pet scans are coming to make sure his glands in the throat are clear. I would ask your doctor about this. My husbands dr three years ago just gave a lip steroid cream. And with only zoom appointments during covid it grew. I insisted to get a dermatologist appointment and he had to change gp to book one. Glad to her it went well. True on the BetterHelp. With van life and Gabby I immediately thought of you both. So true us viewers only see curated content.  Be well and blessings to you both.
If you have a womb anywhere really that doesn`t heal in 2 weeks then get it checked please
In Jesus Name!
get some cannabis salve and apply a pea sized glob under a large bandaid overnight on any questionable areas until it goes away... problem solved
Thx for sharing Nate good to hear your free , I've also had skin cancer 3 times over my lifetime  and I'm very diligent, stay in the shade and wear sunscreen unfortunately it has changed my life,  I will offer this advice get checked yearly or if you notice anything odd have it looked at , It's unfortunate but you will probably have another  all the best
I thumbed down. You could have used your platform to educate re melanoma, which to me, is actual skin cancer. I feel this episode is pure click bait.Your both bigger than this, do health scare vlogs right. Glad your fine.
Nate, thank you for being brave and sharing your story. I work in a pharmacy and see people all the time who demand SPF-free products because they want a good tan. I once had to walk away from a customer who told me "skin cancer" because I wanted to scream. Just over the weekend, another customer told me that it was "stupid" that we carry sunscreen at all after Labor Day, and my immediate response was that skin cancer doesn't take the summer off.
Thanks for sharing!!  As someone who has also gone through this, it’s improving to stress that people need to have these things checked out!!
I am so happy u are doing ok❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Dude I’m going through the exact same thing in exactly the same area right now! Crazy!
Off topic but you should visitor more of France I’m moving to Lyon after I graduate in a year and a half and it would be amazing to see you make more videos on it
poor nate
"Good health is a crown on a well man's head, that only the sick can see.' Absolutely stunning quote that creates reflection in the times we are living in right now.  I appreciate your words, I appreciate you. Godspeed.
I totally can relate to this 💯 God bless you Kara and Nate🙏
God Bless you and thank you for sharing this
Nate, unbelievable the life you continue to have with chapters such as this being unfolded behind the cover. This hits a bit close to home as Rachel kicked cancers ass not too long ago, beating stage2A Breast Cancer.   Here is to clear sailing moving forward, in the most coolest hats ever...forever   Again, thank you for showing the power of love, positivity and determination in conquering lifes continuous winding roads.
Wishing you a speedy recovery! Know what you're going through and it's gonna be stressful but you'll get through this. I was diagnosed with SC at the age of 22 and the appointments and surgeries (I had 2) where gruelling but all worth it in the end. Now I can happily say at 24 that as of last week I'm officially cancer free. You'll get through this. Stay safe, stay positive and wear your sun cream! Even when it's cloudy (can never be too careful)
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Nooo bro I love all you vids please . I will pray for you
my heart goes out to you Nate <3
Get well soon.
Don't forget to sunscreen your eyelids and/or wear sunglasses.   (Mineral sun block, zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are inert and should not irritate your eyes).  You're awake when they slice your eyelids off.    -another younger basal cell patient
Skin cancer. I’m so sorry prayers 🙏 good news though is that out of all the skin cancers Melanoma is the ONLY one that penetrates into your body. Thankfully yours in topical and cannot penetrate the skin and into your body. I am a melanoma cancer survivor. It’s very deadly for one reason only then it’s the only one out of 12 or 15 of the only known skin cancers...the only reason is because people don’t the signs. ABCDE research it. It’s easy. I had stage 2 stage 3 and up is dangerous and went into your lymphnodes which are highways to your organs which is how the cancer spreads from The outside of your body to internally and starts to severely  damage organs. Praying for you brother. I hope you donated some of your proceeded off this video to skin cancer research especially melanoma.
So proud of you for sharing your story, congratulations on being cancer free, I've now realized I should wear more sunscreen, I do wear sunscreen but not enough.  I have so many freckles and tanned
And using Pharma Sun creams will increase your chances of skin cancer, by the little known fact, that using these chemical creams blocks Vit D from the Sun. Vit D Helps fight Skin Cancer. But a Patient cured, is a Customer lost. Look closer at what they have to offer, for Cancer Patients. A Treatment over 100yrs old & still kills more people than it cures. They say they have advanced so much, yet they still know so little, let me use the Common Cold as an example.. Cancer like any other sickness, is a Dis-Ease & imbalance in your life, maybe a traumatic event could trigger that feeling of Dis-Ease. Let us not mince our words here. We have all been lied to. The Government via the MSM is the Virus, Peoples behaviour, is the Pandemic. Common Sense is the Cure.
I had brain cancer when I was 8 I wasn’t supposed to live cancer sucks I will pray for you man
We all love you so much, Nate! (and also Kara, duh) ♥️
Did i cry for the entire video? of course i did.  So happy you're cancer freeeeeee!!
You are in my prayers Nate and Kara and I’m so sorry that you have to go through this but you will get through this and you have so many people who are there for you and you care about you and who are also praying for you too. 🙏❤️
Glad to hear you are doing well. Don't worry about the sun here in Canada, it's about to disappear for 6 months 🙄. Canadian winter is no joke.
"I have cancer" normal people: seek medical help,  Whites: monetize a YouTube video
I'm glad you both are better and in a good place after this difficult time. 🥰  However I feel odd about this whole video and the channel lately in general. This video has a click bait title *had cancer* not *have cancer*. It has a sponsor and a mid-roll? Slightly taking advantage of such a topic imo.   This comment will get lost I'm sure, but I feel better leaving feedback. You're a bigger channel now, the content has to reflect that. I simply miss the authenticity of the older content. Much love. 💕
OMG I know how you feel guys. My boyfriend had a biopsie for skin cancer too a couple months ago and the wait for the results was unbelivably long! All my thoughts are with you guys. Stay strong!   P.S. My boyfriend is cancer free! 😁 Oh and I'm a nurse in Québec Canada, and I sometimes take care of patients who have had Moh's surgeries, I know it can be scary but you handled it like a boss Nate ;)
OMG you’re so young. Glad all is well now
Heart dropped when I read this so happy to hear your OK
100% thankful for sharing, and glad you are healthy. Your trips are amazing, but glad you included some realism of you and Kara, in this uncertain time of yours. Definitely a message that needed to be shared, and can hopefully help others. Keep doing what you’re doing. Your adventures (and Kara’s excitement) brighten my day. From a fellow Tennessean, love y’all!
cancer is my nightmare its already taken 1 of my friends and ive known many with it
I had skin cancer, had a 3 in, incision on my upper chest!  It came back 2 years later!  Went in again and had it taken out! It’s no fun and it takes me a long time to heal!
🤗🤗🤗  & 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 for both of you
Praises & thanks to the Most High you are okay!
Praise God!  So glad Nate got the all clear.  Love watching you guys.
Prayers for continued success in overcoming this challenge. 🙏❤
I'm so glad you're okay and dang #39 on trending.
So happy for you two. Congratulations on being cancer free! My father in law is a Mohs surgeon. Our family wears our SPF all the time. 😉 It’s easy to forget though.  Glad you’re both safe and cheers to good health going forward!
Nobody cares
Thank you for sharing.  I thank God everything worked out.  I look forward to watching you guys videos🙏🏾❤🙏🏾  Keeping you in my prayers.
Who on earth are you?… my Dad went through skin cancer when we were a kid. You’ll live. Or not. Praying for recovery, but man… drama.
Fear porn for click bait. No respect.
🙏🏽💙🙏🏽
Damn bro I’m sorry I had to go through that shit
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Glad you are doing well!
Glad you're okay I just had for shots today it sucks but if it's what you have too do
We love you guys 😢😟😨 But we are solo happy to hear that you r okay and clear and free that great news
I am sooo sorry we all affected by these news with sadness and tears for you both , you are a stunning couple, greetings from Egypt
We are so glad for you Nate & Kara!!!  Thank you for sharing your journey with this!
As a cancer survivor this video brought back so many emotions, so many feelings, so much angst and eventual happiness. I was riding the waves right alongside you Nate. Thankfully your cancer free as am I five years out from three surgeries.
Yea I had bullous from head to toe when I was 17-early 20’s it could have developed into full blown skin cancer on top of Crohn’s disease so at 17 I had two auto immune deficiencies and later had to even have an organ removed probably from the 21 pills I was taking a day plus infusions in the later years. You’ll be perfectly fine the human body is resilient most people have one small issue and blow it up for as much attention as possible when they have no idea how lucky they are to have a somewhat normal life.
Sorry to hear you went through that ordeal but delighted you through it together.  It will make you stronger!
I’m happy you are healthy
and make sure it's not those toxic sunscreens! Some big brands are known for that now I hear. some sunscreens can Cause skin cancer? >.> try to get non-nano, reef safe, and non of those chemical based sunblocks.
🤞🏽💚🙏🏽
Thank you for sharing this story and repeating the mantra that what we see online from anyone is only a curated snippet of their life.  I have really enjoyed your videos over the years and your infectious positivity is wonderful, but life throws challenges to everyone and I’m so happy for you that Nate was able to have a clean resection.  Looking forward to your future adventures.
Oh my goodness the video scared me, I’m so glad you’re Cancer free, Nate. Sending y’all good vibes✨time for more adventures ☺️

Thank you for sharing your story.  I also had a Basal Cell about 10 years ago (in my early 30s) and had the same procedure done.  Prevention is key, so I applaud you for sharing, as it might help others to be careful with their skin, or to see a dermatologist if something is going on.  Also thank you for sharing your travels!
So glad Nate is ok....I am glad you both are doing amazing videos. I always go back and check our video in Peru. Sending love your way.
I had the same procedure done a few years ago.  They had to go back and cut again twice.  No fun.  Dermatologist  makes me wear sunscreen even in winter.
My dads a NYC DERMATOLOGIST. A basal cell is the best kind to have. Second would be squamous cell carcinoma. The worst is melanoma which has a high death rate due to the fact that it develops  In a deeper skin layer and can then metastasize via lymphatic system.
My dads a NYC DERMATOLOGIST. A basal cell is the best kind to have. Second would be squamous cell carcinoma. The worst is melanoma which has a high death rate. We did biopsies and treated all kinds of cancer with radiation etc.
I hope everything the best for y’all! Good luck and love the videos! 😇👏
So glad you are ok Nate! Thank you for sharing your experience...it could help others.
THATS A U Problem and                  i feel ur pain
Nate, I’m so glad you’re ok Brother !!! I’m also glad you went in for a checkup !!! Kara, you’re a trooper being strong for Nate !!! You’re love, commitment and how you have each other’s backs during times like this is so incredible. I don’t comment much, but you’re both one of my favourite couples and I’m so glad you have each other in your life. Blessings and big love 💕
Basal elk is very common and mohs procedure is fine to get it out …it’s not really a bad surgery….glad it wasn’t melanoma
I'm about too cry. 😢
Why did you say something move and say something for the first 3 lines in the video
Hi Kara and Nate! PLEASE hear me out!!  Your skin is your biggest organ, and your first line of immune defense. When your body detoxes, it shows through your skin. Sunscreen has MANY carcinogenic ingredients like benzene, homosalate, octinoxate(these are all hormone disrupters and endocrine system disrupters). Your skin absorbs 60% of what you put on it, and when you have an over accumulation of chemicals/toxins in your body, one of the first places you are going to see it is on your skin. And these chemicals in sunscreen go into your bloodstream and cause all sorts of inflammation in your cells. When the sun reacts to the chemicals on your skin, it can(and mostly does in many people) cause skin cancer. My dad had skin cancer at 25 and he had to stop eating fast food, sugar and wearing sunscreen, and he healed his skin cancer and he is now 48 with absolutely no problems. I am studying to be a certified nutritional therapist life coach right now and the BEST way to keep your body from getting skin cancer again is to find a company that has very clean sunscreen with only natural ingredients( I LOVE “Crunchie” sunscreen! It works so well and it is all natural! No bad ingredients!) and go very lean on the sugar content in your diet bc sugar also disrupts normal cell function and causes inflammation that breaks down your immune system and causes an inability to detox from toxins you pick up in the environment and stuff you take in through food! Adding in high quality and very nutrient dense fruits and vegetables, help produce vitamins/minerals in your body that naturally protect your skin from the UV Rays that are harmful to you(bc the sun is AMAZING for you, but you need to be able to synthesize it correctly to receive the benefits). Barley Green is AMAZING and is so high in antioxidants which cause inflammation to heal, thus problems like skin cancer start to heal!Juice Plus is also an AMAZING company that produces super high quality fruit and veggie capsules that have so much nutrients that you wouldn’t normally get in your day to day diet. vitamin C and E work together amazingly to protect your skin and use the sun rays for your good! So you could add in high quality supplements and fruits and veggies to prevent and heal your skin from cancer even more! Also high quality meats help you absorb the nutrients in veggies and supplements. I love watching your guys channel and I hope the absolute best for you both-so I wanted to share what I’ve seen heal so many people in the past!
Don't worry we're here with you
I wish I could have experienced what it was like to have someone love me as much as Kara loves Nate when I was younger.   Nate is so blessed.
U wanted to share it with us because u wanted views 😆
Typing this before 1 minute into the video …🥺🤍🙏🏼sending love and light your way & healthier days ahead 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
So much camera work for the opening scene
You guys are incredibly inspiring. I know what it's like to have health issues. I wish the best to both of you as you continue to have exciting adventures. I'm glad Nate will be alright. Hugs.
Good to hear the great favorable results!!! I also truly appreciate what you said in the beginning about the ongoing desire and temptation to compare personal life to what we see on social media. This especially is dangerous for those that are not aware aka young ppl / teenagers! I shared your video to my daughter so she can have the perspective and message hearing it from you. Happy travels
Lmao well maybe don’t be horrible to donkeys. Love how you make a dramatic video and monetise it. Rest in piss
Youre lucky. Its not nice having to have things cut out of you, but basal cell carcinoma is a walk in the park compared to melanoma. Ive had basal cell cancers cut out of my arms and legs, no problem. But one day i found a melanoma on my upper thigh and it really changes everything. Its the deadliest form of skin cancer. Good on you for posting this. People need to be reminded to check their skin and do their own research just in case you get a Dr who tells you not to worry about it. If YOU know what a melanoma looks like that gives you power to prevent yourself from being a victim of bad medical advice. Its easy to google the signs of melanoma. If youre wrong about it, awesome! If you are right, like I was, youve potentially saved your own life.
Now imagine getting a surprise cancer diagnosis and then the shocking hospital bill to treat it. 'Murica!
So glad you are well, Kara is a wonderful person to have on your side. Stay blessed, we love you both. Keep doing what you are doing, you are the best. Canada welcomes you………🤗🇨🇦
So glad he is okay. This is a reminder for everyone to truly live their life and do as much as they can because you never know when your last day on earth is. God bless.
Cool as read
Get Well Soon, Capt Handsome!✌️🤩😎🤘
LOOOOOOOOVE you TWO, even MORE now!!!
L. Weak genetics
In the realm of cancer you’re incredibly fortunate.
So glad you are ok ❤️
Thank you for sharing this. I have always had a scab on the back of my head since I was a kid (I’m now 32) and thought nothing of it. My mom told me that it was a birthmark I scratched off when I got a chicken poc on it and it just never healed.  I’m now going to look into this more and not just take my moms word… she herself succumbed to cancer 6 years ago.
So so sooooo happy for your recovery, Nate! Thanks for sharing this. Love you guys ❤️
Your health is your wealth and Kara is so supportive and sweet.  I love that!! Because i know for me i'm a worrier and she was calming me down watching this! So glad it turned out the way it did and i'm glad Nate did this.
Omg I’m so glad Nate is okay!!! 🧡You are both amazing!   Kara, where did you get your corduroy jacket?? It’s so cute and I want one 💛
1:16    because you can title it this way and try to get lot's of clicks and view's, OBVIOUSLY...., you should not exploit thing like this just for your benefit.
I am a 3 time Cancer survivor....2 time Covid survivor...what I've learned as we take these stresses....is to just....BREATHE.....to listen to our body...to be vulnerable....it ain't easy son...I'm 61 Nate..I had my first  surgery at 17 and I'm still here!!!
Hey Nate, thank you for sharing such a personal story of your recent and worrisome diagnosis of skin cancer. My family and I want to just share our simple support and love. "Thankful treatment is being successful" By the way I traveled back and forth from Erbil, Kurdistan Iraq. Only a handful I imagine would ever be able to see Kurdistan as you all have. You have found your ninch, and thankful that you are sharing it with the world. One of my favorite vids of yours(y'alls)... for sure. Bahala na kabayan
glad to hear that you are safe
Nate, I am so glad you are free and clear of cancer! I look forward to seeing you and Kara every week
Nate, my prayers are with you. I am so glad they removed all of the cancer. I am currently dealing with breast cancer, so I  know the feelings that come up with the diagnosis of cancer. It is scary, but Kara and you handled it well.
So glad all is well. Stay healthy speedy recovery for your boo-boo. We all love you both and are in our prayers 🙏  All is well.  Take good care of each other ❤
I've had Mohs surgery two previous times for Basil Cell cancer on my nose.  This summer during my annual physical they did a biopsy, and it has returned on a different spot on my nose, so I have Mohs surgery scheduled again at Mayo Clinic in November.  Please don't be concerned, since Basil Cell cancer does not spread to other parts of the body, and is most likely a result of a lifetime of sun on the body.  Just a fact of life, and modern medicine can take care of it most appropriately.  And in time after the bandages are off it should be impossible to tell it was ever there.  And congratulations on your honesty of admitting your medical problem and reminding everyone to always wear appropriate sunscreen when outside.
Oh Nate, you are strong and will pull through this, much love to you and Kara. Praying for you 🙏
Hi Kara, before even watching this video I actually bought a “daggy” (that’s Australian for dorky) wide brimmed hat because you make it look so cool and I know I have not been being sun safe! Living most of my life in Australia and then Colorado, I spend a lot of time outdoors and have had 5 skins concerns removed (before the age of 30). In Australia we say slip, slop, slap, seek and slide! That’s an Australian advertisement for sun safety :-)
Thanking God for the divine report of you being cancer free Nate…keeping y’all in prayer while you both continuing living joyfully bold and healthy🤩.
at least he is ok love you guys ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜😄
I know that's hard stuff to share. Thanks for trusting enough to be vulnerable with us. SO happy that you are cancer free and healthy!
First technoblade and now you oh my God I hope you do well

Nate and Kara... I woke up to watch a few more of your adventures, and saw this.... So, I'm going to share one of mine with you. 2017, (popular year), I found a big, mole, like, bump on my right bicep. Poked around and it hurt.. so I did what everyone does,.. I ignored it, for AWHILE. It started to hurt more, then, turned black. All my friends were yipping at me to go to the doctor...so, I go. The PA looks at it quickly and tells me not to worry about it, it's perfectly normal. Happens with age. .... But, I know. I have a long background in the medical field, and I KNOW. Within two months, it grew larger and another small one popped up beside it. Well, CRAP. I go back to the Dr, and I demand to see her, not the PA. She took one look at my arm, and, I swear to you, her face fell off. I actually said.."Never play poker!". She tried to regroup and reassure me, but, we both knew, now. Since I am seeing this video after the fact, you know full well what happens next and how fast it all happens. Stage 3 Melanoma with a satellite growth. Rush to UPMC Hillman for a thousand tests, see an oncologist, schedule a stress test and surgery. Flunk the stress test, get a stint on my birthday. Ten days later, surgery and a mammoth chunk of my arm is gone. (Looks like a shark bite.) Then.. one full year of chemo, every other day. Clearly, I'm still here. It was nasty, God awful and I wanted to quit every single day. Some things they don't mention when you join this exclusive club... You are never, in their eyes, cancer free. You just presents as "No cancer evident". You have to get tested A LOT. Every six months, you need a CT and labs..... For five years. It's the first thing you have to tell every doctor you see for the rest of your life. 🤢You have to avoid the sun during it's peak hours and bathe in sunscreen. You have to have paperwork on you to advise others of your previous condition.🤮But the biggest pain in the ass, that I have found, it how everyone you know now treats you just a little bit differently. It's always there and they are always looking for signs that it's back.  Guys, don't let any of it shake you. Find a way, between the two of you, that you always respond to these. You really do have to have a sense of humor. It throws them. They all expect sadness and despair. I made it an ongoing joke.... And it's still going. My daughter hates it, but, I have to have control of this thing or it will take me down. You have each other and your whole YouTube community. We got this. If you ever need to talk, I'm right here.  Be safe, be good to each other, be happy. Carry on.... All my Love and Prayers.... Priscilla
First and foremost, I’m so happy you’re going to be okay and that you were able to share this story. Second, you should move to Italy full-time because that’s where you two seem happiest. ❤️
Celery juice. Medical Medium Anthony Williams. You can heal yourself with a plant based alkaline diet. Wishing you all the best.
I am so glad to hear that you are ok Nate. Kara, I am so proud of you and your strength for Nate. What makes a great man is a great woman standing next to him! Much love to you two.❤
A few years ago, there was a chemical ingredient allowed in sunscreens sold over the counter in Canada but not (at all) in the US.  It made the sunscreen stronger.  Honestly can't remember its name.  Anyone know it?  Seemed to us that if it was good enough for Canada it was good enough for us.  Good you're going up there.  Ask around.  Oh, and you won't need to sneak it across the border.
Ouch dude
hope for the best for you and your family. you guys are great and i love seeing your videos. 🥰
You shouldn’t post fake news like this for views and money it’s not fair cancer should be taken more seriously treat it with respect with people who have actually got it so angry about this you dick heads
Omg Nate 🥺🥺🥺prayers to you I’m so sad to hear this may you be blessed with. Speedy recovery 💕💕💕💕prayers to you and Kara
Thanks for sharing! Your message is very important because we see influencers and those in the entertainment business and assume their life is great!  That said, we are all going through something in one way or the other...
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙌🙌
'youngest patient of the year award' 😂😂 bless your heart :-) I understand how scary and difficult this experience was for you all. So happy for the great news!!! Much love to you all!!!
I just love how much you love each other 🥺❤️ its like the perfect match
Good News, glad it worked out in your favor !
God bless you 🙏🏻
Glad they got your cancer out!
blend 4-6 pomegranates with alot of water each day,  also eat pints of wild berries
Thank you for frankness in talking not only about cancer but also about mental health. X
My prayers and thoughts are with you.
Wishing you both good health 🙏🏻❤️
Wow.  Good health to you young man
So glad to hear that Nate is alright! Thank you for being so vulnerable in front of us all and open about the struggle you're going through 🧡
I don't know you and I've never seen your videos before!  But i hope u wellness and healthy life .. get better soon 💪
I have a 7 year old son who if he had his way would spend all day on YouTube. As we always do, we watched this video as a family. Sharing this side of your life took courage and helped us reinforce our message to our son that its not all Rosie on YouTube. I am sure it wouldn’t have been easy to throw the drone up and speak to camera when you would have been naturally worried about the outcome. Thank you!
Wear your sunscreen mister. Love every esthetician fan of y’all’s rn lol.
No worries buddy... Wishing speedy recovery from India... I'm actually an atheist but I'd pray from my heart for you to be all full of Josh again..)
having had skin cancer my self I appreciate your sharing your story. I think people often brush it off as ohh it "just" skin cancer. The emotions that go with it are hard and being awake is weird. I had to have a reconstructive surgery with mine as well it was so weird driving from the derm place to the hospital with a huge hole in my face. You sharing your story makes me think harder about sharing my story as well. Aww man I didn't get to eat that day because they had to put me under for my reconstruction. Sun Screen is a life saver. I'm so happy your cancer free right now.
I wasn't sure if I had the heart to watch the video. I didn't want to think that you are human too and humanly things can happen to you! But I finally got the courage to watch today and I am really so relieved that you are ok . So proud of both of you.
I love you guys and watch your show all the time. Me and my family’s prayers are with you. Please be a voice for cancer prevention and cancer cure .   Life gives us all an opportunity to do something big and make a difference.   Stay positive and stay strong 💪🏽
This is such an important video, and I'm so glad it will be seen by so many young adults. You were lucky and good for Kara for making you get checked out. She loves her travel partner, and you two need to be together. Take care of each other, quick healing and safe travels.
I am pretty sure. I have skin cancer. I have also decided not to medical attention.
I too had skin cancer on my face. It was no problem. I, unfortunately, have now been faced with leukemia for the past 6 years. I am ok, I’ve got this, and so do you. I’m older, almost 60 (gasp, how did that happen!?) so the leukemia didn’t come as quite of a shock as the skin cancer did at 23. Take care.
Dealt with a couple of rounds of basal cell.  One on my left ear, the other in my right eyebrow.  MOHS surgeon did a great job, but it was really sensitive for weeks afterwards.  Had to sleep only on my right side for several weeks.  Had to change the dressing on my left ear (I'm right handed) every day for weeks.  You may want to see about sleeping in a recliner or something like that for a while to keep the overnight swelling down.
Lost my dad to skin cancer (melanoma) when I was 3 years old. I had my 21st birthday yesterday it’s been 18 years and I’m still healing there nothing more painful than losing someone you love. Don’t let these things go unnoticed. And like Kara said at the end always wear spf. Glad to see everyone is okay this is a mere bump in the road for all your adventures.
You guys are my favorite vloggers. Glad that you're alright! Love you guys!
Watch Emily Hayward she died after being "cancer free". Death is comin'.
Okay
Massive kudos to you Nate (and Kara for keeping calm)! Unbelievably brave of you not only to go through but to share it with the world too. I have no doubt that this will have reached, touched and helped so many people. All the best with the recovery and upcoming adventures, lots of love from the UK 👍🏻✌🏻
I'm in it with you 😉😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Thnk you for this.  MAKE SURE YOUR SUNSCREEN IS ORGANIC
What's with them haters disliking the video 😔😔
Another cancer survivor
Stay Strong brother.  You’re still here amd that is important.
Been having this stuff cut off me since I was 40 am 67n now.  Keep doing the checks, and if you see something suspicious go in early.  Sunscreen up, and keep letting me share your experiences on You Tube.
Congrats to you both. Thanks for doing the video it was very brave of you.
Thanks for sharing.  Hoping for your speedy recovery Nate. Then on to your next adventures.
I go for cancer screenings once a year, I started back in January of 2020. The reason for that is because I have Lynch Syndrome which means I have a higher risk of getting some cancers. My dad also has Lynch Syndrome and he had colon cancer years ago , my dad's brothers and a sister all died from cancer and my 1st cousin also died from cancer,  they all had Lynch Syndrome. My older brother also tested to see if he had Lynch Syndrome and he did not. My dad was upset when i got my Lynch Syndrome results but i told my dad that it is fine I am glad to know I have it so I can make sure i get cancer screenings every year.
I am happy you are ok Nate stay safe <3
So glad you are ok. Cancer is scary. Please look after yourself
I've had MOHS several times I know how scary it can be.  Good advice on wearing SPF I didn't when I younger and I'm paying for it now.
What a joke, "I have skin cancer", also "includes paid promotion"
I'm so glad you're okay. Thank you for being so brave and sharing your story. 💖
I didn't know what to do when I saw this video. I just had to pause. I pray nothing else happens in the future.
Well done such a scary process, hope you are back going soon
John 3:16 "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.🆗
I’m so happy all is good! Hugs
How can I like a video multiple times! You guys have encouraged me to go out and try things I usually wouldn’t and it’s amazing you’re willing to share this part of your lives with us! So thank you! Health issues shouldn’t be put down so I’m happy you’re putting this out here. Hopefully it’ll encourage others to pay attention to their skin and take things seriously!
It’s heart wrenching but I’m so proud of you Nate, for talking about this. And damn Kara, you’re the best wife he could’ve asked for♥️
Glad you're cancer free nate. Keep on keeping on. Cheers to more adventures.
Sometimes it is better to take the time to heal instead of worrying about where to place the camera
Thank you for sharing this Nate.  Take care of yourself, both of you!
I’m lowkey sad this was not a collab with dr. pimple popper, but i’m glad nate is ok 🥰
I am so thankful that your alright. My husband and I watch you and Kara every day! I've seen some episodes several times! ❤ We love you and will pray that you heal quickly!
Love watching your channel. quick recovery and best wishes for you both
Glad that worked out Big Nate.
Hi was really worried but glad your fine really looking forward to seeing your next video keep safe 😷👍🏻
Kara, you are allowed to worry! Cancer is cancer, you can never have a good cancer! I have thyroid cancer, I was diagnosed when I was 15 and I found you guys when I was in the hospital. You guys have inspired me to travel once I become a registered nurse and help people in developing countries. I am so happy you shared your story as I feel more connected with you guys more. So thank you. Stay strong, you’ve got this! So proud with everything you had to go through! I love you guys so much!
So you just have random cameras set up all throughout the house regularly? Lol Glad your ok.
About ten years ago I had a suspicious erratic mole removed after a similar situation - the results suggested it could have been troublesome - but owing to the due diligence of my Dr, who removed it and the surrounding flesh in his surgery, It has given me no further difficulty. I had another weird skin anomaly removed about six years later off my eyebrow that proved to me of no concern.  Congrats on the positive outcome, and just keep an eye on things, and make sure that you pay attention on anything unusual.
Glad You’re Ok! Greatings from Lithuania =]
Cannabis oil/cream cures it easy.
Will you visit the province of Quebec?
I’m so glad that they got it all, I’m glad I came to the comments first. My brother was diagnosed with metastatic malignant melanoma in December. He had the cancer removed, did radiation and is now on a chemo pill but is currently showing no new signs of cancer. 🙌🏻🙌🏻
Thank God he is cured now...after seeing the cover of video I was like 😱😱😱😱.. May god bless you with long life..take care of your self Nate and Kara...love from india
You did others a huge on promoting not only mental health but cancer , especially SKIN CANCER. Be well and be safe 🙏
Oh man I'm glad to hear you two are ok may many blessings fall upon you and your family
My heart just dropped reading the heading. 💔 Stay strong, stay happy Nate! Love from Bangladesh. 🇧🇩 Lots of prayers for you!
🎉 I cried happy tears for you today nate... omg you must of been so scared so glad all sorted now.. kara you look after Nate so well ❤💙
Hi Guys. Thank you for sharing with the world. It is SCARY AS HECK when you hear 'cancer'. As a fellow "basal celler" :-) I completely understand. I've had 5 Mohs procedures so far. Yeah. So far. A fellow patient waiting with me the first time was a doctor. I keep remembering her comment: "If this is my cancer, I'll take it. It's an easy one" (not that things work that way :-( )  This is the caution: One diagnosis is a warning. Get checked regularly and quickly when you're suspicious. I had a similar experience (and location) for my first one. Getting it out made a big hole :-(  But, like you, all is well in the end. Also a warning to be even more rigorous about sunscreen, hats and other protection while having adventures outdoors.  Oh, and congrats on the one and done cycle (nobody wants the later rounds) But for your audience, the point of Mohs procedures is that they actually expect to NOT get it all the first time. This is to minimize the damage while ensuring they get it all. It is quite common to repeat 2-3 cycles on the day of surgery as the lab finds a little bit left and the surgeon goes back to get that part. Sucks but better than making a bigger hole.
You need a strong advocate/partner during times like these.  Kara is ur angel.
I noticed the band-aid on Nate’s head in one the of last videos (treehouse getaway) and was wondering what happened. I’m glad to hear things turned out the way they did and it is not as bad as it could have been. Thank you for sharing this video about something more personal! That’s not easy to do. Stay positive and keep doing what you love!
First of all, Thank you for sharing your journey with us. It is not easy to be so open with so many people about a very scary health issue. Secondly, I am so happy you will be ok and are now cancer free! Please know how much we love you both and are sending positive thoughts and prayers for quick healing. Continue to take care of each other! 💕
Title Update: "I had Skin Cancer"
UV-C is everywhere now. Yes.. the cancer causing by inactivating DNA. This due to our weakenedmagnetosphere, due to the many solar cycles weakening and giving us the Grand Solar Minimum at present. This is why the microorganisms and so many things are mutating as well. Part of long cycles of life on earth. But currently being blamed on CO2 and people, rather than the sun. Other planets flip their atmospheres during this period. No people.
Best wishes from Canada.
Congrats!!!
My heart just dropped like the ball on New Years Eve.
I am glad that your cancer was not malignant.  I hope you get better soon.
I was diagnosed with Stage III Melanoma just last week. Surgery in 2 days!🤞  PS -Best of luck to Nate and everyone else having health issues 💕
so glad you're ok! I had a Mohs procedure on my forehead to cut out a basal cancer at 34. Always wear sunscreen!
Thanks for the news this will make me carefull ...
Kevin from the office had skin cancer too
Thanks for sharing some of the private parts of your lives.  Very happy to hear that things went so well!
Hey good for you guys that is great news.  Also I'd like to say crying is it's own form of Strength and is a sign of a very strong inner core.
oh no!
I am so glad to hear Nate will be fine, I love you guys,  you both are adorable! Blessings!!!🙏🙏🙏
me, who has had a scab on my finger for a couple years after hearing this:
Clickbaity shit Title : I have cancer  Me: I have no fucks to give thumbs down
I'm so happy that you don't have cancer
I had cancer 7 years ago and every time I go back to the doctor I feel some trepidation.
Gotta say kinda scared me reading the title of your video! So EXTREMELY happy for you both that Nate is “all clear!” God Bless you both and continued health and LOTS of happy travels!! Thanks so much for sharing with us! ❤️
Thanks for sharing your story. I didn’t know about skin cancer on the ears!  Good to know.
my husband and I both have had Mohs surgery, at different times, and there were no problems..
"Just pretend you're at the dentist!" Oh THAT wonderful happy place, ah just floating away...to the dentist and the sound of that drill lol. Happy everything turned out alright! I work with lots of patients who have all forms of bone and skin cancer so I was happy to hear that summary up front and able to watch the rest of the video without nearly as much worry as I otherwise would have!
liar
So glad you're doing well. I also had BCC removed this summer at 34. One round of the MOHS procedure for me as well. Never think it will happen to you until it does! Wishing you all the best!
Good to hear you are cancer free. People need to take any changes in their body seriously and see a doctor.   Been there, done that. Hardest part for me is not letting my 10 yr old son know I had cancer. He was already having issues and I did not want him to worry. They cut me from front to back to remove part of my kidney but 5 years later and I am still cancer free. 👍🏼
Thank you for sharing. And I really apreciate your work. Bless you💗 much love💜
I highly recommend you guys to watch dr.joe dispenza , it will help.
So much emotions 💜 I'm so glad to hear that you are recovering. Thank you for a real and raw video and for all the other amazing ones too!
I mean at least your not me ( I have a brain tumor)
Omg hop you get better
Praying for you.
Wishing you a speedy recovery. My sister had the same type of cancer removed from her hairline in August. Be prepared for your head to be numb for 6-8 weeks and for random sharp shooting pain.
Why did this make me so nervous!!!!! Glad everything’s ok 💗
So thankful you are cancer free! All the best to you both!
I am so thankful that you've been seen and you are now cancer free Nate <3
I AM SO HAPY THAT Nate is ok, I love your channel so much.  Stay safe and healthy!
ONE THING MORE... NEVER GET IODINE (EVEN THE FUMES) NEAR YOUR EYES... I'M NOT A DOCTOR I AM ONLY TELLING YOU  MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH BASIOL CELL CANCER.... IF YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO IT IS NO BIG DEAL... I SURFED FOR YEARS... WHEN I FOUND OUT I HAD CANCER I WAS TERRIFIED JUST LIKE THESE POOR PEOPLE.. NOW WHEN I GET ONE IT'S NO MORE THAN GETTING A SCRATCH OR A CUT...  OH YEAH ONE MORE.. ONE MORE THING ... THE CANCER DOES NOT COME BACK... YOU MIGHT GET ANOTHER ONE SOMEWHERE ELSE BUT ONCE TREATED TO COMPLETION IT'S GONE FOR EVER ! AND NO SCAR AT ALL...
I too had a basal cell skin cancer removed from the top of my head. 19 staples for a dime size lesion because the skin doesn’t stretch on the scalp. I have also lost a part of my ear to a very deep basal cell. The great news is that it is basal cell.
My father has had skin cancer too, and he’s doing fine. Real healthy.  Just keep taking care of yourself! We all love you 💜✨ I’m so glad you are on the mend !
Guys! Glad it turned out the way it did. That time period waiting on results is so heavy
surprising.  he is so young.  my dad had two  remmmovved.  gguess you need more uv blocking hats..    watch out beecause i hear sunscreen is bad for you now
Thank you for sharing. Am thrilled you are over this hurdle. Stay well and positive ; - ) xxx
My favorite food is gun
Good
Godbless you brother 🖤
Hugs, Nate! My mother in law has had a few basil cells and she’s fine, otherwise. All she’s had to do is have them excised. I know that’s uncomfortable. I’ve had cancer before (20 year survivor of non-Hodgkin’s), so I’ve been bled, cut into and all of that jazz. You will be fine. God bless!!
L
So glad you shared the suspenseful times as well as the planned adventures. Glad all is well
Nate, I understand how you feel. I had a melanoma removed from my temple this year. Now, I don't want to be in direct sunlight at all. My doctor told me to use zinc oxide, and I don't like it, so I try and stay covered up when I am in the sun. If it wasn't for my wife, I would become nocturnal.
SO GLAD it's just a Basal Cell. After being a Sun Wrokshipper my whole life I had two BCs removed after 45 years old which makes me really lucky. I know wear Hat, SPF and Sunprotecting clothing. Best to both of you!
I’m praying for yall
This caption was probably the most shocking of all.. My heart just dropped.. Glad that you are fine..and as your wise grandfather says, keep that crown of good health high up and strong.. God bless you❤️
lame video.
All the very best! Good luck!
My mom is dealing with this on her nose an same situation. It sucks but it’s the easiest one to remove, glad your clear!
💪💪💪
I'm happy you are doing well... my husband isxa white boy like you and got scuped on like yours from the nose.
Good health is a crown on a well man's head that only the sick can see.  Love this quote
So glad he is ok!👍🏻
I had melanoma in situ skin cancer on my face.  They removed it and basically told me I had between 1 to 5 years as it is aggressive cancer, that was 4 years ago.  I see a dermatologist a few times a year and he says it was in situ and they got it all so stay out of the sun and whoever told me I had a year was wrong. Yeah it has been 4 years so easy to say lololo
Your skin is like that, everyone whos a doctors knew you had skin cancer
He guys, just to let you know I’ve seen your video, appreciating your honesty and openness. Glad you’re ok! Wishing you both all the best and good health and luck! Loving your videos.
Don’t physically know you guys but I’m so happy to find out you’re ok. I will keep you both in my prayers and Keep Living Life to the FULLEST…
That is a beautiful quote, and I am glad that Nate went and got the help to be CANCER FREE!! I will have you, Nate, and Kara in my prayer list. This moment showed me the importance for praying for others, even if we might think they might not need it, but prayer is always needed. Kara, I am so proud of you for being brave, strong, and supportive for Nate because I can't imagine the fear he might have been going through, you both. Thank you both for being open and vulnerable with us. It honestly makes me feel like I have two amazing, beautiful friends telling me about the beauty of life and the wonders of this earth. <3
hey man get well soon
"I'm Cancer free" is a sentence I've wanted to say since 2012 when I was 15/16 hahaha.   Luckily mine is also a fairly quiet lump in my pelvis, and a Paraganglioma so very rare too (thank god I had that one instead of neuro blastoma as that is much more aggressive, and I've seen it its horrible to have). They tried to operate on it but it was vascular (Latched onto a main artery) so wasn't successful. In the succeeding years I've done two different types of Radiotherapy to suppress it, one half of my family was gene tested and they found the same tumour in my sister and Dad but not in the rest of those tested I think, they then had theirs removed with vascular problems but still successfully.   So I'm still stuck with mine, and I entirely get what Kara is saying; the medication I take everyday tends to remind me it is still there, but the good news is that its quiet not necessarily benign. In that time though, I got to go to the British Grand Prix and Monaco Grand Prix because of Starlight in the UK AND I've done Undergraduate studies, postgraduate studies and I'm trying to start a filmmaking career out of that education. So I've made a habit at looking at all of the silver linings, and I love your sunny content as well. This one to me was especially relatable.
Get well soon Nate! May god bless you with good health
You guys are too energetic we love you so much
Guys take a rest...You guys are strong ❤️
You faced your fears and were brave.  Glad the procedure is behind you.  And thank you for sharing this.
Sending good health and happiness to you! 🤍
Glad you are Ok!
Honestly, if you HAVE to get a cancer of any kind, skin cancer is typically the best you could get.
I saw this, and when I woke up I watched it (second time watching it), and my heart sank. I love watching you two so much, I’ve thoroughly enjoyed watching your journey over the years, thank the lord Nate, you’re ok! ❤️❤️ Kara, you did such a good job staying strong for him. We love you Nate!
when i saw the title i cried
I am soooooo relieved to know that Nate is ok...... Take care of yourself and get back on the adventures soon.....  I am  a big fan from India....I lobe watching you two.....the lobe the understanding the dedication the involvement is just another level....  it feels like I know you two for ao long.....  Will be hoping to get a heart from you and have a chance to chat....  take care of yourself....
You both are an adorable sweet couple and super supportive to each other 🙂 glad your all ok and keep strong always
Don’t die 🤝
Not very funny to make a (sponsored) clickbait out of such a serious topic. Disgusting, to be honest.
My mother had skin cancer two times and she did ok!!!! Wishing the best for your nate
I am very glad you are going to be ok
MY HEART DROPPED TO MY BUTT when i read the title . I am so glad that you are both ok .
I will include you in my Prayers .......and always remember a cebuano like me from Philippines Cares people like u and Never Loose Hope sir Nate .......only God Knows for our Future and God Bless u and ms Kara !!!!!
😳🥺🙂😉😃😁😄
So relieved 🥺❤️❤️❤️ take care guys ❤️
happy you're doing well Nate, definitely great news. take care guys.
Why did it unsub me first... second I have it also but it's not so bad. I have to have mine taken out all the time...
I’m glad everything worked out and you’re fine. That’s awesome. Glad you put out the video as well. I have had a type of pre skin cancer for 10 years now on my face. I have to get it frozen off once a year, which sucks   But yeah I do wear sunscreen all the time now. Again glad everything is ok. Looking forward to seeing your Canadian videos
good
Keep being safe and shining, guys! ❤❤
I’ve been binge watching your vlogs for the past few weeks-simply awesome guys! They have kept me thoroughly entertained. I feel like I’ve been on your adventures with you. But when I saw this on my feed my heart crashed for you guys - now I’m feeling emotionally happy for you! So relieved for you both xx
Your an amazing wife kara.. so chuffed nate it 100% heathly and cancer free.xxx
Fantastic news for you, Nate! Happy for you, bud.
Stay strong Nate <3
So happy to hear the good news about Nate. Let’s hope for a long, healthy future for you both xx
K. I don't care my dude U do u
Wow 😮 did not expect this. So happy you went and got it checked, removed and are well now. I discovered an innocent tiny mole on my husband ear, got it checked - melanoma. They removed it and reconstructed his ear. We’re thankful we were proactive and got it checked. Be proactive with your help people!! 🙌🏼
Thank you guys for posting this and sharing this.  My boyfriend of 6 years passed away a month ago while we were in the Bahamas, and since then I've been depressed and slightly jealous of other couples. This video was a huge much needed reality check. I was feeling alone, like I was the only person experiencing bad things like this at 25 years old.. As I was scrolling down my feed I saw this video n my mouth dropped open so wide. I was so hurt for you guys. My boyfriend and I started traveling alot and after I graduated in 2023 the plan was to take a year off get married and travel like you guys..  I'm glad you are ok Nate. Thank you for sharing. ❤
get wrecked scrub
get wrecked scrub
🙏much love and prayers 🤕
I'm just thankfull you didn't need months of chemotherapy. Many can be completely fine after and then many like me get left with permanent damages. Hasn't been a day in 6 years I don't still wake up feeling like a hellraiswr victim. But no Hodgkins lymphoma anymore. Just glad to hear you were able to get help and treatment eve  through covid.
You remember that video where Kara showed all the 'not pretty' side of living in the van where she admitted to washing the coffee pot with only water? This video too I value the most, just like that one. Thank you for speaking so openly about something so personal. This is thousandfold from the previous video yet again, so needed. People grow with you and these fears are real, become real. And some people are alone through it and don't know anyone else that went through it. I am happy you are on the mend <3 Be safe and sun screen is nice and all but BIG good hats are even better <3
Thanks for sharing, by making Nate's illness public, it helps to remind others take care of what can seem at the time to be a minor problem! I am very glad Nate is doing better
I am glad he is fine. Will pray for your good health Nate. Take care and have a great life ahead.
Lots of strength and prayers for you guys 🙏♥️
I miss those days that you came to kurdistan, i want to see you again❤️
I have albinism and I had that type of skin cancer in 2006. When my doctor did my biopsy I noticed it didn’t heal. I was very upset when my doctor told me about my skin cancer. So far so good. Please use sun screen or a hat with us protection. That’s what I should have done way before my diagnosis due to no pigment. I glad you’re ok.
I am glad Nate is free of cancer and thanks for sharing. I am grateful you have shared such a personal issue which has helped me in a small way to remember I am not on my own. Nate's grandfather's quote is so true. Never take health for granted it is so fragile.
Glad you’re fine. Stay blessed.
Had the same, a couple of times, and it's scary at the beginning but it's a treatable diagnosis and just wear hats and sunscreen.  You'll be all good!
Happy that Nate is cancer free . I've been. Looking for your Massachusetts trip can't find it  😑  And do you a vlog of Hawaii I'm planning a trip in December and would love to watch your videos before I go ..  Thanks 😊
Prayers for you 🙏❤️
So brave of you both to share this. Thank you for your honesty, we really appreciate realistic and personal videos as this one. <3
So relieved to hear the good news, so happy for you guys 🤩🤩🤩🤩
I started watching you guys not so long ago but you are my all time favorite you tubers and you are so inspirational and I started crying when I read the title and I'm so thankful you are cancer free. And I hope you recover well. Please keep us updated.     Kara please take good care of Nate thanks. I know you are strong and brave you can get throgh anything it's just a little bump in the road you will get throgh this we all belive in you and we will pray for you we all love you ❤
Some of the best youtubers/content creators are here! We're so glad Nate is doing great. Health is wealth indeed.
Its survivable as long as you don't try to go that whole "homeopathic" route.
Very great full to know you are ok.god bless you.love from Bangladesh.
Please be in The hands of JESUS CHRIST.I wish you both well,and love your adventures.
"Didn't know if this was something I wanted to share" as you vlog the entire process hahaha such a blatant lie but no worries glad you're better
Kara and Nate.  I started watching you guys a few months ago.  I've been deployed in the Middle East and was looking for something that could get me away from all of the hustle and bustle.  I used it as sort of a countdown until I get home to see my wife and kids before we go on our adventures.  I noticed the bandage when you went to kiss Kara good morning in the tree house video and wondered if you banged your head, or if you had a procedure done.  It now makes sense.  I'm so glad that you were able to take care of a potentially serious issue before it got to a point where it could be serious.  I look forward to your upcoming videos, and I'll definitely have my wife watch your channel with me.  I know she's going to LOVE it.
So glad to hear that! No relation with you guys but I wiped tears when heard that Nate is okay! Take love from Bangladesh! ❤️ 🇧🇩 Hope you will visit our country again someday!
Any surgry is a worry, you just have to hope for the best and statstics are on your side so lets hope that's the end of it :)
Praying for you Nate your videos have inspired everyone so keep a positive thought.
I remember my dad having skin cancer but a worse one luckily he got it found and out quick.
Such a roller coaster worth of emotions! Glad to hear Nate is cancer free!

God blessed you from Pakistan
I’m so sorry that you have skin cancer 🥺
Where you going in Canada? what city? area? If you are going in the Montreal area or if you need to know what to visit let me know
stay strong nate we all love you
Good job Nate!
You literally click bated us you don’t have cancer anymore so the title should be “I had cancer”
Waiting for results is a stomach churning experience with butterflies and hoping nothing to dramatic.
I hope you guys (especially considering all the shots) will practice intensive self care - super nutritious good organic foods and lots of clean filtered water!!!!  ROCK ON!!!
Thank you for sharing... this is such a great reminder for us all. You sharing your story will help to save someone's life.❤ Love that you share your real life with us... so many people struggling out there and they are able to see that There is hope and help out there. Stay safe K&N❣
Stay Strong Nat !!!  It takes alot of gut to bring it up, let alone bringing it up for the world to know and then going thru it.  Letting the world know that it ain't all glitz and bling 24 x 7 x 365.  That's something i truly like about you guys.  Get well soon Nat !!  Kara, such an amazing supportive wife!!  As you would always say it in your vids, WOO HOO !!
I love my pitbull he has a white coat his brother who got adopted got skin cancer whit colored dogs and horse get often skin cancer there is a lot of sunscreen maybe y'all could help and get the word out most vet suck at this and only if a pet has signs they bring it up
I'm so happy for you. God is blessing you. Thank God for his hands on you. Stay up Kara and Nate. Your awesome😊
I had a skin cancer cell between my toes it was so painful the removal I kicked that handsome medic I will never get over that embarrassing
So much drama for such a minor incident……….Been there, done that many times.  Now, if it had been melanoma, then the drama would be justified.
I'm 46 grew up on a farm never used sunscreen I don't know if it would've made a difference well I was diagnosed with skin cancer I can't talk bout it glad you're ok
You guys are amaziiinggggg
Nobody gets into Heaven without accepting JESUS CHRIST, REPENT & believe in the gospel and you will be saved. Ppl think that satan is some ugly,scary,evil looking creature NOT true the devil comes to you disguised as an “angel of light” and everything that you want JUST to capture your heart and deceive you…yes Satan is pure Evil so he is smart he knows how to come into your life to distract you from the TRUTH and the truth is that JESUS CHRIST Loves you and he is knocking at door to your heart . He wants to SAVE you from this world,hell ,and God’s wrath which is to come. Don’t wait or hold it off bc NOBODY is promised tomorrow. You could die in Your sleep or on your way to work in the morning in an accident. Life is unpredictable,if you die in your sins without accepting Jesus Christ as your personal Lord & Savior you will be JUDGED and cast into hell(Lake Of Fire) where there will be darkness, weeping ,and gnashing of teeth FOREVER, all eternity. Day & night , your soul will have NO peace & NO rest. Where the flames never quench and the fire never dies….I don’t want that for anybody so I’m here to tell you that I love you & JESUS LOVES YOU ,all he wants is to have an intimate relationship with you. He wants to know you. He wants to SAVE you. God bless you all♥️🙏🏽💯
Love you guys, keep your heads up and bask in gratitude for everything else you have in life!
There are more than 100 videos on my channel, I can't understand how someone gets a million views, and someone won't get a hundred thousand in 2 years «
God is still wit you as well as your number one fan elyse
im so happy with the great news you go Nate and Kara. We love you.
Praying for healing ❤️❤️❤️
<3 Nate
First off, thank you for sharing... not only can those who follow your adventures keep sending good vibes for a speedy recovery, but you never know who just might need a kick in the rear to go get checked for this!!!   We love your adventures, and cannot wait to see more... plus, Nate, while you're healing up, you can rock some awesome hats!   LOL
There are many cheap, effective natural remedies, including Essiac teac, Chaga mushroom, bitter apricot seeds, apple seeds, latrile, baking soda, peroxide therapy, Iscador, Hoxleys method, and others that help fight cancer.
My favorite moment is when Kara hugs Nate and he tells her"you've been so strong for me." And she says "Yeeessss" and he touchea her nose in the most cutest way!! Ughh my heart melted!!💕☺️
Glad you're doing well.
If you're going to get skin cancer Basil Cell is the one to get. I've had them all and squamous cell right on the side of my nose...so I know what your talking about with the smell of burning skin. It's a really emotional experience. So glad you had the least invasive skin cancer
🙏🏻Praise God… he is so good. Bless you both on many many many more journeys. ❤️
You're a great man, Nate. sending all the love. get well and keep as healthy as u can. also, it's people like you that make YouTube a safer, more friendly place so thank you!!!
Great example of why having support from a loved one is so important. Bless you guys!
Happy to hear you are cancer free! You two are amazing!
You are such a warrior Nate and Kara you are the true spirit because faith is something that actually heals a person…so good to know that you are good now 👍👍👍
Can we all agree that when He uploads our day gets better! 💖
I'm glad to hear that you've got it treated in time for it not to have spread. Sadly my dad didn't get his cancer discovered before it was too late and it had spread too much for treatment to help anything. - Keep your eyes open, and don't neglect going to the doctors. 💞
just dont go to the docter
Thank you for sharing this, I am so happy that you are getting through this process with so little complication.
רפואה שלמה!רק ביראות!Speedy recovery, I wish you only good health!
Bless your journey Nate that was hard when you were given different diagnosis but glad it was finally diagnosed; I wish I could tell younger people to be careful of sun or the suntanning machines.....I had similar story for my calf on leg...It is scary at any age.♥
So relieved Nate is ok. Love you guys keep it up. Nate glad you are ok.  ❤️‍🩹
stay safe man!
I'm no longer waiting for the GRANT LOAN because I earn $ 46,700 every 14 days recently
Proud of you Nate !! Hope you guys stay strong 💪🏾 ❤️🙏🏾
❤️❤️
Noooooooo but you guys are my favorite YouTubers
My heart just sank after reading the title. I never comment on anything. But glad he's doing better :)
Yay God is sooo good I’m so happy that Nate is cancer free ♥️♥️♥️♥️
So happy that Nate's going to be fine!!!! On a lighter note, where are you planning to visit in Canada? If ever you are coming to the National Capital region, drop me a line I would love to help you out and love to talk to you about your Everest base camp travel.. I'm thinking of going in a few years.
I'm so glad you are fine..  <3
One day at a time… I was diagnosed with GIST sarcoma 9 yrs ago and have had 4 surgeries and it’s come back again so looking at another coming up . Just keep The faith and keep family close..
So glad everything worked out well.  I really enjoy your videos in particular your optimism for life.  Be well.
and you will be healed soon.
Several years ago, a friend of our family was diagnosed with melanoma, a small cancer spot on his skin that metastasized to the rest of his body. He died five months later. He was 48 years old. I'm so glad that Nate is cancer-free, but this could have turned out much worse. Don't ignore dark spots on your skin, and use sunscreen.
https://youtu.be/cxKKn4kNIP0 glad you’re ok
Hi! I am Mrunal. I am 11 years old.  I watch your videos everyday. Your videos are a-m-a-z-i-n-g.  After seeing this video I was relieved that Uncle Nate is now A-ok. I have a tip that eat a lot of brocolli ( in a limit obviously ) to control the cancer  ❤ from, Mumbai, India
Thank you so much for sharing this! As content creators, you have the perfect platform to spread awareness. Skin cancer caught early is curable! Hopefully others will be inspired to get something concerning checked out. Yearly visits to the dermatologist are crucial for anyone, not just someone who’s had skin cancer. Two years ago at my yearly visit with my dermatologist, he discovered a melanoma! It was caught early, and I am considered cancer free as well. Also important is the daily use of sunscreen for everyone. Just find one that feels nice and you won’t mind wearing. I love the EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46. It is unscented and feels very light. I get it shipped with Amazon subscription every three months so I don’t have to think about it. Btw, please do not listen to those who say sunscreen causes cancer. Speak to your dermatologist if you want specific recommendations. So happy for you, Nate!
Grandpa knew what he was talking about. 💕
Thank you for sharing this. I’m so happy you’re ok 🙏🏻 PS you’ve literally done every challenging terrifying adventure available to humans but you’re afraid of a needle?! ❤️❤️
clickbait
I am so glad Nate is ok and I am sending all the love to both of you
as a life long CA native, I've had enough basal cell cut off of me to keep Hannibal Lecter happy... you'll be fine
Hi guys, I'm from Vietnam. And I love your country very much. please interact with me 🇻🇳❤️🇺🇸
I'm sure you guys are tired of reading comments by now but I thought I would throw in my two cents anyway.  I recently went through a similar scare with skin cancer. Mine was dead center on my clavicle and was diagnosed with malignant melanoma (really bad I guess). I also was able to do a few surgeries and call it good. (God willing) as of Sept 18th I'll be one year cancer free! I tell you this partially to show my battle scar 💪 but also to offer my ears. If you guys need someone outside of your wonderful support system I can lend an ear and give you insite to both the loved one and the 'soldier'. As always thank you for showing us some of your valleys as well as your mountains to us followers; it helps us with our own lives and reminds us and reminds us of everyone's fragility. Yall are great.
I’m really sorry that you had been all through that I hope you get better ❤️‍🩹
Nates grandfather is a very wise man! So glad everything is okay and gosh you two stayed so strong 
I am so so glad for you. Had the same scare a while ago.  And thank you, thank you!!!!  for making this video. Men never have the testicular fortitude to share their issues. It takes courage but you made a difference!!  You may never know but you may have saved someone.  It's never easy to share but because of you  I just booked my appointment with my dermatologist.
As a 27 year old who has just had melanoma  removed from my leg, it’s so nice to see influencers and people with a platform talking about it. It’s not talked about enough. You have a voice to many people who feel alone. This video had me tearing up. So glad you’re doing better!
So glad he is okay! My heart sank when I read the video title. Much love and safe travels!
Not usually a commenter, but I love watching you’ll explore and live life! Best to both of you. I thank God already for putting this in your (van) rearview mirror!
Dearest Nate.. You are sooooo strong.. 🥺😭❤ Kara, no doubt,u r such a great support to him.. Super relieved that things are fine now.. ✨Wishing you a speedyyyyyy recovery.. ✨ Sending you lots of love and hugs🤗🤗 ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
My mom had intestinal cancer 10 year ago !!  What she told me is  You should have huge amount of will power Daily yoga (I am indian) And always remember you have to live for others and have to do more till you die to make this world a little bit more nice place !! And always believe in yourself 😊🙏🏻
I'm really glad you chose to share this, any cancer journey is incredibly private. However with the amazing platform you guys have built, talking about it and normalising the conversation regarding it can really have a very positive and inspirational impact on people who may be going through a similar situation.      You should be very proud of yourself for doing it.     Glad the surgery was such a success and wish you both health & Happiness.    P.S. Bloody love the vlogs!
If you would share a little earlier....we could pray for you.  I "know" your family was praying for you...but imagine if all of us were praying too!  So thankful all is well.
Thank You for sharing this , it is important to remind people to wear protective clothes and sunscreen even on cloudy days if you plan to be outside for more then 15 minutes.   Glad that Nate is   Ok:). Hope he will remain ok for the rest of his long and happy life.
No doubt it sucks but if you're going to get skin cancer, a Basal Cell is the one to get. You're lucky on all counts. I had it on my forehead a few years back.   Have fun in Canada. If you need help in the Montreal area, feel free to reach out.
Thank you for doing this video, allowing all of us to see the emotional side of this journey. Well done.
So glad you're ok Nate!  Kara, this was done so beautifully.  I really hope i can edit like you some day!  xooxo
Glad that Nate is fine. Thanks for doing this video. I am going through the same thing now. Except it’s on my face. Thanks.
Thank you for your openness, Nate. You remind viewers that you and Kara and others on social media are real people too. We all can offer public awareness of various conditions to help others. We are thankful you have no bad news at this time. Blessings to you both and your families. As a matter of full disclosure, I am a research subject with a rare brain disease. Not intending to upstage you ... just letting you know you are never alone.
obviously it’s very sad but congrats on getting #14 on trending!
Very very important post! Thanks for sharing and wishing you best health always❤️
Kinda crazy that Bec is sharing her cancer story too. Get better Nate!
i really happy that you are alr....love you both
How can anyone give this a thumbs down!?  Thank you for sharing your story, and endorsing mental health!!!
This is a good thing to post! Hope it reaches the young who think it’s only old people who have skin cancer. I have had three areas on my head removed, my forehead, behind my ear and nose. I go back every six months for a screening check. 🇨🇦❤️
Wow wow brother message me
So glad you guys are okay. Love and hugs ❤️❤️
Thank you for sharing your live, adventure, the good and the bad.
I’m a Nurse in Canada. Just seeing how fast your health care system is compared to ours is absolutely awesome. I guess there’s pros and cons to both. I’m sooooo glad you’re ok Nate! My mom has had several basil cell spots taken off on her face. It’s not fun. I love your channel guys!! I’m in Cambridge Ontario if you’re ever this way 😉. Have fun in Canada!!
😢
My heart dropped when I saw this I'm so sorry you had to go through this glad your on the mend and hope you have a speedy recovery  thank you for being open and sharing your story that can't have been easy sending big hugs to you and Kara ❤️❤️
So glad you're okay! We love you Nate!
Probably from the CV 1 NINER SHOT
So glad everything is OK. Thanks for sharing this bit of life with us all.
Great video! Where I am in Australia I feel like everyone knows the dangers of skin cancer all too well but good on you for spreading awareness to a global audience. Yes, it can be a killer but also so so preventable and treatable if you act early and just get checked out (and wear sun protection!)
Thats great to hear that nates doing good now !!! Thankyou for sharing this with us❤❤❤
I came, I saw, I liked, I Subbed. Kinging It + Eamon, and Bec were not wrong I can loose myself from the joe Biden delusion for months, and I will try to be nicer to my faucking neighbors manybe because I can just watch some olded shyt you uploaded years ago as the nightmare of FAKE SHYT consumes erryting. See it's working already :)
Use Norm Macdonald's example. Don't make your cancer other people's problems.
This was similar to something i had in my leg for over 4 years. Although mine was non-cancerous, it gave me a ton of pain for all that time and i just had it diagnosed and removed earlier this year.  My procedure was definitely very different from yours though. Since it was in my leg, they did a CT Guided ablation. Which basically they put me under a CT machine to precisely locate the tumor and then they drill a needle down through my bone and into the tumor. They then stick a rod down the needle that drills a part of the tumor off for a biopsy and then they stick another rod down the needle that is connected to a machine that heats the tip of the rod up high enough for around 5 mins to incinerate the whole tumor. Some people do stay awake for this and they just do localize anesthetics, but like nate, i absolutely do not like needles, let alone one where the tip is the size of a ball point pen lol. So luckily i was able to be put under. I hadn't had anything close to this done before so i was extremely nervous and scared, but it went incredibly well and after more than 7 years of wearing a knee brace because of how the tumor made my knee feel, as well as having dislocated it multiple times when i was younger, due to my tendon being a little longer than it's meant to be (i eventually grew into it i guess, thats what the doctor said anyways), I'm finally able to live without wearing one at all. And no more aleve or any other pain medicine.  I go back in a few months to have a scan done to make sure nothing has grown back and my bone has healed properly, but the way i feel right now, i don't think i have anything to worry about.  Thanks for sharing this video, it really makes me feel lucky to have all the technology and medicine we have, to be able to get rid of something like what nate or i had in such a fast and easy way.
Thanks for letting us know. You guys mean alot to this community (& me) and we appreciate your candor. I'm pray'n for y'all.
Nate, we are so glad you are ok and Cancer free. Kara your the bomb!! Please know we keep you in our prayers for your safety and wellbeing. My husband and I team drive a semi and follow y’all on your adventures. Stay safe out there and enjoy the beautiful life you have created!!
Good thing you caught it early get well
The people who dislikes the video is the people who ruined people's life
Love you guys and so glad you are ok Nate! Props to Kara for staying so strong for him. ❤️
My grandma had skin cancer and so did a friend at the age of 20 due to being "taneroexic". Both are/were cancer free after their surgeries. Wear sun screen, don't go tanning and protect yourself guys!
I'm glad you are ok Nate. My Wife has had the same surgery several times now. It can be scary.
Thank God🙏🏻, so nice to hear that your better. Keep motivated❤️❤️💯🙏🏻
I can't even imagine what you have been through. I am glad Nate is okay. and his grandfather is a wise man
I am so glad that Nate is ok. Thank you for sharing. Many prayers for health and safe travels.
Thanks for sharing your story, for showing you too can have bumps on the path of life,... Carpe diem and take care!
I'm so happy you decided to share this journey with us!
Glad to hear that you’re ok Nate.
We the followers of Theravada Buddhism perform a ritual or more like a routine sorta thing every month or week or whenever we get the chance that is whenever someone becomes sick we release live fishes in an open natural water body...like a river or a lake and pray for that person's early recovery because of this good deed. I don't know about others but in my case it has worked every single time.  Call it selfish or not a "selfless" deed or whatever but in the end at least some fishes are literally getting their life back.  And whoever is reading this comment may you live in peace and fearlessly.
14 on trending good job
I'm so sorry Prayers
I don’t know if it is a Coincident, but why is so many youtuber learn they had cancer. 🤔
Thank you for sharing this. I lost a friend from my youth last month to melanoma. She fought it for almost 4 years and it had spread throughout her entire body. Please take care of yourself and hold your loved ones close.
Thank you as always for being genuine despite the vulnerability of this situation. Your strength is amazing and inspiring. Cheers to more adventures together.
Thank you both for sharing.
This makes me cry... god bless you both. Stay safe and healthy always. 😘
Can we just……appreciate Kara. She is right beside at all times being supportive and strong. I can’t imagine how she’s must have been going through and seeing the love of her life go through this. It must have been hard and she stayed positive throughout. Someone get this girl some gourmet coffee!!
I am so happy to hear that it’s been removed. It must have been scary times. Thank you for sharing. ♥️
god is with you in jesus name amen
Nate get well soon. I wish you the best. Greetings from Switzerland 🇨🇭
We're so glad you got to hear the cancer free diagnosis! That must have felt like a giant weight had been lifted. Also, the "not a valid extension" sequence was incredibly stress inducing btw 😅
OMG! Way to ‘appear strong’ Kara ❤️. So sorry you two had to go through this, but I’m happy it all turned out good. Please take care of yourselves, the World needs you. You two are the kindest humans and deserve only the best. Thank you for being vulnerable and sharing.
I cant thank you enough for reminding your viewers that what we are seeing is not the full picture. Kara, I'm amazed at your strength and I broke down in tears when I saw you being able to let go and cry. Nate, I'm amazed you were driving to go get lunch after what you went through in that chair. You two are the definition of strength. Thank you for sharing your grandfather's wisdom with us. I will carry that with me forever. Praying for your safe travels.
I'm so glad you are cancer free! I was diagnosed with liposarcoma 2 years ago (after having a lump in my thigh for 3 years). I have been through a roller coaster of emotions and have just recently felt comfortable talking about it. I just celebrated my 2 year cancer free anniversary that took my chance of reoccurrence from 70% to around 20%. It's important to get your lumps and spots checked. Thank you for conveying that message!
Get well soon buddy 👊🏻👏🏻
can we get opperation and somehow transfer it to me i just want to die
i wished had it
Take care n lots of prayers your way 🙏
My heart stopped when I first saw you’re opening remarks. I’m very happy that you were treated and are now cancer free. Absolutely agree that you can’t take anything for granted. Be well and continue enjoying life! ❤️
You can't help but become invested in these stories, I am so please that you are cancer free Nate. Thank you for being open enough to show this intensely personal issue. Oh and wear sunscreen!
congratulations
Keep staying strong Nate :)
I had a Mohs procedure also. A quarter-sized hole on the side of my nose right under my eye, oh yes the smell of burning flesh to cauterize the bleeding is soooo pleasant! Glad you're okay.
I’m so proud of you! Stay strong, guys!
Thank you for sharing this experience so that others may consider their own health and be aware of potential moles and sores that just don’t heal. I am glad that it worked out for you.
When I read the title, my heart dropped. Until i read the description, I'm glad he's now cancer free. I hope you're doing well now.
Glad you are fine.
My all prayers and love❤..god gives you strength ..a truly inspiration
My heart just totally dropped when I read this. So glad they got it all. Sending prayers for comfort and healing blessings from Oklahoma 🙏🏻💜🙏🏻
Glad you are cancer-free, Nate.  As a skin cancer survivor, with two cysts removed, and half a thyroid removed, I can appreciate the hesitation, and anxiety you feel leading up to the procedure.   The ultimate result is a good result.  The rest is just a really good story to tell friends and family.  Continued good health to you and Kara.
God bless you guys!
this kind of relationship is something that is for forever i love both of you been watching since i wasnt even logged into my channel.  Seen over 70 countries and all of the current states and its a relief seeing you okay nate.  Proud of both of you for being strong 💚
So glad you are okay. 🙏
So glad his ok and you are both now at peace after all this huge scare xx Take care and be safe 🦋
Hopefully this will bring awareness to skin cancer  By telling our story.
So glad to hear you are ok
oh god at least your ok so that's the good part
Last August 6th, I had an lunginfarct. I had to go through an ct scan and they saw a little knob on my lungs. 6 weeks later I had another appointment with the doctor, they wanted me to do another ct scan, to see if it was cancer. Results were fine and I am recovering great. But those 3 days, waiting for a new scan + results were a hell for me. I can not understand how you were able to go through this for three damn years. I am proud of you guys, you are a beacon of light for us, even with this video❤
Very happy to hear that Nate was given the all clear...thankyou for sharing your journey while it's been confronting for you it's so important for everyone to not put this off...please get tested Nate got lucky many people aren't but catching it early can make a difference 💜
Seeing one of your new videos pop up on my YouTube page made my heart skip a beat… WHEN I SAW THE TITLE MY HEART LITERALLY DROPPED!! but I’m so glad your ok! 🥰
Stop taking vaccines and you will live longer….
STOP USING SUNSCREEN!!!!
I had no idea how much I have connected with you both via your videos until I started crying at the thought of either one of you NOT being ok.  I am so glad Nate is cancer free! Sending love and hugs from Australia
Men are so ridiculous and frustrating when it comes to seeing a doctor. My dad died suddenly from a heart attack at the age of 64. Was never sick, but had not had his annual exam. 2 years with a scab that wont heal is a long fucking time! Please ladies and gentlemen, get your annual exams and if there is a singular concern like this, make sure to figure it out. If that means getting a second opinion so be it!! I’d love for Kara and Nate to follow up with a sun screen review. SUPER IMPORTANT especially for the pale folks.
well, cancer is bad but BCC (basal cell carcinoma) is treatable.
UV Light is very very bad for the skin. Please wear protection as much as possible. Also anything above SPF 50 is the most efficient rating, anything more than 50 has huge diminishing returns. (SPF 50 blocks 98% of UV, while SPF 100 blocks 99%)
my heart was not ready for this. thank god he’s okay now
Oh no...when I seen this I was so worried. I am so glad your cancer free Nate. You guys are strong and will get through it together...like always. When I first seen this I thought it was due to you guys traveling a lot. Well get well Nate we love you guys both! 🤗❤️✌️
Clout
Yall should come down to Tampa Florida
Take extra care of yourselves in the sun guys. I used to cringe and worry about you both getting skin cancer while watching your travel vids as so many times you were out in the sun with no wide brim hats and sunscreen.  In Australia with have on going campaigns about protecting ourselves from the sun. Our schools have a no hat no sunscreen no play policy. Glad your ok Nate.😊
💕💕💕
Good Look With Your Recovery Look After Yourselves Both Of You All The Very Best Take Care
One day at a time. I had 5 open heart surgeries and my fiancé just came home yesterday from having surgery to remove a cancerous cyst. I know what it’s like to be the patient and the patient’s loved one. Both have there challenges. One day at a time..
I hope whoever disliked this has a bad Christmas
God bless you guys i am so happy hes ok  also life does have ups and down but know ur fans are there for you
Hello Kara and Nate I know your not going to see this but I just wanted to tell you I hope you get better and Ellington better I know how Kara just be feeling bc my nan died of it I wish you both the best and I love all the videos you make for us😍💖💕💝🙂
Thanks for your insight, yes all have issues, I one of those people, but we get better soon, hope to do more than been locked in by lockdown, think I had enough of that word for a lifetime! 😂
Change title to i have defeated the skin cancer
Be well!
I am Cesar Gbless you chicos and thank God your Cancer free i love you chicos i need to see you in new adventures take care guys
Makes me wander . Im only 18 so I haven’t put much thought into the random scab I’ve had on my scalp that hasn’t healed since I was 14
I was really not expecting this video, my heart dropped! His grandfather is wise, health is everything. I have epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and thyroid problems due to chemo and it absolutely sucks. I'm not able to do everything and I'm only 30 years old. So happy to hear Nate is fine!! 😁
I didn’t think I would get as emotional as I did, seeing how raw you guys were really made me realise you are real genuine people. You’ve got a fan in me
I live in Australia (the land of sun!) and had a  Basel Cell Carcinoma (BCC for short)  removed from my forehead about 2 years ago. It healed up great, but my specialist told me to be EXTRA sun smart moving forward as once your body knows how to mutate the cells once, it can do it again. So you're more prone to getting them again with UV exposure. glad you're ok Nate. Keep safe and thanks for spreading the word!
I’m so sorry to hear that
Skincancer is so dangerous and so underestimated. Be carefull outthere long sleeved shirts and hats are compulsory when being outdoors . trust me i have lost friends to skincancer and i dont wanna be next, take care you two!
Great to hear that all is ok. My sister went through this a few years ago after having a boil like thing on her thigh that wouldn't heal. It was cut out, lymph nodes taken etc but thankfully she is ok, goes back every 6 months for check ups & scans. Well done for sharing your story on here, & possibly saving lives by making people aware of skin cancer. Love watching you both. X ❤️
Gosh, so sorry you had to go through that scare but so thankful that Nate has the all clear! ❤️
glad you are okay Nate
Adverts on a video about having skin cancer...people really use anything for a click.
I love you too, ye can make a laugh out of the news that ye have cancer. Ye are the people we need in this world. POSITIVITY =0
Lol you might as well made a video on a booboo on you elbow
sad that people maybe very click baity videos like this trying to exploit their problem for views, not even a life threatening condition and the thumbnail + title make it seem like a very serious matter when it's nowhere near that
Makes me crying ❤️ I send you all of my love for both of you 🙏🥺 take care ❤️❤️🙏
Speedy recovery to you Nate.
you go Nate! and Kara you could not have been a better partner and supporter of Nate! he's Lucky
❤🤟👏👏👏
Canada? Really? Still waiting for you two in Ohio! Oh by the way, I'm happy that you are cancer free. May Allah (God) bless you both with a healthy, happy, cheerful, joyful, and more adventurous life!!!
So glad to learn you are ok Nate, best wishes to both of you xx

stay out of the sun hahahaha
I started to tear up when Kara was being strong for Nate. This year marks 3 years of my sister passing from Ovarian Cancer! I am so glad that he is perfectly ok!
This is heartbreaking stay strong guys and make sure u go to all the appointments look after yourself Nate love to you both x
❤️❤️❤️
i’m so proud of you cara and nate, i love watching your videos and you guys are so strong and caring for each other. i wish the best for you both in this journey and if you need some time away from vlogging then take a break! you guys deserve it <3 take your time we are all here supporting you!!
I’m so glad that your doing okay, never forget that everyone is here for you! 💜
More power to you Nate.
It’s nice how positive Kara was during the whole thing and how she helps him get through this troublesome time in his life.
Extremly happy for u and may u always be blessed. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Fake news
Prayers for your health and healing. 💝🙏💝 you are right you guys don't have to disclose personal or medical information. All for boundaries.. That said you have a great support system at home and in YouTube so accept all the love and we'll wishes. 💝🙏💝  because You are not alone in this, and your encouraging others to see a doctor, leading by example. 💝🙏💝
This video is such a weird flex.
I feel your pain.....I also had a basal cell near my nose......early detection is the Key. Great Job!
Best to get Check ups, no one's always cancer free.
Thank you for sharing your story! You all may provide entertainment for many but the sincerity of your videos makes you both such amazing people to follow.  Be safe and stay healthy!
It’s a bit weird, but many people in Aus have an annual skin check and likely have a couple of bccs removed on an annual basis. That’s basal cell carcinomas. I initially thought you were over reacting, but I think the prevalence of skin cancer in Aus has completely normalised it, and we are pretty casual about it. We don’t lie in the sun to get a tan, kids are trained from a very early age to cover up. On the whole, the only people with a tan are tourists. So glad you shared the story. It may encourage someone to go get their sunspots checked, potentially saving a life. Well done to you!
I know it’s hard to share some things publicly, but you did an amazing job with this video and will likely help someone dealing with skin cancer, as well as highlight the importance of prevention and getting checked annually. I’m glad that you’re on the mend, thank you for sharing your story’
We love you Nate ❤️❤️
The editing made you seem super sincere.  ... 🙄
When i saw this i cried no not nate dog not my buddy im glad that ur ok and tjat you caught it early love u kara and nate
I had tears in my eyes when Kara finally let go of her emotions... Coz we all felt the same emotion... I can't even imagine how tough this year has been for both of you, and I am happy Nate is much much better now. Take care of your health and each other, always...coz we love and need you around for as long as possible, and coz ur both now 'our family' too.
hey guys, you´re so cute and handsome - together. Don´t let the bad things take part of ur life. Wish u all the best! Greetz from germany ♥
Ok, wow this really hit me. I read the title and i had to process what i just read. It took me a while because I always thought Kara and Nate have perfect lifes, they deserve all happiness and good vibes and stuff. Ofcourse I know that you guys are still humans, so stuff like that happends. But i forgot, completely. Thank u Nate ( and Kara), for sharing your story. Its not only a reminder to not forget that people who share their lifes are normal and human beings too and second of all, that you are strong and your message is empowering! Thank u!
Thank you for this video guys! You bring authenticity to this platform. I've been following your journey for few years now and hope to travel with you for couple more years! :)  Stay strong and healthy! :)
Thank you for sharing.
I wanted to say thank you for sharing this - the more people that do, the more people become aware of skin cancer, and hopefully awareness can be built around prevention and treatment.  About four years ago a very dear friend shared on Facebook for all her friends and family to see that she had been diagnosed not only with Melanoma, but that it had metastasised to her brain - she was fighting it, but decided rather than doing it behind closed doors she would share it in the hope that it might inspire others.  As a result of her sharing, a bunch of her family and friends went out and had skin tests conducted (in solidarity). My Mum and I went - she was first, out she came with a big smile, all clear!!! I was next... not all clear - three biopsies later and I had a diagnosis of 1 x Melanoma (in situ, so very early) and 2 x Basal Cell Carcinoma (I was in my 30s at the time).   All of these have been treated successfully with surgery - I have a three inch scar on my arm, one about inch long on my collarbone, and one an inch long in my hairline. I started on three monthly skin checks, got up to six monthly... Back down to three monthly following another BCC diagnosis and removal (a new scar on my cheek)... I have just gone back to 6 monthly - I cannot wait to get to yearly checks!!  Had my friend not shared her story, I would not have had a skin check, and my Melanoma might not have been caught so early, or my BCCs discovered and removed. I will always be thankful to her... Sadly she lost her battle a little over three years ago!  So, again, thank you for sharing your story.
Get well soon praying for you
Fuckkk 😞😞😞 ma bro
if there's a skin cancer to have, BCC is the one to have. Best not to get it all together, here in Australia us Family Physicians/GPs cut them out ourselves because it's so common. Moh's surgery does require a dermatologist to make sure all the margins are clear. Glad it's gone, make sure you all get skin checks!
I'm so glad that he is ok, not even going to lie my anxiety went up waiting to hear.  Stay blessed 💜💜💜💜💜
no wonder you were Missing in action, i miss watching your videos even those i havent watch, i still find them enjoyable and in the future i could travel more around my home country.
WHAT
We're Happy for d result, God bless you both, take care guyz
Really very very happy that you're fine❤
Welll that sucks.. 😢  Hope you get better soon buddy..
Take more care, man. I hope you recover soon.
Must have been lot of mental trauma that you both guys have to go through but glad that everything is fine now..  Love from India...
take care of your health. it is something that money can't buy...
Nate, I had a BCC on my nose. A plastic surgeon removed it. He was pretty 'matter of fact' about it. Unfortunately, the histology showed that he hadn't quite got it all so he had to go back in. Needles in the nose hurt like *%@£&. He did it and there is barely a mark. As long as your surgeon has 'got it all', you will be totally fine. Makes you aware though doesn't it? Best wishes.
I've had it on my ear and they had to cut the top of it off.  It's not to bad. Just make sure you get check every six months to get check
God bless you both🙏
Get well 💙
My bf and I went through the same thing last year. He had a spot on his forehead that (after first being misdiagnosed) turned out to be cancer. He's cancer free now and he also has to get checked every year for the rest of his life.  I know how stressful and scary this is for both of you. I'm so glad Nate's cancer-free! Hope he recovers quickly!
Yeah it's very prevalent so don't feel you are the only one. Hang in there get well
From one Nate to another, congratulations. That sounds like such a stressful time for the two of your and your family. Even with a positive diagnosis, that "what if..." feeling can be overwhelming. I'm happy to hear the good news.
Get well soon Nate..😎 ❤🙏
You are such a cute couple Glad to hear that it wasn't so serious and the procedure went well
Click bait cash grab.
So glad Nate is ok 🙏🏼
I had the exact same thing but on my forehead. Had it removed about 18 months ago, no problems since, no further treatment required. Wishing you all the best. I was saving up for a proper vlogging camera but had to use the money to have the skin cancer removed and have not been able to set any money aside since as I am on a limited budget 😞
❤️
Hope you have a speedy recovery
My gosh I was gonna cry
Thankfully skin cancer is one of those cancers we can fix with our modern technology and science. Glad you’re cancer free!
Glad you are doing better brother...please please please no longer go to dangerous place like Cherynobl. Not saying that caused it but at the same time I hope your wisdom is telling you the same thing...safe and healthy travels and enjoy the show
Bless you both, I’m so glad to hear Nate’s going to be fine. Health is most definitely wealth 🤗 I also believe because you are both such happy, positive and happy souls that it helps attribute to better health.
So so so glad to hear Nate is cancer free now! You guys are an inspiration to many. Please please take good care of yourselves, as you both make the world a better place to live in😊 Loads of Love to you both, Kara & Nate!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Congratulations on being cancer free. What level spf?
OK, how is it possible that the adventures of a couple of kids I don’t know at all, but follow almost every day, could cause me take care so much? And who is chopping onions in my house? They need to stop. Immediately. Or bring me a box of tissues. Stat!
I very much enjoy watching your adventures and I'm so thankful to the Lord that your both ok. <3 <3 <3
So happy you are doing good after all this. Thank you for sharing.
1 exterior basal cell carcinoma? Apart from skin cancer you have a bad case of drama queen!
As the mom of a cancer survivor (my 22 year old son), I totally understand what  you’ve been through and I’m so thankful your treatment was a success.  I love watching you both...your enthusiasm for life is contagious.  Keeping you both in my thoughts and sending healing vibes for you, Nate, and hugs for you, Kara!❤️
& to think I looked forward to watching your next upload. So glad that it turned out OK & you're on the mend 👍
The Doctor’s advice re wear a hat & use sunscreen is so important, including ears. Once I got sunburnt on one ear & didn’t realise until I brushed my hair-hurt like hell. I’ve made sure to include my ears in my sunscreen routine ever since.😊
This was difficult to watch and very hard for you guys. Thank God. 💕
Glad you’re ok Nate. I saw this in my feed while watching an Eamon and Bec movie and skipped straight across. After the surgery, you didn’t want to hand the keys over to Kara to drive so you could chill out?
This video title floored me a little when it popped up on my Apple TV.  Me and my partner Torstein have been following you for years and we have watched every single video and we love you guys.  As a bonus dad for my partners daughter we went thru a full on cancer battle when our youngest one got blood cancer six months after loosing her mother some years ago.  She’s healthy to day and just started nursing school and we are so thankful.  We are so glad you are ok and that everything is fine.  Big hugs to the both of you.  Lots of love from Magnus and Torstein in Norway.  Ps if you guys ever come to my hometown Stavanger again please tell us so we can say hello and show you the best of stavanger that you guys missed the last time.
I'm so glad for you that its only the skin on the back of your head and not somewhere else.
glad he's ok.
Not at all to be worried. Just Chill. Check out whether cut mergins and base is free or not.  ( Oncosurgeons) feedback 👍
Life is full of unknowns, isn't that what keeps it interesting?
We will stay with you stronger in this situation. Stay strong & get well soon
So happy that all turned out well. You two are the best. ❤️❤️
My husband has had the same surgery on the side of his nose.  The minute they tell you that this is cancer is just realy scary.  Eventough cancers of this type are not that serious.  My husband didn't care for this at all.  I was realy worried.  In the mean time, they have cut of a spot on his ear, on his back, ... it keeps scarrying me.
I have one of these, had one shaved off but should have had it cut out and was told it will come back, 5 years later it came back but they are not worried about it, its slow growing, apparently it is very rare to have these on the scalp so we can be rare together Nate, get well soon buddy
So glad to hear you are cancer free!
SPF is your BFF!
❤️❤️
Thanks for sharing and fantastic outcome.  Here in Australia we are the skin cancer capital of the world.  Everyone here is recommended to have their skin checked by an expert annually.  I've had a BCC and an SCC before my 40th birthday.  Great advice, wear hats, wear sunscreen, be sunsmart!!!
Sounds like they got it all. Congrats. Mine had already spread. Make sure to keep up on your check ups. Welcome to the cancer club.
Happy That Nate Is Ok ...Take Care Pals ❤️
I hope y’all wear sunscreen all of the time. You’re both super tan with all of your travels so I hope you’re taking care of yourselves.
Wear sunscreen everyone.
We're so happy you are okay <3
Clickbait at its very worst
All the best to you! We love you!
We spro you
Stay strong, to the both of you
So great to hear you’re doing ok! You guys are bringing positivity and inspiration to me such a year. It’s uplifting to know how real and grateful you are. Makes you more authentic and relatable  Keep you in my prayers
It is good to share that you struggle with this.  I had to smile when Nate said he hates needles, this is the guy who jumps out of planes, off cliffs, jumps into ice water 😂? Very thankful for you that all is well.  Looking forward to your videos in “God’s country 🇨🇦
Cancer is serious no matter what form it comes in, so glad you guys are happy and healthy🙏🏻
Please start wearing hats and sunscreen if not for yourself and what Nates been through but be a role model.
Lol. A video fishing for sympathy also never fails to promote a paid sponsorship... 🤣 smh.
This actually made my heart hurt. I am soo glad you are both ok. I am going through a really horrible trauma and your blogs help me escape, distract me from what's going on. I truly appreciate you both and the joy you bring everyone. Keep on trucking you awesome people x
Glad Nate is ok!  Thanks for sharing and doing this important video.
I have never cried watching your vlogs before.  My heart just dropped.  I am so sorry you had to go trough this. Sunscreen is alpha omega to avoid this. I hope you metion this from now on very often. I am so glad it worked out and it is not life treateing. My sister just went trough breastcancer and it was lifetreatening. So I know the scare for sure. She is cancerfree now. It was a suspence for a long time. Kara and Nate, it is always nice to see your love and care for eachother, but never have we seen it so out as in this vlog. You two have a treasure wich is wonderful. Sending lots of  loving hugs from Norway.
So glad you are ok Thank you for sharing Hopefully this video will encourage people to get that spot checked and to be more sun smart 💕💕
So happy you have good news!!
Happy to hear you’re ok now Nate! Sending love 🌸
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥺
My wife is cancer free as of this year after being treated for breast cancer (Chemo, Radiation and multiple surgeries) and I still get the same feeling in my gut when I read about someone getting diagnosed with it.  Just like my wife is doing great and cancer free, I’m so glad that’s how this video turned out too.  Thank you guys for spreading positivity, love and the real side of things and not just the polished instagram side.  It helps everyone enjoy your channel, but also feel relatable and even informed as well.  Stay happy and health you two, as well as all of the comment readers out there!  ❤️
I can relate to Nate's adversities. I had a basal cell on my face while I was just beginning my senior year of high school, and I had to get Mohs surgery. I was also the youngest patient in the room, by far! My skin is always sensitive to the sun, so I have to be mindful of putting on sunscreen and wearing hats/shirts when going out to activities like swimming. The pandemic has taken a great a toll on my mental health lately, but I did finally go back to the dermatologist earlier this year for a checkup and also am getting checked on a yearly basis. It felt weird sharing this story with my own community at the time, but I wholeheartedly agree that authenticity and transparency with your community goes a long way. Thanks for sharing this, Nate!
Wish you quick recovery Nate!
Thank god You’re okay I’m not sure you should be driving though
Congrats, Nate! I’m so glad everything went well! Good post, thank you for sharing. Our Grams had skin cancer and refused to use SpF coverage\hats or umbrellas and did end up with metastatic skin cancer. Not good.   You’re cooperating and being a shining star + mentor! Very Good.  BTW at first glance I didst see bandage and thought you had gotten  a MT Head Shave.haha  Squint abd see:
I am endeared to you two now more than ever.  Appreciate you being so courageous in sharing this.  It's all the more remarkable that you continued on your insane, mind boggling incredible adventures while such a battle was going on.  Delighted that Nate has conquered yet something else besides racing with donkeys :)  You know,  with all you've accomplished I wouldn't be surprised if you guys someday zipline yourselves to Mars and back (and I bet we'd still get room tours and morning coffees in bed ;))  Sending y'all my love.  Happy for the prognosis..and praying it stays that way :)
You two are amazing. You make me realise every day how important it is to enjoy life to the fullest. Thank you
STAY STRONG
God Bless💝🙏
Thank God! You Dodged a bullet ,a lot of people didn’t. praise the Lord for he is mindful of us. #sunscreen
Seeing Nate grab only the one cup of coffee and not giving it Kara in bed made my heart drop. I knew from there this was gonna be a heart to heart
Wishing all the very best! Love from India ❤️
Faith in Jesus is all I have left. I lost my job over not wanting the vaccine, I have lupus struggling to keep up my health, and I’m on a ton of meds already! Plus we don’t know the long term side effects of this v. But because of my personal medical decision me and my children are suffering. Things were hard for me durning the beginning of the pandemic and the shut down. I used all my savings to scrape by. I’m Feeling so hopeless. I don’t know how I’m going to make it. I’m a single mother. I’m not complaining. I just need to vent. I have no money for food I can’t even feed my children! I’m so ashamed. But even though I’m going through all of this, I still have faith in Jesus!!!
Happy to hear you’re recovering and wish you both continued good health. Thankyou for sharing too.
So so glad it all worked out for you Nate !! Heal fast compadre !!
🥺🤍
I was wondering why you guys was stress after bike marathon at first thought it was long days of biking but you guys kept looking at each other odd like something was on your mind.. just saying I could tell and maybe I wasn't only one.. but glad for happy ending ☺️
God bless you nate kara 🙏🙏🙏💒
Oh no! Not the cancer with a 99% survival rate!  Who gives a shit
I don’t know you bro never saw you on YouTube this my first timing seeing your video I’m telling you this because I don’t won’t to show fake love but I pray that you get better god is a powerful man and he will help you get through this just have faith 💙🙏🏾
Unfortunately this is the ‘norm’ in Australia. Every person here gets checked every year (or should). There are skin cancer clinics in every town and city and everyone I know has had at least 1 skin cancer cut out. This video is some what amusing to me (not because I’m downplaying what you’ve been through, just because it’s a normal part of life here and we don’t bat an eyelid about it). Not saying that’s good. Just different. I myself have had 3 skin cancers cut out from face and arms. I really don’t find it a big deal at all,…………but everything is relative right? The perils of being Caucasian in sunny climes. Healing should be swift. Wear hat and sun screen and keep on top of things with a yearly check and you’ll be fine.
“You didn’t even pass out, and you only yelled at her once” bro that killed me
Glad you caught the problem before it was worse. Basal cell skin cancer is still serious. Once you have one spot you are 80% more likely to have more. My husband started with one spot on his back but now has had it on his face, scalp, leg, neck, etc.  Annual checkups all over your body will be important moving forward to catch it while it's small. Small spots can usually be treated with an electric needle. Invest in UV protective clothing with long sleeves, neck protection and etc. Sunscreen alone is not enough. You two spend a lot of extended time in the sun so your risk is higher. It often takes a decade or more for the damage to begin to show. See a dermatologist regularly, keep enjoying great adventures, and keep smiling!

Sorry about that
Love you guys
Get well soon....
So happy your in the clear! 🙌
Dont think tooo much. . ...
As a cancer survivor, I really enjoyed this video. If you ever come to Houston a lot of people would enjoy it!
Well done for showing this I can't believe you drove after it so brave,  Poor Kara was ready to cry from the start,  it's very hard to watch your loved one in pain. Well done guys best video ever 👏🏼
This dude had a zit removed and he is making a sympathy clickbait video titled “ I have skin cancer”.  Anything for views, eh?
So happy to hear that you're fine Nate
I was so heartbroken when I saw this video and caption pop up on my youtube, but Im so glad this is behind you now. Wishing you good health and many more adventures to come!
So happy for you Nate that she got it all on the 1st try! Lol yep kind of get a perk of a 'facelift' along with the removal.  I've had 12 skin cancers removed... basil cell and squamish cell carcinomas. MOHS surgery is the best!  Had a bc that took three rounds to get it all....cut from the top of my cheek bone to my outer side of chin....best thing is I can barely see the scar!  Keep up with your yearly checks, and if you see anything suspicious have it checked out please👍 Sunscreen sunscreen sunscreen 50 SPF everyday😘
Glad you’re free of the c Nate, keep on kicking life’s butt mate.
Get better soon andore power to you.
Thank you soooo much for sharing this.
We are so happy for you that it's gone and you're doing well, take care and appreciate all your adventures together even more than before!! 🍀
all the best Nate
#PrayForNate ❤
Glad Nate is okay. God bless
IM SO GLAD ITS GONE!! God bless you guys!! 🥳💓💓
Im literally crying 😢
No more backwards ball caps.  Get you a straw hat or a fedora and protect yourself.
Thank you so much for sharing this with us. You are absolutely right: don’t take your health for granted. You both seem to have a really good attitude. You faced it head-on, there were tears and fears, and now you are coming out the other side!
Be strong my man
When I saw this video I started to cry :(
So happy Nate is ok. Thanks for sharing. Keep on fighting man
Thanks for sharing your journey with the BIG C.  Glad all is okay.  The PSA for better SPF is great to remember for all.
Stay strong 💪❤️
What a journey, I’m so glad you’re okay. You are a couple of bright lights in a sometimes dark world. Much love to you both 💗🥺🌹
I feel so relieved to know that you’re cancer free Nate. Love you 🙌🏻
God bless you nate :) im happy your healthy
Cancer is scary and not knowing the unknown. my cousin battled cancer at 15 and I was there by her side through the whole thing and it was a year and half till she was cleared and cancer free. The ups and downs through it all really was a struggle not knowing if she was going to beat it. Thank god that they were able to get rid of Nates in one shot ❤️
I am so glad you got good results.
I really like the quote from Nates Grandfather. Glad you’re cancer free and a timely lesson for us in the Southern Hemisphere where we are heading into Summer. Take care both xx
Thank you guys for sharing this !!!  I'm so glad Nate is alright.
oh my god, my heart dropped so far when i read the title
Glad you're not dying Nate.
NATE, To do That AWAKE! that gives me goose bumps.. I think You guys said you Had to be awake, did u try to get sedated? that is like my #1 biggest fear man. Epically seeing you react mid surgery!! AHH! This is what keeps me away from getting myself looked at!.
I just saw the video about Nate’s skin cancer! First off, so glad that you had the outcome that you did! When I saw the title of that VLOG my heart stopped. Thankfully it wasn’t more serious! You are both so right, everyone no matter who they are and how ideal their life appears, has something going on in their lives that they are dealing with. Also you are both so right about not taking your health for granted.  I found that out the hard way this summer. My Sister suddenly and quite unexpectedly died at the end of July 2021.  She had been dealing with a minor illness that was supposed to not be life threatening at all.  She died of complications that occurred suddenly and could not be overcome. I actually found your videos while surfing Facebook videos during some sleepless nights after my Sister’s death. I must admit to some jealousy that you were off traveling the world while mine was crumbing, but seeing Nate’s video reminded me that we all have burdens and challenges.  Take you guys!
I had this same procedure last year and had probably similar feelings as you did. The word “ Cancer “ just scares the crap out of me. No matter how bad you never want to hear it. Mine was a massive patch and I had it for around 3-4 years as well. I’m so glad you are better I am so happy to never see another MOS surgeon again.
Nate: “now it’s time to go to canada” 😄😄 you guys are superhumans ❤️
So glad you are ok. This cancer thing scare me a lot. Bless you 🙏 ♥ for both of you
im so happy that you are well nate and kara waow you are so strong.
much love y’all
You ppl are so gullible it’s disgusting.
LOOOOOL This is the same kid to sit out because he bruised his leg during a football game.
Use blackseed oil. It works!!!
I love you guys! <3
Scared the crap out of me, but glad all went well and it was just a basal cell - at my age, I have many, many friends who have gone through this multiple times over the past 10-20 years + an aunt who has had quite few removed since the late 80s. Take care and follow their recommendations! Glad you're OK!!
@Nate, You are a strong man, Take care, Stay Safe and I would pray for a Speedy recovery
Such a roller coaster worth of emotions! Glad to hear Nate is cancer free!
Thank you for bringing this to light. I have had skin cancer three times. Sunscreen and a hat!!!!
I love y’all so much! My mama was just diagnosed with peritoneal mesothelioma and its is sooooo hard . God bless you both
AWEEE NATE!!! my heart sank. I cannot imagine EVER being given that C WORD diagnosis of any kind! I am so glad you went in and had the biopsies done.
Hey guys, doctor here. BCCs are nothing to worry about. Just get em scraped off and check up every year or so. Nothing to worry about. Cancer in the most minor sense. Good luck and wear a big 🤠.
He kemosabe that 🔪
Good grief, I hope you are both okay, as I know how daunting this can be for couples and families. Love from Geelong, Victoria Australia (Near the Great Ocean Road haha).
Wishing you the best!
Hello Nate, my Mom had the same ,  Basal carcinoma on her head also.  FYI if anything on your body does not heal for  2 weeks have a doctor check it.  Always biopsy! Some of sunscreens have benzene which can cause cancer. Sunscreens absorb the sunlight.  Zinc is better choice.  Try wearing a wide brim hat  that has UV protection. The higher the elevation you are the higher the UV which means you can get burn faster.  The closer you are to the equator the higher the UV exposure also.  Snow also is reflect the UV to you. My mom had it cut out in her  80’s and had to have radiation treatment. She passed from kidney problems not from skin cancer.  There are UV protection clothes. Kara should be also be thinking of wearing a wide brim hat also.  Tip of the nose  often common area for skin cancer. Thanks for telling us.  Love your videos.  Really appreciate the both of you .   Hope this helps.  Joyce
So happy everything went ok guys. Zen Nate may have been developed from this situation (positive outlook)!!! This was a terrifying title to a video yet it helps everyone to see that these things happen to everyone all over the world. Much love to both of you
God is so good. Love the quote from his Grandpa
Hi Nate   Let me tell you a story.   First of all I'm 78 now and still going strong.   I enlisted in the USAF in 1963 and was assigned to Nellis AFB Las Vegas for the first three years and then to Thailand for a year, after reenlisting I was sent to San Antonio.  After some more travels I ended up at Homestead Florida for three years.  While I was there I had the same as you.  I had several spots that would not heal.  I was treated for Basal Cell several times and after retiring in 1983 I was back to San Antonio again  1990 the doctor said I was a candidate for a special treatment.  I had chemo on my face and ears for three months.  Fast forward 20 years and I have been going to the doctor and getting more small cancers burned off my arms, ears, and faces about every six months, usually 5 to 6 each trips.    Stay strong and just go to the doctor when they tell you, they are really easy to have them burned off about 15 minutes every six months.     Stay trips and happy sunsets from San Antonio Texas  Larry
You are awesome 🤩 and keep smiling and keep y’all head up and keep moving forward. 👍🏻😎👍🏻
Hope everything goes well for you! This is definitely my favorite channel!!
OMG! So great to hear all is well! Take care! 🤗
You guys might not see this but I remember when your channel are was only at about 3,000 subs..seeing the title scared the crap out of me. Watching you both grow over the year made me feel like we’re friends/family. I wish you guys the most peace, love, good health, and happiness in the world :)
Hope you get better
The title should be "I had skin cancer".   The clickbait is the real cancer.

Wow!! Day 1 viewer and fan! Glad y'all shared and agreed about what social shows about people.  My heart dropped as well!!! You guys ROCK
dont be recommending sunscreen unless its non toxic most sunscreens contain cancer causing chemicals, just saying x
So glad everything is OK!!! My FIL, BIL, and husband have all had melanoma removed and my heart felt for you guys ❤❤❤
The reason it hurt was because they did NOT let the numbing injection soak in. They need to wait a few more mins. PLS TELL THEM TO WAIT A FEW MORE MINUTES before doing anything further.
Glad to hear that he is healthy 😊
Glad you're gonna be ok. Australia and New Zealand are the skin cancer capitals of the world thanks to being under the hole in the ozone layer. Please guys, take some advice that we've learnt the hard way. Slip, slop, slap is the mantra. Slip on something with sleeves, slop on some sun screen, (read the instructions as you're probably only using a fraction of the amount you need to and check the expiry date), slap on a hat, choose a hat with a brim as, anyone that spends time outside here often ends up with skin cancers on the top of their ears. Also, please avoid the sun in the hottest part of the day. Just heard the skin specialists advice as l finished typing. Glad you're passing it on.
Hey Nate and Kara ! My Name is Jason and I have been a fan of you guys for a couple years now! First off thank God Nate is ok and skin cancer free! Please know you guys are in my thoughts and prayers I have also lived in Nashville,TN ! Just want to say I'm a huge fan of you guys ! And thank you for sharing your lives with us and the YouTube community! You guys are awesome  and looking forward to seeing more amazing videos! GOD BLESS  YOU AND YOUR FAMILY!  SINCERELY  Jason!
THIS is a couple video. No, this is a _relationship_ video. 🙏 The travels are fun and all, but this shows the true underpinnings of a relationship, what it's all about and how to do it well. Gah, you guys are amazing. Thank you for showing what GREAT RELATIONSHIPS are. 💖🙏
Thank you for sharing! Stay healthy!
*PLEASE TELL US HOW DO YOU PAY FOR YOUR MEDICAL CARE IN THE USA PLS.* .
My dad has skin cancer the non cancerous kind. He got a big one removed from his next years ago. He’s fine! He goes in once a year to get any small suspicious spots frozen off.
I m a physician and when I saw that Nate had skin cancer ,I hoped that its basal cell carcinoma as its the one with best prognosis. I m glad that its not melanoma or squamous cell carcinoma.Basal cell cancer has very very good prognosis and I m sure Nate will be fine.I know a cancer diagnosis is stressful no matter what but I know Nate will be fine..
In Miami my pastor would go to the beach with the black members of his church, and he was bald, and he did not protect himself. He got skin cancer on his head. In those days I was in middle school, and would not protect much either, but since I wasn't German like him, but Spanish, I did not get skin cancer. I just got very, very dark, like Tamil-level dark. I since recovered my lightness but then kept being active outside (with more protection), so now I am usually tanned a bit which is inevitable living in Miami and then Indochina after being born in Honduras.
My step father (who I dearly loved, Alex) had skin cancer, and he had to deal with it for many years.  He had it cut out, scraped out, or whatever - and had too many bandages at time - but he always had the best of attitudes.  You will too I am sure.  You have a helluva partner, great channel, good feeling about life and what it means - you are an inspiration to me at 65!  My mother did die of breast cancer.  That was terrible, but she had a couple of years to spend with my children, me, and Alex.  So, you have Kara.  That's the best medicine you could ever hope for Nate.  Truly.  And I have to add now, you are her medicine as well.  I'm watching a love story on youtube in real time.  I'm happy to know I get to see so many more videos.
basil cell  crock of   click bait. so what.
I am so glad that you are cancer free! I have followed your story for about two years and you helped get me through the long unemployment that hit the Entertainment field! Know that I am not the only one who breathed a sigh of relief when they said they got it all and you are cancer free!  Love the content and love even more you are healthier again, Nate! Thanks to you both!.
Ive had this surgery several times. I have to go in every six months where they check my whole body. I jokingly tell the doctor that every time I come in for a checkup they take a part of me.  LOL
Love you both !!!!!!
Thank you for sharing. This is important that we all wear SPF and be protected in this day and age. The fact that you shared will help others. And Kara, you were so supportive of Nate during the ordeal. He is so lucky to have you.
Ivan so happy that you ser clear, and i realy Hope that you win the award because you deserve IT so much you help in my Days and i hope that you Will do it forever
Me too. Best kind of cancer to have though because it’s treatable and visible! 🙌 please folks, always wear sunscreen. Your skin in a few decades will thank you. And pay attention to changes in color, moles, texture, etc. Have your doctor look at your skin every year (unless you’re magical and can see your back and shoulders really well).
Nate I’m glad to hear that you are cancer free. I’m 77 and pretty much the poster child for going to the dermatologist and getting squamous cells and basil cells removed I go every three months for a check up. I’m light skin blonde hair, well it used to be and green eyes. The nice thing is that the dermatologist is your friend it doesn’t hurt to go and get the check ups when they tell you to. I’ve been watching you through the years thoroughly enjoy your channel.😎
First and most importantly, Thank God ur okay Nate, secondly, you guys are just spectacular. Think I’d watch you guys watch grass grow. Lastly, the ending w the therapy stuff, Bravo. So important to take any stigma of therapy off the table. So happy for you guys and for Nate, I hope you guys have a great week and that it’s as wonderful as the both of you. 🙏❤️🙏
I had melanoma removed 3 years ago, I was 20. Crazy crazy.
I have myasthenia gravis. It flared last year, and has been an ongoing battle. I had a thymectomy via sternotomy last March and had major complications that landed me at Mayo Clinic. My whole life has changed. My nursing career is essentially over.....but hey, I can roast some really amazing coffee 🙂. Kara, your quote of Nate's grandfather REALLY hit home for me. It is 💯 truth! I'm daily finding silver linings in all of this, and finding value in little things in life. Some days are really hard, and some days are a little better......I'm learning to just roll with it. I'm so glad Nate is cancer free! I had cancer 9 years ago and those words, "we have clear boarders", is like music 🎶 to soul! So happy for your both....now onward to more adventures!
So glad it was a positive outcome and you are ok!!!!
My heart stopped reading video title 🥺 so glad to know everything is better now! Hats off to both of your mental strength last few months!!! ♥️Sending many prayers and love on your way♥️wishing a speedy recovery♥️take care and stay safe, love from Bangladesh!
So over dramatic,  omg.
Excited to see you coming to Canada!
Stay strong! Prayers
Well done Nate. You were very brave. I had a MOHLS procedure last year and that wait in the middle is horrid so I really felt for you. Great outcome. Stay well.
You got this Nate! I am extremely sorry to hear these news but I know that all will be fine. YOU are so strong
What did he have? BCC? If so, that’s fine just needed to cut it out. It’s not a big deal.
Glad to hear that got it all. Some bunches of years ago I had malenoma skin cancer on the back of my leg! It took a biopsy and 2 different cuts to get it out. Praise God no more cancer.
sorry broi hope it gets better
I'm happy to know you're doing good. Please take care of anything else you see ASAP next time if there is a next time. . my father's good friend has been struggling with skin cancer for years and it's gotten bad the last 2 years. It's just not something people talk about, and most cases aren't bad if dealt with quickly. Stay safe and wear sunscreen!! 🥰 Love to you and Kara!!
Oof
So relieved to know you are cancer free.  Things like this come as quite a shock. About twelve years ago I was diagnosed with a chronic neurological disorder with very little known about it. Over the past couple of years it has really taken a toll on my ability to move. Fortunately, I have a wonderful supportive husband. We are transitioning into a new phase in our lives and are determined to live our “best life” no matter what that looks like in the future. We have some big adventures planned and are looking forward to the future.  Keep enjoying your experiences and each other.  Sadly, I’m afraid it is too late for my ears. The damage was probably done when I was much younger. But if the time comes, maybe I can get reconstructive surgery. Think elf ears.
So glad you are ok. Prayers your way. Love you guys
Thanks for sharing. It helps others feel better about getting checked and protecting their skin.
Glad you shared this. A true-life story that many of us encounter. You are definitely not alone. Happy you got through and are fortunate to get positive results. Life is full of adventure and adversity. Stay strong, Kara would be the perfect support for you!
Wow Nate that was scary.  y'all handled it so well. I guess you never know what life will throw at you. We will be praying for healing and no more cancer ever again.
So very happy to hear the happy ending to a scary story.  Prayers to you both.
Haven’t watched yet but I saw a comment saying your fine? Please say you are   Edit: oh my so glad your ok Nate
God is the solution to all your problems 🙏 God bless ya'll
Stay healthy Nate… and Kara too…
so glad to hear youre okay nate! sending u both lots and lots of love and best health <3
That's a profound quote.
so please put aside the hamburger stuff and eat sth more healthy
It's because he got the vaccine and got covid tested
So happy to hear you are OK!! Remember the sunscreen on the ears👂🏻👂🏻
My heart shattered reading this. 🥺 My father died 6 years ago from skin cancer.  It's so real yall.   Nate, I'm so glad to know they are monitoring it and that Dr's think they have this all under control. Stick to those yearly appointments! Then as soon as you have ANY gut feeling that something feels weird. GET YOURSELF CHECKED!!   My father had a melanoma spot that was on his temple. He got it checked and removed. It was positive for being cancerous. But they cut it out and they were handling it. Cut to 5 years later...my dad complained of a persistent migraine. 6 months later he died from a brain aneurysm because the cancer spread to his brain.   TRUST YOU FREAKING GUT!!! All the positive vibes 💕
I want to say thanks for discussing your issue. Nate, glad your healthy. Realize that discussing your C, hopefully, someone will go to the doctor and get their issue checked and maybe it’ll save some pain later and maybe a life.  Keep on keeping on.
You’ll be ok ,my mom and dad both had cancer cells removed head face and chest. To much sun will make them  come back
Wow, Nate, that’s so scary BUT I was relieved when they said basal. I know that sounds weird to say but it grows so slowly and is the least serious.  I just had a Mohs surgery for a basal cell lesion last month and I can’t even tell you how scared of it I was. You were such a man! I was terrified of that darn “procedure”. And WHO came up with the doctor’s spiel describing it I want to know? “We’re going to cut out about 🤏🏻then we’re going to send it to the lab and if we haven’t got it all were going to take out 👉🏻 👈🏻 and do the same, then we will take out ✋🏻   🤚🏻 if we find that .....well, just plan on staying awhile.”
Aww guys thank goodness everything is ok. Xx
Don't worry, basal is the most common type and rarely a problem. I had some removed on my face like 10 years ago and that was it. My mom had a few and other than the cut out and light scarring, no other problems. The procedure wasn't bad, either.
🙌💪❤️
I guess even tho you're young,  cancer can pop up anywhere & any age. Everyone needs to get tested regularly by a dermatologist. Not a scare tactic...but a health tactic. The lady who cuts my hair was concerned about a bump I had for 10 years it turned out to be brain cancer..& I'm alright after 7 years taken out. But, I should of not of procrastinated so much & took the the tests sooner. Glad Kara made him do it! Kara needs to get a dermatologist check her out to regularly since they're outside a lot. Glad all is well..but, it's a wake up call to us all to take better care of ourselves & not to over look even the small things. 🙏🙏
Sending healing thoughts.  I'm sure just hearing the C word is terrifying.  Glad you're okay Nate xo
So glad you are okay.  Much love and respect . From South Island here in New Zealand. :)
What a wonderful thing for you guys to share. It can’t have been easy but by doing this, you not only let people know they’re not alone, but also to encourage people to get their skin checked. I live in Australia and this is a vital message to get through to people. Well done. You just might have saved someone’s life. xx
My heart kinda skipped a beat when I read the title.. I’m so glad you’re cancer free.. God bless
Congrats on the positive outcome, so happy for you both. It just goes to show how vulnerable and fragile our aging carcasses are. No fancy filters or glammed up posts can stop us being susceptible to life's ugly hurdles.
Nate, your intuition is not wrong, cancer is of a parasite nature. Several anti-parasitic drugs are used off label to treat it. Look into natural health, plenty of people reverse cancer, it's something that doesn't have to be a death sentence.
This really made me realize what a problem our health system is, specifically in these types of situations, Whatever happens, we will always be here for you: Nate & Kara, we love you to the moon and back!
Definitely wasn’t expecting this !!!!! So gLad you are you Nate and cancer free !!!!
Wear sunscreen! Everyone everywhere. No matter where you live. It’s much too common and can be so easily avoided! 🙏🏻
They have vacuums to pull smell out.
Thank you for sharing this with us.  Happy for the news of cancer-free.  I have a cousin, a few years shy of 40 that has had multiple skin cancer biopsies and surgeries.  My step-dad had to have a portion of an ear removed for his.  Don't ignore things your body is sharing with you.
I am so happy about this news. You two are beautiful people and hopefully have 70 years ahead of you! SUNSCREEN!!
Thank you for sharing your authentic selves with us! You have no idea how many people you have impacted. I made my husband watch because I have a hard time getting him to wear sunscreen. He promised to get a recurring scab on his head checked out! We love you guys! ❤️
So glad you had it treated and you're on the mend. That would be a sensitive area to heal with sleeping and washing. I had the same thing on my forehead. Several years ago I was told it was eczema. I just had the same procedure this summer...not fun...  feel better soon.
Welcome to the club. We have had several cancers and a bunch of benign. Wear broad brimmed hats, both of you!
Empathy from another person that had a BCC cut out from my forehead - the smell of burning is really not pleasant :-( I had 60 stitches as the plastic surgeon did a weird cut to fill the hole...and was worried that I would look like Frankenstein but the skills of the surgeon were amazing. Cannot even see the scar now unless you look really hard. I use a moisturiser with a built in SPF every morning now - easy to make it part of the routine. Best wishes for a speedy recovery!
Bless your heart 🙏🏻✝️🙏🏻!  Have a blessed healing 🙌🏻
Kara is SOOOOOOO ANNOYING and she wouldn’t be shit without Nate and that’s a fact !! And that says a hell of a lot coming from a 77 year old great grandmother like myself !! Keep it up Nate !
I've had 5 basal cells removed at this point (I'm 39). I'm also a PA, so I know it when I see it. Basically, if you have a spot that never heals, it's probably cancer. You'll likely get more in the coming years, so get an annual skin check!
What they don’t tell you is that the spot will itch for a long time after ( like years). I had one removed on my back
Omg I almost cried knowing that my favourite youtuber channel wish that it dose not come back just all my love from Victoria Australia
I really hope you are doing better Nate 🙏🏼 sending prayers, and wish you great health in the future ❤️
Sending so much love and prayers your way ❤️❤️
Praise God 👏
Oof
Cuz
Cuz
I've had numerous Basal cell carcinomas removed. Be glad it wasn't melanoma. Don't mean to downplay it but not unusual for someone my age who grew up never using sun tan lotion. I'm 63 and nobody used suntan lotion in the 60s. Also spent years in the sun playing sports.
I haven't been ok for 15 years. 😞  I just want to be healthy and not suffer.
Heavenly Farther, Lord, protect this family and all their loved ones. May they countinue to enjoy life and live honering you. May the  wound be healed in your name god, so they can give you all the glory and all praise. Amen  Love you guy so much your always make my day thanks guys
This is so strange because I was watching one of your older videos last night and you both appeared to have a bit of sunburn. I'm twice your age and kind of a mama bear type and I was thinking, "oh I hope those two are careful about sunscreen". (you probably are). I'm happy you got through this with flying colours and I am so sorry for the scare you both just had. I've had one of those benign follicle tumours removed from my head just recently and three malignant, but non-dangerous, removed from my legs so I know how traumatic it can be. Big hugs to both of you and thank you so much for sharing your adventures (both good and bad) with us. Your channel is, hands down, my absolute favorite.
You'll be totally fine, do not worry aboit anything,i adore you guys and God will keep you both safe. Stay blessed ❤❤❤
So glad to hear all is good..
Welcome to the cancer club.  Good health to you.
My uncle developed skin cancer about fifteen years ago. He was a long time outdoor labourer, working with concrete most of his adult life. He battled it for just over two years before given a clean bill of health. He and my aunt just celebrated their 45th wedding anniversary. I am a huge fan of your vlog and channel. I send all my thoughts and prayers and love from Alberta, Canada. 🇨🇦💜✌🏼
I hope you get better my mom was also diagnosed (sorry dont know how to spell) with skin cancer 2 weeks ago but I hope Nate gets better and has a good recovery. Love your  videos.
I really appreciate how you guys take the time to “be real” with everyone. Over the years, I fell in love and as much as I loved your overseas adventures, the ones on the Homefront have been starkly different but in the best way possible. I love your guys adventures.   Thank you for being vulnerable with us. Also, Kara is such an awesome cheerleader. I’m so glad Nate had someone so supportive like that during this rough time!
My husband and I love y'all and this channel! So happy you are better now Nate! Will continue to pray for y'all! Thank you for sharing and being vulnerable with us. It takes guts! Sending all of the best positive uplifting vibes your way! ❤️❤️
This was supportive to see because I just had this done on September 22 on a spot between my right nostril and lip. I was also the youngest in the office.  I learned that a support friend/boyfriend is super crucial- i was by myself-the procedure was pretty intense.  I'm healing up and feeling good a week and a half now.  I'm so happy you had Kara!
This is why we love you guys.  Putting out the truth so that it might help or encourage others . . . kudos to your courage.  Here is to hoping a life is saved by this episode.
Thank you for sharing 💜
Hooray and Praise God!!
Nooo not Nate being touched by cancer, not one of the youtubers who make me happy, my mom and dad have both been touched by it, its a horrible thing and you dont deserve it, you’re such a kind man, but thank god its not life threatening, love ya. happy that you healed, wishing you good health nate, and sending you n kara hugs always.
I hope you don't die cuz your amazing you have a wife or gf ✨ But my heart stopped then I seen this video I hope you feel better ✨
I had a 1 inch piece of skin taken off my leg, cancerous.  But no treatment, they got it all. However then I did get breaat cancer with great margins and radiation.  Now cancer free. You're going to be fine. Prayers for you all.
So glad Nate is ok. Take care you two and keep sending me on vitual adventures with you!
Thank you for sharing! Wishing many years of health and happiness for you both!
that time variance authority touch in your timelines is awesome tho
Thanks be to God. So glad you're OK.
Glad Nate is doing well.  It has been a long time and medicine has progressed, but we lost an amazing Uncle to Melanoma.  At the time, it seems to all happen fast between diagnosis and the funeral, we later learned there were signs for longer than we knew. I am glad Nate finally had this checked and will keep in top of mind (sorry, could NOT resist!!) Glad Nate is heathy and doing fine, and thank you for sharing.  It is not easy to be that raw, but it does help spark conversation and THAT is a win!
Thank you for sharing this part of your life Nate. Thank you for being strong Kara. Made me teary when they called to say you’re all clear!!! Yay!! More travels and can’t wait to see Canada vlogs!   But I should’ve read your pinned first! It was very suspense watching it hehe.
My best wishes and thoughts I hope you get better
Did yall take a pic 2 years ago or even before he went into have it removed? If so can u share it so we can see what something like that would look like incase we have the same thing happen.  Thanks
I open my youtube and the first thing on my wall is this video, my heart skipped a beat and I was so scared to even play this video but when I did I could just say two things by the end of it, THANK GOD HE IS SAFE!!! and I DID NOT EXPECT KARA TO BE THIS CALM AND COMPOSED. I am falling in love with you two more and more! Please take care! Lots of love <3
So glad Nate is okay!!!
Wow that saying is so true!! Currently going through a chronic health issue that is inhibiting my life in ways I never could have imagined. So thank you for keeping it real and allowing us a peek into a vulnerable and difficult part of your lives! So much love and so thankful that Nate is now cancer free!
I’m so happy to see that Nate is good. We are very thankful that you guys shared this. I know it must be hard but you guys are such an inspiration in every good or bad aspect of life.
Sorry you are going through this as someone with Melanoma I understand how each biopsy and removal really hurts the psyche - wear your sunscreen everyone 🥰
'Local anesthetic '...
Stay strong.
Skin cancer in New Zealand is so common, my Dad both my Nanas, pops have all had lumps removed. You be fine
Sending you both prayers! 🙏🏻
So glad this is all behind you now.  Been a long time carrying that stress.  Now let the healing begin!!
So happy you’re recovering Nate! Sending all the healing vibes to my fave travel couple!
Because nothing says skin cancer like paid promotional content. What a bunch of money grubbing clowns.
Youll be fine! Keep a positive attitude! Love you guys!
I had went to the dermatologist in 2017 to have a mole looked at. She removed the mole and did two biopsy like you well the second biopsy showed that it was cancerous. So they sent me to md Anderson here in Houston to have surgery to remove the mass and some lymph node’s to see if it had spread to the lymph nodes well it spread to my lymph nodes so they did a full body work up for scans to see if it had spread any where else I had an mri with and without contrast and I had a ct scan with and with out contrast well the ct scan showed I not only had stage 4 melanoma but that I also had stage to kidney cancer and the mri showed that the melanoma had spread to my brain so we had radiation to the brain and I had to be put in a halo and be put in a radiation machine for 5 1/2 hours six weeks later I had an ablation surger on my kidney where they had to burn it so bf they could burn the tumor on my kidney they had to go in through my bladder to put In a Saline shunt to shoot water to the parts of the kidney that was not bein burned so when they went in to put that shunt in they took a scope to like around in my bladder to see if there was any tumors there well sure enough there was they did a biopsy and it came back as stage one bladder cancer so took treatment every two weeks for a full year and I am proud to say that I am cancer free in all areas and we rang the bell this past May a day bf my daughter turned 10 and I give God all the glory
hope you get better!
Praying for you guys!!
We love you, Kara and Nate! So relieved that all is well and Nate is cancer free! Prayers of comfort, health, and peace to you! ♥️
I was tearing up the whole episode because I was anticipating bad news.  I'm so relieved and happy that Nate is ok.  Now get back out there and enjoy life!  Don't forget your sunscreen folks!
So good,that the cancer is gone🙏🏻!!! When you guys are in Canada you should come to Vancouver island it is like the Canadian version of Hawaii, except for the rain and slight cold but beautiful none the less!!!
I feel like I really know you, and I'm grateful for your friendship.  ( From Matthew's friend, Tara.)
Yehey! Nate is cancer free! Thank God! Tc and keep safe Kara and Nate!
Get heart skin checks now guys especially with all the crazy stuff you’ve been doing!
Ok
Always ask for more numbing of it’s hurting they can do that!
Send your prayers for Nate.
Oh wow, so glad you’re ok! What a relief for y’all. Blessings to you both!
Lmao
Don’t stress to much mate, we get them cut out all the time in Aus - if it looks sus, we get it cut out don’t even bother with biopsies because you’re just prolonging the time. Better safe then sorry :) I’ve had so many cut out and it’s honestly the earlier the easier it is to be cut out and get to before it turns into cancer. It’s sooo common here.  You can always ask for a sedative if you’re nervous :)
So glad everything is alright. Didn’t think this would make me cry. Good bless !!
🙏 glad to know it's all ok, I enjoy your Canada visit with A&B🤗 awesome video
Tips from Australia, the skin cancer capital of the world. Wear a HAT with a BRIM not a baseball cap and if you are outside and sweating, redo your sun block every 2 hours. Stay safe in the ☀️.
My Grandfather had skin cancer on the tip of his ear. He had it cut out and it healed nicely. The doc said he should wear more than just a baseball cap when he went fishing and to use sunscreen on his balding areas. I hope you heal as quickly and are skin cancer free. Take care.
So glad you didn’t have melanoma! My dad and husband had the same skin cancer as you and after having theirs removed they haven’t had any recurrence or new ones ! So glad you got the correct diagnosis and had it taken care of. Very scary. Really makes you appreciate good health💕
I just had the same procedure done but under my nail ♥️
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
So happy you are cancer free❤️❤️ but wait, Canada?😲 I’d love to know where I live in Newfoundland🇨🇦
skin cancer survivor here - basil cell cancer about 8 years ago and well as the more serious malignant melanoma 30 years ago (still have a nice scar from that one).  Annual visits to the dermatologist to catch anything that pops up and live your life using sun screen and/or good hats, clothes that cover
Great news that you are okay! Heal quickly Nate!
Hi nate glad you took the time to find out about the cancer I know that mine was let go to long and I have the scars to show for. It was not my choice but the MD . I am like you cancer free try to keep your self safe and out of the sun love your blog next time get one of the small portable air-conditioning unit .  You just add water and it will take the air down to 70 percent you find. It on Google. Stay safe
Glad you are cancer free!  I think it’s great you posted about it.  You are young for skin cancer and your experience may encourage another younger person to get a spot or bump checked out!  Good job!!
So glad you are okay!!  Stay strong and positive!   PS: my aesthetician said don’t use any SPF over 50 because it acts the reverse
thank god nate is good kara you so strong god bless you both
CLICKBAIT TITLE - TASTELESS - DISGUSTING - DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR PINNED NOTE! ATTENTION SEEKING - HORRID!! - UNSUBSCRIBED! YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES!
Click bait ass title. Officially unsubscribing cuz of that
You guys are my favorite and I’m glad that he’s alright. Y’all are such a fantastic example of a supportive and strong couple ❤️
I’m Glad you are keeping on top of it. That’s how you beat it. My mother died of breast cancer in 1986. The DR. Insisted I get a mammogram.  That saved me in 1986. I had surgery and found I had cancer at Stage less than I. Four years after later I got a suspicious mammogram. I had surgery again.  The first was in 1986 and the second in 1991.  I had reconstructive surgery and I have had followups.  I’ve been negative.  Stay on top of it.   I really wish you the best.  Just stay aware.!!!!    💕💕🙏
Praying 🙏 for your recovery and so happy to hear you are cancer free. 😀👍🙏
Glad you are cancer free!
If you are going to Canada...you gotta visit Quebec city...and taste Cretons....so good!
I hate reading when people say that they have cancer but so glad you are being public about this.  Too many people do not talk about their cancers. I was diagnosed with stage 1 colorectal cancer. It was the most difficult issue in my life. I was very open about it and had such great support. You have our support. Please take car and heal quickly and thank you for sharing
i dont know you, but get well soon 😁
I had a BCC removed from my scalp years ago. I then had to have more surgery on my scalp, because there were some cells left over from the first surgery.I was put under full anaesthetic.  I now have a weird hair line. My doctor told me that I have a higher chance of getting skin cancer on other parts of my body.  I have to have a skin check every 12 months. Glad you had it removed Nate. Take care.
I am so glad you are okay. I got the video notification while I was driving and my heart literally stopped,  love you guys.
Can’t imagine a Sunday without a Kara and Nate video ..happy to hear Nate is 👍🏽..
So glad that Nate is better. When Kara was sharing how much  was taken  out of his head.  i was eating popcorn and that did not go well. LOL
So glad you are cancer free. Just got diagnosed with cancer myself and am terrified of what comes next-so it is nice to hear success stories.
Been going through metastatic melanoma since February currently in the ICU because of a seizure turns out it's a spread to my brain staying hopefull but I take inspiration from you guys and hope to go on adventures like y'all
🥰🥰, so happy you are well.
So glad for good news! 👍🏻
I'm perplexed by the downvotes, but I guess I shouldn't be. I'm not going to make this an "Oh, yeah - well that's nothin'!" post, but let's just say that I've experienced something similar, with a more comprehensive recovery plan. The long and the short is, the diagnosis and treatments were WAY more difficult on my awesome wife of 30+ years than they were on me. Yes, I went through some massive chemo doses and a stem cell transplant, but her path was still more difficult, so Kara's position is much respected. Anyway, I'm grateful that your diagnosis was what it was, and we all appreciate your candor in sharing the process.
Sending you hugs and prayers for a speedy recovery. Glad you got it taken care of. ♥️🙏🏼
Wishing you both many happy years to wear your crowns!  Sending love!
i'm amazed at the number of people who think the won't need surgery in their life at least once.....
Hold her tight and tell her you love her with all you heart.
extremely thankful that you are okay and cancer free 🤍
I hope 🤞 everything goes well for you sir
It is very painful to hear this, but happy that you are recovering,  you will soon come out of all this
You will be fine buddy.  Good wishes from whole of India..
stay strong nate <3
Glad you are ok. And thank you for sharing. I am actually waiting for my results as well for skin cancer. Hope I get some good news as well. 🤞
We will be praying for you ❤️❤️
So glad that you are alright!
So glad to hear you are okay! 🙏🏼
So happy Nate is OK!!! I was so worried when I saw this! I love watching you guys and your adventures! Praying for many more beautiful exciting adventures that you can keep sharing with us! ♥️
Wow after that long great to hear! Take care of yourselves ♥️
So glad Nate is ok. My father and sister had skin cancer and took care of it,  my case i found out in 2020 that I had a tumor on my right kidney and it was cancer. The tumor was 10cm and my kidney came out this year on March, I'm still waiting if they got all the cancer. Its very scary the C word 😳
idfc
Ditto on the SPF. I have not been a sunbather for about 20 years now and 2 years ago, I had a huge cancer spot removed on the front of my shoulder. It was more than likely all the years of trying to get that perfect golden tan. It’s not worth it. Please take care of your skin. It’s our largest organ. I’m so glad you got this taken care of. Well wishes.
All the best to a speedy recovery.  Glad things went well for you Nate.
Good to hear that Nate is officially cancer free!!! Also know that I'm walking with your in prayer.
So happy that Nate is okay....!!!
Noo your fans will support u
Where here for you and good to hear you are doing good
Praying for you❤️❤️
Heal fast Nate waiting to see your next adventure time in Mississauga Ontario Canada waiting to see your Vlog here
SENDING LOVE!!!! <3
I've had numerous instances of basal cell cancer on various parts of my body, including the head. Some of the cancers were treated using the Mohs system. I'd like to reassure viewers that none of my visits produced anything but the slightest pain.  [With one exception: a cancer on my ear really hurt after the anesthesia wore off. I was told by a friend that, since the ear is really close to your brain, and there are nerves running from the ear inside your skull, there can be strong pain.]  All the other times I had basal cell cancer removed, there was no pain, or only a slight pain after the anesthesia wore off. I will have to admit, though, that this may be the result of the fact that my dermatologist is very, very good at sticking the needle in to administer the anesthesia. He does it very, very slowly, and so once he's pushed the needle in a very slight bit, it no longer hurts as he pushed it in further, since the numbing occurs immediately.  So.. bottom line. It's likely that you may  NOT have any of the pain that this guy reports. Good luck!
The most annoying thing in this video is if u want this press 1, if u want that press 2
Jesus loves you.
My dad dealt with basal cell skin cancer because during his younger years never wore sunscreen. He lived to the age of 87 until 2014. He died from natural causes. The doctor gave you good advice about sunscreen and hats.
I have watched every video you have done. You are the friends whose lives we are invested in becasue we have been watching you for so long but have never actually met! It's crazy that for not knowing someone you feel for them and I ven got teary eyed at the phone call from the Dr. - I am so happy to read that Nate is ok!
Been with you since country #31 you can't go anywhere Nate !
“Good health is a crown on a well man’s head that only sick people can see” what an incredible quote. Could not be more true. Prayers to you both! If it helps, my grandfather beat cancer twice and proceeded to live another 30 years til the young age of 85. Chin up! God bless y’all!
Prayers for you continued health for the both of you, thank you for showing this so maybe more folks will get spots checked and not wait too long out of fear.  Been the last few years to dermatologist and had ore cancer  spots on face from sunburns in my youth but I stay on top of it now and plenty of spf and hats!!! 👍❤️
I watch y’all all the time for a few years now & I usually write comments every once & a blue moon under your videos. But I just really want to thank you for sharing this. I’ve had the scar that came out of nowhere over a year ago & it hasn’t healed or gone away & so this helped me to make the decision to get it checked out. Love you guys! Glad Nate is okay! I live in Florida & I never wear SPF so I need to do better.
Thanks for the way you did this.  So many people forget that cancer doesn’t pick who it effects and people like you two who have a pretty cool life are not exempt. Way to be strong and send a positive message.
I'm so relieved Nate is Cancer Free!!!
Nate and Kara, I am so so so glad to see Nate is finally out of danger. Been Crying all throughout this video and been praying for him. I have my uncle passed away a decade ago due to cancer and have had bad memories since then but I am so so so happy and emotional at the same time. Please take care of your self Nate. I will continue praying for your good health :-)
I'm glad you're okay
Thanks for sharing this—we are so happy that all is ok!
I love you guys so much. I'm so happy that you're okay Nate!
So happy that you are cancer free.
On an unrelated note, anyone know where I can get this hat?
Glad you are okay Nate!!
Nate. this was a Heartfelt reminder that there are so many types of Health Issues People of any Age have to deal with. So it was Touching that you Shared your Situation with so many that follow your Channel. keep your chin up and know this is a stark Reminder.
Thank heavens you're ok!  Please keep that head covered from now on.  Got it? Good.❤
Glad you are okay Nate!
I had squamous cell removed from my nose and then had to have plastic surgery after. I had mohs done as well. Thankfully I only had to do it twice when they did the Mohs.
My husband actually told me this morning before I knew you posted "I don't want you to freak out and get upset when you see Kara and Nate's new video. Nate's fine, he had skin cancer and it was removed and he is fine".   Honestly, even with his reassurances that Nate was fine, my heart still dropped.  Nobody ever wants to hear the "C" word.  I can imagine your fear these last few months and I'm so happy that you're okay.  My grandmother years ago had a spot on her nose that was skin cancer and had the spot removed and she's going to be 90 in January and is completely fine. Kara, you were a trooper and so strong for Nate when I can only imagine the fear you felt inside.  When you got the call that all was well and you teared up, I teared up as well.   Enjoy Canada, wear your sunscreen and a hat and have fun!  Love you both!!!
So glad it was good news.  Thanks for sharing your story, I'm sure it will speak to and help others.
So glad it worked out well for you!
God is with you 🤍 stay strong , have faith and pray ✨💪 🥺
wow not the best time in MY LIFE to see this video because I was bawling within the first minute of the video for reasons i'm not going to go into. But! I'm super happy for the positive turn out for you guys. Stay safe!
"Slip, Slop, Slap, Seek, Slide" is a sun care mantra that every Aussie & Kiwi kid has grown up with and it's been around since the 80s :) It means - Slip on a shirt, Slop on some sunscreen, Slap on a hat, Seek some shade, and Slide on some sunglasses. Five things that are equally important for sun protection!
OMFG!
A good reminder to thank God for your health and the blessings he gives every day.  Glad Nate is ok!
Thank you for sharing your story. I hope it helps people get checked out! Wear sunscreen!!
This was so important to share.just gotta say thank you .just thank thank you.happy safe travels guys.;)
Nate to help the the hatefulness of needles just get some medicine to calm you down before it happens it really does help man hope everything works out for you
Had me in tears. Skin cancer is not joke. On to more living life now...not later.
I'm so very happy you're as alright!!!
My grandpa has half of his ear cut off part of his cheek cut of and multiple other surgeries it could always be worse glad you are ok love your guys channel once things calm down maybe I could explore with you it would be a dream come true
Slip-Slop-Slap https://youtu.be/b7nocIenCYg
So glad you are ok Nate, hugs to Kara too!!!
ahahaaha not Kara still making Nate drive after his biopsy LOL
I am proud of Nate and both of u guys for taking the situation a good way and taking care of hope u good recovery
Here in Australia we have the highest rate of skin cancer in the world. Annual checks are part of life. It's always good to constantly get checked
At first I was angry at the potential click bait title, but the introduction is redeeming! Best wishes for continual good health checks!
Glad Nate is ok, Glad you guys are taking it easy. Sending all the love to you guys <3
So happy that all is well. I work in the medical field, and all too often I see patients who have ignored small things until they become major problems. Kudos to both of you for staying on top of this and not ignoring it. Looking forward to watching all of your adventures. Welcome to Canada! For goodness sake, can you try to come here in the summer!?!
You guys are gonna be fine :)
Nate, I'm glad everything went well.  I too have had basal cell carcinoma on my head at a very young age.  Once you do have it, you will know what to look for.  The quicker you get it diagnosed, the smaller the mohs surgery spot/scar you will have.  I'm now in my early 50s and I have had a total of 3.  Best of Luck with you and Kara.  Definitely wear that sunscreen!!
So glad Nate is doing better and had the surgery to remove the growth. Cancer can be sudden and very scary so glad he got the surgery done before anything got worse or the cancer spread. 🥳🥳🥳🥳🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Use the law of attraction
No wonder the big bandage on his head last time. Nate, if you can travel to 100 countries and survive, then you got this! It'll just be a small bump in your journey called "Life"! ❤❤❤
Time to change the title to... "I had skin cancer"! Happy that the procedure went well and that you are in the clear! I had a similar experience and learned that I needed to drastically change my diet, otherwise, precancerous growths would keep coming back. Many people think that the sun is to blame for skin cancer, but it's really our internal environment and chemistry reacting to the sun that's responsible for manifesting cancer. To prevent more from occurring in the future, reduce inflammatory food and drink as well as personal care products. Keep it as natural and organic as possible. Wishing you nothing but health, epic adventures, and all the happiness in the world with Kara
Wow what a title..God bless u anyway he can
My thumbs up was really a heart. Prayers for you Nate!!
Glad to know you are doing fine. Prayers for speedy recovery and Kara is so brave...blessing to you both...welcome to Canada
🙏🙏🙏
Yay for great news ❤️
I have had a couple basal cell carcinomas in the past. one very close to my left eye. They were all removed. The one by my eye they put in about 20 or so stitches. They  cannot be seen now. Have a new one lower and further away from the eye. Will go to see my dermatologist in a few weeks and he will remove it as he is a surgeon as well. Later this week I will  go to see my ophthalmologist for a check up on my right cornea. There were scratches on it so he needs to see if they are gone or worse. If worse then it will need to be replaced. Then I will go see my dermatologist.
Glad Nate is ok. Yep, your grandpa is a wise man - health is everything. In Australia, we have the highest rates of skin cancer in the world because too many people don't put sunblock on or more importantly don't wear the appropriate hats. Baseball caps are a waste of space. You need to get a hat that is rated spf 50+ and that has a rim that covers your ears. Stay safe
Well I’ll be rescheduling my appointment for my dermatologist tomorrow! Need an all over check but have a bump that sticks up on my head like a pimple. Will definitely be getting that checked out too!  Many blessings to you both and to Nate for being Cancer Free and for y’all sharing this!! 🙏🏻
That’s such A WONDERFUL News!!!!!!!   Congrats!!  Keep caring for each other and especially your health.  Great Day for u both!
I wish the best of luck to you
If you've had the Fauci ja b, you would be well served to have a full immune panel and see how well your killer T cells are working to avoid  future C.  God bless.
Soooo happy to hear Nate is going to be alright! Scary stuff for sure! I really should make an appointment to see a dermatologist as well. I have a few “ spots” just to be safe I should get checked.Thank You Nate and Kara for being so brave to tell your story. I’m sure you have inspired a lot of people to take that first step to call their dr’s.Thank you. Going to Canada hey? ( Notice I didn’t say “Eh”, as I am Canadian! 😉) Come visit us out West! Love to have you!Take Care! 🇨🇦🇨🇦
Mr. Neal is full of wisdom!  Thank you for your transparency and for sharing this part of your lives.  Making this video is helping more than you will probably ever realize.  Good job!  (If you get a chance, please tell Nate's grandparents that "Mr. Bob" from TRBC says hello.)
So glad you are cancer free.  In 2017 I was diagnosed with stage 3 lung cancer.  Went thru all the treatments, radiation, chemo and immunotherapy.  Now I am cancer free.  Will get checked once a year for the rest of my life also.  I know where you are coming from.  Stay strong is my motto!!  Love you guys!!!
Thanks for sharing, I went for the same thing. Just be sure to keep getting check in with.  Congrats
I know it’s not always easy to put yourselves and your adventures out to the public. The world is full of so many kind people but also some stinky ones too. Thank you so much for sharing this part of your personal life, you encourage others to be fearless and adventurous, and now you encourage people to be fearless when it comes to scary health issues. Thank you for continuing to inspire us in all levels. I am so relieved that all turned out well!!
So happy mates ok
Hey listen to this song to feed you up great night by need to breath
Skin cancer is no joke.  I really like that you made this video...My Uncle died from Melanoma..so I am so glad that you took care of it.  I am glad that you all love each other enough to listen to each other.  That is why I watch your channel.  I love how much you love each other and trust each other.
So glad to hear that you are doing good
I’m so sorry Nate! Hope that your wound heals
Praying for both of you. 🙏🙏 Thanks for sharing.
I’m disabled and this YouTube series is how I get to see the world. Thank you for bringing us along on your journey I’ve learned and grown so much watching you guys and I’m so happy you’re both in good health. I wouldn’t wish sickness or injury on anyone.
I guess it just goes to prove to everyone....how important our health is....and that no one is immune....so important that you shared...because, you have such a huge global following....that you will undoubtedly save lives....so thank you...x
I’m so sorry. As a cancer survivor, watching those phone calls waiting for biopsy results really sent back me to some scary times. Great job taking care of yourself! I’m going to be better about sunscreen. :)
I was sad when I saw the title of your video.  But if you had to choose a skin cancer (or any cancer, for that matter), basal cell is the one to have.  It never really causes any problem except cosmetic issues, unless you ignore it.  If you looked on line, you can probably find a huge number of photos of people who have had disfiguring surgeries because they ignored the problem for years.  You have had it taken care of, and it shouldn't be a problem for you.  Basal cell cancers develop because of extended, unprotected sun exposure.  The problem is that melenoma, a much more dangerous form of skin cancer is caused by the same exposure.  People with basal cell cancer are probably at higher risk of developing melenoma, because they are caused by the same exposure.  The take home message is:  Avoid excess sun exposure, coverup while in the sun (wide-brim hats, long sleeves, etc), use sunscreen religiously, and perform regular skin checks yourself, or have them done by a dermatologist.  You have a great platform to spread the word!
New title... cancer survivor
I’m so glad everything worked out in Nate’s favour. I had a chuckle when Nate “ yelled” at the doctor. In Australia we would have screamed, swore and every thing else. As my city is currently in lockdown ( longest lockdown in the world) watching your videos give me hope that we will get out and travel once again
Happy for you two, thank God is old news now, live strong.
I know a friend who had skin cancer, he said it wasnt that bad removing it
Thank you for sharing something so deeply personal, it was sad to watch and had me crying almost from the beginning to end.  Sending you both love.
I don't need "click bait" to watch anything that y'all share with us. This title broke my heart. I have followed y'all for Soo long. Before y'all hit 50 countries. Then you hit 100 countries. As you go to your 100th y'all hit 1 million. It seems like it was overnight when y'all hit 2 million. I love y'all and always will. My heart and prayers are with y'all.
So sorry that happened to you man
Omg I opened up YouTube to this. I’m heartbroken for you both, I hope you recover well nate. Loads of love to you guys  💙💙
So happy to hear you cancer free. Nate I will continue to pray for you. God Bless you my friend
This video made us realise how deeply we’ve got attached to you both. Even though you have told you’re fine…we feel sad and deeply concerned, triggered some serious anxiety.. Sending love from India..
wear sunscreen you guys!!! y’all are always outside 😩😩
I am so sorry that you had to go through something so scary, Nate, but my heart could not be more happy that you're ok!!
Never wanted something to be clickbait so bad.
Hi Nate, the best thing for you to do at this point is to use RSO (rick simpson oil) it will help get rid of the skin cancer. I wish a speedy recovery for you man, keep ya head up!
I have no clue who you are but am so glad you beat it gj and I'm so happy for you
Thanks for sharing Nate!
Continuing prayers.
Good to hear that you are fine, Nate. Looking forward for more youtube videos from both of you. God bless...
What a huge relief guys, so happy for you 🙌❤️❤️❤️❤️🇦🇺
So Sorry
I’m so glad everything is ok. Nate is a champ Being awake for that. And Kara is as well for seeing it happen. I hope you have a speedy recovery ❤️‍🩹
Had the same surgery right below my eye about 8 years ago. So far so good!! It wasn't to bad. If your going to get cancer, its better then most of them... welcome to the purple shirt club. (ACS relay for life cancer survivor tshirt color.)
The main concern with skin cancer is that it is NOT melanoma.   I have had 17 skin cancers and all basal cell or squamous cell.  They have all been removed, with 2 of them still healing over some 40 years of dealing with this.  They have to get all the cells so sometimes they are wider and other times they are deeper.  Not to worry.  You are young, so you will need to be examined every year or two.
I'm so happy for the great outcome! 🙏
Since we're on the topic of cancer I'd like to share something. A few years ago during a routine x-ray of my lungs the radiologist found a black spot. I've never been a smoker but I was exposed  to a lot of 2nd hand smoke as a kid, my dad was a chain smoker, which eventually killed him. I also spent much of the '90s around friends who smoked. The doctor was concerned it might be lung cancer and ordered a CT scan. I'd have to wait 2 weeks for the results. It was a LONG 2 weeks. During that time I did some reading and found out that by the time a lung cancer shows up on an x-ray it's already too late and most people have maybe a year and a half to live. So I called up those friends I'd been around who smoked and urged them to talk to their doctors about getting a CT scan. It would be really easy to say that I saved someone's life by doing that but to be honest I'm not sure any of them took my warning to heart and got the CT scan. I've lost touch with a lot of them but the ones I'm still in contact with are all okay. Still, I caution any of you who smoke or were around a lot of 2nd hand smoke to talk to your doctors about getting a CT scan to be safe.  BTW, the black spot on my lungs was from something benign.
526 haters (as of my posting this comment). I definitely don't have thick enough skin for a Youtube channel. Pun intended. Why would 526 people click "dislike"? Did they want Nate to be terminal?? Anyway, glad you are ok Nate, and sorry for the haters.
holy fucking shit
Green tea Wet tea bags
I've watched many videos of these two, and I can see how Kara is such a crybaby, I don't know if it's the right term for it, but I just want to say  Kara did great. She had to stay strong all through out, and SHE DID! and I love how it turned out and Nate is now healed! These two are just amazing and really grateful for their lives. Please continue to inspire people and TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF PLEASE! <3
As soon as I saw this I started praying for you. My mom had skin cancer, and she's also cancer-free. I am so happy for you! God is good!
so glad nate is ok. i am a subscriber from indonesia and i love what you do. The fact that you guys want to share this story is so bold and I really really appreciate it. You guys awesome and i am so grateful that you guys are OK. Stay safe n helathy kara and nate
A little too dramatic for me only because my husband’s been through it twice it’s not that serious if you catch it in time and very treatable.
🙏🙏
Nate may God continue to keep y’all safe with health lives❤️❤️☺️
Good news F cancer
My heart sank reading this. Take care
Anyone else crying a lot ??
My mom has had Mohs surgery 28 times on her face. She is 93. I have been there for over half of them. We joke she is having a face lift one spot at a time. Take care of yourself Nate and each other!
SOOOOO GLAD YOU ARE OKAY.  YOU KNOW WHAT, I AM GOING TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT FOR A THING THAT NEVER GOES AWAY ON MY ARM.  THANKS FOR SHARING WITH US AND BEING SO HONEST.
is it clikbait or what? wth?! seriously
K this had me concerned. I'm so glad it turned out okay. This vid did prompt me to call my dermatologist in the morning. I've had a scabby spot on the top of my head for almost a year. friends say it doesn't look like anything. but, they aren't doctors! Thanks for the push and the thing about SPF on the ears! I'm bald and frequently forget the ears! Love you both. Stay safe!
when there actually is serious news it wont get posted on here until weeks later....stop clickbating
I feel so bad....I hope u recover soon ....and come back strong I love u ❣️
Thank you for being transparent and vulnerable with your situation!  It is good to see honest people who share the good/bad/ugly!  It was brave of you both to film this and put it out there for us to see.
About 20 years ago I had two basal cell carcinomas, one on my collar bone the other on the tip of my nose. I was given two choices for treatment. Surgery or Aldera cream. I went with the Aldara cream. I used a tooth pick to apply a tiny drop on the area and rub it in. The advantage of using Aldara is that it promotes your body into attacking the cancer and basically, eating it up. It took a couple of months in my case for it to do it's job, which means the entire time I had bandages on my collar and the tip of my nose. Afterwards I had an indentation on my nose but over the years it as filled in and looks back to normal. There's only a tiny patch of skin on my collar bone to show where that cancer had been.  I'm glad things went well for you but being outdoors so much you'll have to become a fanatic about using sun block and the higher the better since you're exposed all day long in some of your adventures. Higher altitudes also means more UV rays and even an overcast day has enough UV to burn the skin.
Just replace the skin then :  )
🙏🏼🙏🏼
I am so thankful your skin cancer free!!!
Glad he’s better
thank you for sharing this journey with everyone. you're helping to spread awareness of skin cancer. keeping yall in my prayers.
Awesome news! I hope I get to watch you guys traveling through your old ages!
so glad you are okay I really look up to you guys and how much love and support you give each other.
You got a biopsy? And let them tell you it’s cancer?? That’s hilarious.  Doctors wear butcher coats for a reason. Your body would have fixed that for ya. But now it’s gonna freak the eff out. Haha “all clear” omg they scammed you big time. Idiots.
My husband had a similar experience with skin cancer. It was so aggressive he had chemo and radiation. Glad all is well. When we don’t have our health we have nothing.
its so funny since covid is over all the youtubers are now posting cancer scares....its the new trend..well done
We had a peek at one of the biopsies wounds in the dome episode
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🐾
So so happy you are OK, Nate! I teared up a bit worried about the results.  Thank you for sharing. This is very important for people to know especially for the area you had it which I'm sure not very many people check often since it is not easily visible. God bless you! ❤
Glad you are cancer free. Been through that procedure a number of times the past 10 years. Driving with the window open is killing the left side of my face. SPF and hats are your life now. Make sure to have any small thing looked at...its the ones that you don't think about that that doctor sees while looking at the one you think is important.
I’m sorry
Lmao
Praying for you, Nate.
I’ve had bladder cancer for 13 months.
Had a lipoma on the back of my neck. Being awake during surgery is wierd. You feel all the tugging through the rest of your body. Glad you're OK! Thanks for sharing this.
huh, i guess being black/brown is useful
Thanks for sharing this.  I had this exact situation.  I had a scab on the top of my head for several months. Unfortunately the Mohs procedure was an all day procedure for me  as the had to keep cutting to get it all.  I wound up with a fair size bald spot and slightly misshapen.   The wound was too large to effectively stitch back up again.  But 7 years later all is good and my slightly longish hair hides scars.  I did have some scabbing again a year later.  It really scared me but turned out to just be one of the stitches that was accidentally left behind.   So everything has been fine ever since.    But please everyone wear your hats and spf 30!
I'm sorry you went through this horrible experience. However I am somewhat disgusted that you used such a clickbait title when you are now cancer free. It feels like you wanted to upset your audience intentionally. Discussing this health issue in your video was admirable and it highlights the importance of sun safety.  You could have demonstrated much more integrity when dealing with such a serious issue that so many people are affected by. It left a bad taste.
Harry Potter's grandmother. That's what we called my mom after she had a skin cancer removed from her forehead that left a zig-zag, lightning bolt, shaped scar. The little kids were excited to meet Harry Potter's actual grandmother!
My history teacher gets skin cancer like once a year cause it runs in his family. Last year he got a huge cut on his arm, but he hasn't had it this year. His dad has to get cut on multiple times a year
I don’t think my heart has ever dropped so far down into the pit! I am so sorry and I am happy your ok!
I’m so glad you are better I hope you have the best recovery
So happy all is okay! So relieved for you. I completely understand how scary skin cancer is. I  was diagnosed with malignant melanoma at age 35, it was caught early and was very lucky.  Thinking of you both and please know your not alone in this situation.  Thank you for sharing your story, skin cancer awareness is needed. Take care and wishing you a speedy recovery.
running low on new content it seems.....sheez
Sending huge hugs and lots of love from Canada. My dad has had skin cancer and survived it. My uncle got COVID last year, in an old age home, and died. So I am with you Kara when you say health is sooo precious, it is wise to count blessings everyday. I am soo relieved that Nate is cancer free! Love to both of you from Ottawa, capital city of Canada! xox
“We’ll see what WebMD says...” That’s my life. 😂 My husband just had three basel cell spots removed, he’s fine, healed great. My father-in-law had a huge spot removed, even needed skin graft, and he’s doing great too. 😁 Glad everything went well...❤️🎉🍾🙌🏻
I've been through Vulvar cancer twice now.  I am scarred from 3rd degree burns from radiation and my life will never be the same.  Cancer is nothing to play around with or make light of.  I pray your stay well.
God bless you . Please buy 100 spf bug bottles and keep it on stock in your vans on all times.
So glad to hear the good news...you guys are great. I'm praying for you both!
I’m so sorry Nate stay strong
rip im sorry bro get better
I wish you a safe and quick recovery. “I had skin cancer” or “I had a cancerous mole removed” would be more accurate or fair titles of this very serious video.  I’m assuming you do not actively have skin cancer so I wonder if you would consider changing the title.
Really happy to know you are OK.
I had skin cancer but was first told  it was an infected hair follicle as well. After a long long time they finally told me the same thing.  8 hours and 56 stitches on my face  I too had the same surgery, and I’m happy to say I cancer free. Good luck to you!  You will be fine. 😀
Thank you for bringing this to everyones attention.  You might have saved someone else's life by talking about this.  So happy to hear that you're cancer free.
I am so glad you are ok. I have dealt with a lot of cancer in my family so I completely understand your fears!  Love you both !  Keep on living the dream! And please see a dermatologist regularly to check yourselves out. Ps.. I’m a nurse and mom so there you go.
We are all here for u  we love you guys
Hi Nate, I had my first Basel cell when I was thirty. That's 29 yrs ago now. I have had some more since, but manageable because I use my sunscreen whenever I am going to be put in the sun. Glad you are okay. I remember how scared I was hearing the C word. All the best to you!
So sorry to hear this !😢 I have many health problems & understand how stressful & scary it can all be , especially the © word. I had a scare myself a yr ago , I know your world stops. Be strong , think positive always& never give up hope ! With u guys by each others side I'm sure u won't!🖖✌️🌈💜 God bless u both !xo
"It's okay not to be okay" DEFINITELY YES! 💯
Am I the only one who noticed the bandaid on his head in their last video??
god bless to both of you.. stay safe travel always.
As someone who was diagnosed with cancer (still goes for check ups every 6 month), so glad it was nothing serious. Get a professional advise if you know that you have something that is abnormal. Most can be healed if catch early on. I still HATE hospital visit
Praying for you Nate !!
I had MOHS this year too…still recovering but thankful to be cancer free. Welcome to the club, Nate! SPF is the stuff.
My father had this and left it for years. He had the top half of his ear removed about 6 years ago.  One of my little cousins refers to him as a “half-elf” 😉
Nates grandfather is a very wise man! So glad everything is okay and gosh you two stayed so strong 💛
oh that's scared me!
Ww just watched your video about Nates cancer scare so glad everything is okay
I hope you are ok.
Prayers.
We love you guys so much and wish nothing but the very best! You inspired us to travel more and start our own YouTube channel.
Glad to hear that you'll be okay.  Love watching your videos and so glad you shared your cancer experience with us.  My wife has survived Breast cancer twice.  Love you guys!
I am glad on the positive outcomes Nate. Thanks for keeping it real-important we see all sides. I have not been a sunscreen user and Im 56 today-will change going forward as a result of watching this video-seriously. Thanks!
Get well Nate, I'm happy you're gonna be OK!
This was so responsible, genuine, and vulnerable. Thank you for recognizing your influence and doing it with grace, strength, and integrity. Sending healing thoughts.
I have had mohs surgery several times on my head and neck ... I use a cream periodically called effudex that treats precancerous areas of the skin.. I usually use it on my forehead or my ears , arms or legs .. good stuff.. I go to the dermatologist every 3 to 4 months to get stuff cut or burned off ... some of this stuff takes years to develope.... certainly not in all cases ... I had been cooked by the sun for years ... I am 65.. I don't remember people using  sun screen growing up... I do remember life guards using zinc oxide smeared on their nose... stay on top of it and you should be just fine...it a shock to hear for the first time... however most of it is very treatable... I usually get Basel cell or squamous cell cancer removed..
Nate you’re scared the hell out of me.
Good luck bro 👊👊👊👊👊
Thank you for making this video K and N.  You are an amazing couple but you are right your viewers only see the adventurous fun side.  You are normal people with normal lives (yes and no) and normal problems like everyone else.  Hooray for you for being real!!!  I love it!
Love you guys and your videos.  Thanks for sharing your story <3  May God continue to bless you on your adventures!!
The world is grateful that you are willing to show the bad as well as the good.  I'm very happy that you are cancer free.  Let's all pray for those who are not.  Best of wishes and may your next trip around the sun be the greatest gift and travel of your lives!
so happy it's " so far so good " ! my heart and my mouth literally dropped when i read the title... my dad passed away of lung cancer 2019 ... and it is a difficult process... you 2 are forever in my prayers  that you will ALWAYS be cancer free!
Kara and Nate here is the link to the Ukrainian youtuber who talks about cancer.  Miscellaneous Stuff.  https://youtu.be/Ge2sDDBQTfI
My Father went through this more times than I can remember and as long as he was aware of changes in his skin and got regular checks he was fine.  He left this world at the age of 95 unrelated to skin cancer.  Praying for both of you and your peace of mind.  Thankful that it was caught and treated.
Great news !!!! and yes....for us that live in South Florida SPF is A MUST all year long !!!! have a great trip to Canada !!!
It's what you said first..all we see on media not 100%real..when you get one more chance for your life..let's come back to allah.. alhamdulliah..you guys are awsome
May God bless and keep you
YAY!! So glad you’re okay Nate, what a blessing to be cancer free.  God bless you both <3
Happy for you, understanding the relief!! 👏👍
Hi Nate, and Kara, tis very sad to finally hear about the diagnosis and very happy to hear that you had the operation and that they got it all.  The amount of cancers must be bad.  All I've been hearing lately is about cancer.  Anyway I watch a Ukrainian vlogger who travels into the Chernobyl exclusion zone.  Moreover she has an interesting video about bitter apricot kernals which she swears by.  She talks about the Western diet and why she think people get cancer.  I was told that apricot kernals contain cyanide but shes and her family swear by them.  I'll leave her link below.
This video should have been sponsored by a hatmaker.
All the best that everything goes good for you , thank you for sharing  your story ....God Bless
Nate skin cancer can be almost a nothing when treated but when left untreated for years and years it can be fatal but it has to be very aggressive. Good sun protection will keep you safe as you possibly can be and yearly skin checks can be a great early detection process and caught early means really easy treatment.
Thanks be to God you're all right
Where’s Kara
Praying from home✌️🙏
Glad you’re doing better.  Been there done something like that.  5 years ago 6 lymph nodes stuck together and swelled to the size of a racquetball in my right armpit.  Had a micro biopsy then a full removal biopsy.  Felt the same anxious feeling waiting for results.  I’m also negative to this day.  Unlike yall I don’t get to travel much but I’m enjoying your travel vlogs until I go on my multi-country euro vacation next summer.
I will be praying for you guys
So glad all is well.  If you are heading to Nova Scotia would be amazing to bump into you folks!  Where ever you go, stay safe and hope you have an amazing trip!
I was one of those having to get a chunk of my ear cut with Moh’s! I was SO lucky that my hair dresser caught it early and it did not spread. So glad everything went well- I know your pain. Praying for continued recovery! ❤️
Years ago I had a weird brown spot on my cheek that wasn’t going away. I went to the dermatologist to have it checked out. She looked at it and said “that’s nothing to worry about but I want to take a look at this” and she pointed to a pink spot by my nose. I hadn’t even noticed it. She did a biopsy and I left. The next day I got a call while I was at work, which was pretty scary. I was supposed to call them for results, so them calling me, immediately let me know it wasn’t good news. The girl said “you have a ‘little’ basal cell skin cancer we need to remove. My heart dropped. How could she use the words “little” and “cancer” in the same sentence? All those years of sunbathing in the back yard were coming back to haunt me. I had the MOHS surgery as well. After looking me over from head to toe we discovered I had two more skin cancers. One on my chest and one on my back. Luckily all three of mine were basal cell. Since then I have to go to the dermatologist every six months. I have had several things burned off and cut off since then but luckily no more cancers.  For me, it was a wake up call that I needed to treat my body better. I am vigilant about wearing sunscreen daily and try to avoid being in the sun for any length of time. I’m happy you got it taken care of and are cancer free. Best wishes from Louisiana.
I love it kara and nate
We are so relieved to hear that Nate is ok and we pray for a speedy recovery!  Ironically it sounds like we both are recovering at the same time.  I just had surgery for umbilical hernia and removal of 13 Lipomas.  I truly understand what he is going through in recovery, wound care is frustrating!!  It is truly the women in our lives that keep us together and pushing forward. Your so lucky to have someone compassionate like Kate!  I know I wouldn’t be half the man I am without Steph!  Glad to hear you are on the mend and can’t wait to see what adventures await in Canada!  We are headed that way in June!  Stay blessed!
Great video Kara and Nate, Glad that Nate has recovered and now is a cancer survivor and that his experience serves as a lesson for all.
Nate has the best support system.. Kara
So glad everything is okay ❤️
Thank you for sharing your story!  Because you shared your story you may give someone that nudge to get that weird spot or bump checked out and save their life.  So happy for you both!
4:30 is the definition of American healthcare
Stay well always Nate!!
Lmao
I almost started crying before hearing what you said about it not being life threatning. Scared the crap out of me. You have been out in the sun a lot over the years. I am so happy that its now out. Keep yourself healthy and your skin as well.
When my husband had 3 mini strokes a few years ago, I was petrified. I can relate with Kara’s stress and worry about Nate.
Two things:  1) I really appreciate the vulnerability and openness of you two opening up to us and sharing. Nate, I’m very happy that you are officially cancer free. Being bald, I’m always remembering and usually forgetting my hat and sunscreen - so y’all might be saving my scalp. 🙂  2) I really hope I can find someone who looks at me the way Kara looks at Nate. Things like this are so much easier when you have a rockstar supporting you.   Have fun in Canada! Excited for the video. 🙂
at first it was so weird to see you waking up in a bed lmaoo, used to the van.. tent..
Congrats, please stay on top of annual testing. Blood too.
So glad you are ok Nate.  Love you both.  Stay strong and healthy.
So glad you're doing ok Nate. Those kinds of things are never fun but glad it was a positive result. ALl the best with it Nate :)
I also had a Basal cell. On my face. 45 stitches. They had to go in 3 times to remove it all, until the edges were clear.  Yes…wear that sunscreen. Glad you got it taken care of.
I was so worried cuz I had no idea. I'm so happy that your okay and now your cancer free. This now tells you that anyone any age can get cancer and it's not fun to live with. I'm so happy for you guys. Wishing you guys Love and Prayers that nothing else bad happens. You guys are the Best Travelling Bloggers out there on YouTube and I love your videos. I never get bored of them. Take care you two and hopefully soon you'll be able to get back to traveling around the world. Love it guys
Hi nate, my name is mitch hoerig and my senior year, i was diagnosed with melanoma cancer and had a serious surgery on my neck, i have been through multiple steps and processes and procedures and i am so glad you are strong enough to share your story ❤️❤️ im such a huge fan of yours!! Youll get through this man!
Thank you for creating awareness about skin cancer….and i hope you are doing well.
Dang I don’t even know u but dang I hope you get better
Glad you’re healthy again, Nate. Must have been scary to go through that, and scary for Kara too.  To be honest, I’m concerned that my first thought, reading the tittle, was “He’ll be fine, skin cancer is nothing. They just cut it out and you move on…” I had to catch myself. I suppose it comes from living in Australia where skin cancers are almost inevitable for a large portion of the population. That’s also why was baffled that the dermatologist didn’t screen for skin cancer to rule it out first. In Australia, it’s literally one of the first things discussed and tested for by doctors for any skin condition that could remotely be skin cancer. Anything from a misshaped freckle to a scab that won’t heal, similar to what you had. Thank you both for reminding people to use SPF, it is so important, even on cloudy days.  Looking forward to watching your adventure in Canada ☺️☺️
Well I am glad that you were able to take care of that.
"I hate needles.... and shots". I've been a type 1 for 38 of my 47 years. I can't help but chuckle when people say that. I've spent a long time seeing that crown upon others' heads.  Glad you gotten this taken care of quickly. It's when people put things like this off that they get into trouble. Heal up and be well.
Sending lots of love and prayers for you all!❤️❤️❤️
My mom had a melanoma escamoso on the rt hand side of nose !! She had it removed by Dr in florida and she healed so quick!! Glad to hear everything is negative and long gone!! God is Good.
Congratulations on been cancer free and making awareness  Bravo 👏
Just ran 10 miles in your honor… I’ve been procrastinating for a while, but after watching this episode I was reminded that wilful suffering is an absolute privilege.
I have had a horrible week I had four test ON my birthday a doctors appointment ON my birthday and then my cat died and this just made me feel more sad. I hope he’s ok and his health continues to be ok! Sending my best wishes to you guys
Glad your going be ok. I just finish chemo and had cancer my self .mines was a little serious but I’m OK .  After you came up from doing the biopsy I Couldn’t help but think though why is he driving Kara lol
I was diagnosed with the terminal kidney disease and have been on dialysis for the last 9 months all while working and being in charge of about 30 people's livelihood during a miserable pandemic... I just looked at each stage or downward section with positivity... Because I knew somewhere right in my own town somebody had it worse than me somebody had cancer some little kid never left the hospital somewhere in the world somebody couldn't get the simple medicine that we take for granted... I feel like I was blessed to be in this country at this time just a short time ago this was an absolute death sentence and still is if you can't find a kidney... Luckily all my friends and relatives stepped up most were denied but one finally came through and I had my kidney transplant on August 5th.,.. I left the hospital on August 9th.... And besides all the pain and all the drugs and all the awkwardness... I felt so blessed to be in this country getting the help I needed with very skilled people and certainly glad you're doing well that has to be a big relief and I know the waiting to find out results can be really hard....
So glad that Nate is ok!
You Just Monetized Cancer. Nice Job. Hope You're Proud of That.
So glad for this positive outcome. Best wishes for a continued health prognosis.
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for shedding a light on a problem that so many people overlook. I had my first cancerous mole removed at 14 and have over 15 removed since, some of which were just biopsies but most of which were surgical procedures like Nate had including a MOHs surgery on the side of my face a few years ago. It’s rare for me to have a derm appointment without getting something cut off me, to the point where it’s become a joke between my husband and I that I’m the living Frankenstein because of all my scars. I hope your video encourages people to take better care of their skin including getting regular skin checks from a dermatologist and TO WEAR THEIR FRICKEN SUNSCREEN! It is so so so important. I hope Nate has a quick recovery and thank you again for making me feel like I’m not alone in my battle ❤️
You’re coming to Canada!!?!?!? Where are you going?
Yes, health i have learned the hard way should be the most important thing in our lives. To try to help ourselves have the best health (physically and spiritually) that we can. And i dont say this lightly. Despite the obstacles ive had to over come (and others as well) please learn to protect your health. To contribute the good things to it instead of the bad. Because it has taken me all year to get my health drastically better. Still not there, but the future is brighter now.
so this makes me wonder. about 2 years ago i discovered a lump on the back of my head aswell. went to the doctor he told me it was a blocked hair follicle and that it would either go away on its own or he could cut it out. i opted to just let it go on its on. and here it is almost 2 years later and its still there. im wondering if i need to get a second opinion at this point. it doesnt hurt but it is hard to a degree. what do you think i just do nate...
Good luck to you both! I am confident you will beat this! Loves!
Have to stay out of the sun ..its bad for you
Glad Nate is on the mend!
you're not crying but i am🥺 all the best for the recovery!
My friend ...nobody likes to hear the big C word...I was diagnosed with a terminal
“He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God." John 3:18 Jesus Christ is returning soon my Friends. Please Repent and Believe in his Holy sacrifice on the Cross to be saved. May God Bless you all https://youtu.be/If4JNXkNAXw
So glad everything came out good.  I will pray 🙏 for a speedy recovery and good health.  Love ❤  ur videos  📹.
❤️❤️❤️
Hey man, I've have three different basal cell lesions, non of them related to the others.  I'm an old fart and expect to die from something other than skin cancer. I only say that because I know you're worried. You're going to be around a long time, and your videos will keep entertaining people! I love you guys and your travels. So glad you're fine!
Stay strong CR 6.5! Best of luck on the recovery!
Love Grandpa’s quote! Nate, I know it was an ordeal but thank God you’re ok! Now you can make silly jokes about how you needed this situation like you needed another hole in your head. 😉 😜
Hooray for Nate’s cancer free results!
Glad it is working out so well.  I am not a medical person but from what I have heard from doctors and have read, Basal Cell Skin Cancer is the easiest and "Best" type of skin cancer to have.  It does grow and can interfere with other organs or body parts, but it usually does not spread.  Glad you had the lesion removed.  It will heal up well.  Do wear Sunscreen.
Thanks for sharing. Good to hear Nate is cancer free. Thank for also bringing attention about therapy and that  it's ok not to be alright. Been in therapy for a year now and a lot of the time it is just to have someone to help me talk through things. Thanks for help take the stigma around therapy away
Ow gosh is nowhere near yelling at someone. Come to Brooklyn, we can show you yelling. And some of it might even be friendly.
My grandma who is 77 just had skin cancer removed a couple months ago. She is doing great. No chemo or radiation needed. You got this.
Ayeeeeee Nate time to drink now Kara so supportive my fav couple 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Nate dont worry about skin cancer my math teacher from 7th grade got skin cancer and she was just fine
Love and hugs sent your way, my dad has worked his entire life fixing boats in the scourge sun of Baja California Sur Mexico. And is now experiencing this, his life thankfully is safe but continues to go back and forth with treatment and removal of tissue. I'm glad you're ok!
So incredibly grateful to hear that it’s taken care of and it’s over. My heart sunk with the title of the video!! Take care as always and It’s so refreshing to see a couple there for eachother thru everything. You’re an inspiration! ❤️🤍
ive had so many cut out... im geting  one on my nose done today.. with a skin graft. im so dang nervous
Nate's grandfather is a wise man, glad to hear that the both of you are OK, good health is not something we can predict, but can certainly influence - if you haven't read this book then I recommend it, it's called "Eat to Beat Disease" by Dr. William Li.
I’m really glad that it wasn’t as bad as you thought 😊. My mom had leukemia and died from it last year, so I can relate to what you guys are going though.
🙏🏻🙏🏻
I have a bald spot from triccotillomania
It's good to know that Nate is cancer free. 😃
So glad it wasn't melanoma which my daughter had 13 years ago.  She's fine but goes to the dermatologist regularly.  Both my brother and his wife have had basal cell and had to have a plastic surgeon because it was on the face.  They did fine afterwards.  At least you didn't have to have plastic surgery on your handsome face!  Looking forward to your Canadian adventures!  Wait!  Did you finish all 50 states???  Inquiring minds want to know!
I go through this every year, it's no big deal for those that are proactive in getting yearly scans.  I've had chunks of flesh taken from my right arm, left ankle & other areas. The one in my arm in particular was severely abnormal & turned out, if they didn't remove it, it would have only been months before it would have gotten in my entire system.   I'm glad u did the video to raise awareness, because every person regardless of age, should always get a yearly scan. It's such a simple process.   That's how it also caught my prostate cancer, i was proactively getting blood tested every 6 months for PSA levels & 7 years ago it was high for my young age.  Turns out i have prostate cancer & we monitored it every 6 months, until i had surgery last February this year.  I encourage people to be proactive with health checkups, because there's a huge advantage in catching things early.
I feel ya , my brother have the same thing that you have and  he will be operated on soon , take care and cudos for talking about it to inform people and make them aware , time is of the essence with the C , so yeah , prayin for you  but l know you’ll be alright son ! ✊😐  oh and looking good with those bandages ! 😁👍💚💚💚
God bless you two. Nate may you remain cancer free and keep it moving.
Happy you’re okay.
Par for the course for we Australians Nate….. so glad you got a good result 🦋
So happy Nate had a good outcome! Things get put into perspective so quick when stuff like this happens!
I gasped when I read the title.. then I read the pined comment 😅😅😅. Glad your okay
Phew.  1st comment on your channel,  been enjoying past videos.  Relieved to hear things are on the bright side.  All I can say is dont put off visits to the dr. I have some experience with this.
My dad had cancer 3 times
There are several types of skin cancer.  The most common is basal cell carcinoma, and is easily treated, even if advanced.  The other types are not.  So if something looks abnormal, go to a dermatologist.
Nate, man to man, I really appreciate you making this video and especially for the part where you explained the responsibility of content creators to show their real lives so people aren't constantly comparing without seeing the faults. I like knowing that you guys are real people--- because it makes your life seem more attainable honestly! Y'all are great man!
Harriet and I are big fans from Richmond Va. I am so glad Nate is on the mends. We all struggle. We are human. Thank you for reaching out to us ,the viewers, and bringing awareness to the importance of skin protection and screening. Be Well my friends. Harriet and Jim , Richmond Va.
So glad you are ok! Thanks for sharing your story.❤️
I'm so glad Nate's ok, you could see the upset in his face. That said, including paid promotion with the title..didn't feel right.
With all my heart, I wish you both a very healthy life, far far faaaaaar from any casualties❤️
Glad you got it early. Remember…ya no dead yet…keep your chin up
Thank you so much for sharing this with us. I am 2 years behind in your videos so this is the first new video I've ever watched. Prayers, hugs and love to you both from London uk
Oh
yes i’m glad ur doing fine. and you will be
Wait what no:(
For those who are very active outdoor or doing lots of hiking s and mountaineering, it is important to make sure you are well protected against radiation. The world we live in now is not quite the same as before. Radiation level in some areas have increased a fair bit. Thanks for sharing your story and take care!
I had an invasive Malignant Melanoma cut out of my arm in July. The fact that it was one skin layer from sending me to an oncologist was really scary. Thanks for making this video and reminding people to wear their sunscreen!
That hit me hard . We love you guys are are always rooted for you !! 💜💜💜💜😭😭😭
So glad you’re ok, Nate! I have skin cancer history in my family and go for mole checks every 6 months.  I hope your story inspires everyone to wear sunscreen & get skin checks.
God bless you
So happy that Nate is on his way with his recovery and that it wasn't a lot more serious. Great job Kiara for staying strong and  in taking care of your man! God bless you both.
Get well soon!  You are so very loved by us!!!  Slow down a little, but keep on trucking!
Watching from Visalia California. Love your posts. Don’t get discouraged by this bumb in the road. You are going to come through this trial well.  Lean on each other and faith.  Blessings ❤
Great to hear that everything turned out good!
i im a survivor of  craniopharyngioma which is a braintumer I had it when I was 4 im now 24 I take a cocktail of pills every day and have other illnesses caused by it but enough about me  I'm so glad you have good news and your on the road to recovery 😊 🙏❤
Prayers and love headed your way. May God bless you both really, really good.
Thank you so much for sharing your story. Glad to hear it turned out good. ♥️
Thank you so much for sharing not only the many highlights, but this scary time!
Happy tears! So glad you’re ok! I battled cancer myself…when I was 31 and had a newborn. Almost 8 years cancer free now . Thank God!🎉🎊
If I HAD to have a skin cancer biopsy, I think I'd prefer it be on my scalp.  For some reason I think that would be the least 'freak me out' area. Best wishes for a speedy recovery for you, Nate!
You are stronger than you think. Take care and have a blessed life you both 😘
Thank God you’re ok 😅
Hope you have a speedy recovery. I will make sure I will wear hats more often in future.
A lot of people get this but they don’t use it for attention
The word cancer always, always conjurs a plethora of frightening possibilities. My heart dropped but am so relieved you're cancer-free now, Nate. Hugs K!
Its a skin cancer bro not brain cancer, we know you want views but seriously no need to be so dramatic about a skin cancer
Yup. So many of us say nothing. Glad you are ok Nate. Hugs.
So happy all ok for you now xx
✉❤
I feel ya, it's scary.   They kept me awake for both my heart procedures this year. I was so freaked out during the first one (I was having the Widowmaker heart attack - LAD 100% - blocked at the time. They placed 2 stents) that I cried all the way thru it. Not much in my life has been as scary as being awake while wires were in and around my heart. The second one was easier but still freaky (they placed 3 more stents in 2 other arteries).   I'm glad for you that even though health scares are not pleasant that yours was fairly minor as far as they go. Basically I'm glad you're okay
soooooo scary to deal with. sorry you have to go through it but im glad youre okay and im glad its not serious
Here from Eamon and Bec.  I enjoyed watching you, Kinging It (the 6 of you getting along).  Sorry to hear you have skin cancer. 😢😢
This had me tearing up even though it ended with good news. Such a scary thing. Thank you for sharing it with us.
Happy for the good news.   Thanks for sharing and letting me know I'm not alone to what I'm going through.
please be better :(
I had a good size BCC on my nose, 40 stitches inside and out to get rid of it and rebuild my snout. Living in Australia we are the skin cancer world champions !!! Yay for us. Glad they got you all fixed up my friend.
I’m so glad that Nate is cancer free we both joined the same club bc at 16 I found out I had thyroid cancer and had an 8 hour surgery to get mine removed and my surgeon said I’ve probably had it for several years but I’m glad he is ok tho
Best to you, Nate. I am glad the news is good.
As an Australian I think this is a weekly occurrence here . I believe we are the skin cancer center of the world . I take myself off the the doctors every 6 months for a check up and everyone else should . Just last week I had sun spots blasted off .
That was a great quote from grandpa! I've never heard that before.  But I am that sick person that sees the crown of health on others.  I watch this vlog bcuz it allows me to explore in a way I can't physically do. Glad Nate doesn't have to join the unwell club because it super sucks.
Thanks for sharing your experience.   Not at all discounting personal therapy; just want to mention the best therapy a person can go through is found in the pages of the Bible.  Start with the book of John, apply it personally then move on to Ephesians.  Your transformation will be amazing!
I'm so glad that you're ok. I love watching you guys journey. It's so inspirational that you would share your experience with the world. I was brought to tears, I'm so glad that you're fine. I'm praying for you Nate, and Kara is the best for being so uplifting for you man. You guys are awesome.
So glad that it was a positive end to your ordeal.
You 2 are As Beautiful as a Couple Can Get ✌♥️👍🇨🇦🤌
Nate, I am so sorry about your skin cancer diagnosis.  I am praying for you and Kara.
I'm sorry to hear this - maybe people can learn from this experience?  Like staying out of the sun, wearing a hat, wearing long sleeved shirts and sun lotion.  For those that think I'm heartless - I've had 2 different places cut off of my body - one on my throat and one on my shoulder.  If you suspect you have skin cancer - schedule an appointment with a dermatologist. If they suspect you have skin cancer - they do a biopsy (which basically a big needle they stick in the suspected area). It could be nothing - it could be something.  They do cut the offending place out - yes - it does leave a scar but thankfully there are products that make the scar go away.   A little scar is better than the cancer going from your skin into your bones. Please get checked!
Prayers for you and your family
Oh no, but yay he's cancer free now
I have the same thing at the back of my head and I've tried many things and it never heals , this makes me go see a dermatologist
Buddy. You re not alone with hating of going to the doctor and Needles. Unfortunately as we get older……  The alternative is not desirable….  Hope you heal fast.
I'm a 68 year old pastie white boy. My entire life has been spent in So. Cal. and Parker AZ baking in the sun. I would come home from my work in construction, lobster red everyday. I've had a few MOHS surgeries, and every year I have several basal cell carcinomas frozen off. Just keep an eye on things and visit your Dematologist regularly.
Mayhaps the title of this video should have been, at best, "I had skin cancer - now cancer free"  In a month  where we recognise those living with or having survived breast cancer - I think a little more thought should have gone into the title.  I would have liked to think that clickbait was beyond you guys.    #justsayin  Glad you're ok now Nate.
So grateful all is well!
The engine does not sound good in that van.
Skin cancer is no joke. Both of my grandparents died from it years ago (in part because medicine was not as advanced as it is today).  It's so relieveing to hear that you got it detected early enough and are cancer free. Hopefully It's one of those "downhills" that makes you appreciate everything else even more.
Thank you for sharing!  God bless!
This is so hard to see and read!! I can only imagine what you guys would have gone through! I am extremely sorry!  But so happy to know you both are healthy and fine 😊😊
Sending y’all love today. You’re both brave and so strong! -Ben and Ang
Nate, I have so much love for you and Kara. I'm sorry to hear you're going through this, but please know I'm praying for you. Nate, you showed me the adventures life can bring to those who accept them. I'm incredibly grateful for that. If I find a gal who is half as cool as Kara, I'll be the luckiest fella alive! Wishing you all the best my guy. Soldier on!
I think skin cancers are very common and typically not life threatening (except for melanoma, unless it's caught early). Of course, no one wants to hear the word "cancer" applied to them, because that's just a scary word. My husband, his sister, and I all had surgery for skin cancer within the last several months. The procedure was fast, and we've had no aftereffects. The biggest takeaway is to take preventive care, in general, seriously, which includes seeing a dermatologist regularly.
Glad it worked out. Had so many things requiring surgery so many times. I actually don’t even flinch when they say we need to do surgery. I request ASAP no time to think about it. Had 4 surgeries in the last 2 years all different all crazy and all life changing for the positive.
So glad you are ok Nate, thanks for sharing
Nate-  I understand.  100% of the people I told immediately turned it around to tell me all the details of their experience with something similar.  100% .  I will just say, I understand, and my heart goes out to you, and my good thoughts and good energy to you.  - Ken
had this done on my ear in may 2020. big relief for me to.
Nate we love you.. praying that your fine. Also Kara is such a supportive wife. Very calm and keeps nate calm. Love you both.   I'm amazed by the video work these people put into there videos. The drone work. 👏
Start drinking whole leaf green tea (3 cups a day). Tremendous anti-cancer properties, especially with skin cancer.
💗💗💗💗
Moral of the story is if your skin issues don’t heal, seek a second opinion and don’t hold off for months and years.  Nate is lucky that this is a slow spreading skin cancer and not too dangerous. If he believed the doctor that it was an infected hair follicle and didn’t seek followup all this time but the cancer was more dangerous type,  then it would be scary news.  Dermatology is a very challenging field and misdiagnosis is not uncommon because everything looks like a  pimple or an infected follicle…
So happy to hear you’re fine Nate, as soon as I finished watching this video I booked an appointment to get my skin checked
No worries! Things will get back to normal soon. Good luck and all the love from India.
I also had to get head surgery! Mine was also cancer free. So congrats Nate on being cancer free!
SUNSCREEN SUNSCREEN SUNSCREEN. ALways.
I appreciated this. 1)  I am happy that Nate is cancer free. 2) I'm sure this wasn't easy sharing, but I think this can help other people realize that everyone faces different challenges, and a lot of times we don't realize what others go through. Thank you for sharing and happy for you guys.
I'm so glad you're cancer free now.  I spend a lot of time with people in chemo wards.  We're all hooked up to machines getting our drips.  I saw the title of the video and was so worried for you.  So happy to know you're not joining the crowd in there!
Omg Nate, my eyes watered when i saw this. I can't believe you had to go through that. KARA I cannot what went through your head, I would be so stress and anxious. You guys are AMAZING, Take care 🙂
AWE I teared up watching this, the pure joy on Kara's face when you were all clear!!!
Hope a miracle happens Nate and congrats on #8 on trending!!!!
So happy you guys are okay! ♥️
I also had skin cancer- squamous cell-  last year, had to have surgery as well.  Have to be checked every six months.  Skin cancer is not to be taken for granted-  my nephew died of skin cancer when he was 37.
Blessing for your speedy recovery & precious health from the Khan family in Southern California
Rip bozo
glad to hear/see the good news ! love your positive thoughts along the way and helping each other ! :) look forward to see your future ! wee
You got this my husband also in the army had gotten cancer, after 3 years he’s finally going into remission in the next few months. I don’t know if you believe in god but he really helped us going through this
This might have been the first time I want it to be click bait
The word your looking for nate is shock! I'm so glad you took care of it.. it's scary having cancer no matter what kind. Yes sunblock is a must we use 80 spf and about every hr unless we get in water.. we use sport as well. Hats and cover ears and any exposed skin:) also sunglasses for the eyes.. they can get sunburnt too. I hope y'all still have tons of fun just prioritize your health nate and Kara ! I sure love y'all sharing your life both good and bad! Stay safe
i have known several people who died of cancer so im happy to hear its not something to be to worried about. i hope everything keeps going well and hopefully this will be this one and only time you ever have to experience cancer. we are all here for you.
I'm 38 and this year I had a BC cancer cut out of my ear. They didn't cut it off! I had a graft and the plastic surgeon made it all look great again. The key message is to be sun smart. There's only really one cause of skin cancer.. the 🌞. So Slip 👕, Slop 💦, Slap 🧢 and Slide 🕶️.. ✌️
hi Kara and Nate
Thanks for sharing you guys! This made even more attached to your channel 😫😍 Love you guys! Get better soon Nate❤️
who the hell disliked the video
God never sends you into a situation alone. God goes before you. He stands beside you.
Thank you for sharing guys, glad to hear that you’re well now Nate!! Definitely a timely reminder to be sun safe ☀️
So glad you got it checked and are on the mend! I had a spot on my arm for two years and everyone kept saying that it was just a freckle. I went last month to get it looked and it was precancerous melanoma. I was so blessed it didn't turn into melanoma during those two years. Looks like we'll both be wearing lots and lots of sunscreen! Here's to happy and healthy adventures to you both!!
Same here too!

Oooohhh. I'm shocked! Glad you're okay Nate!  Fan from 🇵🇭
Nate & Kara what a dreadful time you have had but fantastic news that Nate is cancer free. Thank you for sharing it must've been easy. Lots of love you both 💗💗💗
If it comes back try this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkbBU_NjuSQ Start with a glass of water in the morning.  Coffee later  🙏🙏❤️🕉    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCfDzPs8tvA
That explains the bald patch I saw on Nate's head in later weeks video. Take care, and remember what they say in Australia..... " Slip, slop, slap" ( Slip on a shirt, slop on sunscreen, and slap on a hat !)
BEST DAMN NEWS EVER!!!! YAY!!! So happy!!! God bless you guys!!  All our love from Destin Florida.  ❤❤🧡💚💙💜🤍😃💯💥🌞🎉👍🤜🤛
Why would they wrap the thing around his neck at first, and not around his head? That would choke me and give me anxiety. Omg.. lol
Bless you both.
I dont care
Who’s here when it’s #4 on trending
As American self employed how much is your medical insurance each month? When you're traveling is it cheaper?
Kara trying not to cry made me cry. I’m glad all went well. May you both have long, good health.
Thank you for sharing this! I'm going in for a similar procedure for basal cells in a week. I know it is far from the worst thing that could happen, but it is still a worry! I really appreciate you sharing. Watching your process through this was so helpful! I appreciate you guys!
So glad you are well; prayers for you both!
Sooo glad you’re ok, Nate!! Thank you for sharing this vulnerable & scary experience with us 🙏💙
Had Basal cell on my nose a few years ago and MOHS to remove…I am much more careful now about sun exposure
It is great to hear that Nate is officially cancer free! It is extremely tough to go through something like that, and you two showed everyone how to be strong no matter the circumstances. Thank you for sharing your story 💓
Love you’re authenticity! Glad Nate is okay ❤️
I’m so glad your okay ✅
Be well Nate
MUCH LOVE ! WE LOVE U GUYS HAPPY UR WELL
Honestly dude, waiting two years to get it checked was a horrible idea
So do I. Skin cancer sucks!!
We are so sorry Nate had to go through this, but so happy to hear he’s now cancer free. Here’s to a speedy recovery ❤️
Im so proud love y’all, I love how both of you keep being positive and I’m glad your Oke Nate lots of love ❤️❤️❤️
I also have cancer  You will get thogh it
I’ve never met you two but I feel a bit close to you both from watching your lives on your adventures. I’m glad it got turned around in your favor and thank you for sharing we all care about the both of you. Thank you for sharing you didn’t have to but you did
My dad was diagnosed years ago with skin cancer too, was told he’d never run again could potentially live only another 5 years. Over 10 years later he has ran 2 marathons and lives an even better live than before. Never let these things define who or what you are. Your both very inspirational people and being open and honest with this will hopefully make other people feel more comfortable speaking of their health concerns as well. All the best guys ❤️ Gavin from Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Love you guys. Everyone has ups and downs. We're here for you.
My Dad has squamous cell carcinoma on his head and starting radiation in a couple of weeks. Please continue to get your skin checked. I don’t want to scare you but my dad got his cut out twice and twice they told him they got it all. Unfortunately they didn’t get it all. It is now in his muscle,but they think that’s as far down as it goes. Please be careful. I don’t say this to scare you, I do it because I care. Stay safe.
When I saw this video on my subscriptions I literally had my USMLE Step book opened on Dermatology reviewing for my Med School Test in 1 day… Hope you get well Nate, go get some Canadian cold!
So so grateful youre well!!! Thank you God!! 🙌
I know what you've been through, having had something similar removed from the top of my head fairly recently. It was largish, about 5cm and i have to return weekly to have it re-dressed. It was necessary for it to be covered by artificial skin, but my own skin is now growing back into it. It will take several months to complete. Fortunately here in the UK the treatment is all covered by our National Health Service.
I can’t begin to explain how happy I am that Nate is healthy and cancer free. You guys are beautiful people who don’t deserve to go through something like that.
So glad you are cancer free now. And yes wear that sunscreen (reef safe too) and hats! Our son from another mother had the same thing happen to him and he too now cancer free. Also stay vigilant in watching your skin. All good things to the two of you, Nate and Kara. You have taken me with you these past months as i have been grieving the loss of my dear husband of 42 years. Continue your adventures. Sending prayers your way too. 🙏 💙🐇mama bunny
That’s super scary but you guys got through it. So grateful he is well again!!
Canada? Where to?  Happy to hear Nate is in the Clear, Cancer is no Joke. God Bless
I’ll watch this video,after but hope u get better
Lucky it is just BCC, my husband has these removed regularly (20 per year, ginger is Australia), and pretty easy to self treat with Aldara (burns them off). Wear your sunscreen and big hats people!  And, get your whole body checked!!!!
I cried watching this. The Bravery it took to share this made me so emotional because I know you're helping so many people just imagine of rock skipping a pond and all that ripple effect
Very happy to hear you're going to be okay Nate.    As someone with pasty white skin who's mother and father have both had melanomas removed I take sun care very serious (to the point it annoys the crap out of my friends). Stay in the shade, wear a wide brim hat and long sleeves where possible, always wear sunscreen SPF 15+ even if it's cloudy outside, avoid tanning and getting sunburnt. Thankfully for my northern hemisphere friends your sun is a little kinder on you than the Australian sun...I know it sounds crazy but it makes a difference
Yeah, please don't make headlines like that. You scared the "#¤""% out of us.
Ok I was sorry
I saw this when it was 3 hours old and I didn’t watch it just because and now it’s eight years old
Very sad to hear it. Hope you get well really soon.
Only been watching your vlogs since lockdown 6.0 in Melbourne, not going to lie I was mortified when I read the title. I'm a ex-pat living in Australia and down here we face the highest skin cancer rates than any country in the world. To some extent this is because of awareness of the condition the motto down hear is "slip-slop-slap",  it means "slip on a shirt, slop on sunscreen and slap on a hat". If you google it there are YouTube videos for the campaign. Glad to hear you are safe but keep safe...
I had that same roller coaster of emotions when I found out I had skin cancer too!  Mine was/is melanoma on my arm and forehead.  For me, now constant dermatologist visits are able to catch the next spot, and get it taken care of before it spreads.  Glad you noticed something off and went to see a dermatologist about it.  Sending healing vibes your way!
Thank you for sharing. Nate, thank you for being vulnerable on camera you have no idea the amount of strength that radiates. Kara, it was inspiring and heartwarming to see how instantly of a supportive rock you became when you guys found out on camera about it. You guys have always given me hope for what I want in a partner and continue to do so. I’m so happy for both of you that this was taken care of ! Keep on keeping on! Cheers
Thats why i like this channel. It isnt all about fun, travels or awesome trips... it is also all about struggles... it makes your audience feel like they are part of the family... thank you for sharing
Kara is so supportive. Nate is so strong.
So happy to hear you are cancer free. Really enjoy watching your channel. Thank you!
You both did a great public service especially for young people. It's never to early to get a check up from a dermatologist. Thank you... and always wear sun block.
Hey Nate, I had skin cancer my freshman year of college on my leg. It was so scary and I can relate to you. I am so proud of you for getting through this. I love you guys.
All the drama and music quite unnecessary for something that is killing less people than covid
Nate.. I am so glad the skin cancer was slow growing, not an aggressive type, was not to big or deep and it could be removed without any addition chemo or skin grafting👏🤗. Luck in unluck. Good luck with recovering/healing quickly🍀🤞. It is terrifying when things like this happened.. I had a bone tumor which was removed and then a bone transplantation to replace the bone where the tumor had been. It was 4 hrs in surgery (on my 30th birthday) and several weeks bed bound in hospital. These scares really make us realize how lucky we are when our health is good.   Now you have to be more careful not to get sunburned and use suncream much more, cover up and always wear hats... Especially as you are outside so much.   My dad has had skin cancer on his head x2 (needing more treatment after removal) , on his face x1 and a huge amount on his chest that needed a skin graft and stopped him doing physical activity for almost a year... He tries to be so carefully, but if you have had it once, it means you have the type of skin that can be prone to get it again. So please take care in future...cover up, and cream, cream, cream🤗.
Small taste of perspective.
My hart rate went 📈📉
My husband has been cancer free for over 10 years after having the melanoma on his back and lymph node removal. He was stage 3A. Please make sure to get a full body check once a year! Super important to stay on top of that. Much love! ❤️
Sending so much love ❤ I'm so proud of you both!! Its big to share these things with such a large community. Kara, good on you for not showing your anxiety to hate until the end. I am beyond impressed!
Sending you lots of love and prayers 🙏🏻🙏🏻
Kara: “ They cut ears off all the time”. Nate: 😬   Y’all are so much fun. Safe travels to Canada. #roadtrip.
Stop doing good work here on youtube, bad things tend to happen to good people! :(  Meant that in a good way! Happy that you are well! Good day!
My heart sank like three thousand feet reading the title. But I’m super super glad to hear that your ok! I was about to cry today! I love you guys so much! Just a reminder! Your the best wife anyone especially Nate can ask for!
thank you for sharing and glad you are ok.. i've been through it near my eye.  was put under.  will always have a scar but am so thankful for the surgeon who did his best to make it ok.  basal cell might not be malignant, but it is no joke, it spreads widely under the skin even if it looks small on the surface.  i get you Nate, this touched you to your core, it clearly shook you and i am so moved by your willingness to show it.    Sunscreen and hats everyone, even a small cancer in the "wrong" place can change your appearance and self esteem.
Glad it was basal cell and not anything more serious. My mom had basal cell-like on her ear. They had to do reconstructive surgery with skin grafts after getting it all out. Glad you had it in a spot that was pretty straightforward to treat! Happy travels guys!
I feel for Nate.  Fortunately, skin cancer is not a death sentence in most cases.  Unless it goes on untreated for many years (perhaps even decades), you should only need to have Mohs Micrographic Surgery.  Of course, for awhile, it will make you look scary, but your body tends to work itself out on its own.  The experience is as Nate described...smelling burnt skin and feeling scraping at the site.  It does not seem like the doctor is doing much, but you are shocked when they hand you a mirror (provided that you wish to look).  I have had 3 skin cancers removed (I am 58), all on my face, and had a fourth possibility that turned out to be an Actinic Keratosis (pre-cancerous).  Born and raised in sunny (very sunny) southern California, I was outdoors a lot.  In my later years, even though I had covered myself up, the damage was already done.   The different looks a skin cancer could have make it difficult to think it is serious.  The lesions could be cracked and bleeding, itchy, or just an area that is discolored from the surrounding skin.   The key component is that they never heal.  If you notice a difference on your body, have it checked out by a professional.  It could save you a lot of worrying in the future.
As a former oncology nurse I experienced the doctor tell patients of their cancer diagnosis and it changed not only changed their lives but my own, every.single.time. I'm so happy to hear that you are free of that monster. Take care of yourselves! 💙
Thank you so much for sharing this, it’s so important to raise awareness of all types of cancers in younger people. I was diagnosed with blood cancer in 2015 and, after treatment, am on a watch and wait programme. I was really shocked to be diagnosed as no-one in my family has had cancer and it took me a long time to come to terms with it, especially as my son was only 10 at the time.   Anything that brings awareness to the fact that you can get cancer at any age, even if you live a really healthy life, is so valuable. Knowing what to look for and possible symptoms will help so many people. Thank you both for being so brave and open in sharing this. I hope Nate continues to make a good recovery.
I knew I noticed something on ur head in one of the last videos. I'm so sorry to hear this. I pray for healing! God bless y'all!
Ohhhh!! Good-looking man! You will never be in bad health! You will travel all places around the world and will not stop sharing them to us! Will pray for ur health!🙏
So glad that it went well!
Treat this with Rick Simpson CBD oil .Don`t cut anything. Nate
Nate you are in our prayers 🙏. From Canada
Neem oil
That sucks, guys. I had my first BCC cut out of my head around your age. I'm 43 now and need to head to the doctors to get my 6th one removed tomorrow. Plus they they put me on this cream to put all over my face that gets rid of solar keratosis which currently has me looking like a crusty-smelly version of Freddy Kruegar (Just in time for Halloween at least). I hate needles too and each procedure freaks me out a little. I really feel your anxiety there, Nate.  Here's hoping  you don't have more in your future. I'm sure Kara will keep an eye on any weird moles and scabs and get them check out. Definitely a great opportunity to promote the 'Slip Slop Slap' sun safe message.
You guys truly are my heros! Both of you! You each have taught me so much about life and love and pushing forward! ♥ Thank you for changing a part of me each week that will never be the same! So much love and light from Canada 🇨🇦
Great clickbait title!!!!!!
Glad you are taking care of yourselves. Lost my best friend many years ago due to Melanoma. Keep taking care of yourselves.
Just remember God controls today n holds tomorrow.
My dad had it to then checked yearly.youll be ok.have faith.cancer is a very scary word.
This video made me cry so much! I went through a similar experience with my mum last year, where they had to cut the top of her ear off. Thankfully she is okay but the unknown is so scary! So glad you are okay Nate!
Cancer is a very scary word. And its a world of unknowns. Regardless of severity. I know Kara wanted to break down but she remained so strong. Kara you are the perfect example of Martina McBride's "I'm Gonna Love You Through It" so happy Nate is Cancer free.
Wishing you two nothing but the best of health and prosperity!!
So glad all turned out well.
I am a guy who does not get emotional and I am tearing up. Prayers my friend
So glad you are ok Nate. Thanks for sharing your story. Love you both from Australia 🇦🇺 xx
Take care! Wear sun screen. Wear a large hat. Glad to hear things worked out well.
Loved your comment that you would wait and deal with the news when it came.   Phil. 4:8 Whatever is true…think on these things.   Sometimes we have to wait a while before we know what's true and in the meantime it can be so hard to rest in the knowledge that God is not surprised by these things.  Rejoicing in your good news!
So glad you're doing ok, Nate! How scary for y'all. Good on you for being persistent in your own health. Kara, you were a fabulous caregiver. Now to join the club of wearing spf 1000 for the rest of your life (ok maybe a little exaggeration but I'm at a huge risk for skin cancer thanks to my transplant so I know how it feels to slather it on 😆)!
My heart sank when I read the title and saw Kara's IG post. I'm SO glad he's ok because I love your channel and you two. I have to be honest, I've watched your videos in the past (particularly the Maldives one) and I thought "they really need to use more sunscreen", please do and incorportate prescription retinoid at night and vitamin c and sunscreen in the day to reverse the damage. I worked at a cosmetic surgery and derm office and saw so many people with cancerous lesions at the tip of their ears or behind them, between their fingers and toes come in for Mohs surgery. Please don't neglect those areas in the future *sigh of relief*
Grandpa sounds like the kind of man who'd be able to add to God's repertoire of smart things to say.  So that it's searchable for others, here it is in written form.  "Good health is a crown on a well man's head that only the sick can see." I'm so happy for Nate (and you, too!!) that this story has a happy ending like all your others!!  Love you guys!!
Clickbait when ya can I guess...
Had a Basel cell carcinoma too, was scared to death when first told. Knock on wood all ok for you and me. 😉. So so so important to wear sunscreen, daily even if you live in a colder climate. Glad your doing well!
<3
So so happy everything is okay! Love your videos!
I Pray to god
OMG! This video scared the crap out of me. I felt like Nate was my son and he was actually telling ME that “He has Cancer!” I love you two SO MUCH! I was praying for you through the whole video. I am so thankful that  you had such a good resolution to this ordeal. Praying for your continued Good Health, Protection, and Success as you continue on your Life Journey. Love Always from NYC!❤️
Nate and Kara I'm happy to hear  that your cancer free wishing Nate speedy recovery and thank for sharing your story it's a learning experience for all to protect yourself from the sun 🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻❤️❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰
well dang Nate sorry bro thanks for all the smiles and you're an inspiration!
I feel the same way because my grandmother has lung cancer
Wish you both the best. Get well Nate
I’m so glad they got it out I will keep you guys in my prayers
Thank God his well... Celebrating with you guys
Wow still tears even with reading that things are ok. In our prayers.
Congratulations Nate on being cancer free.  Thank you for sharing your story.  It is so important for people to be aware of skin cancer and to get checked periodically.  I have had 4 skin cancers with three being on my face and the latest just 2 months ago on my arm.  I have been going to the dermatologist once per year where they typically freeze off pre-cancerous spots.  Thankfully this type of cancer is not aggressive/life threatening (unless it goes untreated).  I am happy all went well!!!
Wow, I had the same Mohs surgery in 2007…on the side of my nostril I freaked out when I saw a thumb tip sized hole, after removing 3 layers there but it’s amazing how much skin we have to stretch.  Now, it’s not that noticeable but I need to have another spot on the other side checked. If anything is weird, check it out. And wear sunscreen!
Happy thank God he is ok. God bless u both.
I got a tear for you guys for all the unknown. Happy it was another happy ending video. Lots of love ❤
Nate, Thankyou for sharing this! A friend of mine has just being diagnosed with the same thing ☹️ please just know it’s ok not be ok, you don’t have to be brave for us, you must have shared tears! I have a YouTube channel and are admin of a mental health fb group (RC MHAP) linked to it. Videos like this are so important ♥️ Kara you rock! I hope you are doing ok too. Love to you both and all my support ♥️♥️ EDIT ** I just watched the end of the video, mental health is so important, there are so many places you can get help. Thankyou for sharing that too!
L
Welcome to the club. I've had lots of those little buggers cut out of me.  Everyone should get their skin checked annually.
Thank you for posting this. The last episode you guys posted I was worried about what you were keeping from us because I saw the bandage and I’m so glad that it’s been handled and was caught in time. My mom put off handling a weird spot on her face and they ended up having to cut much of her face off and stitch it back together so thank you for bringing awareness to dealing with it early.
I’m so so glad everything is okay. Praying for you on the daily.
Glad all is well young folk.
Stay strong Nate and keep posting love your videos and content
Guys, I know you don't know who I am, but like you, my world travels have been halted by Covid. I started watching your videos just before this pandemic and during a two month lockdown I watched all your uploaded videos on your channel. I've been watching continuously ever since.  I guess all I want to say is thank you. Your travels and the way you share your life story gives me so much joy. Nate, I'm so glad you're okay. I had tears in my eyes watching this video. Kara is such a perfect wife for you. Her positivity and strength is hard to find in people today.  God bless you both.
Glad to hear it. I just had cancer cut out and I'm still here. Mine was rectal and was real nice when they said I was cancer free. My year has been a real eye opener. 3 strokes then cancer and toss on what's going on these days. they say It ain't over tell the fat lady sings so it's simple........stay away from fat lady singers. LOL Take care.
So brave of you guys to share this with us, you are both inspirational. Amazing to hear that Nate is cancer free.
That title scared the heck out of me! I’m really glad you’re okay.
Thank you for making this video and using your own experience to highlight skin cancer - and the importance of sun block. I'm so glad that Nate listened to Kara's nagging and got it checked out. This is why married men live longer.  Also, thank you for showing a balanced look at your lives. I'm sure this wasn't an easy video to make but I really appreciate your honesty. Too many young people look at the snippets of someone's 'perfect life' life on social media and get depressed that their own life doesn't match up. I hope you take the time off to take care of yourselves before enjoying more crazy adventures.
Both of you are made for each other...
GOD BLESS you Nate:) My prayers are with you, Kara and family
My heart wrenched when I read the title!! I lost my Grandad to cancer back in April so it brought some stuff up😣 BUT I'M SO HAPPY YOU'RE CANCER FREE!!!🤩
Came over from E & B. Glad to hear that you'll be good Nate and that you've got Kara for support.
side note but amanda’s accent was so cute
Fabulous news to hear it's dealt with. Go on and keep adventuring. Life is for living and you both do just that.
In the last 6 weeks, we have been told that my brother has cancer twice - an aggressive type. Two weeks ago we were told is that is is NOT cancer, but they are sending him to a chemo consultation???????? Live life to the fullest, enjoy the ones you love, go to the doctor, but remember, they are just practicing. Ever so happy that your outcome was so great. Travel on
I'm glad that your ok now ❤️
I from UK. I have chronic lymphocytic leukemia. I've had it for 5 years or more. It effects people in their 60s. It's very slow in its progress. No symptoms at all. I found out I had it when I went for pre-op for a procedure that had nothing to do with illness. I had a blood test, and that's how I found out about my illness. I don't want to scare anyone. But anyone over 60. You might want to get yourself checked out
Thank you for sharing, it's so important to share this real life journey as well as all the fun adventures.  I'm so grateful all came out well for you.  I remember well the shock of a breast cancer diagnosis and fear of the unknown.  Now I celebrate 5 years cancer free.  Prayers for continued good health.
I wish you both the best especially you Nate.... I hope you will be cancer free for the rest of your life ❤. Best of wishes Tim from The Netherlands.
i am so sorry, glad you are fine now.

You should both get a full skin check each and every year now :)
Thank you for sharing this personal journey. Now, sunscreen on those ears, hats, sunscreen and have the big K check u over every couple months along w doctor visits for checks.
R u fr.
Nate, I had a similar scare when I was 18 years old.  I recovered, but I wish I had a cheerleader like Kara to see me through those quiet times when doubt begins to creep into your mind.  God bless you both.
i LOVE your shoes what brand are they ?
So glad to hear that everything turned out well, sending good vibes your way! 🤗
My first reaction: 😳😱😭  After the video: 👏🏼 👏🏼🥳  So glad you guys are both good. Sending lots of love and hugs 💕 🤗
look forward to watching your videos every Sunday night after work,  didn't enjoy this one until the end.  So glad Nate is all good. Much love to both of you for the enjoyment you have given me since i stumbled across your videos. Now go smash the 50 states and enjoy doing it.
So glad you are ok.  I just found your channel a year or so ago and just feel in love with it.
Thanks for being real and honest.  Ill be keeping you in my prayers.
I am sorry I had a aunt at the beginning of this year die of  skin cancer .
Stay strong
Alhamdulliah !!!! You are Fine!!! May Allah Bless You with the gift of Health throughout your Life !!!
It's crazy watching this.  Last year my wife had endometrial cancer, and had to have all of her reproductive organs removed at the age of 27.  Watching your videos and travels helped me think of times ahead to get through watching he go through everything.  Watching Kara's reaction vs. Nate's just brought e straight back to those moments where I felt I was more worked up and scared than she was.  I'm glad your experiance with cancer was better than ours, it's a horrible thing and I'm glad you are ok.  Best of luck.
God bless all that is seeing this message.Jesus Christ loves you and died on the cross for you and your sins ❤️
Oh thank god! A lot of us had noticed something on his head in the last video, but none of us expected it to be this. Thank you for sharing! Thank god Nate is okay! I hope he’s recovering well and the pain wasn’t too terrible.
This experience is unfortunately a part of live that makes you stronger but is no fun in any shape or form.   Too many are every year affected and too many will face cancer in the next coming time.  Please know that science has made so many ways to heal and survive!   BUT:  Always check yourself and when in doubt ... GO TO A DOCTOR!! The most important factor to survive without being too affected by cancer is an EARLY DIAGNOSIS!    Too many people DIE because they are too afraid to get an abnormality checked by a professional!    Very grateful you shared this guys.. some people might get motivated to do the right thing!
Happy to hear that it's Basel cell and gone. Hope you heal quickly.  Keep wearing the hat Nate x
Sending prayers to you both x
Happy to know it won't spread or become a serious issue... Congratulations to your rebirth ..  Keep living the Adventures 👦🏻👍🏻🗻🏞🧗🏻‍♂️
Good to know that you guys are fine! Seeing the title of the video was a huge downer but thank you for sharing! Have fun in Canada!
Yes Nate! So happy for you. My heart dropped when I read the thumbnail, I’m so glad youre okay!
I wear SPF 50 because I burn like no other just a note for you guys and I were everywhere I believe in it
Sending prayers and hugs it’s funny but not in a ha ha way my dad has similar cancer but his was on his four head and you both had the same surgery so sending prayers for you and I understand because it’s hard  dropping to hear of that word cancer it’s not an easy thing right now a good friend is going through stage for colon cancer and I’ve been with her from the beginning I will be praying every day for you guys like I do for my dad and my friend I know you guys will beat this
Hey Nate, Kara I'm keeping you guys in my prayers and Nate's I pray that your skin wound heals quickly. Give it to God in prayer my brother, there's nothing He can't heal or He can't fix.
Nate I know what you went through.  I had skin cancer on my nose. I was also very nervous.  I had to have plastic surgery done to fix the hole in my nose. God bless.
That surgery needs to look into pronox,big time.
Happy to see everything turned out ok, you guys are an awesome couple and Nate you really deserve a long happy and fulfilling life.  No doubt there will be challenges but you handled it with flying colors.  Your channel is really really good and are so,enjoyable to watch.  Thanks.
Thanks for sharing! Glad you are better!
Sending lots of love to both of you & your families
Trust me. Ears are very important... make your annual visits... SPF 70 all the time... Hats that cover your ears as well!!!  Floppy old guy hats!  My lost ear lobe is my constant reminder... Be Smart...  Thank you for sharing your messages...
OMG i was just looking threw YouTube and i see the tittle of this video when i tell you my heart dropped it literally went to my toes but im so happy that you are fine and im looking forward to your next adventure STAY STRONG!!!🌎🙏
Relieved from Dhaka
Glad to hear everything is well. Praying for your speedy recovery; hang in there! 💙
Kara and Nate I love you both dearly, watching you makes me happy, and inspired, and I feel like your friends which is why i'm saying this at all and this is a separate comment because I don't want to take away from the importance of this video and your message and again this is sincere with love. .  . . . . Please reconsider your Chick-Fil-A choices...I'm a part of the LGBT community and I love and support you both. I know the food is good, I've had moments of weakness as well, but it hurts when I see them in your videos....because I know what they support. It's just a consideration. and again from so much love. -Forever a dear fan; Hope
Future plot twist: Sunscreen's chemicals cause cancer.   The best protection is to monitor your exposure and never get too much sun that you burn.
So glad to hear that Nate is now cancer-free. ❤️🙏
Good news, super happy for yall. God bless. 🙌
Where kara
I was super scared!!
I had the same cancer on the side of my face last year. They had to cut twice to get all of the cancer. They made a hole the size of a silver dollar, but they sewed it up just fine. I barely have a scar which is shocking to me. I had a heart transplant 3 years ago and with the anti-rejection drugs I take I am very susceptible to skin cancer. I go in every six months for them the check me out. The best of luck to you Nate.
Best wishes for a healthy future
So so glad to hear all went well and the cancer is gone . Blessing to you both!!
Thank you for getting it checked and taken care of. My cousin had what started as skin cancer on his head and it wound up killing him. Good on you for manning up and getting it removed
Did you really take up a fucking ad on this video?
I hope it gets better🥺🙏 Make sure you having not to much coffe
When I seen this pop up in my recommended my heart dropped, but after watching the video i am relieved that Nates okay and he’s healthy. Hope you heal up fast Nate as i am excited to see you’re next adventure, Lots of love ❤️❤️❤️
❤️
Thinking of you guys!!
Im an outdoor educator, and last year was diagnosed and treated for the same cancer. I didn’t have to have a MOHS procedures because it was on my nose (but I got to watch them remove it!) While it isn’t really a big deal, it is VERY scary. I totally get it. They ended up finding a second spot on my neck on a follow up. Yes, Wear SPF and UPF clothing. Glad you’re okay….but I know, its scary.
I'm so thankful this had a happy ending!! I love you both and am praying for you!
I saw the heading of the new video and my heart sank,, but to watch the video and hear your cancer free Nate  was the best thing to hear,, I.m sure kara and all your family and friends felt such relief after you were cleared,, I love your grandas quote too.. Kara I'm so glad Nate has you. Your such a loving wife but you know how to make Nate smile in his darkest moments . Thank you for sharing this very intimate information bet that was hard but thank you for sharing..so glad everything is good,, keep safe to you both,, sending my love from Glasgow Scotland xx
Y’all made me cry a little but I’m so happy that you’re doing fine and I hope you recover well! ❤️
Thank God you're cancer free, not a lot of people  can say that, as sad as that may be. Now you know to take better care of yourself. Much love to you guys.
Finally you guys are coming to Canada!!!, you need to come to Kemptville Ontario
Hello from the skin cancer capital of the world….Queensland Australia. I had a stage 3 melanoma and lymph nodes removed last year and skin grafts. I have had a lot of friends who have had SCC’s and BCC’s removed and it fairly common here. Wear lots of SPF 50 sunscreen that contain zinc or titanium…it sticks when you sweat.
Hi Kara and Nate. I've truly sorry to hear what you have been going through this past year with Nate's head. But... I am so happy Nate is now 'Cancer free' (YIPPEE). Keep doing what you are both doing and I love watching your latest video/adventure weekly.  I love that you guys are a very honest and positive couple. I live in Birmingham, England. Love you both Jit x.
Apologies for messing up the saying. It's  Slip, Slop, Slap! It sounds like a breeze when you say it like that. Slip, Slop, Slap! In the sun we always say "Slip Slop Slap!" Slip, Slop, Slap! Slip on a shirt, slop on sunscreen and slap on a hat, Slip, Slop, Slap! You can stop skin cancer – say: "Slip, Slop, Slap!"
Nate, man! I am so happy you are well. It must have been so stressful having to go through that. Love you guys! :)
Thank you for sharing this part of you lives. I think a lot of people forget that when they FOLLOW people whether on youtube or inst that you're not seeing the whole picture. So by sharing  your cancer scare it's really good to know that all people have struggles and real issues to deal with.  That said I am so glad you have been declared Cancer free. Praying that you both will recover from this and move forward stronger together. 🤗
so glad you're on the mend, nate! my dad was recently diagnosed with skin cancer, also a basal cell, and has his operation this week. this has helped settle my soul a little!
Wow, what a quote,  "good health is a crown on a well mans head that only the sick can see." -Papa Nate
I have a mole on my ear that I am worried about. I always smother it in sunscreen when I'm out in the sun, but it is something that I want removed for prevention sake.
Glad your ok Nate. Sending lots of love and good health and vibes to both of you. I laughed at Kara's we'll see what WebMD says....that's so me.
Thank you for sharing this very intimate story and for being real and present. Wishing you continued health, happiness, and strength!
Nate to kara "stay strong for me all day" 🥺😭❤️ that tears me up. Ahhhh this couple ❤️💪 thanks for inspiring us everyday. Health is wealth ☺️ God bless you two always! 🙏
Lost my mom to cancer when I was a kid. It was hard to keep going. I'm glad Kara won't have to keep going without her life partner. Love each other cherish each other and remember this time the next time you're taking one another for granted passively. But let this be a bad memory in your rear view
man please dont do a title like this again!! scared the hell out of me. glad your fine dude.
Trust me. I'm a doctor :-)  Basal Cell Carcinoma is not something that should keep you up at night. It's so slow-growing. It's like going into a race with a beat-up old Pinto car with a bad engine while you're in a brand new Plaid Edition Tesla. Just be grateful that it's not something worse like melanoma. Chill and relax. Your doctors got this!
5:21 not me laugh-crying when Kara says she's sorry he has cancer hahaawwwww
So glad!! I miss your vids!!
Thank you for making this video. This year during my routine derm visit he took a sample of a spot at the back of my jaw I hadn't even noticed. It came back as melanoma. They did a Mohs procedure and took out a big ol gob of tissue. They called it a stage 0 melanoma and said the procedure was a success. I wasn't expecting it, and I hope I don't need to do it again. I'm 56 y.o. and have spent some time in the sun. Younger people especially need to be aware to use sunscreen and protect their skin. Best thoughts to you and everyone here. 8-)
Bless You Both🙏. I just had Mohs surgery for skin cancer in the top of my head, less than a month ago. Wooo hoo! We are both cancer free. Best of luck in your recovery 💖💖💖
Such good news to hear that the surgeon has removed all of the cancer. And how supportive is Kara?! Good luck and health to you both ❤️❤️
Ohh hunny im sorry
Absolutely love you guys snd so glad to hear all is ok… totally understand what you’ve been going through though. Greg had #Mohs surgery on his nose late 2019, a few months before our Cambodia trip. It’s a testament to how awesome the surgeon was that you can’t see any sign of it on Greg’s face in our Cambodia video series as it encompassed all of his nose and into his forehead!!… it was a terrifying experience and, even though it wasn’t me going through it, I totally know what Nate meant when he said he could throw up just thinking about it 😢   Anyway, onwards and upwards hey… again, so glad you’re ok Nate… we absolutely love you both - you’re awesome! xxx 🙏🏻
Pogchamps
Nate, I wish you all the health and healing! Thank you for sharing this. Kara and Nate, I think it's a testament to your marriage of how you all handled this. We you can tell in the call scenes that you guys are a team through and through. All the best!!
Hey Nate just wanted to say I know exactly what you have gone through as I had a melanoma removed from beside my eye when I was just 17. I am now 50 and here as well to tell the tale. I was in shock when I was given my diagnosis and kept going about saying I had cancer in disbelief as all my doctors told me it was nothing sinister at all. Anyway you look after yourself and take care x
Don’t die
Sending you both my prayers and best wishes ❤️
Having gone through a  cancer scare 2 years ago with the hubby, I can relate. So glad to hear all is well!! You are coming to Canada? When, where?? Here in Ontario, we are getting ready for winter.........
Bloody hell, that title rocked me, So very glad you're ok, stay strong guys.
So this Is the new trend on YouTube now🤦🏼‍♀️ your title is click bait and actually really sad that u would use it. I’ve had the same thing cut out many of us have, not that it’s not scary but I watched my mum actually die from cancer. So pisses me off when ppl use it like this for views.
I got so scared by the title so glad that Nate's alright... Take care guys ...lots of love ❤️
Praise that you are ok
No biggie, guys.  I have had the same thing about three times.  I just get my annual exam and I'm good to go. The hard part is finding a dermatologist and getting in right away.  If you hear the word, "Melanoma", that is when to be afraid, otherwise, it's just a nuisance day.
Literally I'm 50 seconds in, he's about to say the first word of the video and I'm already crying Edit: 1:09 now and thank God!
Remember to use indica oil and coconut oil cover for healing even lawyers though it's gone.
My prayers are going out for you Nate
Your sharing Nate's experience with skin cancer may encourage someone to have their own issue checked. Thank you. Be well.
When you didnt bring Kara coffee in bed, I knew something was wrong🥺 Happy you're taking it in strides Nate!
glad to hear you are ok! thank you for talking about sun protection and the importance of spf
I’m so sorry Nate but my mom just left like 4 days ago for 6 weeks to have a surgery for a tumor that might be able to cause some type of cancer and this is maybe the 4 year and like 5 th surgery but I got my friends and family like you guys because I watch you guys all the time and you guys make me so much happier since my mom left
Hope everything is ok man
speaking from personal experience, this is not something you should lose sleep over.  I have personally had over 100 basil cell skin cancers removed/treated, most of this was due to may years of sun exposure not only as a child but driving boats for a living for many years, as long as you have yourself checked regularly and just be aware of your skin, you have NOTHING to worry about, I have also had several squamous cell cancers as well, but again, as long as you address them, it is not a worry, you obviously take care of your body, which is a great thing, this is just one more thing you need to take care of........all will be well in the end, and this too shall pass, hang in there, get it taken care of and be well!  Safe travels!
Soo happy that Nate is cancer free now and glad you talked about this guys! We did not think about sunscreen on the ears, good to know !
If you didn’t like the way sunscreen feels to your skin you can try another type / brand. Find the one sunscreen that make you want to use it everyday. I used to cry every time I put on sunscreen but now I found 1 product that didn’t irritate my eyes and I really like how it feels on my skin.   Also, cloudy days doesn’t mean you can skip the sunscreen. Reapply after 2 hours especially if you’re out in the sun. If you spend your time in a house near the window you still need to wear it, unless you’re in a basement.
Your advertising works! I just bought a Celsius to try and it's delicious! Bold flavor but not overpowering! And only 10 calories! I'm floored.
Hugzs you guys. I understand how scared and concerned the both of you all are about this. I have been struggling with a brain tumour for a couple of years. Much love and Best regards Hee.
❤
That is such great news!!!!!!!
Health is wealth! Im so happy! Yay to cancer free! 💕
I’m so glad for Nate !!!🙏🙏
Thank goodness you're okay!!!
Glad you good homie 💪🏽
People need to share real things like this. It always helps someone else.
Health scares are never easy, my husband had a massive brain tumor that landed him in the ICU immediately, life got put on pause but like Kara mentioned we never take health for granted now. Nate so glad you had your skin cancer removed and hope you heal quickly.
I was so worried when I saw this couse u guys are my favorite YouTuber but good thing ur fine.keep safe and God bless you guys🥰❤️
I've been down the skin cancer road myself. Ignored a mole on my back for two years and it turned into stage 1 melanoma. Now I have a huge scar on my back and have to get check twice a year for the rest of my life, but I don't have cancer thankfully.  Also I don't like going either especially when they have to use the laser, that burning flesh gets to me every time.
This brought me to tears. I'm happy for you Nate....and you as well Kara. As someone who grew up in australia. Skin cancer is a big thing that every child in school is told about and we (australia) have numerous tv commercials about using SPF50+ skin protection. Its drummed into us. *Looking forward to seeing lots more excellent videos from you two*  Rob (now in London)
I’ve had areas of my skin removed because they were worried about it being cancerous. I was awake for the hole thing. It’s a different feeling for sure.
I live in the desert Southwest, and I get basal-cell carcinomas about every other year. Kind of a pain to treat but not really a big deal in the long term. I have had one squamous-cell carcinoma, which was a much bigger deal. I haven't had a melanoma, which is eminently more serious, but go to the dermatologist twice a year.
Great news with the all clear! All the best Nate
So glad your ok. ❤️🙏🏼
Thank you for sharing! Kara & Nate so strong and badass
I was so worried when I read the topic as I love you both so much, thank God that you’re fine by now stay safe and take care of yourself ❤️
Sunscreen is incredibly important especially for people who do not tan naturally like me. I do not play games with the sun. It is good for you to a certain extent but then it can also literally kill you if you have too much of it. Like anything else, cheeseburgers included.
I'm glad everything is ok Nate! I know how scary that can be. Sunscreen is definitely a must!!! Big hats & rash-guards too!!!  We spent the 80s in our backyard pool without SPF & my Dad has now had multiple issues with skin cancer on his head & ears. Last time he needed radiation too & trust me you ready don't want that on your head. Thanks for sharing the journey :)
🤞
Glad to hear all is good. Just found out in August that I had testicular cancer… later that month the CT scan revealed it had spread to my abdomen… I had two orange sized growths removed all the age of 26/27… even tho it wasn’t a more serious form of cancer it was still a traumatizing experience… I’m finally able to lift and move around more freely… defiantly learned not to take good health for granted and that you are never too young for medical issues to arise…
sending love x x  x
Oh yeah, I forgot to mention the smell of your burning flesh. So happy it went well for you tho.
Hey guys I just wanted to say thank you so much for being open and sharing the struggles. You’re right so many people want to smooth everything over and make their lives seem perfect. In times like this it makes you truly count your blessings.  God bless!
Nate you should really get a PET scan... it's the only way to be sure the  Cancer didn't spread.  Insurance usually don't want to approve it cause it may find something, and insurance companies do not want that cost.  You found this 2 years ago... that's a long time for things to possibly spread in the blood stream. Also, you should always get a 2nd opinion... it's really not a big deal.. doctors and oncologists always recommend it.. My girlfriend, the love of my life, was diagnosed with breast cancer last year.. and she had surgery, chemo, and radiation. And we did exhaustive research.  One thing we learned is that it's important to get a 2nd opinion... thank goodness we did...
Well now, put this is all behind you two , and y'all keep going forward. I had to have 2 great big nasty lumps removed off my head. I let them go to long. I have no cancer. Mine were just a mutated hair folic. I learned is very common.  So I know what you went through. I had 5 shots in one spot. So glad everything is doing great for you!!
My Dad has it too. He’s had 2 really bad ones, but going well now. Just had number 58 removed
We're so happy you're okay! And appreciate you sharing that being a content creator is a lot of showing a curated feed of our lives. We have also been dealing with so much health stuff lately and caring for family members, and aren't sure how much to share. It's good to normalize these things and show that we're human too <3
So glad to hear that you were able to catch it early and are now clear. As someone who is currently battling stage 4 prostate cancer I know how difficult it is on both the individual and possibly more so our loved ones. Love and prayers to you and Kara. Keep those vlogs coming they really make my day more enjoyable traveling threw your eyes!!!
I had cancer on my scalp as well and had the mohs surgery.  It is painful to have any skin removed from the scalp as the skin is already super tight so pulling it together for stitching really does hurt.  But the good news is it only lasts a couple days.  About a week after my surgery the hair fell out around that area but it all grew back.  That was several years ago and all is fine now.  Just make sure you go in regularly now for screenings.  Glad you are fine!
i’ve been watching you for 7-8 months now it’s really sad to see you go through this hard time hope you recover soon❤️
They do the procedure and then have you wait in waiting room for an hour until results come back from lab. If it looks like they got it all then you're done. But sometimes, as with me, they had to take me back in to have more cut out. They look at the edges.
Wish you both all the best.
God bless mate, wishing you all the best!
Love you both!❤️
Out of everything, I think the most heartwarming part of this was seeing Kara's concern and then happiness when he got the all clear. The love between you two is so clear!
Im so thankful ....I was crying with you Kara for Nate..God full Blessing for Nate..He on our prayer list..❤️😘🙏🙏🙏🙌🙌
My husband had a basal cell carcinoma removed from his cheek by the same procedure. He healed up quickly and just has a minor scar.
Nate: "been looking for words to do word things" LOLOL!!!!!!! :)
Tell her to give me her calves I need bigger calves
omgosh u guysss 😢 wishing you good health henceforth <3
My dad found out he hade a vary rare cancer and died a week latter the doctors at the hospital had never seen it before so they didn't know what to do it was the hardest week of my life, im just happy he is no longer in pain and yes he was in a lot of pain even though he had the strongest pain meds they can legally give him. RIP
When the spot is froze, it is a huge bump. You can actually hear the knife cutting your skin. Really weird.  But I didn't feel a thing
Es freut mich das du wieder gesund bist
Positive thought and prayers! Speedy recovery for you! Stay strong! No more cancer for future!!! Great job Nate!
I'm so glad he's cancer free! I don't blame you for worrying, my dad had a tumor and they got rid of it all, but a worse cancer came back last year. Just try and stay healthy! 🐢❤️🐢
How did he get it
I am sure you will save lives through awareness.
I’m 44 and I’ve been getting them since I was 16. I got scars all over my legs back and arms. The only skin cancers that you truly need to worry about are melanoma. All the others are nothing to really worry about. I predominantly get BCCs and SCCs and general solar keratosis. Life in the northern Australian sun.
They have to go deeper to make sure they got it all. I had a little dry spot on my eyebrow for YEARS. They would freeze it off or cut it out, but it always came back. Thing is, you couldn't see it on me. But I just knew because I could feel a tiny dry spot that wouldn't stay away. So finally a new dermatologist sent me to a MOHS specialist and he went deep and cut it all out. I have pictures. Looks like a damn crater over my eyebrow. But very thankful to have it done.
Ok- first, very happy for the great news. Second - girl was praying hard, even went and got the Lord’s chicken!  #chickfila 😁😁😁😁😁😁
I hope that you are well, my friend. I am deeply sad to read this.
My grandmother had skin cancer and it’s something I constantly worry about as I have mild skin damage on my face. Meanwhile my sister tans like there no tomorrow 🤷🏻‍♂️ I’m glad you’re cancer free now, it’s such a tough journey. Thank you so much for sharing this
skin cancer types actually live the longer than no cancer types
Had that done on my nose in March……they had to go in two times. Ended up with two black eyes but so glad it’s over. Knowing that they have clear margins is very reassuring. Very happy that it’s all behind you now. Now go travel!!!
I am so sorry to hear that Nate! Keeping you in my prayers!  Glad to know that you are healed! 🙏🙏🙏
Oh, it's basal cell. He's going to be fine. My mother has a similar story to Nate: there was a spot on her arm that didn't look right, and it stayed that way for several months. Her family physician told her it was dermatitis, nothing to worry about, but when she had a dermatologist's appointment for a separate issue (completely unrelated) and happened to show the doctor her arm, they did a biopsy right then and there, because the doctor didn't like the look of it. Biopsy came back as *_Merkel cell carcinoma,_* which is literally the worst kind of skin cancer you can get. Melanoma kills more people, but only because it's way more common; Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is 60X rarer than melanoma, but it will kill you dead if it is caught too late (1-year cumulative survival rates for all melanoma is 95%; for all MCC, the 1-year cumulative survival rate is 61%...after 5 years the numbers are around 87% for melanoma, and 43% for MCC, making MCC more than FOUR TIMES as deadly, as 13% of melanoma patients will have died after 5 years, compared with 57% of MCC patients).   Fortunately, while she was extremely unlucky to get the worst skin cancer, she was also super lucky that it was just _in situ,_ that it hadn't spread to surrounding tissues or lymph nodes. So she had it (and the sentinal lymph node, which is the one nearest to the site of the cancer, to which it will spread first IF it spreads) excised just a couple weeks after the diagnosis, and has been cancer-free for 3.5 years now. Nonetheless, because there is a 25% chance that MCC in situ will kill you within 5 years, she has frequent (every 6 months) appointments with a specialist to keep an eye on her, make sure it isn't coming back.  So good on you, Nate, for getting it checked out. Skin lesions are something to take VERY seriously. I'm glad that you listened to your wife and followed up, despite being told the "infected hair follicle" story. Truth is, for the extremely rare skin cancers (like MCC), most GPs have probably never seen a single example, while even non-specialist dermatologists may only see half-a-dozen over their career, so there isn't exactly a good chance that they will recognize a rare cancer for what it is. Insist on a biopsy (for the record, I know getting your skin cut open is a pain in the butt...I have had 3 suspicious moles removed from my back - not only was the process fairly painful, I now have massive keloid scars that itch all the time, in place of what turned out to be normal moles*), because to a pathologist, even rare cancers have extremely distinctive cellular features that result in accurate diagnoses almost all of the time.  *The keloids are ~1 cm circles, so I tell people they're from the time I was targeted in a drive-by shooting. Strangely, nobody believes me.
Skin cancer is usually not that bad. Easy to get rid off. Just don’t wait too long when you see a “strange” mole or spot on your body. But usually not something to cry over or be scared off. Still sucks tho. But I got to be honest.. a little annoyed how dramatic the thumbnail is and how dramatic this video starts. 😅 but anything for views I guess. Maybe I would’ve done the same thing. Trying to get something positive out of a negative.
Good luck Nate !!! Greetings from Italy
I scrolled down and right there, the first video on my recommended page, "I have skin cancer" and my heart literally dropped. So glad to hear you are recovering! Hope this is the last you'll have to see of cancer. I love your transparency with this, keep doing what you're doing! Stay Positive and Wear Sunscreen!
God bless you Nate. May you be very strong and may no pain ever bother you. Love and best wishes to Kara.
Glad you're going to be OK. Sending you hugs from London 🇬🇧
Stop eating the crap restaurant and fast food. Take quality vitamins, minerals and supplements. Most sunscreens have cancer causing chemicals do your research! Get a Berkey water filter and put the water in glass or stainless. Don't brush teeth with fluoridated products. Your welcome
Good job congrats
Glad you're doing ok Nate, it's pretty scary! However I do live in the skin cancer capital of the world- it's a rite of passage for EVERYONE to get skin cancer at some stage. Nobody in my family over 50 HASN'T had it!
Glad you are ok!
Thank you for sharing this.  You never know if this may save someone else who didn't even know what to look for.  So happy that things turned out well.  God bless and keep you.
To both Nate & Kara, thank you for sharing this with the community. I can not begin to imagine what you have both been going through. Sending positive thoughts and know how much you are loved by your community. Stay strong.
Glad you are alright Nate. Have fun here in Canada.🍁 All the best, be safe and God Bless!
Oh my goodness. I know that feeling all too well. It's terrifying. I was diagnosed with melanoma on my chin over 15 years ago. I, too, had MOHs surgery. They got all the cancer cells on the first try. A large portion of my chin was removed. But plastic surgery is magical. I still have a scar... but it is my badge of courage. I'm a SURVIVOR. Nate, you are a SURVIVOR now too. High five! Wear your sunscreen and keep all the fabulous videos coming. Hugs to you and Kara.
so glad they were able to get it all and are cancer free!
I was so scared seeing the title, but am really glad you’re ok! Kudos for having the courage to share this with everyone. I appreciate (and am often in awe of) everything you guys do!
Now you have an excuse to not wear  a mask if you want
Hang in there, Nate! Praying for you!
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Thankyou for sharing!
The title said you have cancer - but you don’t . Not really appropriate to click bait a subject like this 😳
Appreciate you being so willing to open up on this Nate, and personally, I’m glad to know now.   I forget what video it was where I noticed what appeared to be a bald spot on your head, and it had me perplexed a little bit as to what it could be.   Now it all makes a lot more sense. I’m praying you make a fast and speedy recovery to 100%.
Ready for y’all’s skin care routine!!!!!🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🤗
Sending love and positive vibes to both of you. So happy you are in recovery nate!
Thank you for being brave and sharing your story. Happy to hear you're cancer free Nate!
I've survived melanoma and have other skin cancer as well.  They check me every six months.  Some that were the worst were looking like nothing more than freckles!  So make sure to keep those appointments and mine started in 1990. I'm now 56 . Living in FL it's hard to avoid the sun,. But a normal life as long as you wear protection and hats and always sun screen!!  Hang in there!!
I lost my grandpa from skin cancer 5 years ago. Glad to hear your 👌
Amen love to hear that your doing great
Praying for you man! I’m so sorry!
Have had all three skin cancers ( grew up on a beach) melanoma, basal cell,  squamous cell. All removed like yours. Wear sun screen!
So happy you are ok Nate!!!!
Cancer and wrinkle free Nate...
Cancer is a horrible disease and takes good people all the time, as I’ve experienced first hand.  There is no justice I can find in it.  So glad you are ok.
My grandma is dying from skin cancer. The fact that you guys included a sponsor on this vid makes me sick. Unsubscribing!
This whole time dude had cancer but at the same time never stop making crazy video.   The dedication this couple has is insane 💯
❤️
i’m so glad everything went good!!  i was tearing up when you were on the phone and watching the rest of the video.. just know we are all here for you both ❤️
Greetings from Scotland, a very personal thing you shared with the world and I am so glad the outcome is good, enjoy the future both of you.
Thank you for sharing the good and the bad. Walking the cancer journey with my mom the past few years. So happy to hear that Nate is in the clear! Best wishes from Southern Manitoba, Canada! Looking forward to following your Canadian travels!
God bless Nate and Kara.
Thanks for this Public Servuce Announcement 👍💯. Who knows how many lives have been saved today because of this video. Always wear sunscreen and be mindful of any suspicious looking areas on your skin. I have been through several similar procedures which included a cancer diagnosis and surgery. I have found that the first time was the worst time as you just hear the "C" word and tend to freak out. Not that you will ever get used to an experience like this but the takeaway is early treatment is so essential for your health and well-being. Thanks Nate for having the courage in sharing this personal experience. Thanks Kara for your positivity and support for Nate. Take care. ❤ 🙏🌎
I’ve had 3 of these cut out of my scalp over the past few years. I also tried to take Nate’s positive attitude about it being a cheap facelift 😄
Holy Bible - Isiaiah 40 : 29-31 – He gives strength to the fainting; for the weak he makes vigor abound. Though young men faint and grow weary and youths stagger and fall, they that hope in the Lord will renew their strength, they will soar with eagles’ wings, they will run and not grow weary, walk and not grow faint.
What you are going through is really hard, I hope you will take your time just to relax and just do you, we care about you, we don't expect you to upload a video for a while, do it whenever it makes you happy.
Glory to God.  God is good.  I'm glad you're okay.  May God bless and keep you and Kara, always.💞💞🙋🏾‍♀️🥰🥰🙌🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Sorry to hear about the cancer, It sucks... but so happy that its been removed and now your cancer free. xx
So glad you are ok Nate. Lots of love to you and Kara xx
Happy they got it all out. I personally went through that a few years ago for a cancer on my lips. It’s really scary waiting to know if they got it all out. Stay strong and love your YouTube channel keep them videos coming
Thanks for sharing guys. Such a great message especially about sunscreen. About 2000 people die here in Australia each year from skin cancer. It really hits home as a friend died only a few weeks ago from it. I've also had it but was lucky it was the same type as yours. You should get checked every year. Make sure you and everyone else does.
I'm sooo glad Nate is doing fine🙏🙏🙏
WedMD is suspect at best, I wouldn't trust their information, bought and paid for by big Pharma!
Thanks for posting this video, it was very educational. I always thought that skin cancer mainly was a danger on areas that get a lot of sun exposure. I did not realize that a scab on your head could be skin cancer.
We’re so sorry to see this video but also happy that your now cancer free, we love to watch your adventures and send our love to you both from over the pond in the UK 😉
Huge hugs from NZ Kara & Nate.  So glad to hear you’re in the clear, what a relief 💗 Kia kaha , looking forward to Canada 👌🏻
I was wondering in last weeks video why he had a bandage on his head.  God bless both of you.  Keep living your  life because you never know.
Get well soon  Healthy recovery to u Nate
I have the same problem. Two cancers have been removed (one from each ear) The yearly skin checks are very important, as more are possible as you age. In my case (at age 74) my dermatologist says that they are a sign of my misspent youth in the Australian sun...
So glad you’re ok.  All the best for better health!😍
From someone who has had 5 BCC's removed from their face. You will need to change outdoor behaviour and be extra sun smart because if you have one you are possibly prone to get more as you get older.
Whatever the future holds for you guys you have have all your family & friends but you also have us. Thank you for shearing this with us. It definitely couldn’t have been easy but you did so good!! Well done mate you did amazing!!
And always wear a hat.
Stay healthy! Got me spooked for some minutes...
Was anyone else getting stressed that he was driving 😧😂
Glad to hear that all is mostly ok. Take care and protect from the ☀️
Huge best wishes to you, hopefully this was a small blip that you can forget and move ok from! I sat with my partner through his critical illness, and I totally resonated with Kara’s actions throughout this - you’re tough because you have to be, for the person you love and yourself. Really pleased for you both ❤️
So glad they were able to diagnose it soon and get it taken care of. Thank you for sharing even the bumpier parts of life as well as the sunny ones! Take care of yourselves. ♥️
Kara, I lost my husband to cancer a few years ago. I can really appreciate how scared you were, and are…and how well you supported him.  I’m so happy it’s likely fine!  Yes, Nate…that was a pretty smooth process. Glad you got that.   Funny, how many people are invested. The great You Tubers make you feel like you’re friends with them, you’ve sure done that! ( not gonna show up at your house, don’t worry)  I’m Canadian! Want a driveway in a lovely part of Ontario?
So glad all is good but stay protected in the future
Glad to hear you are OK.
I've had a basal cell carcinoma removed several years ago and remain cancer free after several years; just continue to get checked annually!  You can get past this!  Its not something to be overly concerned about; you got this!
Thank god you are fine. God bless you both with good health
Hi Nat, I live in Australia the land of skin cancer. Always wear a hat that covers your head and ears. Plus you should always go to a plastic surgeon who in your case would have taken one look at your lesion and know it was a BCC. Seriously an infected hair follicle!  Cover up , take care.
My dad had to get skin cancer removed from his shoulder have you been in a tanning bed? His was from a tanning bed so he says
Glad you are ok. Any diagnosis of cancer is scary. You guys did a great job keeping under wraps, but I am glad you shared. Hopefully your experience inspires other to get “that strange spot” checked. Early detection is the key. I hope you continue to stay well now that this experience is behind you.
Glad to know you’re doing fine! I thought I saw a patch on your head in the last video, so I rewatched and there it was at 11:42… They say skin cancer is the “best” kind because you can spot it early on. All things considered, you’re a very lucky man! Stay healthy! From Brazil 🇧🇷
Glad your ok mate wow that really hit me for 6
While I think it's great to see the real side of you guys and your travels and I sympathise with this situation, having had close family members gone through cancer (and some perishing), I find the title of the video very tasteless for people who've actually gone through cancer and treatments aswell as their families
Glad Nate is okay. Being awake while someone is doing something so traumatic is an odd feeling. I've had 3 eye surgeries since 2018 and you have to be awake and aware of everything just incase. Someone poking about in you're eye is not something I'd wish on anyone. 😳 I also got the award for youngest patient, so much so the junior doctors were about the same age as I was at the time 😂
Get well soon Nate. Lots of love from India ❤️
Thank you for being so vulnerable and honest. 💜
Omg
Super happy that it was the least of all evils.  Grandpa is right.  Health is the greatest of blessings….be well…Chris 🇨🇦
Keeping you both in prayer. Jesus is in charge, in this world we have trouble but He has overcome the world. Bless you, and may recovery be complete and permanent. Lots love. Anna
I’m sooo glad Nate is ok.My heart sunk when I read he had skin cancer.My uncle had it off and on for 25 years.He kept getting it on his face,nose,head,ear and needed to keep getting it removed.It didn’t get bad & spread until 3 or 4 years before he passed & he was in his 70’s.Sunscreen and hats are so vital,especially when you’re outside a lot.Life can change when you least expect it.I was diagnosed with cancer in university & although I tried to keep studying at home for as long as I could I became too sick and eventually had to stop.It ruined my whole university experience & stole my early 20s but I got through it.Then I restarted life & things were going well and I got sick again.I tried to keep working through it but got too sick and was forced to go on oxygen 24/7 and now I’m 44 and my life is consumed with medical appointments pain,nausea,difficulty breathing,etc.This was not the plan I had for my life…my dreams were stolen.That’s why I love watching your videos and seeing you guys do so many things I always wanted to do & seeing places I always wanted to see.It’s the closest I’ll ever get to experiencing these things myself.Don’t ever take your health for granted but keep living your lives.If your health is ever affected again you’ll deal with it then and you’ll know now more what to look for as far as skin cancer,if it should ever return.Life can be stolen so quickly&your life can be changed in an instant,so keep living your dreams & anything you truly want to do in life do,don’t put it off.So glad to hear you’re headed to Canada.Can’t wait to see your adventure here.I’m anxious to see if you visit us in NS.Travel safe & again I’m so glad Nate’s now cancer free.It’s a scary thing to go through & unnerving just knowing your health&circumstances can change when you least expect it and you can’t control it but I’m glad you’re well now and back doing what you love to do 🤗 ❤️ 🇨🇦
So glad Nate is OK. I see the Chik-fil-A.  Do some research on omega-6 oil, long term association with increased mortality.
Guys I’m glad all is ok cause I was sittin on the edge worryin myself good news and a really good message to put out there u can never be to careful cause skin cancer is deadly hope ur ok Nate thanks for sharin guys I could see just how hard it was :)
Nate, I am so relieved for you. As a breast cancer survivor, I know the fears and stress you had endured. Best wishes for a long and healthy life. And congratulations for being cancer free!!
I think now you can change the title to "I had skin cancer"🙂 wishing a fast recovery💗
So glad that you are ok Nate. I recently had to have a spot taken off my arm (I work outside all day) and had a few days of uncertainty and worry, but my results also came back negative. And thank you to Kara for your words and the message that it is ok not to be ok and ask for help. You guys are amazing!
My heart dropped as I read this title. You're both such amazing people and I hope you'll be healthy moving forward. <3
Wish you guys all the happiness in life❤️
sorry you had to go through all of this. thank you fir sharing this part of your life. congratulations on the all clear. Praying it stays all clear for the future
IM CRYING!!!!! OH Nate!!!!!!!! 😭😭😭😭 I hope you’re ok. Kara you are so strong, but Nate you are SOLID!!!!!!! Thank God you are okay!!! Love you guys!!! ❤️ “Good health is a crown on a Good Man’s head that only the sick can see,” or something like that. Lol Oh Nate!!!!!! 🙃🙃🙃 Many prayers and lots of NYC big bear hugs!!!
I am so happy for you two that everything is okay now ♥
Really glad that Nate is OK. Take care & stay blessed!
Thank you for sharing this with all of us - you are incredible people - Nate - I hope you're healing well.
Thnx for sharing guys, really happy Nate’s ok. Life is never perfect, it’s how you deal with the lesser times that can make you a inspiration to others. And sharing these things can give us (your followers) a chance to support and pray for you, and give back the positive energy you give us with your vids.
I was at church when I saw the video pop up on my notifications. I couldn’t watch it right there and then but just started praying. Now that I have watch, just praising the Lord for the cancer free diagnosis! Thank you so much for sharing, there isn’t a doubt in my mind that it was a tough choice. But y’all are awesome and we’re all ready to watch your next adventure!
So Glad All is Well ☺️
Thanks for sharing your story! Glad all is ok now. Also, it’s Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Ladies, get your mammogram!
Im so glad that your cancer free! Keep staying strong. ❤️
Worst headache imaginable after getting the cancer on my forehead cut out. I feel for you. Relieved they found yours and took care of it!
So, so happy to hear that Nate is all good. Thank you for sharing 💕
Our whole family of four watches your every episode together. When I heard about your cancer from my wife, it surely pinched. Seeing this episode and knowing that the cancer was not one that would spread and also that it has been removed now made all us feel very happy. Stay blessed and live long. Just an unsolicited advise - there are numerous studies that show the correlation between various types of cancers and eating processed food (especially meat).  Would recommend you to consider switching to a more (if not total) plant based diet. It may surely be very helpful. We wish you both a very looong n happy life together - you both make for such a beautiful couple (** A knock on wood for that).
I work at a dermatology office. If you’re gonna get a skin cancer, basal cell is the one you want to get. It’s more of a nuisance than it is dangerous. But still, the word cancer can be scary. Everyone take this as a lesson! Wear your sunscreen!!
😃➡🎈🎉🎊
all my best wishes to the both of you. So mush stress over so long and yet all that time you gave us so much joy. take care of yourselves.
Well just stop having skin cancer problem solved
Awe! Im sooo sorry, will totally be praying for you!
Thank you for sharing this very personal challenge with your you tube  family much love  and positive thoughts for a quick heal and yearly good news
Wow, that was an emotional rollercoaster. I'm so sorry you guys had to go through all that, but so very happy it's over and Nate is cancer free.  Nate deserves a BIG donut for handling the whole thing like an absolute champ and Kara, was so supportive and strong, she deserves an award too! Y'all are so precious the way you take care of each other. Thank you for sharing ❤️❤️
Hey Nate I know how you feel I had bone marrow transplant when I was 5 and I am 12 now good luck
Kara and Nate: Your story is compelling -- so many wonderful, entertaining videos from all of the world; and, now this open sharing of the issue with Nate's skin, and it touches a person who also experiences this.  When you love the outdoors and hours of beach days and hiking; remembering the quality sun screen is a priority and with your video, you make your audience and beyond aware of the importance of health and sunscreen. Very important video and so glad you shared this. Best to both of you. Susan
I had that done on my back and it took almost all day of going back and forth for them to get it all out, Very nervous when they first told me about it, Very glad that everything came out great for you. Keep checking on this it coild come back, I check every s 6 months.
❤️❤️❤️🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
and now I am convinced that I have skin cancer on my scalp.  maybe warrants a dermatologist appt.  BTW my 75 yo dad had part of his lung cut out for cancer & is clear 6 months later.  So it's worth going to the doctor.
I’m so glad that Nate is ok! And it’s so admirable that both of you have kept making entertaining videos during the last few months ❤️
Thank you for sharing! Watching your adventures is so fun and I have grown to care about you a lot. You're about the same age as my husband and I so it's easy to live vicariously through you. I have disabilities/chronic illnesses that have kept me home nearly full time for the past 7 years. Never stop appreciating your health and ability to travel! I get so much out of seeing your life unfold.
Thank you for sharing this story. Basal cell carcinoma and Squamous cell carcinoma are more common the most of us think. I'd ask your doctor to give you a head to toe examination just to make sure you don't anymore spots developing.  I don't know about Basal Cell but Squamous cell can (it's not uncommon) get into
prayers for  you  and  kara love u guys
Blessing to you on this outcome. Thank you so much for putting this out there. As an oncology nurse, education and seeing another’s experience is such an important part of the process.
So happy that it all turned out good for Nate!  I started wearing sunscreen in my 30's per my dermatologist orders, and now wear 40-50 SPF every day even when I stay indoors!  Health is so important and glad you made a video on it!
I'm so sorry. I wish you the best 💜💜
So happy to hear that the cancer you had was easily treatable and now completely gone. I enjoy watching your adventures. Take care ans stay safe!🥰
❤️❤️
Glad your ok I had some basal call removed from my nose I went thru that fear before I got a scar but I m happy to be alive they went in 3 times
I opened YouTube and looked and saw this and my heart stoped I hope your ok
I am so happy you guys decided to post this video. The reason I’m happy is because I can start praying for both of y’all and with my small groups!! Isaiah 58:8 Look up that verse please it only takes a minute ❤️❤️❤️💙❤️❤️❤️
Omg buddy..all the best...you will get past this.. you have an amazing, adorable wife and fam...
*Had.
I'm not going lie when I saw the thumbnail I got teary eyed, so very thankful the doctor got all the cancer.....If you come BC again I would love to meet up with you two
Wonderful video! Very informative and I’m so glad you shared it with us all. I’m also equally as happy to hear that Nate is going to be OK. ❤️ God bless 🙏🏽 and I’m about to watch Eamon and Bec to see how much fun you guys had.  🤗
Kara, your strength to not cry in the van after the second biopsy brought me to tears. Seeing how strong you are and were for Nate made me reflect on how I want to be as a wife. Sending all my love to you both and thank you for sharing your adventures, love and the scary times with us.
May Allah keep him healthy
❤️ For Nate for being so brave 🤎For Kara for being so supportive
Thanks for putting up this video. I have just been diagnosed with basal cell and am having this same surgery next month. I know a little more of what to expect now. Also, I'm glad you're cancer free, now.
Happy it wasn't serious! Hope you two stay healthy.
I'm so thankful it wasn't a melanoma and also for the Mohs procedure!  Thank you for sharing this.  Who knows how many people you might have encouraged to make an appointment with the dermatologist.
I´m so glad Nate is cancer free! Sending you guys lots of love <3
Wishing you the best Nate, you got this ❤️
Glad you are well... and that you shared this.  Cancer is ugly, as I'm certain you're aware.  My husband has had it twice... and is, at present, cancer free.  Life throws you curve balls all the time.  The successful person (or people) handle those curves and throw them back!  Stay well!
❤❤
I'm so sorry you went through this. I've had two melanomas and a basal cell carcinoma in the last four years. Fortunately, all were shallow and successfully removed but that doesn't make it any less frightening. Hearing the C word is terrifying and I also found it very disturbing to be awake for all of the excisions and to smell my own flesh burning. You are fortunate that this was caught fairly early and just make sure you continue to get your skin looked at regularly. You got this!
ethylene oxide on the nose jabby qtips causes cancer ,, graphene nanobots also,, pine needle tea and baking soda ,, cofee wont help its acidic
Aw so glad to hear everything is okay!! Probably should have read your pinned comment first lol.
I am so sorry you are going through this experience.   At some point in the video you (or Kara) mentioned that you have spent the last 6 years traveling the world and living great experiences. I looked at my husband and said, they have LIVED more in 6 years than we have lived in 60+!!!  You are an awesome couple.  No one, not one of us, is guaranteed tomorrow so don't stop living today because of worrying about what might or might not happen.  THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR INSPIRING LIFE!!!
You eating Chick-fil-A made me want some… but then I realized it’s Sunday. 😢
Thats so good that he's cancer free ily guys so much pls respond I love you guys
Hope you have a fin time
why is so many people on youtube getting cancer tho i hope you can beat it
All will be fine 😘
i wear my scar with honor.  And to educate others about being checked every year. Now, I'm on a six month skin check. And usually have a spot of pre frozen off.  Just keep up with your check ups.
Sending best wishes Kara and Nate lots of 💕
hope he will be well
i have a friend how has canser and it is hard for her so i know that even if you dont post for a while i will always be subscibed and when you do post agien i will allways watch your videos
Am so sad for you
Those darn onion chopping ninjas in my bedroom! Guys, visit your doctors for checkups! They are so important!
Kara, I know how you felt through this entire process: my mom had uterine cancer back in 2018 and it was the scariest thing I think I've ever experienced. Nate, I'm so glad you're okay! Prayers for you both and your continued travels!
Awesome news!  You two are the very best!  Living the best life!  So impressive! Love the quote from Grandfather!
I would say u are strong
Having been through cancer surgery myself before, I know how fearful the future can be with what happened.  Just continue living and loving each day to the fullest knowing life is precious and we only get so much of it.  Be an inspiration to others to show this can't and won't beat you down.
I noticed the bandage on Nate's head last week... I didn't say anything because I figured if you wanted to share, you would.  Thanks for sharing.  Prayers for comfort and strength.  Love you guys and look forward to your adventures each week.  Now off to Eamon & Bec to see more of you guys.
I pray that you get over all this mess soon Nate!
My mouth dropped seeing this video pop up when I opened YouTube. Omg so glad you are okay Nate! I know we're all strangers on the internet, but we love you Nate! (You too Kara!) Take time to rest up and heal, you'll be back to adventures in no time!
YOU GOT THIS BRO! GOD BLESS YALL!!
Thankful  for your diagnosis
Hey nate i am going through the same thing. I had a basel cell removed. And now i am doing radiation treatment to make sure it goes away for good. Hang in there. Stay strong.
Since you guys have traveled the world, maybe it's time for you both to settle in one place and make mini Kate and Nate . Glad you are ok.. Keep safe always.
I love how Kara was covering his eyes when she was explaining the size
Your going to Canada what province
Glad it wasn't serious as cancers go, I'm eight rounds of chemo and 15 of 28 rounds of radiation in with two surgeries to come.  I wouldn't wish this on anyone.
You guys are so great - so obvious that you really care for each other and support each other through everything.  Your channel is always entertaining, but it's clear that your solid relationship is the basis for your wonderful and enjoyable adventures together.
So glad he’s cancer free! Praying for both your health 💜🙏🏻
It's good you had moral support I didn't but they got it all left cheek
I saw the title and I was like:  NOooooOOoooOooooo😟😟😟
This comment is from Assam, India.... Watch you guys everytime a video pops in. Don't know if you'll read this comment or not ... But take good care and things will go better than expected. Love from india....stay strong stay the way u guys are.... nothing's to be worries just go with the flow. Best wishes ❤️
yea i panicked slightly after seeing this. I am so happy that is was easily taken care of and that Nate is okay! <3
Nate glad that you are well and healthy……I thought I saw a bandage on your head in one of your video but didn’t think that it was something like this 🤧 Happy that you now are cancer free😄
Thanks for sharing your story and I hope you have a speedy recovery Nate.
Thanks for sharing. Just say NO to googling things as everyone puts their worst disasters. I know as a 6 yr lymphoma survivor and a bazillion treatments later. Good for you to confront and get it taken care of so you can avoid issues. Best wishes!
canida?
i just started watching you guys and now yall give me theese bad news.... hope you get better.... good luck my friend
It's important to check our body gosh thanks for reminding.  Glad nate is ok
So happy for you
You two make a good team.. There for each other through the good and the bad. Each day is truly a gift! Knowing you are believers in our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, also is wonderful because- no matter what happens in this life, the best is yet to come, for those who belong to Him. Praying you’re able to move forward in good health, hope, and happiness! May the Lord bless you both.
In 2006 I was living in my FEMA trailer by myself. I was 44. My older brother had noticed I was graying finally. We both had huge heads of black hair.. I decided to die my hair after he did his. Looking at the result of my home dye job, I noticed an mole that was all black from the dye just under my hair line I had never noticed before. The die had blackened it also.. Result was similar Nate went thru. Mine was benign also. Left a dime size hole in my fore head. Not as large as Nate's of course. Been cancer free since by the Grace of God. So glad your results were negative. Have enjoyed the travel blog for about 3 years now. Hope you guys never stop. Marc Parker.
Omg
My dad has had basal cell carcinoma on his face three times. He's 79 years old, very active, and healthy. Other than the treatment making his face look really bad for a little while, it hasn't slowed him down at all. My best advice is SUNSCREEN (or wear a hat!).
So glad you’re ok. My husband had melanoma on his back. He’s only 30. I watched a mole and nagged and nagged and he went to the dermatologist and they biopsied it and said caught it early. They did take a deck of cards size chunk out of his back but he is now cancer free.
That is a BULLSHIT THUMBNAIL .
"They cut ears off all the time" - OMGGG :-O  This is a very good reminder to put sunscreen on your ears - especially the tops!  Thank you <3
Just went through my own scare with a breast lump. Praise God the biopsy showed it was benign, I too will need follow ups every 6 months just to make sure it isn’t growing or changing. I actually came across your videos right as I was going through this. On the 4 days I had to rest after my biopsy I watched so many of your videos and just became completely enthralled and inspired by you both, your love for each other and people and your passion for pursuing your dreams. Your vlog was a comfort to me during a trying time, and will continue to be a source of joy and hope for me ongoing I am sure. Thank you for all that you do!
Thank you for sharing!  It was hard to watch, glad you are okay!
Fantastic. You really are a great guy and for sharing this you really do deserve lots of credit. Glad its all worked out. Well done Kara also.
So glad to hear Nate is already cancer-free! To everyone who’s suffering from any illness hope you guys stay safe :))))
Wishing you all the best for a full and speedy recovery. You still have so much more to do and share with us. Blessings
More power to you guy! 💪🏻💪🏻 You’re awesome!!
we will be enforcing this sunscreen habit to the fullest sir. if i see you outside without a hat i am calling the cops
Your a lucky one your cancer is not as bad as others
Thank you for being real with your viewers even though you don't owe it to us!! PTL no cancer!!
I’m sorry. Im glad your being strong!! You’ll be okay. I will be praying for you. I love your YouTube channel. ❤️❤️❤️
I lost my aunt to breast cancer I was mid 20s
So good news !!!! Gland to hear that you are ok !!! Wish the best
💕💕💕
Love you guys! ❤️✨❤️✨❤️✨
Kara and Nate!  I was almost crying buddy My goodness I am so happy that it’s good news And for you to Kara what a shock!  Stay mentally strong 💪🏼. Big love from the Netherlands❤️❤️  Philippians4:6,7  Do not be anxious over anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving, let your petitions be made known to God;  7 and the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus.
Awwwh I cried so much about this 😭 thanks for sharing such a personal story. It’s so sweet that Kara is by your side being so strong 💪 and it’s so brave of Nate to go through surgery. Both of you are motivational and I love you both 💕
Sending my love guys xxx
So glad things are looking positive for you.  Keep active, eat good clean food (no animal products - dairy is the killer) and enjoy life to the full.  Sending best wishes to you both for a long and healthy life ❤️.
I'm sure your helping a ton of ppl out there. We know that word "Cancer" in remission now.

coming from a east tennessean ive been watching y'all for a while now im greatful to hear your cancer cant keep a good tennessean down try to take it easy for a few weeks and we can fell Kara's love throu are screens good wife
Thank you for sharing your story!! BCC (basal cell carcinoma) is the #1 skin cancer in the US and the best of the worst because is curable if you find it on time. It grows outward and do not metastasized. As radiation therapist and working with skin cancer, I recommend you to visit the dermatologist twice a year now since you had already skin cancer, otherwise everyone should visit a dermatologist once a year!! There are several options to cure skin cancer: Moh’s surgery, SRT (superficial radiation therapy), SET (superficial electron therapy) dermatologist office, and radiation therapy (oncology). Every day there are more cases of skin cancer around the world. I am sorry it happened to you but I am happy you are and will be OK. Sharing your story makes an important awareness of this.  Sunscreen 🧴 (zinc) everyday, hat 🧢, white clothing if you are outdoors, and don’t abuse of our beautiful sun 🌞  Blessings to you both.
I'm so glad you're ok!!
It was obviously difficult for you to share this, but it was important and brave.  You don't know who you might influence to get something checked out or to change their behavior that might save their life.  Fear of the unknown is very real for people, causing them to put off getting things checked out.  Your experience might have really helped someone.❤
Be well
Would have been helpful for you to show what it looked like before and after
Hope all is good
Lessen or better yet, remove sugar or simple carbs from your diet. 💪🏻
My thoughts and prayers are with you guys...glad to hear that you're much better🙏🏼❤️
I teared up just reading the title. We love you guys too much ♥️
“WHAT?” is the first thing out of my mouth seeing this.
Human history... a life full of problems...why do we do this?  Is there a problem before we are born?…why bring people into this existence then? Ecclesiastes 4:2-    And I declared that the dead, are happier than the living… But better is to never have been born… https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc1G1-uY9M&list=PLEY-6zOqLhRH71MWn_Q9pQjEExznjsHMK&index=10
You guys, you are just so strong. I love your honesty here. You didn’t have to share this. I know you didn’t do it for sympathy but to educate and I think that’s amazing.  Sending lots of Love from the UK x
I cried so many tears with you in this video, my grandpa has skin cancer after his time in service with the navy. I wear factor fifty every day, please take care of yourselves and thank you for sharing 💕
It's a fashion statement, really.... LOL
Delighted for you Nate. Kara is so loving, and you both deserve years more happiness together. Love to hear great news. 💙💙💙😊
Good for you Nate! My dad has been dealing with skin cancer. He's been getting areas cut out for a while now. And they aren't small.  Wearing sunscreen and a hat is very important.
SPF50 forever!!! Congratulations Nate!!! I went from tearing to cheering!!!
MY HEART DROPPED WHEN I SAW THE TITTLE
Love and health to you both!
🇿🇦♥️♥️
I'm so glad this worked out for the best!  And thank you for making the video. You are so right about the YouTube experience being curated, and many don't understand that.  It's good for you to show that this can happen to even healthy active young people!  I have no doubt that you have saved a few people with this.
I was so worried when I read the title of the video, while I was watching it I cried so much. I am so happy everything is fine, love you guys ❤️
I wish dealing with all cancers was quick and easy like this my cousin is going through a lot she’s only 15 and has colon cancer that came back in her colon and her ovaries I’m glad Nate is ok I couldn’t imagine
Hi guys. My husband and I are veterans of many visits to the dermatologist over the years, having been children of the 70's, before the warnings about sunscreen came out, and have had things frozen off, cut out, etc. You catch the drift. It's great that you are  aware and doing all the right thing early. 👍 So glad everything came out well. God bless.
I’m so unbelievably happy you are doing well. I couldn’t finish the video though. Just found out a few days ago my mom has cancer and it’s just too hard right now. Sending my love to you!
Sending good vibes friend. Keep up the good spirits an you'll kick this in the teeth.
The way you put an ad into a cancer story is simply too much for my taste
Prayers going out ❤️
So glad Nate is okay! My husband and I love watching your videos together.  We are so excited to hear that you are coming to Canada!!!  If you're going through New Brunswick at all some recommendations are St. Andrews, the Saint John city market(the oldest in Canada), the world's longest covered bridge and Covered Bridge Potato Chips (Hartland, NB), and the Hopewell Rocks.  Looking forward to your next videos!
Jeez, im so relieved you're Cancer Free.
WTG Sister Nate. With your bandaid you look like your all already to head off to the convent. :D Peace!
God bless you both. Cancer is a monster. I was diagnosed with B Cell Philadelphia Positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. I almost did not survive. But with the grace of Mother Mary, God, my family and an incredible team of doctors, nurses and staff I would not be here today. You must be your own advocate.
really glad Nate is all better
Sooooooo glad to know you are cancer free  now  Nate ☺️.... Lots of Love n good wishes from Arunachal Pradesh, India 🙏🙏🙏
You look cool it becomes you. Congratulations on being big C free. Now go rest Pamper your brideAnd dare I say stop whining happy for you happy for your bride no I live vicariously through you guys so you can’t stop doing the sillies have a good day take care stay safe. No Kara you did a good job holding out in faking the good strong wife…Make sure he pampers you
I got tested for cervical cancer in the spring and I have to go back in the fall. This is the kind of thing that “should” go away on its own. If not I have to get the spot removed. Prayers for continued healing and that it does not come back.
I have three wonky moles removed; one from my chest, one from my arm, and one from the sole of my foot. Those surgeries are no joke!! Hope you feel better soon, Nate!
🙏🏻
Thank you for sharing honest, real life stuff too. So glad it all turned out okay ❤️
My experience with sunscreen is that can be more dangerous than the sun.  For me, I discovered that the chemicals in the sunscreen burned me worse than the sun.  Cover your skin, even in the summer.  The cancer industry in my opinion, is all about making as much money out of you as possible, not curing you.  When they say you are in remission, you are not cured, just on hold until it comes back later.  Research and do the things to protect you from being exposed too much to the sun.  Stay away from chemical hair shampoos, etc.  Just my opinion and my experience. Do you as you think right, but research everything.
Even though I know Nate is okay I was like “good luck Nate” in my head when he was leaving the car.   We are so happy that he is cancer free…❤️
Not minimizing, but basal-cell, as you said, is very common and mostly not life threatening, those close to me have had and do have, it’s the pain hours after the laser removal deep into the skin that is the bad part… So happy you’re ok Nate and you’ve got Kara, the best support system through anything…
Good for him for going in and getting checked. I was recently diagnosed with Breast Cancer and had a double mastectomy.  If you haven't been to the Doctor recently, please go and get checked, including Kara.
Glad he is in remission.
Guys!!!!   I am sooooo happy our ate is safe and well.  Sending you both big hugs from NY & NJ
Guys just be careful.... love you both. George from Greece
I went through my own cancer diagnosis and surgery this year, and when Nate was saying he didn’t have words.  I really felt that one. It’s so hard to put into words your feelings after getting that diagnosis. I am happy to be cancer free and so happy that Nate is also cancer free.
♥️
I love watching you guys,  I'm so happy that everything is alright!
I'm glad you're not gonna croak, Nate!  But I'm sad that you DIDN'T SHOW THE SURGERY!!
so happy for you two.... you've got this buddy
O wow Nate im so sorry u hv skin cancer i hope u are doing ok :)
🖕🏾Cancer 🤬🥰
I started crying when I saw the thumbnail. Take care both of you.
I am dealing with the after effects of Basel cell cancer now. It has been 8 months of back and too. Because of a tiny speck on my nose the surgeon had to take off a large part of my right nostril. A facial plastic surgeon made me a new one with cartilage from inside my ear. Doing great now just a few more tweaks. All this to say ALWAYS WEAR SUNSCREEN AND GET A RELIABLE BRAND. Thank goodness both of us paid attention and we had access to great medical care.
Many blessings ..love u guys😘😘🥰
Thank you for sharing this! S glad you’re OK Nate! ❤️
Stay strong Nate.  You are in our thoughts and prayers.  Thank you to you and Kara for sharing the journey of life with us.
Bob Marley said, “You never know how strong you are, until being strong is the only choice you have”. He was so right. Also, "What doesn't kill you will make you stronger." Kara was doing everything she could to be that strong for you. When she didn't have to be strong, she could finally let you see how scared she really was. That's what love really is. Don't miss those yearly appointments, and if something comes up like this, get it seen. That's something that not just for you, but that everyone needs to remember. Take care.
Glad to hear Nate is OK. I started to focus on my health at 25 when I had emergency gall bladder surgery. After that I made sure my nutrition was strong with lots of supplementation of vitamins, whey protein and greens. Really makes a difference in how you body handles things. Maybe you guys can get GNC as a channel sponsor now. LOL
Went through this with my wife few weeks back .small surgery on her forehead ..little scarf but now its all good.
Oh sweeties. Stay safe!!🤗
Geez! Scared the crap outta me! Glad you’re cancer free and on the mend. Take care you two. Sending hugs and prayers for a full and speedy recovery. And people complain about my hat!
Well done! Glad everything turned out great🧡
I cried with Kara im so glad you are clear now Nate all the best to both of you xx
Happy for the outcome, I know what it's like to have a scary diagnosis, and then after months of waiting and tests and procedures get a clean bill of health, with some reminders about precautions and being grateful. I do hope this means more hats and sunscreen and no more glacier climbs in dodgy conditions or other seriously stupid decisions. You ate still going to be you, fun, carefree and adventurous even if you DO learn to be a responsible, grateful adult 😜
Sorry to hear the news.. sending my prayers out to you 🙏
Also, don’t forget spf lip balm. 😉 Relieved to hear Nate’s cancer free. Thanks for reminding some of your more impressionable viewers that life on camera isn’t necessarily the whole picture. 📸 This (episode) reminded me of a quote I saw earlier today. “You know who’s going through a lot right now? Literally everyone. Just be kind.”  🤗
Praying for your recovery- you two are good for one another
As soon as the video started, I stopped everything and started praying for you. I'm so glad your ok and  I will continue to pray for you guys❤️ God Bless You Two🙌
You guys are my favourite YouTubers. I watch you all the day, every day when I have a free time. Reading the title broke my heart and left me with my jaw open. I'm just shocked. I hope you heal. I don't know what to say, I'm just really sad... Just... Just take care, ok? I really don't want ANYTHING bad happen to you... 🙏🏼💔
Nice just get more bandaids and wrap up, Halloween is coming and Nate will be an excellent mummy:)
That was a money grab from a gay man and his beard. Hope she knows
I’ve had shots in the head and I hardly felt it because I’ve had dozens of surgeries on my head somewhere and now I have very little feeling in my head. I honestly can’t imagine having to deal with a procedure on my head with all my nerves working. I’m glad it’s not serious and we praise God for that. Though we definitely will continue to pray for you and hope you feel better soon!❤️🙏🏼
Probably cause you had the covid vaccine
Praying for you both from Jerusalem such a lovely inspiring couple you deserve many long healthy years together!
Praise the Lord!
why do you think your friend died of that aggressive cancer? its from the depop jab.
I have to be honest.. when the results came back and things were positive I just felt like a relief and I started crying.
I saw the plaster last time and couldnt work out if a tag from his hat or something. SO SO glad they got it all xxx
if you have cancer it would because you allowed yourself to be nose and arm jabbed with toxic cancer causing poison. for real so id say if you want to live take baking soda daily do not jab anymore. research the situation my friend it is all over youtube and bitchute.
that quote from Nate's grandfather is brilliant!! Gonna take that with me wherever I go, thanks for sharing! <3
I've been watching you lovely couple for years! Have a speedy recovery, Nate! All the way from the sunny city, Singapore!!
I'm glad you're OK Nate, I wish you a speedy recovery 👍  What a loving a supportive wife you have in Kara, be happy guys ❤️
They should have numbed it more! I had that done on my neck a few months ago, and couldn’t feel a thing. The burning skin got to me, but I definitely couldn’t feel it. What a scare, but glad to hear everything is okay!
I was just about to do my homework because i had still a lot to do and only one day left, but when i saw the title of this video i hust said screw homework im watching this first. And i think i got good karma, cause my teacher said i did really well😁 Anyways its food to hear that your ok🥰 Edit: i meant that its good to hear your ok🥰
We’re very relieved for you. Love you guys.
Ditto of what everybody has said.
God bless you.I have cancer too.I m undergoing treatment.I have very rare one.When I had a chemotherapy I watched your videos.Its help me lots. Julie from Sweden
As a cancer survivor myself, my heart dropped when you said the dreaded "c" word. I was diagnosed with endometrial cancer in January of 2020, before the start of the pandemic. I sacrificed being able to have children with my husband in August of 2020, we married in November of 2018, in exchange for the piece of mind of knowing that I was cancer free. It wasn't a decision that was easily made, but it was the right one. Watching the clips of your journey brought tears to my eyes as I thought of my own. It was a relief to know that you are going to be okay. Thank you for sharing your story and giving hope to those who may be waiting on biopsy results. All to often when we hear the diagnosis of cancer we think the worse, of a death sentence, but thankfully it has been proven to not be the case for many, you being a great example and myself included. Take care of yourselves and thanks again for sharing your amazing adventures with all of us. Sending love from Dallas, TX. ❤️
Omg!  My heart sunk when I saw the title of the video.  I am so glad you are cancer free!!    Four years ago today I lost one of my best friends to cancer, so this was some good news to savor on a day like this.  Again, glad you are well, love your channel!!!  Well wishes from NY state!
I’ve been yelled at to wear sunscreen by dermatologists for decades! Unfortunately, I had a severe sunburn at 14 that did a whole lot of damage.  Basal cell (what Nate had) is really bad because it is a shallow spreading skin cancer and removal can be disfiguring especially on the face.  Squamous cell is really nasty, because untreated it goes deep and can metastasize - I had 2 tiny, early ones on the back of my hand removed this summer.  Melanoma is the mother of all skin cancers. It can spread and metastasize and BOOM, big surgeries, chemo, the works.  Listen to Kara!  Sun protection and skin checks at the dermatologist! So glad you’re OK, Nate ❤️❤️❤️
I’ve often wondered about health insurance for someone while traveling, long term, like you two.  How could we get you to cover some of that
Get better soon
Dear Kara, I loved the quote you mentioned from Nate's grand father. I made a note of it and  from now on I am going to write that every possible places so I can see it every day. You also went through a lot during this time with Nate you must know that you are a super woman. Just know that many people who you may not even know them  love both of you and send you good energies.
Love and support from India
Thank you for sharing this. We also shared ours on our channel. Unfortunate our story of skin cancer did not have a positive outcome. My husband died June 10 2019 from Merkle Cell Carcinoma. A rare aggressive form of skin cancer. It was horrible. I’m glad you shared so others can see make sure you take precautions but also get abnormal bumps sores etc checked out. You guys are a great inspiration to me. It’s my dream to travel the country in a van:):) one day…. One day. Thank you again and I’m so happy your results were positive!!!!
God is Good! So glad your ok Nate!
You are such precious people 🤍 I wish only the best 🙏🏻
Oh my,my heart broke. I cried while watching this. So glad all went well. We love you both and hope for quick recovery.
i’m so happy to hear that you are okay nate. as soon as i seen this video it low key scared me but to know that you are healthy and strong is amazing to hear💗
Bless you,health is the most important thing in life.Happy to hear a good news.Looking forward for you vlogs .
NATE:  I had a mole removed on my back in July 2020.  It was Melanoma and was deeper than the Dermatologist like.  I had surgery removing the area around the mole and also removed lymph glands from under both arms.  Bottom line is the are is clear of cancer and the Dermatologist like my chances to be cancer free moving forward.  Let me know if you want to talk.
I am not kidding when I say I dropped everything when I saw the title. I had to watch the whole thing (your pinned comment really helped!) and I almost teared up. Please take care of yourselves and I'm so so so glad Nate is alright now. It feels like someone close was sick after reading the title and I remember just going not kara and nate, please no, let them be safe. Also this video makes me feel ashamed of the times I thought how "perfect" your life is. Thank you for showing all the sides of life. Be safe.
Kara i know what it’s like living with someone with cancer my dad has had cancer for a wile and it’s hard for me but that’s why I watch you guys all the time it helps me forget what’s going on with my dad and to escape the real world.
Great to know that you are doing fine..May you guys keep on exploring the world for a long long time..Best wishes!!
My husband is constantly in the sun he refuses to wear sunscreen. He thinks that his hat protects him. I wish husbands weren’t so stubborn. I’m so happy to hear that you are going to be OK. I hope that you heal quickly can you move onto the next step in your lives. Thank you for taking us on this journey with you.❤️❤️
You both are so brave, courageous. God bless you both. Lots of 😍
I'm glad he's okay you got me scared real bad at the beginning love you guys <3
This is exactly what I needed. I just found out I have cervical cancer. My life isn’t in danger, but my finances are. I’m uninsured. 😬  I’ve been watching all of your older videos. Just finished your Everest Base Camp Trek videos.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
So glad that he is now cancer free, and I continue to pray for his health. I have an aunt who has literally no skin pigment left. She has to wear the highest SPF sun lotion all the time. She also has a large umbrella when she'd outside for long periods of time. Also she has found some lightweight, linen clothing that covers her body. Hope that helps with whatever precautions Nate has to take now. God Bless the both of you and continued prayers.
💚
My heart sank, you are so brave that you are open to talk a bout it and share your life as you said good times and bad times in YouTube. I admire your courage and positivity ,and I am happy that all went well with the procedure. You are a trooper.
Love you guys. Thanks for showing us the good and bad. You’re human, things happen and I forever appreciate how real you guys are. Nate, good to hear you’re cancer free!!
Very important question - would you please share with us how much all this has cost you. It is mind blowing for the rest of the world, where we get free healthcare, to find out how expensive the treatment is in US. Really glad Nate is ok.
First of all, I’m glad you are OK.   I just wanna say, I really appreciate not doing klickbait and answering the question early on. And thank you for the honest words in the beginning of the video about people who share their life on social media. True words, and I like that you are just different. A lot of the reason why I like your videos so much. :)
So glad you shared this and you might even save a life and persuade someone to go get that spot/strange growth finally looked at! My gran died of skin cancer because she didn't want to make a fuss. And when she finally did it was too late.  Thank you for being real.
When I read the title of this video I dropped everything to watch.  I'm so relieved and happy things turned out so well for you!!!  Take good care of yourselves.  I send my best wishes for continued good health and a lifetime of more adventures.  This could be considered a blessing in disguise to get anything unusual checked out as soon as possible.
Thank you so much for sharing!  What an ordeal ro have live with for so long a time.  Suh a blessing to be cancer-free.  Happy for you!!
Soo happy for both of you♥️ Stay blessed ✨
So glad your ok nate. Love you guys
Everybody takes bad news differently but this would not be a big deal to me. Skin cancer that is slow growing that was caught early no big deal.
So happy you are well, Nate. Both of you are so strong! Sending my love and prayers to you from Iowa❤️
I’m glad you’re sharing this. Not enough people get checked for skin cancer and as you said, it can be life threatening. Everyone in my family has had some sort of skin cancer removed in their life. I was braiding my hair one day and noticed what I thought to be a mole. I got it checked and turned out to be pre-melanoma. If I hadn’t got it checked it could have led to a life threatening stage that required chemo. Skin health is so important! Love you guys!!
I had a heart ache when I read the tittle!!  Love you guys stay strong! Stay faithful ♥️♥️♥️♥️
I am so so happy that you are ok! So much love! 💖
Oh goshhh 😩 (kara’s voice) i was so terrified my heart literally sunk, but once he got the good news i literally teared tears of joy 🥲 , im so glad Nate is okay, it would have been a tough one, anyways back to fun adventures and happiness, big weight off the shoulders (sighs) i love you guys, stay strong and healthy 🥲💗
So glad you are cancer free, from now on have regular check ups,
Thank you for sharing your life with us.
Cancer is cancer.  Cancer scares are just as scary.  I’m so glad to hear that Nate is a okay.
This is what makes you guys so real, and why you are so widely admired, and beloved.   So glad Nate is well, and, Kara: you are a bastion of support! On to your next adventure, oh, fabulous ones!!💃🏻🕺🏻👏🏻👏🏻💗
Hope you get better soon Nata
I feel like one of my friends has cancer :(   I'm sorry Nate. Don't let this dim your light! 🌟🙌🌞
So glad to know you are okay Nate! K&N are one of my favorite youtubers. What you do is so much more than take us to different places. Much love to you both, keep spreading the love!
really u  2" ur label, ///// I have cancer stage 4 that staying we all have the cell in our bodies but takes something to triage it. Stay away from the sun.
After reading the caption,  I can’t help but feel for y’all I enjoy watching you both grow, I love your guys adventures but best advise I can tell you live life to the fullest ❤️
Be strong guys❤❤
Glad to hear Nate is ok, and that you plan on keeping up with those checks - make sure you do, my dad deals with basal cell cancer himself, and he goes every 6 months, and they almost always find a new one or two. He has indeed lost part of an ear to it. MOHS is a great thing, since it really gives confidence on getting all of a particular cancer.
I’m so happy that everything turned out alright!!!
So glad you're okay, and thanks for sharing this difficult story.  Best wishes!
1:27 seconds in and I’m already crying 😭 sending nothing but positive vibes Nate!!!!
Praying for complete healing. God Bless both of you!🙏🙏🙏💕💕💕
Love you guys & your transparency!  So many need to know the risk of skin cancer is real……I’ve had my share, 2 basal cells & 1 squamous!  Sunscreen, the new way of outdoor life!  To all, get any weird bumps or patches checked by a Dermatologist, don’t wait!
So pleased there was a good outcome for you two.  You'll never meet most of us subscribers, but, while I can only speak for myself, I know I'm totally relived at the news and so, so happy you shared as it normalises things for people <3 Big hugs to you both xxx
Scary but so fantastic!  That is why we are so lucky to have doctors, and medical experts hopefully available.  It is so hard to be brave during those times.  Having a great partner is such a blessing and is so important.  If you don't have a romantic partner like in Nate's case find someone who can be by your side.  You never need to be alone even if you might be convinced that you are.  In my experience (a different one) I didn't want to admit to myself or my partner that my particular condition could be serious.  Don't do that.  Don't fret non stop, but check it out with a doctor and be honest with those who can support you and will help. The emotional support will help you to go through treatments and the worry and will help any healing necessary.  No one loves needles, biopsies etc, however those professionals are there to save and improve your life.
I am so sorry you had to go through all this. You are very lucky to have each other for support and i'm so happy that everything turned out to be fine!!
You guys are sooo so loved by your community. Just know that, we are with you through thick and thin. You don't know what you guys have done for me and probably never will. But I do, and I stand behind you guys.
I watch your videos every week and get so much joy out of them. Through you I get to know so much of that wonderful world and you inspire me to be brave and experience it myself....all that said even though I don't know you in person, you are role models for me and I am so glad that Nate is fine. I just wanted to show my support as I have an uncle who fought against leukemia and I know how hard health issues can affect your life.  Lots of love from Paula, a young austrian girl❤
Did I just hear what I think I just heard 👀👀
💕
Glad to see Nate is cancer Free..... Be strong and stay heatlhy..... Thumbs up to Kara for the great support...... Now onto greater adventures.......
Love love love!
I had the exact same surgery on the side of my face, in front of my left ear.  Ended up with 64 stitches in my face and no visible scar.  Glad things worked out for you!
skin cancers are so common! getting checked is really the best bet.  And its not too hard to do which is great!
So happy to hear the prognosis is good! Thank you for sharing your lives with us!
i teared up for you! So sweet!💘
stay healthy nate
Holy shit I got so scared seeing this love from the UK
We believe in you take carr
Dang Nate 🥺 praying for you bro
One of my really good friends beat his throat cancer right after he had his kid. I visited him in this hospital every weekend till he got better. You never realize how cancer will effect your life.
Thank god ur ok 🙌🙌
I just realised why Nate was wearing a bandage 🩹 on his head though It was a time one I cant help but wonder if this was recorded before that video 😂😂  Still tho Nate we all love u guys soo much stay healthy mate ❤️
Been fighting skin cancer for 30 years now. Use sunscreen and do regular checkups with your dermatologists.
I'm so happy Nate is going to be okay, but yet still crying my eyes out watching this! Love you guys! Thanks for sharing!
I’m so glad that you guys managed to get it all sorted! And I also love that you’ve shown us that you don’t see EVERYTHING on Insta! Take care you guys, and can’t wait for your next videos!🥳
FUCK cancer! My wife beat it in 2015. Fucking gnarly but glad you took care of it. Nothing else matters besides living your life. Covid is irrelevant. Be kind, hug people, live life and don’t be scared. You only get one life as far as I know.
Bless you Nate. You and Kara are loved and supported through prayers for your continued health and safety in front of/or without cameras.  ((((HUGS)))) to you both!
You’re recovering! What a tremendous relief that must be. I am so happy that the surgery went well. I hope you are resting comfortably. Don’t rush back to work too soon and stay away from stress! Give yourself plenty of time to recover from this illness. lots of love from India ❤️
Prayers and request Healing Hands from Our Almighty God
Thanks for sharing your story Nate!
Praise God!!! I'm so glad your cancer free! Take care of yourselves! Your health matters! BTW, loved the Video with Amon and Bec and Kinging it!
Recieved to know Nate is okay ! Best wishes, Stay healthy
Great news that Nate is safe bro hope you get well soon and back to adventures again  Prayers to you from me and family  Love from India peace
This video was wonderful yet terrifying at the same time. I’ve had a weird “scab” on my head too for a few years. I haven’t thought anything of it until right now. I’m now (tomorrow because it’s Sunday) going to make an appointment to have it checked. Thank you both and I’m so glad Nate is ok.
I'm 35 and for the first time in my life I'm actually concerned about cancer, with both you and Bec going through health scares at almost the same time it has made me acutely aware of my own mortality ❤ I'm thankful that you were both in tune enough with your bodies to know something wasn't right and to have it checked out
Much love to you guys from Scotland. My dad has also had this through the covid period. Nate you’re one of the most focused and positive bout there … just think how many obstacles you smashed through already. You’ll both  take this in your stride as always.
My dad just told me 5 days ago that he has a lump in his lung. Your story even though not related at all somehow helped me. Thanks. I can’t explain it but when people share hard things with each other it can connect you on another level. That can be scary so I am super proud of y’all for sharing a hard thing and opening that part of yourself up. Just know that for me….someone who was struggling with another hard thing, I found comfort in this. Thanks.
Nate and kara. I folw you for the last year and a half from Israel. I learned to Love you so much. Authentic and good heart people that you are!! You bring so much good to the world just by being who you are!! God loves people like you and has mercy for everyone. I'm so relived to know that the tumor was off .  Please please... start changing your diet... Vegan and unindustrieliesed food Is the cure for so many illnesses!! Please.... Love you... from Israel❤
Im sorry for this happening I felt sad when my mom got news that she had cancer so I know how it feels
I got a mini heart-attack and then I saw the pinned comment. Thank god!
So happy to hear that Nate has totally recovered🤩🤗
🙋💕
Please make sure the doctor cuts out a good decent margin around the tumour.
My heart had dropped!!!I couldnt even watch it first.i had to first come and see the comments.Thank God for healing.
I don't appreciate the clickbait title but I do appreciate that you are okay. Love watching you guys over the years and thankful that everything turned out well!
Oh no!! Get well soon
May Allah almighty bless you Nate
Kara, get your oils after that wound! So glad you guys are well and this part went well and quick!
Thank you for sharing this. I went through something very similar a couple years ago and I remember the same sense of fear and uncertainty. It’s really uplifting to hear your story and be reminded that everyone has things happening behind the scenes that the rest of the world may not see.
We love you 🫂🫂🫂
So so pleased for nates outcome 🙌 sending you all the best from the UK 🇬🇧😀❤😊
so grateful and happy and blessed to know Nate is cancer free and that you two continue to handle what life throws your way with love, care & kindness...Nate you did great narrating this "adventure"...continued good health to you both
I did wonder a little about the bandage, I noticed it a few episodes back and you guys hadn't said anything so I assumed it was just something you didn't want to share and that would have been ok ❤ I know that we don't always see all the ups and downs on social media and it's always up to the person how vulnerable they want to be with us. We love you and I'm glad you're ok x
My sincere prayers for continued healing Nate!  You’ve got a strong Wife, and your Faith will carry you thru ANYTHING!  God bless you both!  ❤️
Nate u r my hero.  When I had my mohs surgery I was under anesthesia and out cold.  There was no way I coulda done it awake - mine was in the side of my face and  I have an even weaker stomach than u.  So glad it turned out okay!
So so relieved to hear Nate is fine now. Wish you the best ahead ♥️
The American health care system, where they actually have to cut into you 3 times before deciding to pull something unimportant out.
Now it's time to go to Canada 🇨🇦...we welcome you.  Come to Calgary
Thank god u r out of danger.Hope u r blessed with good health forever now🌸
Thankful that it’s nothing to bad!
I love you guys so much! I am thankful that you are cancer-free, Nate.  Thank you for sharing your difficult journey. I am a shamanic healer and I am sending powerful healings to you both. Namaste!
Love ya Nate💕
My heart fell out of my chest so happy to see Nate is cancer free !!!   praying he stays cancer free forever ! ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️ love your channel
Nate, I'm so happy you got the help you needed. Basal cell is hardly ever a systemic problem, so once you get it out you're done!  Use sunscreen religiously and you may never see another.  Sorry for the headache. Hugs if they're okay, to both of you!
I relate to this video so much in this season of my life. Thank you for sharing your story, I feel a lot less alone with my health journey and I'm so happy Nate is cancer free! Stay safe, sending love from Clarksville!❣
Not matter what kind of cancer, it is always scary to hear.  Thanks you for sharing.  You are correct, those of us watching do not always remember you are like us…human, vulnerable and have emotions just like everyone else.  This touched my heart.  Hopefully you kids have also learned to not put off medical issues too long.  Time is of the essence when it come to life.
I was wondering why he had a bandaid on his head in last video. Prayers for a speedy recovery and continuous cancer free years ahead
Prayers going up 🙏
So glad to hear all is OK and such an important message to share.  Since skin is the largest organ of our bodies it is a critical we pay close attention to abnormalities. I had what seemed to be a pimple on the back of an ear lobe.  It was the same cancer as Nate's but fortunately they we able to treat it with a topical medication rather than MOHS…but go figure, the back of my ear lobes don't even get sun.  Now add the Dermatologist to your yearly checkups.  Love grandfather's quote.  23 Psalm.
I don't know how I feel about the video announcing that you have cancer including a paid promotion.
when i was around 11 or 12 i was diagnosed with the same type of skin cancer around the same place where you had it i was really scared and i tough they had to save of my hair fortunally they diddn't. when i was waiting in the waiting room i actually also was the youngest and probably a record for being the youngest patient ever with this type. i have a scar that sometimes hurt (tempature change, brushing hair etc (but now that i have dreadlock dont really need to brush it)) but other then that i am great i am 35 now. You got this! Stay strong.
Love the twinkly light touches.
Prayers to you Nate, cancer has taken way to many people from my life in the last year but it sounds like your going to be okay. I think you are incredibly lucky to have a wife like Kara, she’s strong and resilient! You could tell she was scared but never showed it for you. Beautiful marriage❤️
So glad Nate's okay now! This must've been a scary experience
Hey Nate, as someone who hates big change and also doctors and shots; be strong brotha ❤️ y’all got this, and you have the best support team around. Be strong man, for yourself and for the people that love you ❤️❤️❤️
i am happy the cancer is gone but that chick fillet made me super hungry
This video reminded me to make an appointment at my dermatologist!
Say NATE…Usually basil cell cancers are not a big deal…Find them and have them removed, as you did…Yes, and wear sunscreen always…A big hat and stay out of the sun at high noon…One basil cell cancer often means more to treat as you age…Routine checks by a dermatologist is not a bad idea…I’ve been cut a number of times…ALL THE BEST…Richard and Jan from Canada…🍒🍒🍒🍒🍒🍒…Life is just a bowl of cherries…
TITLE: I HAVE SKIN CANCER   VIDEO STARTS: INCLUDES PAID PROMOTIONS  😂.  NEXT VIDEO TITLE: IM DYING  VIDEO STARTS: INCLUDES PAID PROMOTIONS
Just as I saw this video,I became so sad!!You guys have influenced me this much...that without even knowing you,I still feel for u...May God shower his blessings upon you..We all are with you!! Love and best wishes from India..Stay strong Kara And Nate
This is such good news that they were able to remove the cancer.  But appreciate how harrowing it is to wait for results.  I had the same issue one summer with a spot on my face I had while on vacation with family.  Had to wait several days for results because they would only let my doctor back home (who was also on vacation) give me the results, which made me feel that the news must be bad. But he eventually confirmed that they had gotten all of the cancer by removing the chunk.  And now I have only a slight mark.  I loved Kara's grandfathers quote...about health being a crown only the unwell can see.
Oh, this scared me so much. I care so much about the two of you and I'm so relieved to hear that everything has turned out well! ❤️🥰
We love y'all!
Very thankful. Happy for you.
First, I want to say that I am SO glad, and happy for y’all that Nate is CANCER FREE!  Secondly, I wanted to say that I have had such a weird feeling all Summer long that one of you were dealing with a health issue behind the scenes that you weren’t publicly talking about.  Third, I want to say that no matter how small, or how large and serious a cancer is if you are going through it then it IS a big deal, and your feelings ARE valid. As someone who lost my dad on March 7, 2017 to stage 4 Mather cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma after a 3&1/2 year battle in 3/7/17, and on May I lost my eldest sister to stage 4 ovarian cancer after a 3yr 3 months battle. I don’t look at losing my dad, and my sister to cancer as like “they lost”. I look at it as “they won”. Because I’ve NEVER in my entire life seen the strength they had while they were fighting for their lives. They both surpassed the expectations of their doctors, and lived longer than anyone thought they would. We had  3+ extra years with both of them. And although my heart still aches for them I know that they are both in a better place, cancer and pain free.  Nate, you are a rock star.  Kara, you are such a great support system for your husband.  Sometimes I don’t feel like there is enough of that going around with the day and age we are living in where it is tabo to say you love your husband and you support him 100% in what he does, and what he is going through.
See you soon in Canada... Don't worry Nate, we have not seen the sun here in 2 weeks. You're good.
Glad to hear that Nate is ok but omg when I saw the title 🙏💓 and yes health is everything that's true 🙏💓
I wish the best for Nate and Kara.  Thank you, so much, for spreading the word about cancer.
Oh goodness Nate. I think you have been really brave and good for Kara to get you to go and have it checked again. I can't tell you how pleased I am that you have been given an all clear, it now gives you the green light to go out and get up to other crazy antics together.Talking of that I'm off to watch you both with Craig & Ammie (Kinging-it) & Eamon & Bec's. Take Care & Stay Safe, Gentle Hugs, UK
your so strong nate
Paid advertisement for something serious?
So glad everything is ok! I’m a stage 3 Hodgkin’s lymphoma survivor as of March this year. Cancer is scary, no matter what! Love your videos 💕
i was so worried for nate i cant imagine how hard that was. i am so glad nate is ok you are my favorite channel and you always make me smile. i hope you are doing great you guys are so fun and kind so keep going on adventures
Thank you guys for sharing what’s been happening for you and I’m sorry you had to go through that. I think sharing is a brave thing to do and will help so many people. Sending love to you both x
🙏🏼💗
So Happy for Nate that now he is well  .
we got you bro
With my hubby and I both having heard that diagnosis word of “cancer” we understand that weird feeling of no words you had Nate.  We are so thankful you are cancer free though I don’t think you are ever the same once you understand that in a second something like “cancer” can change your world.  You guys are amazing and we will continue to pray for you safe travels and good health while we enjoy your amazing journeys.
Wow
Thank you for sharing.  I think it’s important no matter what age you are to be aware of skin cancer. Glad your out come is good. Wear sun protection!
Get well soon Nate. Jaipur, Rajasthan, India is waiting for you both to visit us again.
Guys I feel for you and congrats to a successful treatment. My family has always been dealing with cancer and this year is no different with my oldest brother being diagnosed with pancreatic and lung cancer this summer. We dropped everything at work to spend time together and have one more adventure together. Never ever ever wait! Tell the ones you love that you love them NOW! Do that one more adventure! Make one more memory
Having been through the whole cancer situation myself twice since late 2019 I can relate. In the end though, things usually works out for the better how hard it may be to get there. 😉
damm this scared the crap out of me i lost my father a few years back to cancer. im so happy for you guys nate is cancer free. enjoy canada after this great news
Good luck 👍🏻 speedy recovery
First, I'm really sorry that you had to go through this. Second, thank you so much for sharing your experience! So many people think this is only something that happens to people over 50 or 60. It's great for you to share so that everyone pays attention to to their body.
Praying for you Nate 🙏🏽❤️
Thank you for sharing this!
Love how after they took a chunk out of nates head he still drove the van after haha
Nate: are you good? Kara: mhhmm Nate: are you sure?  Kara: mhhhm  You can see in her eyes that she is fighting against tears ♥️
Wow I am amazed that despite the procedure, Nate was driving. He's a trooper for sure.
So happy for you both. Regardless of the level...it's a scary thing to go through.
Nate, I've been there with the skin cancer, on my face, a couple of times. Too many summers on Cape Cod in my youth (in those days few people used sunscreen). Its kind of scary, I know. The tough part was the size of the of the excavation each time, the doc kept on sampling to make sure the site was clear. My dear spouse insisted on showing me the surgery site via a mirror! OMG!  But in the end it all worked out. The funny thing is I need to go back in for another potential face cancer spot I discovered via a selfie of all things. Thanks for motivating people to get health issues taken care of! Don't put it off.
So happy to know it was not something big! I so love you guys. Please take care! And I love you kara you are the best partner that anyone can have. ❤️ Goodluck
Nate. Glad to hear you are on the mend.  Time stamp: 9:35 papaws are worth a listen to once in a while. Sometimes just to humor them, sometimes because they are right. Grannies too. This is totally off topic but how the hell did you two grow up in Tennessee and not know what a hush puppy was. Y'all never been to a fish fry?
Very happy to hear you are cancer free. Stay strong
Thank you both for sharing. I had skin cancer at age 25. Luckily it was getting it cut out and that was it. My mother has had skin cancer on her face and arms that she has had to have chemo cream treatments. It is a blessing seeing you both pull together through this. You both are amazing.

I just found out today my mom is dying of cancer...
Reading the title made my heart sink, hope you guys are both ok now!
Unlucky son
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽❤️
Hey Nate. I had basil cell on my ear and a spot on my chest. Had same procedure done 13 years ago. Everything is still good to this day. As my surgeon said, If your going to have cancer, this is the one to have. Stay safe and invest in sunblock!!
Glad he’s okay. I literally screamed what at lunch break 🥺
Feeling relieved to know that you are ok. Watching caption creates huge suspensions. You're genuine entertainers guys! Stay strong!
So so so glad to hear Nate is okay! Take it easy and recover!! All the love
I hope he will be better.
Happy to hear you've recovered and doing well!!! Its tough but thank you for sharing your experience with all of us<3   *** Silly question- who takes care of your house when you're away? How do you find trusted house-sitters?
Thank you for sharing such a personal life event.   Hearing the C word is scary. ❤🙏
The title broke me , but now I’m happy for you , I’m happy that you’re okey
Glad to hear that Nate is going to be okay. Whew! Get well soon Nate. Love you guys.🥰
I am so relieved & happy that Nate is going to be OK. I was so nervous the whole video until the all clear. I have no doubt you felt it so much worse these past few months but you are both amazing and we love you and omg I'm crying tears of happiness right now 🥲🥰😍
Sunscreen, no more tanning, long brimmed hats, arm covers. Protect, protect, protect. Speedy recovery, Nate.
Wear your sunblock every single day you guys!!!!
Thank you for sharing.
God will never give you more than you can handle. Sending my love and prayers.
lmao rip bozo
So happy Nate is ok! All the best, you guys deserve the world ❤️❤️
A few years ago I had the same skin cancer type, I had it in my face. A plastic surgeon removed it and they also got in out on the first try. But I do remember the waiting for the biopsy results are much worse than the actual surgery. Since then I am double careful with the sun, one scare is enough! During summer I am either in the shadow or wearing sunscreen SPF 50.
So glad it isn't melanoma. Yay!!!
Seriously, this was a wonderful PSA for anyone ignoring warning signs.
My heart dropped reading the title.
What was the bill for all of this treatment, asking from the UK.
I Pray You Get Well
What a relief to hear they were able to get it all! Don’t mind me, just crying tears of joy for you guys. 🥲
I'm a nurse that's what I was going to say wear your spf and a hat and men commonly get precancerous ares on the tops of thier ears back of the neck  so glad Nates ok I'm in Canada 🇨🇦 so glad your coming 😀
Aw, I'm glad Nate's cancer-free!! It's a good thing you caught it early and the treatment was smooth. This video gave me flashbacks to when I had a biopsy at 17, I definitely cried, so props to Nate for staying strong!
Stay strong Nate great job;)
so how about not fooling your viewers with misleading title?
Thank God Nate is cancer free!!!! I do have a question. WHY ARE THERE SO MANY THUMBS DOWN?????
ok a free facelift at the same time that is a for sure bonus lol
Very glad for you Nate!  Awesome Kara how you took care of Nate!! ❤
New subscriber from Eamon and Bec. I, too, had Mohs surgery on my forehead. Its been 2 years now and the only thing I would tell you is that you might not have the same sensations in your surgery area. My forehead feels numb most of the time. But you get used to it. I have dermatology checks every 6 months and usually have several spots frozen. Thanks for sharing your experience.
Sorry to hear about this traumatic cancer experience. How good you are to share this with your followers. You will never know how many younger lives you've saved with this post. While basal is a relatively minor skin cancer, that is not true of all skin cancers. My husband claims what dermatologists call "the trifecta": basal, squamous, and melanoma, so we know a thing or two about MOHS and other skin cancer removals. Again, thanks for letting folks know that younger people can also get skin cancer.
Nate, I feel you friend. I have had 8 Basal Cell surgeries. Including having both sides of my nose reconstructed. You will be fine! Sunscreen and hats are the best defense.
So happy for the good outcome! 😘
I have had 3 spots remove in the last 18 months. My thoughts are with you guys!!:
🌓So glad that Nate is ok. What a wonderful blessing. Praying for y’all, love ya🤎🙏🏾👏🏾🙌🏾
All my best for you Nate, I'll save any positive energy for you. as for you too kara,
stay strong guys!!
Ohhh no. So glad he is ok. Y’all please please be careful. Love you guys!!!
I'm so glad to hear that Nate is okay now. Thank you for sharing your story and being so open🙌🏻
Omg I’ve been watching u guys for a year now omg when I saw this I cried I’m glad Nate is cancer-free  we all love u guys 💕
Love and prayers❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏
My mom had this exact cancer. But now she’s completely better!
So glad everything turned out ok… Did they ever tell you how u got ur head infected in Asia? Anyways just so happy for u guys enjoy ur time in my home country!!! Cant wait to see the Canadian Volgs XD If you’re heading to Van make sure u check out English Bay and if ure in TO make sure u enjoy an afternoon in Yorkville for shopping/great coffee! Safe trip & stay healthy
Thanks for sharing, guys. Praying for you, Nate. Godspeed.
Kara, for the past few months I did notice something was off with u. U looked down. Now it’s clear, u were worried sick for Nate.
We love you Kara and Nate! Stay safe <3
Stay strong
🙌🏾❤️
Feel for you my thoughts are with you.
Congrats!
i feel silly crying and smiling after that phone call, but it really hit me .
🙏 for you
Alhamdulillah... Hope you dream couple will make us visit many many more interesting places for years ahead.
Cheers guys, glad Nate's ok. All The best from NYC!
First off, that's super great news! Please take care of your noggin - no roughing it for the next couple weeks, let that gorgeous head of hair heal properly. :)  Secondly, I was really impressed w/ your camera work and editing this time around. Establishing shots, bridging shots, great use of aerial shots all used to create a continuous narrative to tell a story that's not typical for you. I just felt more immersed in your video today than usual, and for this topic, that was a great thing. *hugs*
Yes so happy for you. I'm going to pray for you Nate everyday. May God bless and protect you two always and your families. Love you two. Big hug and kisses from: Terrebonne, Quebec, Canada  xxxxoooo😘♥️🌈🙏
Kara is me. My son was recently diagnosed with muscular dystrophy and google is not your friend but it’s so tempting
Thank you for sharing this Nate! I’m so happy that it is treatable and that you are ok💕
Hey Kara and Nate ~ new subscribers here.. we were really touched by this video and we appreciate that you have chosen to be so vulnerable to so many people. Your channel is uplifting and inspiring. We trust your content and are here to stay.
This is the second person I'm subscribed to that has had skin cancer, definitely a sign for me to get a dermatologist appointment. I'm glad you were able to have it removed and that it was easily treatable!
Had my first basal cell skin cancer at 28.n chest.3 more followed.still alive. My son has one skin cancer on his back, from swimming and beach,he was in his 20's.very common. Thought you had melanoma.thats deadly! Good luck.
Wait what??
Thanks for being brave and posting this, many people would not. Thanks for being part of our lives feeling like you are part of my family. lol, you are part of my family, and as family we share the good and the bad, that's life! Do you know a song called "Class of 99. Wear sunscreen"? lol, showing my age, but after hearing that song, I put sunscreen on all year.Thank you for asking people to wear sunscreen. And I must admit living in Canada, I got a little excited about your comment, about going to Canada, I am guessing you are coming to see the leaves changing colour, and adventures this Fall take care of yourselves..
❤❤❤
Great news!
i think i have it on my forehead from a sunburn on the boat sniff
Hey guys tough times don’t last but tough people do
I’m glad Nate got it taken care of and is cancer free.  Take care you guys!
I'm so sorry you're going thru this. I suggest watching MadeYewlook's video on the same topic. It will help ease your mind so much. Hoping for the best for you and Kara. Love you both ❤️❤️❤️ https://youtu.be/qA-NWRhAF2M
In all of these camper video all across YouTube I constantly thought- I hope these guys are wearing their sunblock everyday and reapplying 3 times a day!
Your follawers are proud of you Nate
I could not make it through this video without tearing up🥺...I'm so glad that Nate is okay and Kara is so strong!!❤
Yo God Bless y’all guys and keep up the good work on YouTube
Thank the Lord you are ok!  So glad it all worked out.  Take care.
There are so many kinds of skin cancer, but from the serious looks on your faces I presume it's melanoma. Yes, speed is of the essence. Blessings to you both
Thank you for sharing!! As a pasty red head with skin cancer in the family, no amount of sunscreen should not be taken away at tsa. It should be considered medication more than contact solution should be
❤️
Nate, wishing you the very best and a speedy recovery. It's so authentic the way you share everything from how to videos to we did this, and endured this of all things. We all are with you and sending you lot's of love. Kara, you are such a strong woman and you set such a great example. Sending lot's of hugs from all of us. We love y'all 3000! :)
So sorry you had to go through this
Great video❤️ So glad Nate is all good🥰 Also Kara and her covering Nate’s eyes as she describes the piece taken was magic and adorable in a very stressful situation🤦🏻‍♀️ Take care and I am telling everyone I know to wear SPF🤣🙏🏻💁🏻‍♀️
Kara’s face while she was trying to be so strong totally melted my heart.
You both did amazing! I'm so glad you are ok. All the best ❤💙
Cancer is a scary word and terrifying diagnosis, regardless of type.  It took me six months to be able to say I have cancer after my diagnosis.  #cml survivor 11+years
So glad Nate is going to be ok! Keeping you both in my prayers as you continue to heal and have safe travels.
Stay strong…. Stay healthy…. Wish you More and more adventurous rides to follow..
Glad you are going to be fine. Sunscreen and a hat is your new bestie! My dh has been through six Mohs surgeries, and is having shit frozen off of him every 3 months. He's so blah about it now. And the scars go away. So so lucky. As my derm told me, basal is the best to have. Again, happy you are ok.
i got very scared! :(   im glad ist not bad...
Honestly I felt like I was watching a family member on the screen, my heart just dropped. I'm so glad you are showing the other side of cancer, and how people do become cancer free. Very emotional and greatful. Live every day to its fullest!
Awh guys so glad to hear Nate is ok but sorry you had to go through the worry,take care 🥰💝💕
Great video! Loved seeing the process as well as hearing the PSA at the end. Content influencers in all the best ways! BTW, I had melanoma about 5 years ago and had surgery. I've known so many, many people with much more serious cancers that I always felt weird about saying that I had cancer as well.  But, as you so eloquently demonstrated, it doesn't matter how "serious" the diagnosis is, it is still a big wake up call. We should all take our health seriously--and not for granted. Thank you again for a lovely, lovely video.
Thank you for sharing this video l wish you all the best
Glad everything went well and that Nate is ok! take care guys!
Nate and Kara are so genuine.  They are not only the best travel vloggers out there, but also convey some important messages as well.  Sometimes quick but important messages like, "wear spf 50 sunscreen" .   And sometimes a Set of videos, like the ones from Iraq, where they basically show how wonderful most people are in every country, even a war torn country like Iraq; which most people would consider our  enemy.  They are absolutely amazing ambassadors to our country. They make us proud to be American.
Oh no I'm so sorry that you have Bad stuff going on im plarying for you🙏 god Blills you
Check out RSO oil. I have Leukemia and have been treating with Vitamin K and A. I go to the Mayo Clinic every 4 months. It was 3, but my markers are now normal. Doctors in Germany prior to WWII proved 1, cancer is a lack of Vitamin K. 2, A kills cancer. Higher dosages of K caused my numbers to drop faster. Give it a try. It's much better to prevent than to treat.
We’re so happy that Nat isn’t in any serious risk and that the cancer is as fully removed/ I think it’s important that people realize that social media influencers have lives behind the camera and this is one of the ugly realities.
Wow, such a relief. I am glad you are ok!!💕💕
Mini heartattack
My heart beat just stop for a moment when I saw the title for the 1st time
The title made my heart SINK. I am so glad he is okay and he has you as his partner for life. Love you guys so much and am praying for his recovery and health !!! ❤❤
Thank you for this candid video on Nate's medical challenge. It is important to alert others of what can unexpectedly happen, especially when we are young and feel infallible.  We take for granted our health, until it is compromised.  I have long accepted the fact that if one has good health as we age, we have the most of what we need in life.
So happy to hear Nate is on the mend and you two are a great inspiration for couples everywhere! Hope you enjoyed your time in Minnesota at the BWCA! Continued safe future travels!
You both are Winners and God will definitely take care of you both ❣️❣️❣️ God Bless you both dear
So happy you are ok Nate 💙💙
God bless you and may God be with you were ever you are.
Grateful for your good news! Thanks for sharing your experience and may God continue to bless your journies!
I was hoping the title was a clickbait. Our thoughts and prayers are with you Kara and Nate. You add so much light to our lives and we hope and pray that you guys stay happy and healthy for a very very long time to come!
Grateful for your good news! Thanks for sharing your experience and may God continue to bless your journies!
Sorry to here you're going through all this. My husband has had his third surgery. All basal cell skin cancer. Both of you are not a lone in this as I'm going through the same thing that Kara is.
BCC is nothing to worry about, just put on sunscreen and be alert non of them develops a melanoma
Not that y’all want to hear this but your van sounds pretty shitty. Like you probably want to go in and have that van looked at.
I’m happy that things turned out fine.  Take care of yourselves.  Your whole life is still before you. Blessings!
So very happy that Nate caught the cancer at the right time and that you have gotten the darn beast removed. Big hugs and thank you Kara, for being such a trouper! I would also like to thank you for the link you shared, 'it's okay not to be okay'. Hugs to you both and thank you for sharing with us.
PRAYERS TO YOU BOTH WOW ! I CAN FEEL THE EMOTION IN YOU BOTH GOD IS GREAT AND WITH CHRIST ALL IS POSSIBLE  AND CAN BE OVERCOME ! PRAYERS TO YOU BOTH!
I’m glad Nate is ok.  My mom and father in law both had Basal Cell on the side of their faces and it was a one and done for them.  Lots of sun protection and hats for the future.  Hugs to you both!
I’m happy that Nate is better
Hope you are well soon we are here for you.
Wishing you all the best Nate! My man and I have grown to love your videos and you and Kara have inspired us to travel more. We appreciate you sharing more personal parts of your life and love to see how you and Kara carry each other during these times.
High five🙏God bless
I'm so sorry this happened to Nate. Sending prayers and love your way. So glad and relieved that all is well.
Health and family are more important than money. You seem obsessed with money .
I happened to noticed the mark on Nate’s head but I was worried to comment it on here, but I’m so so so so glad he is fine as he always has been. My prayers will be with you always.
I am glad you are doing well but I have a question are you a Christian?btw I love y’all
And I’m so relieved you’re ok ok. Kara and Nate for years!  And maybe soon some mini Karas and Nates.  You can show us how to travel with mini mes. 😂😂😂 God Bless.
My mother had skin cancer, all three forms.  She followed up regularly with the skin doctor who checked her body.  And was able to remove the cancer before it spread.  Cancer did not take mom's life.  Happy that you will follow up also.
Glad to hear things went successfully.  Thinking of you two and wishing you well.
OMG guys... That was scary!! So happy that Nate is on the way to getting well...stay strong both of you.. Get well soon... Lots of love n blessings...
So happy that all went well, you guys are the best love your travels ❤🧡💛💚💜💜💙
Squamous cell carcinoma.  On my upper lip at 40.  A newly divorced woman.  Talk about SUCK!  Now? No scar, no cancer, great plastic surgeon.  Get your skin checked every year!  Don't worry about it... just stay safe and get checked.  Oh, and sunscreen!  Basal cell covered both my parents starting in their 50's.  Always getting little spots frozen off.  SO don't freak if it pops up on your arms, face or forehead as you age.  Get your skin checked!!! (You, too Kara!) *Give to American Cancer Society. Beat Cancer!*
Okay well that was crazy news!
So happy for Nate to be free of cancer, stay healty Nate. Blessings
I know your lives are not solid highlights - though it often looks like it! Thanks for being honest about other aspects of your lives - the physical and emotional pain.
I could'nt hold back my tears the whole vid. I look up to u guys so muchh and all these years of watching u made me feel like i was a part of ur life and seeing this title just broke my heart into pieces. So so sooo glad all is ok now. May god give strength and courage to u and all the people reading this to face all the challenges in life.❤
I feel for ya.  I had my first basal cell removed (MOHS) from my forehead at age 31, it left a hole the size of a silver dollar and required plastic surgery to repair what was left behind.  I’m now 44 and have since had the following removed.  A basal cell from the top of my head, a squamous cell from my back, a squamous cell from my neck, and a melanoma from my stomach.  Early detection is key, I see my dermatologist twice a year and he’s always freezing pre cancerous stuff off of me.  For a while I was seeing him every 3 months, mainly for peace of mind.    I spent a lot of time in the sun as a kid, was a lifeguard as a teenager, and have had jet skis and boats most of my adult life.  My dermatologist told me “you could spend the rest of your live in a cave and skin cancers would still pop up for the rest of your life for damage done 20+ years ago.  Wear sunscreen and protective clothing, don’t get burned, and see me twice a year”.  My dermatologist is the most important doctor in my life.    Take care of yourself and don’t let this speed bump ruin your love of the outdoors.
As someone who works in a dermatology department in a large hospital in a large city, I can tell you that you need to take really good care of your skin in the sun. Especially the lighter skinned you are. We perform MOHS surgery everyday. You’re lucky it was an easier one and in a discreet spot. Yes, they do pull your skin together. Mini face lift. Sometimes it takes more than one surgery depending on the part of the body. Noses and ears are the hardest ones. Take care of those especially and your whole face. You don’t want it anywhere in your face. You’ll be great!  Go to your follow ups.  Congrats!!!!
I almost had a heart attack
No worries my mom has has skin cancer twice now, one spot on her back and one on her right ear. It's nothing really dangerous but it shouldn't be left because it can develop into something dangerous.
So so happy that Nate is going to be ok 🎉🎉
Thanks for sharing!
This is the push I needed to go get my skin checked out. So glad Nate is okay. Thanks a lot for sharing this!
just fast forward thru your video today..nah..pass..
Sunblock and a large hat (like a Boonie hat) from here on out.  Sunglasses at all times outside as well.   After yelling at my husband for 16 years to wear sunglasses outside and take lutein, when he finally got the diagnosis of early cataracts at age 57 he finally started listening to me.
really hoping for best for both of you. Thanks for sharing. Take care
I was 11 when I had my surgery after years I still remember the smell of my skin burning, last week I found out that I'm having another surgery sometime soon. I'm glad you are willing to share this it's not easy to talk about this kind of stuff stay strong.
God I cried seeing the title. My grandpa found out he had cancer back in 2015 and passed away in 2016. So I really hate cancer.
Best wishes ❤️❤️
When i saw the video name my jaw just dropped. So glad to know that this exprience ended up at that proceedure and that everything is ok. Take care of yourseles! Cant wait to see what's next, hope you are feeling much better nate! ❤❤❤
Nate and Kara both of you brought laughter and joy to our life  during sad and stress moments.   Nate i hope for you a speed recovery  and healthy life. Kate as you ware here for us, we will be there for you guys.  all the love from KSA
Glad to know you are in remission Nate 💕 much love too the both of you ✨
I've had basal cell since 1999.  I go every six months for a head-to-toe check-up.  With my strawberry blonde hair, it's a necessity.  I can't tell you how many areas the doctor has treated in the past 20 plus year.  Some I don't even know about.  Rarely do I walk out of my six month check-up without something being treated.  I wear a lot of sun screen.  Hope to see your vids when you're in Michigan, where I live!
Good guys
Read your title, and just froze.😢 Oh, no.. Turned off the tv, and watched in  serious silence. Totally nervous the whole time. But.. What a relief to hear he was cleared! 🙏❤️ Stay strong, Nate! (and Kara! 💓) We love ya!!
As a psychologist, who lives in Canada, I am so glad to not only know that Nate is OK but was very happy to see you encouraging people to access therapy. We all need to be done with the stigma of reaching out for help and I want to thank you for doing your part. I hope your visit to my home country is as enjoyable as your videos are to me.
It so sad to ear but don't worry I pary for you may Allah give you good health get well soon love from Pakistan
Hope your ok dude
So glad you are good Nate, I was crying happy tears when y'all got the phone call. Thank you for sharing this, it probably is helping someone.
Despite the Economic crisis its still a good time to start up an investment. ,
Bless you!
Glad everyone is ok. Good job supporting him Kara :)
kara is all of us turning to webMD ahaha I relaaaaaate
This hit me so hard right in the feels.  OMG Nate and Kara. Big big hugs
glad you are out of danger....god bless you both
Thank you Kara and Nate! I am struggling with my own health and I can't explain why this ment so much to me but it really did. Get feeling better Nate. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Good to hear your cancer free. Been dealing with cancer questions for a while till June this year. Found a lump on my kidney August last year 2 ct's and an mri in Dec. Then Covid delay,  surgery in May.  Took out half my left kidney. But the surgical margin was  negative so no chemo or follow up treatments. Just monitoring for a few years. It's hard to describe how you feel when you hear the "C" word. But you just have deal with it one day at a time and move on and everyone does that differently. Glad to hear you are bringing us more  adventures to come. Keep up the good work!!!
That message from the doctor…. 😬. I make a point of staying out of the 🌞. I am absolutely guilty of not wearing sunscreens when outdoors. I’ve tied mineral & chemical sunscreen but find I don’t like the feel or oder &  it’s messy. This video reminded me to make an appointment with the dermatologist about the dark spot on my ✋ & to check out a suspicious mole. Thanks for sharing. I imagine a lot of us will benefit from this reminder. I’m happy to hear Nate was fortunate. I know it likely doesn’t seem so but the fact it was (relatively) easily resolved is extremely lucky.
I dont even know about skin cancer. It seems  many western people have this because they tanning.?  As a Vietnamese, we cover body very carefully when going out in summer. I started using spf since last year (26)
I had skin cancer removed below my eye. That stuff hits in the weirdest places. I had another friend have it removed from between their toes!!!  So it’s always good to get a yearly full body exam!  Glad you had a great outcome. I had a MOHS surgery done for mine, too, with the same results. Scary as hell when you hear the diagnosis (especially since both of my parents had cancers!!!) but this is about the “best” one you can get if you’ve got to get it. Enjoy your trips!  Have fun in Canada (I’m a Canadian living in Virginia!). It’s a beautiful country….but they really both are. ♥️
Well  delln
The best therapy can be found by looking up🙏🏻
I “liked” this to support your channel, but I definitely DON’T like this video! So happy you’re ok!
I suspect the dislikes are for the over dramatic acting and music. It’s good to share things but this is over the top for a thumbnail. If anyone has had Basal, you realize how over-dramatic this whole video is. Nate and Kara must not realize how common this form of cancer is…
Well done bro!!❤️☺️🙌
❤️
My heart skipped for a second after reading the title. You r my fav youtubers. Happy to hear that u r healthy as before.
Cancer is horrible Nate talking from experience scars are reminders of how strong we actually are got a massive part cut  out of my shoulder stay strong brother 💪💪
Not gonna lie I shed a tear not only for Nate but because I lost my mom to cancer when I was 3 and my dad last year (not cancer) you guys have been a light to my world when I’m laying in bed at night. Keep up the content and I’m so happy to know Nate is going to be ok.
Best wishes to both of you n stay safe❤️ happy to hear everythings alright now ☺️
How do these two have so many subs?
I’m so glad to hear that Nate is okay ! Must have been so stressful, I hope you guys are doing well❤️
Get Well Nate ! Please dont let anything happen to you, praying for you always :)
So proud of both of your strengths.So sad to hear this but very happy that Nate is on the mend. May god bless both of you with good health, joyful life and lovely future !!!!!!!😊😊😊😊😊😊
Praise God! Glad that you’re okay. Praying for y’all’s continued health🙏🏾
Take care
I WAS SO SCARED.
Basal cell is very common from what i understand. The mohs procedure will keep it gone with a high success rate. I was diagnosed with mucinous carcinoma on my lower eyelid and had my mohs done as well. Just want you to know you're going to be ok. Hearing the word cancer is terrifying and i know how you guys felt and feel. Keep the faith and pray. I got clear margins after my mohs and looking forward to a new perspective on life.
Thank for sharing your experience. Y'all are amazing 🥰
Love that quote " Good health is the crown on a well man's head that only the sick can see."
Maybe take the monitization from this video and donate it to skin cancer research?
I noticed the bandage on the back of Nate's head during your recent treehouse videos, and figured it was a biopsy/skin cancer removal. Glad to know Nate's now cancer free and on the mend. My dad and my husband have both had Mohs surgery for skin cancers. Please know that it's a very effective procedure, and you should not worry. Sending healing thoughts...
OK so contender for best quote for today "if something happens today and there is a reason to worry, we'll worry about it then" perhaps accidentally powerful words  Good luck Nate make a speedy recovery, Amen
It takes great courage to be vulnerable! It is an honour that you felt comfortable enough with all of us to share that side with us! Thank you 💕 And today and each day moving forward we celebrate this fantastic news!! My heart is full for both of you!! 🌹 P.S. Where y'all going in Canada? I live out in the country in Southeast Manitoba 3 mins off the #1 HWY!! Lots of room to park the van!! 😜 In case you want add a stop on your journey! 🙃😳😃✨✌️
Sooo lucky, basal cell is a sort of  mutant wart. Now a melanoma over 2 years is death sentence..... We have both prevalent in my family.
so glad hes better much love <3
I’m sorry this happened to you but do u rly think it’s appropriate to put in a paid promotion in a serious type of video like this…
My dad had cancer and had to have 3 surgery's and had at least 10 hospital visits and he had 4 years of treatment and he is now fine and has does not have to do treatment anymore
Thank you for sharing your story. Glad you are now cancer free..🥰
Oh Nate. GOD is our Healer so in Jesus name you will be ok. Love you and kara 💓from Trinidad 🇹🇹
So proud of you and kara that had to go thru this. Love you guys
Get Well Soon buddy... We can't miss your videos... We eagerly waiting for them... Have a Great Halloween & Christmas ahead...
Stop omg I started crying in the airport after seeing the title
God bless u nate
So so glad you are doing good after those years of uncertainty. To good health!
love you guys
I had a heart transplant. The first thing my doctors told me to do was wear SPF any time in sunlight even when overcast. They told me i am guaranteed t oget cancer one day.
My mom had basal cell on the side of her face, had it removed too. This was many years back but still,super important to always wear sunscreen.
Thank you for sharing with us , it means a lot , wishing you wonderful adventurous years ahead ❣️ hoping for a speedy recovery. Stay blessed. ❣️
I knew it when I saw the bandage last week. So glad it’s basil cell and not a melanoma. ❤️❤️  Wear your sunscreen, everyone!
Love u guys 😘 ill be praying for you guys.🙏
I was spacious when I saw one of your previous videos where you had a bandage on the back of your head. So glad this was taken care of.
Praying that Nate makes a full recovery 🤲..
Happy for Nate and his healing! I had 2 moles removed in 2017-best thing. Thank you for sharing your experience with us. 5:45 totally relate to Kara in that moment🤗
Cancer free yay!!!So glad!!! You folks are my favorite vloggers!!!
I just dropped my phone thinking ‚What? No!‘ I am relieved that you are ok and, as weird as this might sound, this might be a good way to spread the word so people are more aware and start to take care.
Its a good news. Best wishes to you guys. You are doing great. Everything will be okay  💚💚
So glad is wasn’t more serious. Prayers for you all.
So glad to hear that you are on the mend! My dad is one of those skin cancer patients that did lose his ear to cancer last year so it's good you took this seriously.  If you are still in Canada,  we'd love to welcome you for a meal or some delicious baked goods! Safe travels and continued good health!
i’m so happy that ur ok…u had me in tears since the beginning
I was like " nooooooo" . It cant be... but at least it got a solution.
As usual, done with integrity, class and humor. Great PSA. "They cut ears off all the time."  Y'all are loved because you aren't the type to use this scary situation for clickbait and drama. Thank you for immediately telling us he's ok. God bless you on your journeys and in your career.
I’m glad it wasn’t the dangerous kind. I had two basil cell carcinomas. The first was on my forehead over my left eye, and the second on was on my left arm. They froze the area and lasered It off. It was scary at first as I didn’t know how bad it was. They say that you most likely get it on the left side as you are exposed to the sun while driving.
Hi guys my name is Trinity my mom has cancer officially she is cancer are free
Thank you for sharing it was an excellent way to educate and inform
At 9:56 I started tearing up with Kara! 🥺 and I have never cried at one of your videos! 😭😂 Thank you SO much for sharing this with us, I’m so sorry you’ve had to go through this terrible difficult thing. Love you so much! ❤️❤️
So glad to know Nate is cancer free and healing.  Thank you for sharing.
I’m so happy you’re ok.
Thanks for sharing. I have gone through many skin removal including one on my scalp too. Not a fun experience at all, totally relate to being able to feel their every move. Glad you are cancer-free!
Thanks be to God, that Nate's cancer is gone!  You two have brought relief to me during the pandemic and other things going on in this world.  I've enjoyed watching your adventures. Thank you.
So happy the surgery went well and Nate will be ok.  Hope he got some strong meds for pain. Safe travels to 🇨🇦 guys! 🥰
I love your channel. Than you for your transparency you guys. Emotional, I cried with you. Watching these makes me feel like I know you guys, I’m glad Nate is cancer free! #Cancersucks
Just finished watching B is for Build go through skin cancer surgery and now Kara and Nate. Unexpected and unfortunate trend but thankfully not life threatening. Glad to see the early diagnosis and good prognosis :)
So glad Nate is ok. A brush with cancer of any kind is frightening. Happy you have each other to get through rough times.
Oh pumpkin, everything is going to be ok. You have a strong woman next to you to help you along the way. Welcome to the club..a club you never want to be apart of, but once you're here can't imagine life without the survivors you meet along the way.
💙💜
sending you much love xx you guys are so brave!
Thinking about you both. Love your videos. God bless.
Dude this is the same thing that happened to me! They cut a big chunk out of the side of my head for a biopsy. Thankfully it wasn’t cancer  Edit: I went though the same pain! It was like they never even numbed my head before they stared cutting! And I have long hair so I smelled burning hair the hole time
So sorry to hear the news , don't worry everything will be good  Take care Nate and Kara , love and respect to both of you to show happy and sad part of life  🙏
Sending our virtual hugs💕 Thank GOD, Nate is cancer free🙏  Tacloban City, Philippines
Well done. Glad it went as well as it did.
Thank you for sharing.  Super happy that you're ok.    Its a great PSA for wearing sunscreen and making sure your skin is covered.  We're all busy and guilty of running out without it.
I had a basal cell cancer on my nose. It was cut out but still had to go through 4 weeks of radiation. 4 years earlier I had uterine cancer and had surgery (but no chemo). All ok now.. you will be fine.
I'm happy your cancer free
Health is definitely not something to take for granted and a good reminder for all of us no matter what age. Glad Nate is doing well. Sending prayers and good thoughts your way!
My father inlaw had serious melanoma. It looks like a shark took a chunk out of his arm after his surgery. He's a fisherman and he is  in the sun alot and doesn't put sunscreen on all the time. You would think after his first scare he would learn his lesson. It returned again 2 months ago on his nose.  Sunscreen is a must and a hat is also a good idea.
I’m so sorry to here that Nate I hope you will get better soon!!
Kara being strong for Nate kept me from sobbing. I am so thankful that you shared this with us. I wish you the best and send my love! Cheers to CANCER FREE!
I almost made it through the vid without crying....until...........you said grandpas quote. Then I lost it! Thanks for sharing and I'm SO happy it turned out well!
I’m so happy for you both. Nate it’s fantastic news. Kara you must feel such a sense of relief too. Crying happy tears for you both. I’ve been watching you from the early days and enjoy living vicariously through you. Prayers for continued good health. Thank you for sharing this part of your story.🙏🏼🤞🏼👍🏼💖
Nate you are sooo brave and so is Kara... wishing you’ll good health and happiness here after 💕❤️
THIS HAD ME TEARY EYED!! But omg Kara when she said let me check webmd hahahah. Omg that had me laugh. I love how you both were still being positive!! Keep us updated!! We love you both 😭😭😭
Thank you for posting this. I've had a place like that on my shoulder for almost a year. I'm going to get it checked. GLAD YOUR CLEAR!
I sobbed with joy when Nate got the good news. Sending you both so much love
Fcuk Cancer!  But don't worry, you are healthy and smart.  My dad has them and has had some basal cell issues for over 25 years, he is 90.  Still, the word CANCER always assumes the worst.  So...200 SPF slathered all over your head and face forever, and hats...I hope you like hats.    Also, live your best life now
Wow! That was certainly a different episode than normal. But so important and thank you for opening up and sharing a part of your personal journey Nate. You are very right that we all have to realize that as much as we enjoy all the fun and adventures all of you vloggers share with us, there are very personal things going on behind the scenes. Between your story, Bec’s scare, and Aimee’s episode on dealing with her anxiety, there have been some real heartwarming episodes the last few weeks. I’m so glad they are all ending with awesome results. Now it’s time for me to wipe away the tears and go watch Eamon and Bec’s and Kinging It episodes on your adventures in Canada with them. Peace and Calm and ongoing Health. 👍🏻😎🇨🇦
For us it was 12mins of in & out however its really difficult to imagine what you must have gone through in the last 3 years... Good news is that Nate is fine now so take care of yourself buddy...!!!
Good thoughts
Wow
Get well soon mate!
Omg that is why he was using that bandage on his head when they went to the dome house
Hi Nate, I had a lump removed off my forehead about 2 years ago, I went through the same emotions and being scared of the unknown. Like you they dug it out and got it all and yeh it felt really weird. I tell everyone to live life to the fullest you can, because you never know, but I don’t need to tell you that. Very happy your fine and God Bless!
Puh! Glad that is taken care of. I have had the lighter verson of that, were they burn off the skin that is affected/infected. My skin is so pale that I have worn SPF 80 since the age of 16. Like grandpa says, never take good health for granted. I also have Cerebral Palsy and I say to all to enjoy your health while you still have it. Do not wait to do What you want. Do it asap. One day it will be to late… Now, let us go live and enjoy life to the fullest! Party! Party!
"Good health is a crown, on a well man's head, that only the sick can see"  Thank you for sharing that quote Kara. As a caretaker for my ill mother, this made me ball my eyes out. I hope so many see this video as I did and become more grateful for their health. And for sharing your story that may help others.  Forever fan❤
I’m in shock that you have been able to stay so positive during your hard times Nate! That is awesome! I’m praying for y’all and everything goes well with you Nate! Love y’all!
Noooo Nate😭 I love your channel an I subscribed and liked the video if that helps
So happy you got diagnosed and had surgery. Sending prayers!
I have been sharing in your adventures for a long time now and feel like y'all are family. I lost my husband to cancer 6 years ago and know how frightening the big C can be. I rejoice in the positive outcome of Nate's diagnosis.
This year has been tough for my family too. My dad has cancer and it's been tough.  Thinking of you Nate and Kara. Positive vibes sent your way. 💜
THANK GOD. 🙏🏽
Glad everything turned out fine!  It's a blessing.  Appreciate you both and the cheerful videos you make. "Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own."
Crazy video finds out Nate has cancer Nate gets cured of cancer this is a lot😂but I’m happy for them💚
Goodness. I watched my friend have this procedure done and I agree, Kara, it’s intense. I’m so glad that you caught it early, Nate and you’re on the road to recovery and to continue to bring us along on more awesome journeys! 🙏🏻
Thank you for sharing Nate's story and so happy his is cancer free :)   YAY!!!!
I’m so glad Nate is OK.  I was one of those who needed to have my ear done - it wasn’t fun at all but so thankful they found it and I’m in the clear.  Everyone should be seeing a dermatologist, especially if you spend a lot of time outdoors.  ❤️
I legit teared up at the 'all clear'. So happy for you! ETA: Welcome to Canada! I've been waiting for you to visit for years! Where are you headed? I'd love to give you some suggestions. If you end up in the Toronto area, can a kind stranger buy you lunch?
I now have a dermatologist appointment…made for me by my wife…
You guys are destined to grow old TOGETHER❤️
I am so sorry y'all have been going through this and I'm so glad that everything turned out well!! keep safe :)
So glad it turned out ok!  Inviting us into your lives is such a blessing. Keep traveling and smiling 🙂
I was so teary for the first and middle part of the video, because I really do enjoy watching your videos, I am so happy with how vulnerable Nate was to his supporters and viewers! I will definitely listen to what the doctor had said. Please! If you're ever in Northwestern Ontario, I'd gladly host you guys ❤️💕 glad you stayed strong for Nate, Kara!!!! Love you guys!!!
I cried many times during this video, I'm such a Kara❤️😭
come to Clear Lake Iowa I work at a shoe store that sells ons and clear lake is so fun.
My heart stopped for a sec….  Im so happy, that Nate is healthy and everything looks great! ❤️❤️❤️
I so appreciate you sharing this part of your lives with us.  This resonated so much with me.  I received a cancer diagnosis a little over a year ago and had similar thoughts and feelings.  It's really weird to talk about because my diagnosis was so minor compared to some.  Similar to yours, there was very little chance of metastasizing and, outside of the surgery to remove it, there was no need for any other treatments.  I have to be checked periodically over the next five years; however, the chances for reoccurrence are very slim.  I've said that if you are going to get a cancer diagnosis, mine is one of the best kinds to have.  I also make sure I say cancer with a little c because I know my journey doesn't come close to folks who have more traumatic diagnosis and treatments.  Still, I think it's so important that folks hear about our experiences because there is such a wide range of cancer diagnoses and treatments.  There's also been so many improvements that even a Stage 4 diagnosis isn't always the terminal diagnosis it once was.  I'm so thankful that you listened to Kara and followed-up.  Best wishes for your recovery and continued good health!!!
I don't know you guys but dammit I couldn't help the tears falling and gathering in my eyes... You are blessed Nate, thank God this didn't go any further. Stay safe you guys <3
I want to send a thumbs up to Kara, I love how you were "being strong" for Nate. Because Nate would not only stress about what he is going through but what he thinks Kara is going through.
I am glad that you are okay ❤️ take care Nate
Omg are u ok
Basal cell. you will be fine. Just has to be removed.  No metastasis on this one.  Just be sure to get your regular skin checks for any in the future.  I am speaking from 20 years of experience on this one, y'all.  You will truly be okay.
Really interesting to see Nate's reaction to this. I inherited my dad's super light skin, so I've grown up knowing to expect skin cancer and seeing him get treatments. In my mind it's the "cancer that isn't cancer" so long as you pay attention for it.
So glad he's OK!! That's so scary. I'm hopefully going to be getting a lump cut out of my head in just about the same spot, but I believe it's a fatty lipoma and not cancer. I understand his anxiety!
You guys are just love ❤️😘 Stay strong and God bless 🙏
Cancer free 🎉🎉😌 praying that every check out is clear and nothing comes back up
I love you guys! Wishing you all the best forever and ever! You make our world’s a brighter place and I hope you can feel how much we love and appreciate you.
So glad your cancer free now! Love watching y’all videos, ironically I have the same issue goin on, I have had three spots on my head for several years an I go in November to the dermatologist to find out what they are. My family has a history of skin cancer so fingers crossed! Glad your healthy an a good spirts!
I started watching your vlogs when we took our babies travelling trough south east Asia 5 years ago, we arrived in Nz to find out I had brain cancer, I have now had 3 craniotomies and I had to be awake for the third One 6 months ago. I can see Nates crown health 👑 , your videos have got me through some very tough days , so now carry on your adventures on behalf of us non cancer free warriors 🎥🛩 enjoy your life and look after yourselves
Any cancer is scary but so glad this turned out well. You both are blessed and thank the lord for blessing you so much.
Glad to hear you’re okay buddy!
Welcome to the Basil cell club Nate! I had one removed under me eye just above my sinus cavity.,
Well done.
This just made my sink drop
Love you both so much ,you guys are my favourite youtubers ,so happy that Nate is alright ...sending love ,blessings and healing energy all the way from PAKISTAN
Congratulations!! I’m so happy for you guys ❤️ Been through this as well. My father passed of lung and brain cancer, and I myself beat esophagus and liver cancer in 2019 at the age of 25. (I was 23 when I found out I had it) I am so glad you didn’t have to go through any hard treatments and that you are cancer free!!
10:39. how do you know what a tight ponytail feels like?
Nate,  I’m 35 and had Squamous Cell Carcinoma on my stomach.  I was the youngest one in the waiting room too! Haha.  It really is a crazy thought getting cancer at our age but it does happen!
Hello Nate and Kara. That’s sad. I hope u are ok. Always use sunscreen even on ur head. Skin cancer is real not sometime we should play around. My mom had 2 removed Basel cell carcinoma from her arm and her nose. Stay safe. Safe travels
i am so sorry :(
Thank you for sharing! On to better things. Where in Canada?
Thank you for sharing this story. Both my parents had skin cancer and came through it just fine, but they were in their late 80’s. You sharing your story  (being so young) highlights that skin cancer knows no age. I loved you sharing Nate’s g-pa’s quote, reminds me of my g-ma saying “If you don’t have your health, you don’t have your wealth.”
happy you are ok sending blessings I have thyroid cancer so I get it ❤️
I've had many basal cell spots removed...all will be ok...just a minor bump in the road of life.  So glad all worked out ok! ✌💜
Thank you for sharing such a sensitive and emotional experience.  So glad you’ll be okay.
Glad all’s well, I can’t believe Kara let Nate drive though!!!
Well I'm never leaving the house again.
Praise Jesus you are okay. Your doctor is right wear your spf. And since you have had skin cancer you should check out the special spf clothing. My Grrandma has worn it ever since she has gotten skin cancer (and a hat) and her cancer has never come back.
i’m so happy to hear you’re fine and  stay safe love you guys big fan ♥️
Glad you're okay Mr. Nate.
“We will see what web md has to say about it” I do that hahaha it’s such a bad habit though because all web md has to say is your going to die
Love your channel and following you two.  Now BOTH of you should go for regular skin screenings!  It’s important!  I lost my mother to skin cancer so begging you to get properly checked regularly!
Thank you for everything ❤❤❤
I am from india I love you videos,after hearing about Nate I started crying but I am relieved that he is ok
"It was way faster than I thought it was going to be" My ex-girlfriend said the same thing.
Praying
First of all I'm a new subscriber... No applause necessary JK.... But I'm not sure why I didn't subscribe last week when I discovered you I thought I had so sorry about that.... But having cancer three times and surviving all of them... The only one that I cried about was the skin cancer because they had to take off the entire left side of my face.... But it wasn't a cancer that made me cry it was a blue marker that the surgeon was using to Mark how to put it back together I was going to look like Frankenstein and I screamed and cried called my son he thought I was dying I said no they're going to make me look like Frankenstein he was so pissed... 😂 But I waited for a plastic surgeon for 2 weeks while he was on a fishing trip and he did the most amazing job ever... But being a social worker I had to renew my driver's license the same day I had surgery and my picture has this usual freaking bandage on my left side so feeling you bro.... Seriously if you don't like what they did then seek out a plastic surgeon it was the best thing I ever did.... We belong to a special club... You're now officially a cancer warrior.... God bless you.... PS I held a hand mirror and watched to do it.... It was fascinating.... And if you're going to have skin cancer basal cell is the best to have it's not malignant..... But they do look different depending on the person and the area where you get it.... I'm just adding this so you know that mine look like red pimples.... But after 2 months I just never went away I was about to order proactive I jumped in the shower and all of a sudden I just knew.... So people who gets a lot of sun exposure like you guys do basal cell is the most common one..... But glad you got it taken care of
Hope everything goes well and have a speedy recovery ❤️‍🩹.
We love you guys it crazy how you guys have been dealing with all this behind the scene but still being faithful giving us vlogs  I'LL BE PRAYING be strong God is with you.♥️ Now you have the you tube family by your side
Subscribed much appreciated the rawness 🙏
Thanks for letting us know that your well again.  My story isn't as great as yours. I had astrocytoma back in 2018 still going to the doctor about it. Next scheduled MRI is  in January sometime,wish me luck.
Skin cancer is pretty common... And as long as you get it taken  care of, it's totally fine
Because my dad died from cancer
My heart feel broken when I heard that, I send you too much love and health energy ,I love you so much both of you, be safe and happy. But don't worry because body treat cancers all a day and with healthy food and healthy life he wine.
You guys as a whole will get through anything.  And we all have your back.  Wish you well and all the good jujus coming your way.
Life will never be the same
So happy Nate is ok!!
I’m so happy Nate is okay and that he is cancer free. My grandfather unfortunately was diagnosed with prostate cancer and 4 months within diagnosis he passed away. A year later my dad went to the doctor and they found a small tumor that was cancerous and they were able to take it out early so my father is cancer free thank god. Thank you so much for sharing this with us ♥️
Keep checking your skin.  My husband has had three spots removed with Mohs so far.  One of the spots he thought was a mosquito bite.  If anything does not heal fairly quickly, get it checked out.
I had a basel cell removed like 3 years ago, and I have another on my arm that has to come off now.  Just keep up with checks.  Finding them early is key.  When you find a spot, get it checked.  My dad let his go and now he's dealing with melanoma.  Lets both learn from my dad, okay?
I'm sorry but it bothers me that at 3:55 the lady on the phone is telling Nate that he probably has cancer and has to get his head cut open again, and then tells him to have a nice day. How do you have a nice day after you're told that you probably have cancer?
I am a five year survivor of melanoma.  So happy to hear you are well.
❤️👊🏻
I had skin cancer removed from the bottom of my foot this year!! So definitely important to check EVERYWHERE. Glad all is good in the end ❤️
Burning flesh!! When I got my nose cautirized (sp?), I am not able to eat mesquite chicken.
God bless you both 🙏 ❤
So thankful you are ok Nate Be safe.
You both are strong and stronger together. :-)
this is so tragic, my mom had skin cancer. It will be okay. Cancer won’t win
Wow. So thankful Nate is okay, and so impressed and admiring of the messages you send to the world - maturity, vulnerability and, more than anything, love. Cheers to a successful surgery and have fun in Canada! 😍🥰❤️
Definitely a huge opportunity to talk about skin cancer prevention - high SPF, frequent application, and hats. This got a tiny statement at the end, but deserves more attention. Glad you’re okay, Nate!
i got so much relief and felt their happiness and gratitude when they got the call that the cancer was completely removed
Thank you for sharing your journey. Life is so precious and our health is something we don’t want to take for granted. 💗
I just want to add to what Kara said about sunscreen and hats. My father passed away last week from cancer which started as skin cancer on the neck and the ears. Over a period of about 12 years he had skin cancers removed from his back, neck, legs, and had one ear completely removed. Most of the damage was done when he was young working out doors without sunscreen or rugularly wearing a hat. The cancer managed to get into the blood and then spread throughout his body. Please everyone look after your skin, stay safe in the sun and always get abnormal moles or dry patches on your skin checked.
Nate, I am thrilled that you are cancer-free! I just found you both through Eamon and Bec's channel. I watched the video made last year to catch me up on your travels. You are both a joy.
❤
💕💕💕
🙏🏻 prayers for Nate
Omg when I saw the name of the vlog...I was like "what" and clicked right away. I was so scared. Nate I'm happy your better. And Kara you are amazing for staying so sting for him. Love you guys. Stay safe.
You and B is for Build dealing with skin cancer at the same time...what is with the skin cancer and youtubers lately?
Idk why this made me emotional, I’m positive you will be fine Nate and I’m sorry you and Kara had to go through this. Skin cancer, well any cancer is all scary, but 🙏🏾 your story and journey is short with no re-occurrences! #yaycancerfree
Oh no 😪 I am so sorry. I just read the title
way too young to have skin cancer and are at elevated risk later in life
Sending love 🥰
Can’t lie, I reared up a bit. As a cancer survivor, I know the fear of the unknown. Glad you are ok, Nate.
Glad you did.  I worry about skin cancer myself
Positive vibes your way for a quick recovery. Always wishing you guys all the best :)
OH MY GOODNES S I'm SOOO happy to hear he's on ok! I've been watching you guys for around a year now, and you've quickly become on of my favorites, and proof that love is only as strong as we make it. Stay strong like you always do, I know you'll make it through this. Stay safe <3
Sending you both love,support and healing energy
I’m glad you’re OK I have cancer in my family my sister had breast cancer three times they had to keep on going in each time deeper and deeper but she’s cancer free and now she has kidney stones but she told me that she’s always going to have those my aunt Joey had stomach cancer and my grandpa had throat cancer but he smoked all his life and he drank all his life Next year I’m gonna get a mammogram. 🎉😊🎃
I work for a dermatologist, wish I had known this was going on with you , I would have told you not to worry too much! But so happy that you got it taken care of.  This is a wake up to all young people, go get your skin checked yearly!! Skin cancer doesn’t care how old you are!!  Love you guys!!
Scared me to death. That's all I have to say.
What an amazing quote from Nate’s grandfather. So glad that you’re doing well.
Thats not cancer...
I just did research about Basal Cell Carcinoma for a high school project. I'm presenting it tomorrow and I'm glad you're all better!
I cried throughout the first part. You don't even know, and as a matter of fact, I myself didn't know that you guys matter sooo much to me! Stay healthy, and in love always. Much love from India❤️
I'm so happy Nate is fine. I was shocked when I saw your IG post. I've watched all of your videos and you're such an inspiration to me. We should be less worried and more aware of what really matters to us in life. Best of luck.
I'm paranoid about sun exposure and have been worrying about your frequent tans and burns for years. I'm glad this unfortunate local cancer will leading to you guys to reducing your risk of melanoma and other extra scary skin cancers.
We all love you Nate! But I have to say that no matter how Nate is feeling he always is funny to me I started laughing because he turned on the twinkle lights for Kara! It just made my day! 😂 your the best love you Kara and Nate! I’m glad your going to be ok cause we love you SO much!! ❤️🥰
Prayers Nate.
Thank you for sharing this, be well and stay strong 😘 from Israel.
❤️ to you both, thank you for sharing and 🙏🏻 for continued good health.
Having a woman that is always there for you, that loves you is the best thing.
Oh god. Wish you speedy recovery and best wishes from India
May you both wear that crown for a long LONG time
I started watching the videos 3 years ago and subscribed later so we don't miss a single video of you.   Kara and Nate i wish you health and many years of happiness.
So happy you are OK. I love your videos and this hit close to home.  I also had basal cell CA which is the best kind of cancer you can have (if you have to have it). It is slow growing and usually doesn't spread luckily.   I was afraid to go to the doctor though and 15 years later (yes I said years) my secret was discovered when I ended up in the hospital with sepsis from this cancer.  After 4 hours of  surgery, a skin graft and chemo I'm cancer free but at what a cost to learn a lesson.  You are a perfect PSA.  Please take care of yourself.
Other than wearing a hat all the time, did they give you guys any tips specific to protecting the top of the head? That is a spot a lot of us don’t think about and not really a place that is easy to put sunscreen. So glad everything went as smooth as possible in the circumstances! And thank you for sharing this video. I’m sure it was hard!
So shocked when I saw the headline, and stomach dropped. Went to a quiet room to watch and so relieved everything is ok. Keep safe guys and I appreciate what you do. Thank you.
Thank you for sharing this. It’s hard to be vulnerable but I’m so grateful you share the tough stuff along with the good stuff. I love that quote from nates grandpa. What words to live by.
My heart sunk😭...you both be careful now. Everyone just be careful 🥺
glad he is ok and on road to better health... thank you for sharing a private matter.. its important for you and  everyone else. a public announcement to never neglect health... with early screening, positive attitude... it helps in beating anything and let it take its course. glad everything is ok for Nate and family now :) sending much love, health and happiness
i had a cancer diagnosis in 2019,shortly after my 40th birthday. it has been  by far the single greatest struggle of my life. it's definitely taken it's toll, but i think about a commitment i made to myself to stay positive  and fight through it. im glad that you've made it through your cancer journey!
My granny died of skin cancer 3 weeks ago and my mom had stage 4 skin cancer. please people wear suncream. it will not only protect your skin but protect you from a whole world of pain and hurt.
I am so glad to hear Nate is cancer free! Thank you for this video . I have inherited depression from my mother’s site of the family and I have been fighting it everyday. Some days are better than the others. Some days I can’t even get out of bed! I self motivate myself whenever I am capable.I am a survivor because I have to survive for my kids. I am a single (divorced since 2008) mom with 3 kids and 2 of them are transgender. I mention them because they go through their struggle everyday and I love them unconditionally . I need to stay alive so I am here for them. My passion in life is travel. At this time I am working full time and I barely make enough to cover all daily expenses so travel is only a dream at the moment.I used to hate Sundays because of how depressed I got. I now look forward to Sundays because of you guys,Eamon & Bec and Kinging it! , Flying the nest( sometimes Louis and Raya) Thank you for all you do. Take care of yourself for you and for us! Make sure cover those ears with sunblock too.Love you guys. P.S. I hope video with #Kinging it and Eamon&Bec coming soon. Can’t wait for your Canada adventures!
Wow i literally woke up and when I read the title i was in so much shock but im glad everything went soooooooo smoothly but best wishes to you nate I was watching you for 3 years and from there I lost my cousin to bone cancer which is really rare and aggressive. I love you guys and be safe ❤️
My dad had this same kind of cancer and surgery, the surgery happened in June. His  procedure took longer because the doctor needed to take more layers of skin until the cancer was gone. His cancer was under his right eye. After the two weeks of bandages, you can’t even tell he had surgery. His scar is minimal and he healed quickly.  Just like the two of you, it was my mom that pushed my dad to get it looked at. Good job on that Kara!
Thank you for sharing its very personal for some people
my husband had skin cancer on nose. same problem, never healed. hes doing awesome now
I had the same thing cut out of my cheek a few years ago. Also got it out in one pass. But it was a thing ... on my face. I cried and stressed and cried and cried. Now on this side of it, the scar is very, very small and it was just a blip in the road. I was a child of the 80s and that caught up to me in my 40s. Wear that sunscreen, kids!
Through all of this, you both stayed strong!  Your strength is such an inspiration to many others. Thank you for sharing your story and being so vulnerable to all of us!  Your courage will help others in their journey!  Please enjoy Canada 🇨🇦 It is my home and native land and please make sure you try the Poutine! 🤤  So much love to you both!  ♥️♥️
I had bladder cancer ...it was only an hour ish surgery then 6 months to a year of taking it eaay then 4 times a year check ups then after years was down to one been cancer free for years now.. but because of pandemic i decided not ro do testing for a bit because its near the hospital 😬🤐 and may be asking how do they check uhhhh well 😂 they stick this camera like thing up my uhhh 😉
Hope you’ll get better my dear friend.
Thank you for sharing.  Glad that things worked out that you are cancer free!  Stay safe.
You’re brave Nate and Kara!!! Sending love and light for complete healing and continued adventures.
Also had basal cell (on nose) and did MOHS. My doctor told me "If you're going to get cancer, this is the one to get". Glad you're past it now.  Like Kara said, good health is hard to appreciate when you've always been healthy. Keep an eye on your skin, but don't let it slow you down!
So happy you are officially cancer free. Thank you for sharing your journey. It has got to be tough to be so vulnerable in front of the world. I'm sure your story will give other hope and also remind people that everyone is struggling with something ❤
That is so cool
So happy you are officially cancer free. Thank you for sharing your journey. It has got to be tough to be so vulnerable in front of the world. I'm sure your story will give other hope and also remind people that everyone is struggling with something ❤
God bless you both but good Nath is better best regards Martin King
Fuck why couldnt this one video be clickbait stay strong man i hope it stays gone. You two are strong and amazing fuck cancer
so great to know hes okay.
Thanks for sharing! And I commend your bravery
I am so glad that Nate is fully cured. You guys have been entertaining me and my family for a long time now and the least we can do is to pray for Nate’s speedy recovery. 🙏🏻May god be with u.
Well done you guys !!! God bless you both with good health !!!
I’ve been watching these guys for years this is such a shock
Prayers ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ praise the lord
I know it! A couple video back i wrote that the skin looky really unhealthy. So sorry bru
Cancer is always a huge worry!
Watched my Dad go through it. He still is. Even though it's "just" skin cancer (insert rolling of the eyes here cause I hate it when people say that) the word cancer is scary as hell.  I am so glad to hear that you are now free of this worry. I hope you heal quickly and without too much pain.  The smile on your face, Nate, when she said "You're all clear" told me everything I needed to know about how you were feeling in that moment. I hope you've been able to get some sleep (both of you). Take care and I'm looking forward to whatever is next. If you come in to Canada through the Niagara area wave when you go by k? lol
Hey, Nate good to hear that you are doing well. Sending you and Kara loads of good wishes. Take care you both. Love from India ❤️😘
praying for u
Love your channel we watch everytime it's from India...so happy to hear Nate ur fine ...love u both alot. May God bless
your cow can't get up or make coffee on her own?
Thanks be God for being cancer free dear Nate. You sharing your story will be so many people. 🥰🥰
Sorry Nate but stay strong you are in my prayers take care please and good luck 🙏🙏🙏🙏
I'm so relieved that Nate is ok!! Thank you for sharing. Know that my thoughts are with you and that I wish both of you health and long life. ❤️
Nate, You are very lucky. l had my B. Cell whacked off my left, beautiful, shoulder 3 years ago. No Biggie Nate
The strength you two carry blows me away weekly.
This is an amazing example of using your media attention wisely and responsibly. I love your work and this has only made me appreciate it more. Clearly you both understand that by sharing your struggles - you help others be mindful of their health and take care of themselves. Ending with a reference to a therapy service was also an incredible choice. This work you do is not easy and you both do it extremely well. Thank you so much and appreciate that you both are adding value to the world. We all benefit from travel and experiences - even if just reading and watching other’s experiences. ❤️
We have been watching you guys for years and we know you both are great fighters. We have seen you come through many difficult times and this is just one more thing you are going to win over. Stay strong and you are in our prayers :)
we love you guys, we stand behind you. be encouraged, you are deeply loved by all of us. praying for you guys and your fast recovery. best regards
FYI the numbing in your head will take months and months to go away mine after a year I can still feel numbing in the top of my head crazy
So glad that Nate is ok!!! Prayers that you stay cancer-free 🙏
MOHS is an amazing procedure. My dad, grandfather and uncles (farmers), and family friends have all gotten MOHS for their skin cancers. They have all had great results with no issue following. It really makes you think of ways to help prevent further skin troubles. Glad you are doing well and I pray you continue to heal successfully!
Im sure there’s better ways to get a view bump
Thank you for sharing.  I have relatives with both Basal cell and the malignant kind.  Always wear sunscreen!
Excellent summation of social media. I'm very happy they gave you no reason to be nervous.
Go on Nate you can beat this my grandad had cancer and beat it if he can you can
Fk, you scared the shit out me man, happy your ok, proud of you both
Glad Nate  has been given the all clear, it must also have been an upsetting time for Kara. Keep living life to the full.
Best to have Kara to go in and have her skin checked. My wife used to suntan and swim a lot. Used sunscreen but still got skin cancer. You would be surprised how something the size of a pin head and not look like much can be real bad. Both me and my wife go in every 6 months for checks. I had basil cell years ago right on my node next to my eye. Not a good spot either.
I'm happy it was just a basil cell. I had three removed this year, on my back, forehead, and Cheek. The surgeries were no problem.
well done for going through that,  I am so glad to see you are on the mend, I have seen many people dealing with the hell of this disease and my heart dropped for you both when i saw the name of the video. But so glad for you Nate that your getting through and mending. So  happy for you both. Congratulations.
Good you are okay
So grateful that this had a happy ending. God bless ya'll.
Welcome to the club man! Small or not us cancer survivors all have experienced the same feelings. If you ever want anyone to talk to about it I work for a non-profit called First Descents that supports cancer survivors!
What!!!!
Hugs!
Happy for the good outcome. Life just loves throwing curve balls at us and it just makes it even more precious to us. Thanks for sharing and keep on truckin 👍😉
Thank you for sharing your story with us.  So glad Nate is cancer free.
PLEASE SAY "HAD"
Screw Cancer first of all. I get this journey and it sucks, I'm like Nate, I hate needles and am terrified of surgery and major things because everything can go wrong.  I had Appendicitis in 2018 where they found a lump on my kidney, well cue the worst 2019 I could imagine, tests, tests and more tests, a deep biopsy where my lung got nicked which created a bubble in my lung, and finally in September the results were cancer, luckily it was early like Nates, surgery is all i needed to remove my kidney and I am doing well now, but it is scary to hear "It is Cancer, you have Cancer".  Im glad it all worked out, be strong and know someone getting there yearly checkup as well is thinking of you!
One more box marked off your life experience BINGO card.  You made it through like a trooper!
I love and wish you all the well ❤️
I am so happy for you guys. Health is wealth!!!!!!
Bummer for you! Now it’s time to keep checking often.
Wow what a relief you must have felt when you go the Cancer free news.  I am guessing that explains the plater on Nate's head in last weeks vlog.
Kara. You stayed stronger than I did. I’m not sure how it happened but you two feel like friends at this point.   Im so glad you can both move forward from this. X
Very Glad Nate Is Cancer Free 👍👍👍 Hope Everything Goes Well During The Healing ❤️‍🩹 And Im Like You Nate I HATE Needles And Shots
I am so glad, relieved and happy that all went well.  My mom died of Melanoma because it spread into her major organs.  This could have been prevented if she would have gone to the doctors when she saw that her big toe started to get discolored.  She was scared about what the doctor was going to say.  Nate I am so glad you are a trooper and went to the doctor no matter what and you are showing you viewers why you should.  God bless you two and be safe!!!
I’m so relieved!! So glad everything worked out!!! ♥️🙌🏻🙏🏻
Sad at the beginning of the video, but,  happy and the and of it, hearing that the danger is gone! As you said, it's a lesson for all of us that the good health is not for granted! We have to appreciated it, and take care for ourselves. Take care you too Kara and Nate, and keep going👋🙏
Thank you for sharing this very personal story. You are always the brave one and to see you taking all the steps to surgery makes me so proud. I love you both and can’t say how moved I was with this video.
@karaandnate  I’m a skin cancer survivor since August 21, 1987.  That is my second birthday. So glad you are cancer free!!🍾🎉
You should feel blessed cause thats one of the most “benign” skin cancers there are. (Im a med student). My grandpa has the same cancer in the same exact spot. He got it removed various times cause it tends to come back in the lapse of 3/4 years. But its just the same procedure over and over again and it doesnt tend to spread so just go to your appointments and have a good life
So sad to hear that Nate had skin cancer but so glad he's ok now,stay protected guys,keep up the good work,love ur vids.x👍😊❤
So happy it was Basel Cell and not something more serious. You two are young and active so this advice is for you and other young people that spend a lot of time in the sun. I know Kara mentioned SPF, it bears repeating over and over again! . PLEASE, if you plan on being outdoors religiously use sun protection, it could save your life!  Global warming has resulted in a thinner layer of Ozone, natures natural sun protector. Even higher latitudes are susceptible to increased UV exposure.  A Basel Cell Carcinoma is a warning that you need to pay attention to your sun exposure. Please do it!
I discovered this channel last year as I was recovering from treatment for throat cancer. Cancer is treatable and it's something that you can survive. I'm glad for the transparency about your condition and know that you're not alone. I had my yearly CT scan recently and I'm blessed to still be cancer-free. I will have to have follow-ups for the rest of my life, but it's a small price to pay for being able to live. Stay strong, and keep going.
Sending love
❤
I had the same surgery, but it was on my face. Left cheek. I had to go into the hospital the day after for plastic surgery to repair the big hole in my face. The surgeon did a fantastic job. It looks great, except now I have had half of a face lift. I look younger on the left side of my 68 year old face. It has been five years now with no additional issues or recurrence.
Oh wow! You guys are soooo cool under pressure. Would never tell that you had this worry and concern. Any type of health concern is scary! Thank you for sharing!
When they tell you it's nothing to worry about...
My grandfather had the same cancer on his ear, like the top part. He had a very similar badge job, but because they just like cut the tip of the ear off a plastic surgeon had to go in later and rebuild the ear top part
So glad everything went great and you are cancer free. Thank you for letting us in your life and adventures.
Sending loving and healing hugs y'all way ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Thank you for sharing your journey.
Thanks for sharing - and get regular checkups!!! So important! Glad you’re okay Nate!
Thank you for sharing your story and being so open and vulnerable. I want you to know I’m sincerely praying for you and for quick healing. Your story is so inspiring. I pray God touches you and uses you. If y’all ever need anything just let me know. I pray it never ever comes back. Kara is such an amazing wife. She is supportive and caring. God blessed y’all with each other! She’s definitely a keeper! God bless you all❤️ I pray that you both (and anyone else who may be reading this) family, friends, loved ones, and most importantly yourself are all wrapped in a hedge of protection from any and all illnesses whether they be mental or physical. Including Covid or cancer. I pray God touches your life and gives you peace and strength. I hope you know you are loved, valid, and worthy. You are special. YOU MATTER! Remember that. YOU in fact MATTER! Trust me on that. God would not have created you if you didn’t. You have a purpose. You have a purpose in God. To serve Him and spread His Word and Love. You do MATTER. God thinks of us CONSTANTLY. We are fearfully and wonderfully made. Please know that. Especially if you feel you don’t and feel you should take your life or if you feel you shouldn’t live because you don’t matter or you feel you aren’t loved. I want you to know YOU DO MATTER! YOU ARE LOVED! I don’t know you but I love you are LOVED by Jesus Christ our Lord and King. Even if there aren’t many people on this earth that you think LOVES you know the most important person THE creator of the universe and of all life LOVES YOU so much. Although I may not know you but I love you as well.  So please know there are people out there who do love and care for you. If you feel you don’t have many friends know that Jesus is ALWAYS there. He is our best and closest friend. He sticks closer than a brother. I am your friend now as well! I pray your life is filled with happiness, success, love, peace, and joy. Have a great rest of your year. I hope you had of had a wonderful 2021 thus far. I pray you have a great day and night. I pray God may use you and touch you and your life. Spread love, peace, and kindness whenever you can. If you are ever going through a difficult time know that it is temporary and God is always there. No matter how dark of a time you may be going through no matter how unimaginably painful it is there IS a light at the end of the tunnel and it WILL get better. If you need to talk about anything once again God is always there and feel free to respond to this and we can talk about it if you need. Or if you want to be friends. I mean none of this by harm. I simply wish to bring joy to your life and a smile to your face. Remember YOU ARE LOVED. If not by many you’re loved by Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior. You’re loved by me although I may not know you well. God wouldn’t have created us if we didn’t matter. He thinks of us constantly. We are fearfully and wonderfully made. YOU have a purpose. You can find it in God. He can help you to know what you should do in life! He can give you the worlds greatest purpose! We each have a calling in God! He can turn your life around for the better or we just choose Him! I pray if you don’t have Him that you find Him before it’s everlasting too late! Once again I mean NONE of this by harm. I hope I brought some joy and peace to your life and maybe a smile to your face. I pray you have a GREAT rest of your life. I am praying for you. Remember this is a safe space. God bless you❤️ #GodSavesAndLovesAll😭🙌💗❤️
Glad it wasn't to bad Nate.
Hi Nate. Thanks for sharing. Same thing happend to me. With the same outcome. So Great-full for Gods favor. Keep ons making great YouTube vid. 🙏🏻
I'm so happy Nate your Cancer free, I do know how Kara was feeling, My hubby had skin cancer back in 2019 a Malignant Melanoma on his head... It was a scary time & Emotional I thought I was squeamish but I realized I wasn't when I had to become  his nurse emptying his drain cleaning his wounds.... He was lucky he didn't have to have Chemo it didn't spread to his lymphnodes..... He is Cancer free too... which is a blessing...
So glad you will be ok.  Sorry you had that scare.  Thank you for sharing.  Feel better soon.
So glad you had this treated ASAP Nate. Love to you both from your neighbor in Madison, TN!
I know you have to put up an attention grabbing headline but the over the top dramatics is insulting to people with melanoma. Basal cell is rarely life threatening.  Basal cell vs melanoma is like saying you served in the army during Desert Storm but there's a huge distinction between being stationed in Alabama or Baghdad.  Even though you should have encouraged your viewers to visit a dermatologist and didn't, I'm sure your video will draw attention to getting checked out which is a good thing.  Long time subscriber and really like you guys but am disappointed by this video.
Thank you for being so open with us always! This is so important! My mother had it as well, never skip that sunscreen! So happy he is cancer free!!!! 💛💛💛
Thank you for sharing this. You two are very special. I will continue to pray for you both. I know you had a great time with my friends Eamon and Bec. Much love from Reading in the UK.
Still trying to put into words how happy seeing this made me feel…Nate and Kara, thank you for your immense vulnerability and for opening up your lives to the world. I along with others (I’m sure) am so very happy for you!  With agape love, From a mere stranger, Brenda   P.S.: Thank you for reminding me why I am working so hard to become a doctor every day, it’s not an easy journey, but knowing I will one day have the honor to affect human life in such a way, is oh so motivating! 🤗
Healing thoughts coming your way❤️
So happy that Nate will be ok .My husband was diagnosed with prostate cancer when he was 53. Luckily we caught it early. And he is great
Kara stayed so strong the entire time. God bless you both abundantly ♥️
Well done Nate!! The thing we must avoid is not to get too wrapped up in the worrying 👍👏👏👍
I had it too but am fine
Sending love towards you and Kara ❤️
You guys are awesome! Love the positivity.
Have a speedy recovery ❤️
I underwent the same procedure last month.  All’s well.  I’m sure that you will be fine.  Love your adventures!  Keep up the great work.
Hands down the best video yet. The "c-word" (cancer) strikes fear into everyone. You handled this with poise and grace. So much goes on in our minds after a cancer diagnosis and there are so many unknowns. Statistically, men are much less likely to visit a doctor, for any reason, but early diagnosis and treatment is essential for many conditions. This short, serious, and very difficult YouTube posting will likely save thousands of lives. You will never know the true impact of this video - but you should feel very comfortable knowing that you just changed the lives of untold numbers of individuals, families and couples. My sincere gratitude for sharing your story.
I wore today spf 15. Tomorrow I will go back to spf 50.
Glad that your diagnosis was a good one.  My hubby has had 11 cut out and so many frozen off.  So buy a wide brimmed hat and were proper clothing/sun screen young man ;)   Thanks for 😎 making such awesome videos!  Stay safe.
You are so brave we are all there for you
Just reading the headline made me emotional, Thank God that you are on a path to recovery.
Thank you for sharing your skin cancer diagnosis and treatment.  My family has dealt with the same scare and Mohs surgeries.  I can’t emphasize enough using sunscreen and definitely don’t forget your ears!
Glad you got this treated and dealt with sooner than later! Hats will need to be you new best friend 🤠 look for wide-brims to cover ears, plus lots of hats are made with UV-protective materials. Wishing you a speedy recovery!
Praying that the cancer removal was successful and for no more cancer spots to show up. 🙏
I am so glad you got it checked out and that you are okay!
Thank you for sharing, lost my brother in June to metastatic melanoma so watching this through tears. I would watch your videos to escape and think how blessed they were to have such an amazing life. You never know behind the scenes what is going on. 😢❤️happy Nate will be ok.
i love u guys 💗
🙏
You will be fine, I have had 5 of those over the years.
Okay, so I'm going to get that spot on my forehead looked at...Wake up call for me.
Wish you both a very healthy and happy life! We are very happy happy you!
I am so happy you two are okay healthy and well please take care and continue to rock
Get checked regularly too. This could have gone the other way if it hadn't been looked at.
Canada, where I am from originally. Not as good as Starbucks, but try Tim Horton's for coffee. People make up for the cold weather. Look forward to this video.
Yep, been there, done that.  Like you, I was lucky and they got it all on the first cut.  Now I put on my "makeup" (sunscreen) EVERY MORNING, regardless if it's sunny, cloudy, or whatever.
I’m so happy to hear that Nate is cancer free. Thank You for being vulnerable ❤️ I’ve been watching y’all for quite some time and I love y’all and your channel
As I'm watching this I can't help but to tear up! I've been following your adventures since 2016 and you're like a part of my family. I'm so grateful that you're cancer free, serious or not, its still a huge deal. Take care of yourselves.  All my love Alta🇿🇦
as long as you nipped it in the bud as they say...you'll be good to go! :0)
Is that their house?
Dude, so glad you are going to be ok.  Well done for touching it out.  Had 2 scares myself this year, one dealt with and the other waiting to be checked.  So true what you say about not knowing what’s going on behind the scenes!  Hope you and Kara are enjoying something nice now!
Im so sorry to hear this. I hope you are doing ok!
Well that is a title hope you are doing well
Nate is super lucky.  I had that Moh's surgery on my scalp and it took 6 tries to get it all.  Then I had to go to a surgery center to stitch up the grand canyon size hole in my head, under general anesthesia.  It was a really, really bad day.
You guys are so lucky... my dad had skin cancer and it spread to his eye he removed it to try and stop the spreading it continued to spread snd a few months ago the cancer spread to his liver and ut failed 2 months ago as a twele year old it is hard seeing your fathers body and having to attend his funeral im so happy its not that way for you two <3
We are so glad this had a happy outcome. ♥️
My daughter and I love you channel. We are sorry you have skin cancer. I did too when I was your age. Make sure you get regular check ups to be sure it didn't spread. Hope it heals quickly.
So glad that the procedure went well best wishes for perfect health to both of you
Sending love for a fast recovery.
All the best Nate!! BIG BIG hug from Portugal :)
I am so happy that Nate is cancer free.  My heart sank when I saw the title of the video.    Like Nate's grandfather, mine, too, had a health quote.  My grandfather used to always say, "I always pray for health, not wealth."  A few years ago he passed away at 102(!!!).  On his 100th birthday he reiterated this quote again (he had mental clarity until the very end, I might add).  My mom fully understood that his prayer was answered and jokingly chastised him saying, "Daddy, you should have prayed for both!!!!!"  😊    Thank you for sharing this.  I wish many more decades of health for the both of you.
So glad you are ok. Thank you for your honesty. Praying for continued good health!
It's Sunday evening right now in India and I was out with my friends when the YouTube notification popped up. I am going to be honest, I teared up. It was tough to explain my friends why I am all sad for two YouTubers half a world away. K&N, you've touched and inspired many lives that you guys don't know about. I wish Nate a very speedy recovery and Kara is a champion. The way you both handled this is incredible. More power to both of you and everyone who is championing this battle 🖤
I might have shed a few tears. Thank you both for sharing this difficult part of you life. Nate, wishing you a speedy recovery.
So glad to hear you are cancer free! My husband went through the same thing as you about 5 yrs ago. He had a spot above his eyebrow that would heal and scab repeatedly. Finally got him to go see the dermatologist, his too came back as basal cell carcinoma. All of his yearly dermatology check ups have been clear since, but he is very aware of wearing his hat and sunscreen. We look back on pictures in the years before the diagnosis and that spot had been there for a long time. It is a very slow growing usually non spreading cancer but cancer none the less. You two are an amazing couple and I love watching all your adventures! Take care and God bless!
Your so strong 💪!
Wishing you the swiftest possible recovery and lots of love
Skin cancer runs in my family. My mother had a big chunk of her cheek taken out. My grandfather lost vision in his eye (other was a fake from a lawn mowing accident) from skin cancer. It goes back as far as we know. It's one of my biggest fears, because it's such an easy cancer for me to get. I tan very easy, if I go out in the sun for 30 minutes I'm shades darker. But I'm the shade of a sheet of paper because I'm too scared to go in the sun and risk cancer. Seeing this video actually helped me. It reminded me that not all skin cancer is fatal. Even though none of my relatives (that I know of) died from skin cancer, it's still so scary. Like y'all said, the unknown is scary. I'm so glad to hear that you're cancer free, even if it involved yelling at the doctor lol. Congratulations!
Hi Nate.  I had basal cell on my scalp cut out a few years ago.  I always wore a visor to protect my face - now I have to wear a hat whenever I'm outside.... plus sunscreen.  Glad you caught it early.  I'm glad you shared your message.  :)     Lisa
May you both remain in great health ahead and we all your subscribers will pray for you guys and we always want to see you traveling world   Stay healthy, stay happy and keep up what u guys doing.
Sending you both blessings Nate you are a strong person, thank you for sharing your story you never know who you may help in telling your story thank you both, be safe, take care.
🙏🏿🙏🏿
Woohoo! Very thankful 🙏 for  you guys!!!
Do regular skin checkups. Catch them as soon as you can so they are easier to deal with! Hugh Jackman gets them every once and a while. ✌🏻 Make sure to also ask for biopsies when you wonder about an area that won't 'heal'.
I had the same thing. After the Moh's procedure you will be good to go. Just keep an eye on the area. Downside, it did take about three years for the divot to fill back in.
I have bump on my head that sounds exactly the same. Ive been fighting my wife about going to see the doctor.
I think the title should of been "I had skin cancer"
Hi... I've had C at least 3 times. So 1st watch your words! Don't claim it verbally. You are overcoming C! It's going to be an overcoming battle a victory over C. I fought lymphatic, breast, cervical all for the whooping cost of $777. (7 golf ball size under my armpit.) Because the higher your nutrition and not killing with chemo the better.  You are going to get over this. If you need cool places and people to meet who are the best feel free to reach out. Covering you in prayer as well. MT
Can't help but cry while watch Nate talk about his skin cancer. 😪😪😪   But when the doctor told Kara and Nate that he's clear, I literally yelled "Thank God". 😊❤😊❤😊❤  Will continue to pray for Nate's continued recovery. 🙏🙏🙏  Thank you for sharing your story. Be safe and be well. ❤😊❤😊  Love, Prayers and Hugs coming from the Philippines  🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
Been there done that. Some of us are more predisposed to damage by too much Sun - I have to cover up.  Take away is treat it like servicing your car: check regularly and don't leave doubts unchecked. I'm real pleased it worked out well, Nate. BTW: Yep, for me also, the smell of my own burning flesh was not pleasant.
So happy to hear you are fine and ready to roll !!
poor kara it must be tough for her to find that out I hope your okokay nate
Skin cancer is something you'll need to watch for the rest of your life. Speaking as someone whose family is effected by it. Sunscreen, body checks, and good health practice, Nate.
Thankyou so so much for sharing your experience Nate. I’m so happy that you’re okay and this video might help others to become empowered to get their skin checked ❤️
So happy that you're cancer free. Thanks for sharing!!! It's a very important message about sunscreen. My dad died of melanoma skin cancer. Love your granddad's quote - so true.
That was SCARY!
Well at least that explains the white patch on the back of nates head for the last few videos. Also explains why he took to wearing a hat as well. Am glad that Nate is cancer free, and I do accept that cancer (the Big C word) is very scary.  As for having his head cut open, I have been there and done that. I had a cyst in my head that needed to come out so I spent 5 days in hospital and 1 year at home after surgery. Apparently any surgery to the brain can be traumatic - for the brain that is. Nate,  please wear sunscreen on all exposed skin so that it does not "Spread"
Cancer free is amazing! For preventative measures::sunscreen BUT internally, I recommend consuming foods/herbs/minerals that have cancer fighting properties such as soursop. I drink the tea almost daily. I also recommend removing foods that can help “feed” cancer. Continued best wishes!!  Love from Nashville 🖤🖤
I’m so sorry you had to go through this. I had a scare as well with a colonoscopy but as they only test  polyps once they’re  out, I was fine  in the end , they were taken out in time as they were precancerous. Good health and good luck to both of you
Im so happy thet you Nate is in the clear.
About 20 years ago I noticed a "pimple" on my left cheek that wouldn't go away.  I kept nicking it when shaving.  I went in for a biopsy and found out it was basil cell cancer.  They performed the surgery and pulled the remaining skin back together.  A few years later I noticed another bump.  As it turns out they didn't get all of the cancer the first time and had to perform surgery again.  That time they got it all and I'm fine.  Today the scar is so faint no one can see it.  Just have Kara check it routinely over the next few years because it is very slow growing.
What a great message to get out to everyone and also to ensure to have a colonoscopy at the appropriate times and more frequently if you have parents who have had colon cancer.  Slot of cancers can be treated successfully if caught earlier. Stay safe guys!!
Health is the crown on the well man’s head that only the sick can see. I am having long covid for past 16 months and my body is still in very bad shape. I could relate the quote very well. I got a govt job here in India but couldn't join it due to my health. i am currently unemployed and still preparing for the exams with these health complications. Hopefully my health will be okay soon and should be employed...
Nate’s grandpa’s quote is so wise.
Not that I thought it wasn’t true, but I guess you can say I was shocked!!! I was like in my brain thinking this has to be wrong, and then it hits... I am so grateful that you got through it!!!; while hearing that you’re clear. Thank you for sharing your story, and glad it wasn’t more. That would’ve given me a panic attack, and more.
I'm so glad you're okay now! Another one of my favourite YouTubers, Madeyewlook, also recently shared her story about having skin cancer. It's scary how it can happen to anyone and after hearing both of your stories, it's definitely made me plan to go to a dermatologist to get an exam done just out of precaution.
I understand where you are coming from as my youngest brother has skin cancer too.  He had his biopsy and now has to have it removed.   I pray for him every day.   Good luck and God bless.
I'm glad Nate's okay stay strong guys ❤️
Why r they telling you such biopsy results over the phone?!
Well damn now I feel really bad asking about what was on Nate's head last video. 😓 So happy you are recovering and wish you both well and good health going forward. ❤️ We love Kara and Nate and hope to see many more videos!
Proud of you both. Xx
I went through this within this last year. I totally get everything you're feeling. I went through "OMG I'm going to die!" & then went the opposite way to, "This is no big deal. What was I freaking out about?" Be prepared to inspect every little thing on your skin for awhile.
Nate great news that you're cancer free yes watching good for you hopefully it be good  👍
Thank you so much for sharing the behind the scenes. It means a lot and I wish you great health throughout your travels I love watching you guys thank you for sharing your story again. It’s good to know what goes behind on behind the scenes and that you guys aren’t just happy and go lucky all of the time. I wish you guys safe travelsAnd can’t wait to watch more. Speedy recovery Nate
So happy Nate had a positive outcome.
I was legitimately about to cry when I read the title. Im so happy you're cancer free already. Im sorry you had to went through that. I'm happy you guys are here :)
So happy you’re doing ok. October is breast cancer awareness month guys. Get professional help if you think something isn’t right.  Health is wealth.
So sorry to hear you’re unwell! You are strong and will triumph. All the best going forward.
You two are my favorite adventure slash life slash travel channel on YouTube ever, so glad you're healing and healing, this must have been a hard video to make but thankyou guys for being open and honest, always sending you guys endless positivity and good vibes
OMG
I’m so happy for you.  My husband just went threw this he had radiation on his nose after the removal. He is ok right now.    God bless.
much love from sweden! so happy that if was "only" this bad! thanks you for being vulnerable with us<3
Yes they do, my dad has a top portion of one of his ears they had to cut off.  SO HAPPY this went well!!  My brother in law died last year of lung cancer....scary and horrible. Take good care of yourselves! Sending love and a big sigh of relief!!! <3
So glad everything went smoothly with the Moh's procedure and everything is all good now! I also love that you brought this to light for people to see and shed some light onto basal cell! As an eye doctor, I see basal cell all the time around people's eyes when they have no idea, so hopefully this will inspire others to take stock and get any spots they may be unsure about checked out! I'm sure this will help a lot of people out!
Thanks for sharing. My under-40, healthy brother died of brain cancer a little more than a year ago. Diagnosis to death was just 3 weeks. To be honest, the cuts of all those phone calls sent me right back to those weeks, except all of our phone calls ended with the worst possible news - rare, aggressive, tumor location to difficult to operate on, terminal, etc.   I’m so happy that you kept getting the (relatively) good news.   And thanks for your comments at the end  Kara, about how you are much more aware of what could go wrong… Nate’s grandpa’s quote hits to my core . Make sure to take care of those thoughts, and don’t let them take over. It’s easy to dwell on them too much and let them distract you from living (speaking from experience).
I’m so happy that Nate doing better and is cancer free !
I was wondering why I had seen a little white patch on your head (maybe a bandage?) … y’all I am so relieved! .. but I bet not as relieved as you are!
Super glad you are well Nate !! Scary moments....
Glad you’re okay!
Great! Have a healthy life.
I'm so glad all is well ❤️ I had that same surgery but on my upper lip and it was the worst pain of my life for a few days after but also best pain killers I've ever had, so I slept alot.
Nothing but love💙, Thanks for sharing! 🥰  If you live closer to Utah, I would make you guys dinner.  🥰
Sending love and prayers from Alaska.
We love you both so much! Thank you for sharing!
Get well speedy recovery
Why don’t you add a link for contributions to a cancer cause like saint jude to counter this drama. More serious cases out there. This seemed a bit dramatic. But glad you have good health. This seemed a little over the top. My father has very serious skin cancers issues. This editing seemed a bit much.
Nate, so glad to see that you are cancer ♋️ free. The word cancer when it hits home is so scary, I know as I had a mole issue on my arm and now small benign tumor on my eyebrow that I need to take care of I think. Yes, like your dad, I am up in age but still have good health. Take care you guys, a fan for life.
so happy that your getting better. <3
Thank God you're alright, Nate.
Why would they do a biopsy where they already discounted one possible result out of the two? If they set out collecting a biopsy where the only result that they found acceptable would be cancer why not do the deeper tissue biopsy to begin with so that the results would be trustworthy in their eyes? When they sent off that biopsy they had to have known that what they collected was not sufficient in their eyes to get a proper diagnosis. Medical care in the United States even with insurance often is not affordable. You can't even say that they were trying to be less invasive because the only options in this from when they took the biopsy was either it comes back as cancer which then requires removal or it comes back as not cancer and then you have to do a more invasive biopsy anyhow. So just smells like profit farming
So happy to hear nate is okay ! I was crying the whole video! Love you guys !!!!
Thank you for sharing. I have had a spot on my scalp that has been not healing for a year. I too have been putting it off. Because of your video, I not only called for a derm appointment, but, I got set up with betterhelp. Because I've been struggling there myself as well. Thanks again.
Stop doing this for getting views ….. you YouTuber’s can go to any extent 😡
I’m literally having tears in my eyes ♥️♥️ thank u god for keeping Nate safe !!   Sorry for so many comments because as I’m watching through video I’m commenting so that I don’t forget a thing
When they numb it tell them to shoot the juice in slowly it won't hurt as much. Have had that surgery twice on a finger and head.
Hits so close to home…I was also concerned about a spot that a dermatologist told me was “fine” and it wasn’t until 2 years later at another derm (because I knew something was not fine) that I was diagnosed with melanoma. My grandmother was going through treatment for squamous cell carcinoma (also skin cancer) at the time that was on the back of her head and ended up passing away from it. I had to have major surgery on my son’s 5th birthday. Lymph nodes were removed as well as a football sized area of skin and muscle on my collar bone. I had to wait 2 weeks to know whether or not cancer had spread. Skin cancer is no joke. Thank you for speaking out, people need to know how important sunscreen and hats are. Mohs surgery is a great procedure, a friend of mine just had it 2 days ago. Stay on top of skin checks!
This is the most gut wrenching thing to hear from my favourite couple in the world. First Bec's scare and now Nate. I m so elated that the people that bring smiles to such a large part of the world are all A okay. Cheers from India
❤️ you guys. xx
Rip bozo
My prayers are with you
Lots of love to you both ❤️❤️❤️
God bless ya! Love you guys
You will be fine
So happy Nate is ok.
I cried hearing this. May God with u and cara.  Stay strong  my friends.
But how do you apply sunscreen to the back of your head where hair sits? Serious question
Thank you for sharing ... its also great that you're bringing awareness to cancer. My husband had melanoma cancer - which was diagnosed too late, and he passed away. So Im glad you guys got this sorted out quickly!!  Its serious stuff! 😊
So happy that u r doing good 🥰R u going to Canada??? 😲Is my dream vlog really comming true? 🥺🥺R u meeting Eamon and Bec???🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰 please let it be true. My 2 fav vloggers meeting🙏🙏🙏🙏
Get well soon Nate... So happy for you being Cancer free!
i never know what to say about these matters. and now knowing the good news I'm super glad you're clear and doing well. I pray for your fast and full recovery
Sending lots of love and positive thoughts 💕
This explains what I thought was a band aid on the back of your head in the last video. Glad everything turned out fine.
great to know youre doing good, praying for a fast recovery
love the pair of you !!!!!!!!!
Omg, so scary.   I’m so happy for y’all, congrats on being cancer free now.   Happy to know, your fun adventures will continue 👍👍😊😊.  Good for you Kara for being so strong for Nate !!
Soooo glad you didn’t jump up and hit your head on the roof when the good news came!
Best wishes to you two! I love your videos and your positivity you bring to the world! Many blessings to you in the years to come!
Both of my parents have had Basil Cells, by which I mean they’ve each had multiple over time. You might get another one at some point but as long as you keep checking, they should never be a real problem. It’s scary the first time but once you go through it once, if it happens again it will be much less stressful. The earlier they catch it the less they have to cut, and for my mom, every one after her first was caught very early by rigorous skin inspection. Glad you’re gonna be fine.
I had wondered about the small bald spot in the tree house episode. Rolling my eyes at the initial "infected hair follicle diagnosis". You'll be fine now!!! 🙂
My mom had skin cancer, my dad has lymphoma so I’ve seen the non life threatening and the life threatening sides and either way anything with the word cancer in it is scary, when Kara said the fear of the unknown I totally get that! But so so glad you are okay Nate! Sending so much love and head healing vibes you guys way! ♥️♥️♥️
Hey! My sons going to have his first covid jab, he’s twelve and is terrified of needles! And the jab is tomorrow!
One of the reasons we love you both is you are so authentic. Shaving your legs in the hydrant, make-up/no make-up, tears, laughter, fear, love. Thank you for keeping it real and reminding us that life is not always pretty. But together, life is good. 💙🤍💜
Never u made the viewers feel that something so big was going on with u 😞   U guys are super strong ♥️  I’ll pray to God that u guys always stay happy   Being a Hindu I’ll  pray to my god to keep u guys happy always 😘😘
idk if yall heard it.... but they're coming to Canada !!!
Ohhh so glad that, now Nate is okay My eyes got filled when kara was trying to hide her emotions. Love you guys stay safe n healthy always 💕💕
a lump in my throat beginning this video...so happy for the end results.  Thank you for sharing and you have so many people behind you....Keep staying strong!
Everyday is a gift, enjoy your days ahead and many trips around the sun together.  Your chick-fil-A make me smile :)
It’s true what Nates grandfather says I’m chronically ill with a genetic rare illness and what I would give to live normal again thanks for sharing and it’s ok to be vulnerable it’s good to talk about serious things from The Netherlands 🇳🇱
Thank you for showing us this part of your life. It's scary but we care and it's great to see that Nate is going to be ok.
So glad everything turned out ok much love to y’all😁
the way that nate is still concerned about Kara everytime they found out news. they melt my heart
Thank you for sharing. It most have been a difficult decision to make this video. I'm sure you have spread awareness and helped people.
Hey Nate. Thank you for sharing. Kudos to you. You got this mate. Sending you and Kara lots of love and warm wishes from Australia.  I love your vlogs. You will be making many many more.  If ur ever planning to come to Perth make sure you let me know.  Stay safe guys ❤️
You guys are so brave! glad nate is good now! please take care! much love p.s could not stop my tears :((
💪🏾💪🏾👏🏽👏🏽you both are always in my prayers, I'm so glad that you are ok 👍👍☕☕
Thoughts are with you both, so happy that you are cancer free - really respect your message about Therapy and peoples feeds being the best bits of their life. Hope you both are okay and hope Nate’s head isn’t hurting too much.
Thank you for sharing this deeply personal video- but yay, glad you are well and omg Kara you held it together so freaking well!!!✨👍🏻✨👍🏻
glad it was benign, but nate needs to make sure you have UV protection. My dad has had skin cancer removed & I work outside as well as being an athlete all my life so I spend a lot of time outside, which has made me be more preventative than i normally would be. I always wear an aussie hat at work and also apply sunblock even if it's overcast. sunblock is also one of the best things, as well as inexpensive, to prevent wrinkles, so it could help nate with less wrinkles too. the quote about the crown is so true. stay safe & healthy cheers from CO
I gotta have that scab on my head checked too 😣 thanks for sharing with us!!!
💜💜💜
Thank you for sharing, you will be ok, lather that sunscreen and make sure you get you check ups every year. Love you guys 🌻🌻🌻
When I was in first grade (about 7 years ago), my dad was diagnosed with Melanoma on the back of his neck and a tiny bit on the side of his head. That was a really uncertain time for my family and as a first grader, I was pretty scared. I can definitely relate to the uncertainty. So happy you are well now Nate!
My husband starting having skin cancer leasing removed in his late forties. My mantra is “where’s your hat”
I had a similar surgery about 15 years ago on the left side on my head.  I had to have them cut three separate cuts to get it all.  My 6 year old granddaughter was visiting  at the time.  She was rather concerned that  they had taken a big slice off the head.  The bandages hide the spot, but she still was freaked out.
Glad you found out and can take steps to prevent future cases.
Thank God your fine. I was about to say "No! Not something bad happening to another of my favorite YouTube van lifers!". Whew! Word to the wise. Wear your sunscreen everyone! Especially if you sunburn or tan easily in which case you should wear a higher spf. 30 to 50 spf is the norm. I wear spf 50 myself.  My doctor recommended it  because I have sunburned before.
I'm glad Nate will be ok. I love watching you guys and would hate for anything to happen to either of you. Take care. P.S. Love, Love, Love Grandpa's quote.
Take turkey tail mushroom and reshi mushroom pills they will boost your immune system to kill cancer cells and prevent future remission.  Search polysaccharide peptide PSP on scientific papers.
I had a Basil cell on my left temple real close to my eye. I had the Mohs surgery and it was an 8 hour ordeal. They scraped layers of skin off my face. I had 2 rounds of this. Then a skin graft.  I’m all good now. Glad you’re two. Good luck to you.
May God keep you guys and continue blessing and protecting yall. I dont know if you guys are believers but Jesus loves you and will never abandon you even in your darker times when you give your life to him. Safe travels and be well.
Wish you guys the best ❤️❤️ glad they caught it
thank the gods you're ok!!  Kara, Great job staying strong for Nate, that had to have been a scary time, keep on keepin' on!
Sending good vibes guys!🤍
Sending love ❤️
7:07 “I don’t like the dentist either” Me too lol 😂
Been there with my Husband. But he is 1 year in remission after a year of hectic radiation and chemo.
Glad to hear Nate is cancer free!🙌😃
Very happy  you are ok put on that hat keep the of your head  and put on a very good sunscreen  please  both  of you
Wow…Such a touching video beautifully crafted 😊 Nate I wish for your speedy recovery and God Bless You!!! Kara you are a great support and your message at the end of the video is a virtue to follow.
Thanks for sharing, and praise God Nate is alright. As I have watched your channel and really enjoyed the content, I authentically wish you well always and rejoice in seeing you both live life and let us come along with you.  As part of it, know that when you share struggles, I'm sure, just like me, many people are offering their thoughts and prayers for you.
I woke up and read the title and my heart broke! Its crazy they go through this and stay posting these amazing videos and we had no idea 🥺 so thankful for them & so happy Nate is doing better!!!
So very happy that this ended the way it did and that you both are healthy! God bless you guys!
Sending much love to you guys ❤️❤️❤️
His grandpa’s quote 🥺🥰 so good & so true. Hang in there Kara & Nate, really glad Nate took care of himself and is on the mend 😊💛
I noticed a bald spot on Nate's head last week.   I know we don't know each other but I care about you guys.  I am glad you finally got the spot seen to. Sometimes your gut is telling you there is something wrong and you need to keep pursuing the truth.  If something doesn't resolve,  go back to the doctor.
So happy to hear you are fine. More power to you. Stay strong both ❤️
Thank you for sharing this!  It is important for everyone to check even what seems minor!
The "C" word is a bad one.  We have had three scares with the "C" word in our family.  Your brain always rushes to the worst of the worst.  I never want to hear the word Cancer again in my family.
I couldn’t imagine being told you have cancer on the phone sorry for all of it get better soon!
❤
Well done both☺️ you are the happiest couple I know and it’s a joy to watch your videos!! Keep up the good work!!
My mother had the se type of cancer. So glad your taken care of and your clear to live your amazing life!! God Bless!!
You are incredibly dramatic bro. It’s a common skin cancer and easily treatable. Your dramatization of this compared to people actually going thru a serious cancer to get YouTube views is borderline pathetic.
25 years ago I had basal cell cancer on my face they took it off it has a 40% chance of coming back. I've had no more spots at all. I pray you have good results also. I love your program I watch it every time it comes on.
Thank you for sharing your story. It will help so many. I was diagnosed with a brain tumour in March that is slow growing and won't metastasise but it is still overwhelming getting treatment. Being so young is so scary. But you look like you've got a great support network around you. I'm praying for you and Kara and I'm so proud of how you've handled yourself over the past few months and this video 💙💕❤
Kara, you held it together better than I did! So happy Nate is doing well and is now cancer free! The two of you can get through anything, no matter the outcome. Blessings to you both!!
I'm so glad to know that you're in the clear Nate. You are both extremely brave and have come through this so much stronger. Therapy is an absolutely amazing tool and so important, especially at times like this. God bless you both xoxo Nav xoxo
there are so many difficulties in a marriage and you never hope any health problems are one of them… i see so much of myself and my partner in you guys it warms my heart so much how positive you both were and gives me lots of hope for the future. keep doing what you’re doing
Thanks for sharing this important story. You are courageous Nate!  God bless!
I am so happy!❤️
Love you Nate stay strong. You’ll conquer this cancer. ♋
October 3, 2021  Please read this before it is censored.  Please watch and discuss 'Dimming' by deep sea scuba diver, world traveler, Dane Wigington.  He is a successful solar panel engineer and used to work for Bechtel in San Francisco.  Millions of people all over the world are getting skin cancer now, probably because of geoengineering or climate engineering, it is destroying OUR ozone layer which protects us from the sun.

Maybe you could get a variety of hat, (thick cowboy hats, cowboy shirts, jeans?) ,etc., companies to advertise on your channel.  Sun screen poisons coral, etc. so it is better to wear full scuba diving wet suits than sun scree in the ocean.  Sun screen is probably poisoning the tap water everywhere as well.

Earthships may be the cheapest, most efficient, way to save humanity, cats, dogs, domesticated pets, from skin cancer and extinction.

You can grow bananas and pineapple inside an Earthship!!!  Best Wishes to All!!!
Thank you for reminding me to wear sunscreen. I usually hate putting on sunscreen, but this video is really making me want to put on sunscreen. I’m so happy the cancer is gone! You are such a great couple💖
Thank you for sharing this with us. I wish you good health, wealth and positivity
I am glad the skin cancer is clear, in my family we don't have cancer except for my grandfather, My grandma is dealing with demantia, my other one diabetes Type & My mum also, Me diabetes type 1 & My dad Asthma
So pleased to hear it's under control and Nate is well. Thank you for sharing the not-so-nice bits too. Love from the UK xx
Thank you for sharing. A lot of people are scared to go to the doctor thinking it's going to be something bad. Most times, it's something that is fixable. But the more you put off going, the worse whatever it is, is going to be. Something that could have been taken care of easily turns into a major procedure or even too late to fix.  As a 9-year cancer survivor, (I had stage 3 uterine cancer) it could have been WAY worse if I hadn't gone to the doctor when symptoms appeared. I'm so glad Kara got you into the doctor when she did!
Omg.. when I say my heart dropped. When you see the word cancer you automatically assume the worst. 🥺
Thank you for sharing this!!!  It is SO important.  I am so glad you are going to be ok.
Oh nate I was just wondering what was on your head❤ stay strong
I had two removed from my head last week. Quite deep. You must go for head scope every year please.
My mom had basil cell almost in the same exact spot on her head that’s so crazy to me. Her and I both have chronic illnesses and that quote you said at the end about good health being a crown only the sick can see is so true. It made me happy to hear someone in such good health (Kara) say that because I often get comments from people saying “are you really that sick” instead of trying to empathize with me. You guys are amazing and I hope Nate has a speedy recovery. I really appreciate the honesty and vulnerability in this video
Sending you both cyber hugs ... happy that Nate is on the mend and to Kara for being his rock ... you guys are amazing!
Guys, we are so relieved to know that Nate is ok. You are a pair of champions and to share the whole ordeal with the world is brilliant and will help so many people. We can't wait for more adventures with you and here's to good health lads! 🥂❤
I am so pleased that u r cancer free Nate!!!
You'll be fine Nath... ❤️
I am so proud of you for sharing what has happened to you. My grandpa has AML which is life threatening so don't worry because you can take yours out while my grandpa has to try to deal with his treatment.
Oh you guys ! So happy your ok and and its over. Thank you for sharing. Stay Safe!
Glad to see you guys are okay! Life throws us challenges but we must overcome them! So happy for you two! <3
Well done 👏....these things come to bite us on the arse at anytime.... life so fragile ...but you have now helped others 😊💚
We are so happy to hear that you are ok! Congrats!
Thank you so much for sharing this with us, I am sure you have inspired many people to go get checked!! Speedy recovery Nate!!  🙏❤
Thanks for sharing. Love from Norway
So happy you are good to go. 🤕❤️
God bless you both for sharing. Thank God for the skill of the medical profession. I am so delighted for you both and pray the scaring will heal swiftly,

Why the drama? Sad your using this for hits?
Thanks so much for sharing. It can happen to everyone and anyone. So happy for Nate and Kara, that Nate is Cancer Free, 🗣 Yeah! Raise God for the many Blessings. Watching this video, inside your van looks so clean 😀 Keep up the great work.
Thank you for sharing.  I have gone in for a skin check before.  It was negative, but scary.    Also thanks for the ear warning.   I want to keep my ears.    I am glad it was a happy ending.
should probably rename tittle to I HAD skin cancer lol.
I am glad your ok man, I saw the title and freaked out a little lol.  I think Ive actually binged all of your videos now, so always looking forward to seeing a new one!  :Edit: Cant wait to see Canada!
King
my eyes just teared up and skipped a beat when I read the title....Nate Kara you guys are super strong homansssssss..i love you guyss
Thank God u are all OK
So glad Nate is on the mend. I was so scared. I will be praying for you both. 🙏 Thank you for sharing. Stay safe. ❤
Stay strong  ....v been  watching  from Kenya...
Wow guys!! Thank you so much for sharing. It means so much. Nate, never feel weird for telling us your merely human. Your humility and positive energy is so contagious. I just apprciate your honesty and yoir videos so much. Love you guys even more than before...
So glad this went so well ! Had been curious for a few videos what the bald patch was all about. God Bless You Both.
i really felt this one i love watching your'e videos and making homework i hope you will be still making these amazing videos you are an amazing person take care of yourself (and of youre wife kara) :) <3
Love Kara and Nate so much I didn’t even want to click on this video..
glad you're alright man, stay strong brother..
Really happy to know that you are now cancer free. It takes a lot of courage to share your experience. Take care!!!
My mom had skin cancer
So glad you're on the other side of this and thanks for sharing something so personal and important! Both my parents have had skin cancers removed from their heads and faces in the last couple years and they're both so diligent about sunscreen. I think us Aussies just expect skin cancer.
Glad to hear everything went well and you got this taken care of, Nate! Great job with the PSA and sharing with others to take preventive measures. Kara’s comment about clipping ears at the end will make me cake on the spf alone!
So glad you shared this story - its important to know people go through this
As my sister said, who passed away of cancer when she's 55 years old, " life you never know, be grateful of what you have".  Also as other person said, sunscreen is not perfect.  So stay away from sunlight, try not to expose ourselves in sunlight as much as you can.
Thanks for sharing. I wish you guys all the best!
Praise God! I have lumps in my boob that I have to get checked out every 6mo. Your not alone!!!!!!! We live u!
❤️❤️❤️❤️🤩🙏👍
Nate, blessings today and everyday. Kara, tons of love!
Happy 😉that you guys are ok, my Dad has skin Cancer but he's not cancer free yet 😑😞 blessings 💗🙏
Thank you for sharing such an important and unpleasant personal story that helps improve cancer awareness and prevention!
So good to hear he is doing fine. So happy for you guys... 💕
Prayers! Keep us posted!
Glad to hear that it's getting better. Hope both of u are doing well 🙂
So glad everything worked out favorably.  Thank you so much for sharing this huge SHOCKER with us.  You are helping others with your honesty.  God bless!
Glad your ok Nate would miss  you and kara. You guys are great.
So glad you're ok Nate. Sending you both lots of love ❤️🤗
I am happy to hear you are fine Nate ❤️❤️❤️
Thank you for telling us your story bless you both
OMG my heart beat paused for a second there. Good to know you guys are safe and sound. To all the good souls here, may the Universe bless you with good health and abundance 🙌
Thank you for sharing something so personal, I’m sat here crying, not sure if it’s because I know your fear, or because I know the relief of being told they got it all in one go, either way I was fine until I saw Kara holding back the tears and being strong when you were told you had cancer. So glad your ok, and your healing well, much love to you both xxx
🙏💕
Its so genuine care dat kara was always by ur side. U guys r fun to watch together.. N i pray evrything wil be okkk. Evrybody has a battle to fight... d only thing 1 has 2 know, is keep being motivated, c d positivity, and keep ur self in healthy environment.
So funny when you mentioned the burnt skin  smell. I work in derm so when you said that I instantly knew exactly what you meant
Glad  Nate is ok. Sending y’all love and peace during this difficult time.
Get well soon Nate! I’ll be praying for you.
So sorry you had to go through this.  It's an ordeal either way but it's so good that they got it all out. Thanks for sharing with us and hope you recover quickly but don't forget to rest too! 😊
Feel so honored that you chose to tell us all what’s going on with you. Praying for quick and full recovery and happy and safe continued adventures. 🤍
Thankful that everything is clear... :)
As a breast cancer survivor I know about the apprehension of waiting for results. So glad you are cancer free.
Thank you for bringing us into your lives and sharing this. I am sure it wasn’t easy. Happy to see Nate has recovered!! Best of health to you both ❤️
I had mohs surgery for a basal cell on the tip of my nose. It was not fun and they had to do an elaborate flap thing to cover up the spot. So I can totally relate to what you went through!
So glad they got it all, I know how scary it can be as I had Melanoma on my back 10 years ago, and as with you they took out a larger section to be sure they got it all.  I do recommend that you get yearly check ups for the next few years, just to be on the safe side.  Now for me being a bit crazy, Seriously Nate, you climb mountains, dive with sharks, sky dive and many other dangerous things but you are afraid of needles?  I thought that was so funny.  OK, back to being seriously, please share with us if you need help paying for your medical expenses, setup a Go Fund me know and I am sure others, as I will help you two out.  Now for my scary story, just found out a disk in my neck is severely herniated on both sides to the point it is deforming the nerves, so looks like I will be having surgery within the next month to have the disk replaced.
Feel better Nate we love u soo feel better
Well that was a surprise.. glad it worked out ..happy for the news ..oh canada I'm in Saskatchewan..lol
You and Kara's smiles; HID IT SO WELL!!! Cheers to you and a speedy recovery
Nate - glad you are on the mend and thanks for sharing.
So glad for your good outcome
Best wishes Xx
As a cancer survivor since 1991, I can only say your grandfathers quote is so true.  "Health is a crown on a well man's head that only the sick can see."
I really wanted this to be a clickbait. So glad it has a happy ending.
Oh my goodness! My Dad was diagnosed in 2019 and I cannot imagine how you have kept it together like you have! Y'all are amazing and I am so thankful that Nate is okay.
All the best Nate
Hi Nate it’s important that people speak up about cancer, you are doing the right thing 🙏🏽  And just to say that everyone no matter their skin colour 👏🏾👏🏿👏🏽👏🏻👏👏🏼or skin tone should wear SPF Bless you
Dude.
Sending love, light & healing vibes to you!
So glad all is ok. Bless darlings
you are so brave and strong Nate.. you got this!! 💖  sending you well wishes!
Just be glad it was not on your nose mine was i had over month think going have nose cut off , but lucky i was ok. Since then i cover up in the heat of the sun. Glad your ok. all best
My mom ended up with skin cancer. She had it removed and so far is doing peachy. She has to do check ups but is worth it.
My god, I dropped everything to watch! I'm so glad that you're OK!
Thank you for sharing. It is so important to get the message out about skin cancer and the importance to get checked out no matter how old you are or how little the lesion appears. I also won’t take it personally that you don’t like dentists. I have heard that my whole career 😊
Any time the C word it used it is scary especially if you are younger.  But this kind of cancer is very common and if treated early it is easily dealt with.  By the way I get a full body check once a year for skin cancer….. no biggy.  Hope you heal fast
Cancer is an awful thing.  So glad yours was able to be dealt with.  I was diagnosed stage IV just over 2 years ago at 37.  No family history, nothing.  This is how I found your channel, doing chemo non stop takes it out of you, I don't have any energy.   Anything I do have I save for my 3 year old.    Keep safe and healthy!!
On my way to the beach right now and you better believe I’m going to drench myself in sunscreen 😅 SO so glad that this was just a scare. But even knowing the final result I still cried thinking about how hard this must have been on y’all. Stay strong. So much love and good vibes from Florida 💖
❤️
Its ok to not be ok - you have no idea how much I needed to hear that today...
Glad everything turned out ok.  I've been following for awhile and love you guys.
Smiling and laughing is my therapy in my case. You guys are my part of my therapy, you bring so much happiness with your video. I can't go to sleep without watching one of your video. I'm fighting an orphan disease and i know the agony you had while waiting for THE call back. I wish you all the best for the future !
I’m glad Nate is doing fine. Best wishes to you guys. Safe travels. ❤️
I'm so thankful that Nate is cancer free! He definitely needs to wear strong sunscreen and a hat when out in the sun. Y'all need to do regular skin checks to make sure that another spot doesn't show up and be neglected!! Good luck!
Before surgery, try this: soak a gauze pad in silver colloid and tape it to the spot. Later rub in Oil of Oregano and a good fresh oil vitamin E, not cosmetic but food supplement. Wash and Rotate this routine a few times a day. Continue for 2 weeks. You find its gone around 9-10 days, but keep on treating it for 2 weeks. My last friend healed a huge warty mole that changed. It fell off. Never came back. Painless and leaves no scar.
Good luck Nate. It will ok.
Dear Nate and Kara please let me know the follow ups. Mr and my wife Lima we are parying for your recovery Nate. -Dr Hassan from Cancer clinic. Lesotho, Africa
I was also diagnosed with Cancer in November, and officially got the cancer free letter last week, mine was treated with drugs and a biopsy too, its scary and relieving all at once... so pleased for you both  💕💕
Had one of these basal cell spots a couple years ago on my chest. It looked like a scratch that never healed. I was so glad when I found out was easily treatable, but was a real eye opener for me. I also remember how stressful it was waiting and wondering. Glad you’re on the mend! 🎉
God bless you guys!
I am so glad Nate is cancer free!  I can not thank you both enough for posting this to help other people.  I so enjoy your videos!  Love you both!!!!!💗💗
So glad Nate is on the mend❤keep safe guys!
Thanks for sharing this!!  The most important thing with skin cancer is getting those regular checks!  Don’t skip them!  Good for your doctor for having the re-do on the biopsy!  That was huge.  Honesty, basal cell is child’s play.  Melanoma is the killer.  I had one removed on my back 10 years ago.  I have reddish hair & freckles.  Those genes are more likely to be prone to skin cancers.  I thank God for my dermatologist- he literally saved my life by seeing the small suspicious mole on my back.  Get those check ups regularly and good luck - you’re gonna be fine it’s amazing how the body will heal. 💕
Thank you for being real and vulnerable I'm so glad you are ok nate i really hate cancer stay safe you two and have fun in Canada i loved it there when i visited
Nate, im glad you are doing well. please dont hold back on things like this in the future. I always pray for people and wouldnt mind doing it for you too. Kara, thanks for being so supportive,. I wish you both the best of everything. moving on, Canada Eh? sounds fun, get after it bruvz
dang nate. stay safe. so happy that you are okay. thank you for the positivity and strength
Hope you’re going after that doctor with a suit……
Hey loved the story. My Nan sadly passed away years ago from Cancer she got the all clear but unfortunatley it came back a d spread. Hers was far worse than yours but it goes to show no .atger how serious it ends up people are always supportive in this world. Hops this means you can know keep traveling the world. I am hoping next year to complete my goal of visiting all the continents of the world. Then after that my ultimate goal is to do Mt Everest base camp for charity.
Nate you're so strong and brave. Not only for going through it but for also sharing this to the public. I look up to you for that. It's also really cool that you're coming to Canada again cause that's where I'm from. Safe travels!
That's the exact same type of cancer that I had removed from my back! I did think the description sounded familiar... In my case my family doctor didn't think it was cancer but since it kept opening up an bleeding it did need to be removed anyway and he sent it to the lab afterwards just in case. Glad it wasn't a bigger, badder type! And sunscreen and hats ftw!
Thank you so much for sharing this video. I got news a couple days ago that my dad has cancer and will be having surgery done asap. It has been really hard to come to terms with. With all of you guys Eamon and Bec going and watching from kinging it recently sharing it has helped a lot. Thank you so much
Thanks for the pinned comment -  heart literally went down after reading the title!!
wish you all the best 🙏🏼 ♥️
Thank you for being vulnerable and sharing this with us. 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 You got this man.
I'm so happy Nate's okay.
My dad has had skin cancer two times now and my mom had pancreatic cancer. Its horrible, i wish you both the VERY best of luck :)
After Technoblade, this made my heart sink. I am so glad you are okay Nate. Sending both of you so much love. xx
So glad your results were good.  What kind of health insurance do you have as itinerants?
sending you all so much prayers and love!
My heart dropped after seeing the title but I'm glad you guys are ok now. I appreciate you guys sharing this part of your life 💛
My husband has a rare form of skin cancer , at present dormant, yearly mapping and check-ups - we live life to the full & travel and he keeps himself as well and protected as possible - get strong 💪
Get well soon 😊
Hope you are better nate sorry to hear that but happy that u are cancer free now
Stay strong guys
i have something on my head too... i guessss i should probably go get it checked out
I'm so glad to hear that you're okay, Nate! Thank you so much for sharing this story - it's a good reminder to not only protect yourself when you're outside, but to also go get things checked out if you think something might be off, even if you're scared. All the very best to you both!
yayyy im so happy for you:)     come visit gatineau when you will come to canada
I have it too my friend. I’ve had two surgeries and I’m happy and healthy and I KNOW you will be too.  Respect! 👊🏻👌🏻
Now I'm scared. I'm a wildland firefighter always outside. You will be better Nate and thank you for sharing this
so that was quite a shock but I'm very happy that it ends like this for you and I wish you a lot of strength from the Netherlands
I hope you are on the mend Nate and we are all here for you!!! ❤️❤️
❤
Proud of you Nate. My husband has had 50+ removed…many basil cell. We are very proactive. Prayers to you and Kara.
Hey Nate and Kara I'm praying that Nate will be OK. I watch all of your videos. You all have so much fun together. God bless you all. A fan from The Bronx NY🙌🏿❤🙏🏿
I had a basil cell on my face.  They cut it out.  No big deal.  That was 15 years ago.  You'll be fine.  Edit:  Actually just got to the part of your video where you said you could smell burning flesh.  That reminds me, they didn't cut it out, they used like a little lightning bolt and burned it out or zapped it out.  Either way, it was not a big deal.  I asked the doctor after if I'd need plastic surgery for the scar, he said that I didn't strike him as being a model.  What an asshole.  LOL
prayers for quick healing for nate! i hope you and kara are doing alright❤️
I saw the spot in Nate's head in the last video and wondered what was going on. I am so happy you are Cancer Free!!!! My BFF went through brest cancer some years back and is cancer free. #Cancersucks
Dear Nate and Kara just now i watched your VDO. I am worried. How are you doing Nate? I am doctor my Name is Dr Hassan Mobashshar Nd I work with Cancrr patients in Lesotho. Please let me know.  Me and my wife Lima,  we care about you Nate and Kara.
Amen and praise the Lord.  Lots of love from Bhutan 🇧🇹 We will upload you both in our prayers and God is always on both of your side . Jesus loves you both and may God shower massive blessings in both of your life and family. 😇😇😇🇧🇹🇧🇹🇧🇹😍😍😍
Wishing you speedy recovery
I'm grateful for your statement regarding the normalization of therapy.  There is not one person on the planet that doesn't suffer emotionally for some reason and at some point in their life.  Mental health is the foundation of physical health. Thank you.
So happy for you.  NOW WHERE IN CANADA ARE YOU GOING?  TORONTO HERE.
Glad you're cancer free. 🙏🏻🙏🏻
Uh oh 😰
Lessons from this video:  - Nate is Cancer free! - WEAR YOUR SUNSCREEN!!!
All clear, the two best words to hear re cancer. Thanks for sharing.
Hi from Canada, Happy all go on ok friend , Have a Nice day & Be safe
I had a similar skin cancer removed from my back a few years ago. Even though I've stayed out of the sun for decades now, the damage was most likely done when I was a teenager and spent a lot of time in the sun. Glad you're on the mend. Take care!
If you disliked this video, you have no soul!
Thank you for sharing..it takes courage to do what you have been doing  and putting on a brave front..so happy for you
Well, I've been watching your youtube channel for a while and am surprised to see another young person like myself with skin cancer. I had squamous cell carcinoma and a large tumor of that on my nose that looked like one of those ugly witches. It was a very fast-growing and scary cancer, but I got it removed in January of this year (also the Moh's surgery). Unfortunately, there is a huge scar from my forehead down to my nose that is healing and looking better every day. It's my plan to eventually make a youtube video with the photos documenting the horror. Now is a good time to advise you to start wearing skin protection. I wear dermatologist-approved sunscreen and always wear a large sun hat (Coolibar). When outside for longer periods, I wear SPF-protective clothing while hiking in addition to my sunhat. Skin cancer is very common, and if you can avoid getting it on your face by wearing sun protection, that is best.
Really great video.  Lots of good messaging  .
So this was the reason for the wound we seen on Nate's head last video. Thank you for sharing this life experience, cos its important that young people like us take our health seriously. Cos waay too many of us ignore small health problems that might grow into big issues later.
Thank you guys for sharing this with us! That must have been so hard! Praying for fast healing and many more adventures :) big virtual hug 🤗
I feel like you overhyped this for views.
I was about to cry 😭 when I saw this video but I’m so happy for you Nate that now you are cancer free🤕
I’m glad your doing ok ❤️get well soon man
my dad had skin cancer. we knew it wasnt serious as we had caught it early but the thought my my dad having cancer is a weird thought sometimes
I'm very glad you had good news in the end
Super happy all is well and you're on the mend. Any surgery sucks. Glad you're feeling better!
Take good care of yourselves!
Hi guys, i was so worried when I read the title on this video. Glad to know that everything is fine now! I am thinking that since you guys spend so much time outdoors you should try to cover up more (long sleeves, long pants, hat, grow longer hair, try not to be in the sun between 10 and 2 pm). I wouldn’t rely on sunscreens too much because they are finding carcinogens in the sunscreens too.
I feel so bad my papa had skin cancer to
So glad you're okay!! Safe travels guys! Praying for a swift recovery for you!
Those Nashville accents are wild. Glad you are moving positively through this rough spot.
_How on Earth_ are y’all getting those silent drone shots? It’s blowing my mind bow I’m able to hear the ambient noises without the [expected] accompanying whirring of the drone blades.
when i heard this and saw this I was so upset and when i found ou he was all clear i was so relieved
Thank goodness!
My heart broke reading this title sending u love from Los Angeles 💔 😢
Massive respect for sharing. Love you both.
Who tf watches this and leaves a dislike
Thank god your husband is ok
Basal cell carcinoma is the "best" type of skin cancer you could have.  I've had several removed over the years, plus some squamous cell ones.  Being fair skinned and having suffered through many sunburns as a child was probably the cause.  I now stay out of the sun as much as I can and get annual skin checks.  I'm glad all is well now.
Glad you shared this. It is important. I noticed a bandage on the back of your head in recent videos - so thank you and God bless you!
I’m in tears watching this you’re so brave. Thank you for sharing your story, I wish you all the best my favourite travel vloggers
THANK YOU for sharing! I too had the Mohs procedure to remove half of my ear because I waited so long as well! Glad all went "well"!
Just want to encourage everybody that just like you might get your breasts or prostate examined for risk of cancer you can also go to the dermatologist and get a skin check once a year. My exam took about 15 minutes.
Sending ❤ and healing your way! Thank you for using your platform to fight skin cancer and mental health! Looking forward to more of your adventures!!!
Ur u guy geten a babi
Nate, doesn't matter what cancer it is, the words are never easy, but those of us , that know...just know!!!  Prepare for a few wobbles  but onwards and upwards!
It's so sad how people think their the only one with problems!
The first thing that I said reading the title was, "NO, NO, NOOOO". Thanks to the Almighty you are okay Nate💗 Take care of yourselves guys! Yearly health checkups are ESSENTIAL.
You are pretty young to have to start dealing with skin cancer, but for people in their late 40s and beyond, seeing a dermatologist at least once a year is very important.   If you spend a lot of time outside you can expect to have pre-cancerous spots frozen off or cut out for biopsy on a regular basis.   I have had 3 Mohs procedures done, and probably will have more as time goes by.  Just another part of life.   Given that you had the cancerous spot at a relatively early age, you probably should see a dermatologist at least twice a year.  Skin cancer can kill, but if you catch it early it is easily treated.   Use SPF 50 sunscreen whenever you go out.
Kara & Nate, My prayers will be with you continuously. I am a cancer survivor being diagnosed with Thyroid Cancer back in 2017. I'm very sure that you both not only have millions of subscribers, but prayer warriors all over the world. I wish you both many many blessings to continue. God Bless You Both!
So glad that Nate is good now. Shout out to Kara for being so strong and staying by his side all the time.  God speed to both of you. ❤️❤️
Thank you for sharing. I think we all forget that you all are human and work through the day to day issues of existing. I’m glad that this turned out well and that Nate is cancer free and on the road to recovering❤️ I hope that you have a great week and I know you had fun in Canada because I kinda watched everything out of order. It was my wish/dream that the 6 of you all got together. I hope that you can all get together (maybe Wales?) again❤️👍🏻😊
Try having osteosarcoma and then leukemia.
Thank you so much for sharing: so happy it all turned out oke! Take care and stay safe.
Your story was very scary to hear but I am glad to see you're doing better Nate!!
So happy that Nate got well
I hope and pray that you recover completely asap....
Oh sheeeeet
Just reading the title made me cry :( Am just soooo glad that everything is fine.  I have seen my mother suffer for more than a year due to Cancer and just the word gave me chills!  Take care Nate!!
happy to hear that all is well. but that doctor is right, wear sunscreen every single day, come rain, snow or shine. even when you're indoor where there's a window. bc UVA (cancer and aging causing UV) penetrates everything.
So great that you made this video! It is such an important topic and especially for men to be better at wearing sunscreen 🧴
As a b;;ood cancer sufferer  for the last 8 years, allow mw to express my empathy.  I will not tell you what you should do, as every cancer journey is different,  I will tell you to listen to your medical team amd to drink lots of water each day.  Good luck and remember to let the cancer impede your life as little as possible,
Nate you were very brave to share this story.
good for you for educating the public about skin cancer.  often overlooked by many.  JDR
I’ve been there!  I had surgery and then plastic surgery. I’m also a nurse. If you ever have any questions, I will help all I can.
So happy to hear Nate is cancer free!  Sending smiles and hugs to you both and a prayer of thanksgiving to  heaven. 🙏
atleast you were honest. most youtubers gonna be like "I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU" and than make you wait 30 minutes to figure it out. but you just had it in the title
So glad you’re ok but kinda disappointed you used this opportunity to make money   But I’m sure you will probably donate the cash seems like you are that kinda couple and not one to profit from health scares
Glad you're feeling better. Thank you for sharing, stay safe.
Oh, not to be too persistent, keep up the good Youtube work. I've been following you two for more than a year and love your relationship, your videos, your humor and your posts. You two are among the half-dozen or so travellers I check in with weekly. Loved your day crawdad fishing. I grew up in Louisiana and used to catch them in rain-filled ditches using a piece of string tied to a bit of bacon. Works every time but it takes a while to get more than a snack out of it. It's good amusement for a teenager,  however.
My heart just literally stopped seeing the title and the thumbnail. It felt so bad while i was yet to start the video. I just love you guys. You 2 r my fav youtubers 🧡
I’m so glad that all of this was manageable and ended well. I cried along with Kara in happy relief.
Thank you guys...... I have something wrong in my arm... I go to the doc tomorrow to see if it it is bad or not. I refuse to think it is cancer.  I have so many things running through my head lately. This video helped some. I will try to keep you guys updated for tomorrow...
I have ever seen such a baby. "Clear at the margins". Lol
Kara and Nate! so glad y’all are doing well! Praise Jesus you’re okay Nate, great job staying strong Kara.
SO glad to know that Nate is gonna be okay! In the last vlog we could see the bandage on his head and were wondering what that could be for. Cancer is one of those things that can creep up on you unannounced, thanks to Kara for pushing Nate to go see the doctor pretty early.
Sending healing hugs your way! My husband had the exact same thing (and same surgery) on the top of his head. It was definitely a rude awakening about taking good health for granted. Since then, my husband sees the dermatologist every six months and a few other "spots" have been removed on his back, legs, etc. It is scary, but there is comfort in knowing that he is being monitored and any issues are being promptly addressed.  Yes, SPF 50, especially on your ears. Since my husband is losing his hair (genetic), he puts it on his head, in addition to wearing a hat. Thank you for sharing this journey with us. You have an entire community sending healing vibes your way. On to the next adventure!
"We'll see what WEBMD has to say about it!" Hahahah Kara you gem.
So sad to hear  of your diagnosis, Nate, but happy to see that you're doing  okay. Stay safe out there.
Nate is my favorite youtuber! Stay strong man!
<3 you guys. Happy that everything has turned out well, and thanks for showing us the other side and giving us a different angle to your story. Wishing you both the best and looking forward to seeing more of your shenanigans and adventures.
So happy Nate is on the  mend ❤️ ❤️❤️  sending so much love to you guys, thank you for sharing your story .
Get well Nate.
What a blessing in disguise! Thankful for your cancer free diagnosis! And I was so ministered to by Nates dads quote…so wise and profound…I am writing that down and will reflect on it regularly! And thank you so much for your transparency. It is a good reminder for all of us that no one has a pain-free or struggle-free life. “May the Lord bless you and keep you. May the Lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you. The Lord lift up his countenance upon you,  and give you peace.” Numbers 6:24-26
Oh God I'm crying
Wow that’s amazing you are such a fighter thanks for sharing your story
All the best to you and stay safe ❤
Nooooooooooooooooooooooo😬😭😕
I'm so happy for you! I love your Granddad's wise saying about health. God bless you guys!!
I had the same thing removed from my back.  I needed to have a plastic surgeon remove mine since it was in an area that moves a lot they had to cut a W shape in my back so that the stitches didn’t get pulled out.  Good luck and hope that is the only spot!
May Almighty bless you two ❤️ love you guys so much ❣️
good job staying diligent ... my hubs had the other skin cancer on his ear ... they cut it off now it looks like some animal bit off the top of his ear ... hats and sunscreen folks!
Congratulations on being 100% healthy! :) May god continue to grace you both...and us all!
I clicked on this as soon as the banner showed up son my phone! Nate I’m so glad you’re ok and things didn’t turn out to be serious for you. It was a relief to watch! And Kara, love seeing the support you gave Nate while he went through this. I love watching you guys and truly admire you’re relationship. Cheers to many more years of health, travel and video creation!
I have a growth on the front right side of my head... going to the Dr on Wednesday, fingers crossed it'll be sorted.
that is why he had a bandage on his head.
I thought it was a clickbait video, and I was thinking why would Nate and Kate be putting out clickbait videos? And about cancer, at that?!?!   Unfortunately, it is. Totally clickbait. Totally unexpected you'd put out something like this. Sort of disappointing.  But good it wasn't anything serious, Nate.
Thank you for sharing this very personal part of your lives. You're both amazing and your videos bring me so much joy! Wishing you the best in health and happiness!
Thank your for sharing this part of your story. So glad to know Nate is on the mend now. ❤️
Prayers for your speedy recovery 🙏 ❤ 💙
Take care Nate, first look after yourself rest falls in place. With love from India
So glad you are OK and Kara was a trooper. I had the same thing on my stomach last year. Consider them battle scars with great outcomes and go see a dermatologist once a year..Happy news!
I'm so happy you are all right. If you have to have skin cancer basal cell skin cancer is the least worrisome. As someone who has had skin cancer, I can totally relate to this video.
Correction to the video title: you HAD cancer. God bless! Also it’s breast cancer awareness month - reminder to self exam 🌸
Thanks for sharing that. My husband has also been on a cancer journey and also hates needles and operations so it wasn’t easy for him. We know the waiting and worrying parts and now we’re on to the 3 month checks part. It’s been tough but he got to the other side. So happy to hear you did too.
So happy that you have had a really good outcome x
Thank you for sharing such a personal story and I’m so glad that this had a good outcome for Nate.
You quoted Lee that was very touching " it's okay to not be okay " I loved it and also to I was watching something else and Eamon and BEC popped up where they also had Lee in their opening scenes and then you guys got to hang out with them so that was pretty cool kind of a roundabout way of letting everybody know Lee still remembered and it's okay to not be okay thank you so much for sharing I love this❤❤❤
I’m so sorry Nate I feel so bad for you
never clicked so fast, so glad you are ok!!! ❤️❤️
In my case, basal cell deals are usually caught, like yours, as pre-canderous. I've had two Mohs procedures. One on my face, another in the web of my left hand. Very faint scars remain. They cut it out, biopsy it to see if they got it all (no ragged edges that might mean spreading) If they need to take more, they'll do that and stitch up. My dermatologist has kept me alive through two Mohs deals over ten years. Melanoma is a cancer you can live a long, long time with. You came out of it great. When I had my lip cancer cut out years ago, it never came back. But I had to eat through a straw for nearly a month to make sure the scar was faint.  When I shave my mustache to check on it now and then I have to really look close to see the scar. Like I sad before, if you have to have cancer, go with the skin type. With regular checkups. and using sun block, you can live with it until something else takes you down.
After this, I’m so glad I recently bought a UPF50 wide-brim hat with a back panel that covers my neck! And it looks cute too! 😁 Thank you for your story! You might have saved some folks skin! 🙏🥰 (my hat is Camptrace from Amazon, for those who need one!)
❤️❤️❤️
You always help me and others through a lot so now it’s time for us to help you
I had Mohs 15 years ago; they had to go back 3 times to get it all out of my chest. The scar is barely visible and my yearly checks are good! So glad you had this done!!
Just glad the cancer was taken care of and we can go back to adventuring with Kara and Nate! :)
My father had basal cell carcinoma roughly 25 years ago on his nose.  They removed it and it didn’t come back. But, they found a melanoma tumor two years ago.  This past September was the one-year anniversary of his passing.  Skin cancer is scary.  Wishing you the best of luck with everything.
Oh my gosh😱 Can’t belive this😫😭 Stay well❤️🙏
🙏🏼🙏🏼. I love u guys!!! I cried a lil. You guys are amazing!! Thank you for sharing
My first skin cancer came at 30 years old on the tip of my nose 2 months after I had my third child. I get it the fear. MOHS surgery on my nose that went down to the cartilage  I had 4 rounds of MOHS. I was awake for my procedure too. They just numb the area at each round. Total 6 hours of surgery because it included the complete nose reconstruction. They just placed the surgical tools on my chest! Ha. I was easily the youngest patient by 30-40 years that day. Here I am 15 years later and I’m doin great. Good luck :)
God bless you Nate, praying for you
My dad has had benign basal cell tumors develop on his head for most of his life. Luckily, he only needs to go to the dermatologist annually and have them cold lasered (like a wart). It's a non-threatening nuisance. I'm so glad you're okay Nate!
Glad to hear you’re ok Nate ♥️
Thanks for sharing this it’s really important to highlight. Felt every moment of this video & so glad you’ve got the all clear - just goes to show that health is the most important thing 🙌🏼 You were both so strong & Kara was an absolute rock throughout. You guys really make the most of life, can’t wait to see what comes next 🤩🤩
I was tearful the entire time and am so glad that you are ok Nate.  It has never felt to me like you and Kara are stranger on a screen.  Thank you for sharing your lives with me and all of us.
I get Charles Trippy vibes watching this didn't he go through the same thing
My heart dropped reading this, so happy to hear you’re fine ❤️🙏 all the best for the recovery and here’s to future health!!
I've been there. I had Mohs surgery on my nose and then had to go back a week later to have it again for 2 more spots that had popped up. I was in my thirties and remember that feeling of being the youngest patient by far. It sucked but I'm so thankful for science and that they are able to identify and treat these types of cancers! Thank you for sharing. It might help others get checked out.
Hope you feel  better.
You guys did such a good job with this video!!!  And congrats on your excellent outcome Nate!!  I think you two have a bright future ahead and I wouldn’t be surprised to see you starring in major videos and bigger projects soon, you’ve both come a long way from being excited about spa treatments in airport lounges (which were fun to watch).  HERES TO YOUR FUTURE!!
Nate you will be ok. I've had 2 cancers 3 times in 10 years and I'm 37. God is good! Keeping you and Kara in our prayers!
So proud of your strength and decision to share your story, Nate!
I look for your videos every week, you have become my favorites, you make me smile. I am very happy that everything turned out so well and the adventures will continue. Good Luck to both of you.
You're very lucky. My Sister (Colon) and cousin (Breast) are both cancer survivors. Very scary and would't want anyone else to go through what they went through. Very happy for you. Thanks for sharing your story.
Praying for the both of you.
@ Kara and Nate me and my family are huge fans. I had the exact same thing when I was 29 on my ear. If you ever need someone to chat to about this let me know. Cheers!
Had the same type of cancer years ago.  It’s a little scary but it’s workable.   So glad Nate is ok. TY for sharing. People will take notice and that’s the positive side.  You’ll help someone else.   Hats.  Sunscreen. Awareness; spread the word!
So sooo happy to hear that he is doing better now. The story came as a shock and we love you both so much. All the love and health to you both. Keep inspiring and spread happiness ❤️ Welcome to Canada 🇨🇦 let us know if you visit Toronto, we would love to have coffee with you guys
Use CBD oil internally and externally Nate!
Grandpa wisdom is excellent- love that quote!
Great, things worked out for you. You know Hugh Jackman had same done like 2-3 times himself and he's doing ok.😃
Nate, I'm glad that your ok.
Oh thank god Nate is ok I was balling
As I head in to two procedures the (14,28th) to have suspicious places removed ,I felt all of Nates emotions. So glad he is on the healing side of things now.
I waited and waited and waited to go in and get checked. Praise be to God I also had a treatable skin cancer at 36.   Thank you for being brave and sharing your story - awareness is so very important!
Not a funny topic but karas eye cover description broke the stress lol
Nate you and your wife’s content is inspiring and great it gives a new perspective of life while travelling. You let us see all the good in other countries and in each other. I really hope you power through your cancer like my relatives did. I know it’s hard and depressing at times but you have a great supportive wife and friends and that’s all you really need to concur your issue. I love your content and positivity and compassion for others. I wish you all the best with your journey through cancer and god bless you and your wife.
Fk me, are you serious? After all that you turn it into an opportunity to commercialize it and make money for yourselves. You really have lost yourselves. Massively disappointed in you. you have lost your way. Cheap and distasteful advertorials all the way henceforth?
You will be in my prayers🙏
That is an amazing quote by Nate's grandfather.
I just want to compliment you on the handling of this. So many creators would have turned this into a clickbait bonanza, and a cliffhanger episode. This feels a lot more like just a really honest look inside something you really didn't want to talk about. Artfully done, and thrilled to hear that you had a good outcome. And Kara, thanks for leaving out your meltdown. We all know you had one, but it would have been rough on us as well.
wait so u live in a house now?
Glad you're ok Nate. Great to hear you're reminding everyone to be Sun Smart
I was so scared when I saw the thumbnail and now I'm crying in relief at the end of this video 😢😭 so glad you are ok Nate xxx Now go join have fun with Kinging it and E&B! 😀
Hey Nate, sending tons of love and healing energies. Same to you Kara. You will beat this. Thanks for sharing friends :)
Relieved it is basal cell and not the big "M" form of carcinoma. Still sucks to go through all of this! My mom has been through several...keep an eye out for similar skin spots, but I hope it is gone for good. And therapy is awesome!!!
I am so happy you pursued answers. Your Grandpas quote is now in my “strong words” file! Thank you!
Just speechless after this video. Get well soon, Nate! Let me tell: you are a rock star 🌟  You guys are inspiration!! 👌 🍃
Im sure this video was difficult to make. Im SO happy to hear that everything went well and Nate is cancer free!! Thank you so much for being real, and showing your viewers that not everything is always as perfect as it seems when it comes to influencers, social media, etc. Im sad this happened but so grateful you decided to share and remind everyone that what they see in anyone else's life isn't always the full picture.
Good luck buddy
First time commenting here. Love you, Kara and Nata. More power to you and thank you for always being my source of inspiration ♥
I wanted to ask in the last video what the spot was on the back of Nate’s head when he kissed Kara good morning (I saw bandaging) but didn’t want to come off sounding rude, just worried. I’ve had moles removed on my cheek and forehead so I feel for you. I’m so glad you are cancer free now Nate and thank you for you opening up to us about this. We love you Kara and Nate💜
Nate, I am sorry for what you are going through. I know you are not alone and by posting this video look at it as inspiration for other ppl going through it as well to say it time to be proactive and  get it sorted. I actually went through hand surgery to remove tumour embedded in my thumb  I wasn't under general just a lot of numbing and local. I know in my heart that you will be alright.
My wife and I love you guys, we're glad to hear the good news we watch everything that you guys post, and buy the way we're going to visit petra in few weeks just wanted to say thank you for the previous videos. 🇦🇲
Sending you both Love
Thanks for sharing 👍 God bless y'all! ❤❤❤
🙏🏻🥰
In all this i could see how Kara was so positive throughout….Nate is so lucky……wish you good health for today and always
We love you have❤
So much love to yall!! So happy that Nate is cancer free !!!
Techno now u?
There’s something beautiful in watching Kara being strong for Nate even though you can see she’s nervous too.
Love your videos and I am so glad you are okay!
Love you both! ❤️
Get well soon Nate
My husband just had MOHS surgery to remove a basal cell carcinoma behind his ear. He's doing very well and recuperated quickly. It's still scary when you hear the "C" word.
Praying for you brother, get well and get back exploring
Also make sure you put on your sun shades to protect your eye
SPF on your head is not the first thing one thinks about. Especially if one has hair.
Sending love
Thank God he's fine, this is definitely a great reminder 🙏
My mom passed away because of cancer when I'm 18 years old..  After struggling for 9 years..  And now my doctor told, i got problems with my blood
Wow, you popped up on my feed, they found a melanoma on my ankle about the same time you found out yours.  I have been to 2 different consults and have surgery on the 14th of Oct..  They have to do a skin graph and some sort of dye test.  It has only been there 1 yr..  Glad you are getting yours taken care of, I pray mine goes as easy (healing wise and cancer free) as yours.
Oh my goodness! ❤❤❤❤❤
Hi Kara and Nate! I have been watching you guys for awhile now and you guys are one of my favorites. Me and my best friend have been so inspired by you you guys are the most amazing! I was so heartbroken for poor Nate, but I'm so glad he's okay. I have watched so many of your videos with friends and my parents, and all of them love your videos! I also come from Tennessee and I just don't know how to express how much you guys mean to me. You guys are AMAZINGl
I needed tissues for this one, but sooooo glad to have a positive outcome. I lost my dad to cancer and it’s definitely not easy. Take care and can’t wait for the next great adventure
Man made me so worry glad you're okay now take care stay safe ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I had a basal cell cancer removed 35 years ago. No problems since then, but I'm addicted to sunscreen, long sleeves and hats. Your life will always be extraordinary and precious!
Thank you for sharing!  I’ve had multiple of these basal cells cut off by mohs and they are amazing!  Most heal so that you can’t even see them!  My most recent skin cancer however is an invasive melanoma so I’m scheduled for a deeper dive on that later this month and praying that I caught it early.  Keep up with your wellness exams they can save your life!  A saying I received was “your health is your wealth.. without it the rest is all inconsequential”.  So glad they got your head all fixed up Nate!  Good for you Kara for staying on him!!
Very happy that went well, given the circumstances.
Where and when  treated matter .. this could be a lot worse. Plz take care of yourself first
My husband had to have Mohs surgery on his face last year. They had to shave half of his mustache off and dig in FOUR times to get it all. We’re from the generation when there wasn’t sunscreen when we were kids, and when SPF 15 came out, it was a big deal. Skin cancer is no joke. USE SUNSCREEN!!!  Sending Nate quick healing prayers!
Watching there videos for a few years now I often wondered if they wore sun screen and most of their videos they were hat-less or close to it.  Glad to hear Nate is fine and both got a wake up call which they are passing on to their viewers so a lot of good has come of this.
Nate peice of cake women all over the world get moles removed out of vanity.  It takes 10 mins and yours was carterised so less healing time.  But not to lessen melanomas!  Very dangerouse to ignore and always wear your sun screen!  Good thing your living your life to the extreme fullist!
I don't know you and will never meet you and I'm so pleased you are fine.
We feel like you are a part of our family.  I could not help crying before you shared all was now well at the end of the video.  Your video will save lives because we and many others will now have suspicious skin lesions checked by doctors.  Thank you so much and stay healthy.
I’m actually most upset about the title of this video
I am so glad you decided to go get that checked! I recently went to get a skin check and they biopsied 5 different moles and two of them came back precancerous, but still fixable. It sucks, but better to get it over with than to wait for it to get worse!
Nate keep strong remember stay out the sun
Sending the biggest hugs and all the love to both of you!!
Watching you and Kara in not only the good times, but also the scary moments is heartwarming.  Your a very special couple and I thank you for your courage yourselves with the world.
My heart just dropped looking at the title…  I just srtd d video… but i hope everything is fine and you get back to your best health as soon as possible 💟💟💟💟💟
Noo I wish u will be better
Thanks for sharing!!
Great news nate hope.you have a speedy recovery 👍👍
I'm such a big fan your yours and Kara's and I'm so glad your going to be ok Nate xoxoxo
You 2 have being serving us greatness and I'm emotional knowing how doing that plus having  to deal with such news can be a rollercoaster yet you kept smiling, shining and spreading joy. Sending hugs and lots of laughter.
So happy for you both that everything was okay. Sending you all the positive thoughts xoxox
I visit my skin doctor more often than my G.P. or cardiologist. The G.P. and I work on my diabetes. The cardio office watches over my heart and three weeks ago put two stints in my heart (to facilitate blood flow). Note: I was awake for the entire procedure while they put a tube up a blood vessel from my wrist to inside my pumper and left the two stints behind. It was sort of interesting but mostly I listened to half a dozen people in scrubs laugh and joke with each other for 45 minutes or so. But my skin doctor and I have a relationships going back ten years. We trade sun block tales. I say I wear sun block in the rain. He tells me he wears it to bed (he's of Scandinavian extraction, has red hair and freckles). I was Opie Taylor as a kid through the fourth grade, when my carrot top turned brown and my nose went freckleless. I'f you have to have cancer, take it on the surface rather than inside. Trust me, you'll have a longer remaining life under a dermatologist's care than the thoracic guy. Sorry to hear about your scab, Nate but you're going to have a decades-long relationship with your dermatologist. But stay out of the sun and use block anyway. Plus, buy some long-sleeved shirts and give up shorts. Just good advice I follow myself. And I'm pushing 80 real hard, so don't worry about it.  Just treat it,
Canada?!?
Ya know I saw the spot on your last video and was wondering what was going on. Soo happy everything is ok, love you both. God Bless
So glad Nate is okay! Proud of you Kara for keeping it together for him! Whew! You can cry and breathe now! ❤️
Thanks for sharing this stressful time with us. So glad things turned out the way they did :)
Thank you for sharing, skin cancer is no joke,  be very conscious of your exposure to the sun.  I’m currently stage 3 Melanoma. I Have had 4 surgeries removed the tumor and also had lymph noids removed thankfully it hasn’t progressed to stage 4. With a 30% survival rate it’s scary
I totally shed a tear throughout the video! Thank you for sharing your vulnerabilities to us. Just know that you're not alone in this! ❤
Hi! I’m so glad Nate is fine physically. I hope you’re both doing okay mentally as well. Take all the time you need to recover❤️
God bless you and your sweet wife.
So glad you’re ok Nate!! I wish you guys would have done more in this video to promote wearing spf
this is so inspiring.
Good job 👍🏻
Sending you lots of love and prayers Kara and Nate!
You guys don’t know how much your videos inspire me, like you guys are my favorite travel youtubers. Knowing what Nate have been through made me sad cause no one should ever have cancer. But I’m so glad that he’s all good now thankfully!! I know it hasn’t been easy especially when pandemic started but I want you guys to know that in every journey you have been through and more journeys in the future, just know that you are not alone in this. You guys have us! Thank you so much for trusting us that you guys are capable of opening this to us. We love you guys so much! More journeys and places to meet Kara and Nate!!
So glad you are okay. Thanks so much for the sunscreen message. Just a reminder that UV is particularly intense at altitude, even when cloudy!  Keep your skin safe folks 😍
I seriously cried with you Kara. You and Nate have really inspired me with your love of adventure. Nate I will continue to pray for you every year.
I went through a similar experience two years ago. Even though I was getting skin cancer screenings, the doctors missed it. (Small bump on my forehead… never scabbed or looked like much of anything.) It wasn’t until I mentioned that I had it for years that she decided to do the biopsy. I was kind of shocked at the size of the incision and the eventual scar. My point is, you are your best advocate and only you know your body. I’m so happy that you shared your story and that you are cancer free! I guarantee that with your sub count, this video will help many people make an appointment to get checked. Love you two!❤️
my utmost respect to both of you for how you handled it and only revealing it when Nate's been cleared of his cancer. stay healthy and cheerful always
Hey guys. I am glad that everything went well. I know how scary it can be to deal with the inevitable trials of life. It makes you really understand that everyday is truly a gift. Thank you for genuinely sharing with us.
So happy that Nate is ok. Rest well now. Coincidentally I went for my check up after our trip to Switzerland too and was diagnosed with cancer. It’s tough but being positive helps me to move forward and stay strong. I’m cancer free today and hope to stay this way.! Take care & stay healthy! 🍀
Really powerful quote by Nate grandfather: "good health is a crown worn on well man's head that only the sick can see"... Now that has me thinking... Damn! Am so happy you shared this story, but what is going on in the YouTube world? Your the 3rd YouTuber I watcher THIS week with something major going on health wise. BUT... thank the Lord all is well with you Nate. 🙏🏽
I could not imagine my life waiting for videos to be uploaded on this channel and not seeing Nate because it is Kara and Nate’s channel. Good job for taking time to beat that cancer. Let’s just say cancer is still a cancer whatever type of cancer it is and how severe it is. Point is you survived.   I would also like to congratulate all the cancer survivors (like me) in the world who can read this comment. This life we have right now is already our second chance and let’s do not take it for granted. Keep healthy and happy everyone.
I thought I saw a plaster on your head a while ago. Glad to hear you’re healing!
♥️♥️♥️♥️💪💪💪💪💪
Life does like to mess things for us. Everyone trying not to catch the corona viruse, then suddenly some cells decide to have a riot. Get well big boy.
Dear Nate and Kara, I am from Bangladesh and I have been following you and your channel for a long time. I felt heart broken when I first saw the title of the video but seeing the whole video made me feel abit relaxed. I just want to say that i will be praying for you and your family. Be strong and keep positive vibes always. Peace
Glad that you are all good, Nate! Take good care.
💪🏼❤️🙏🏼. Thank you for sharing.
It’s a slap in the face to make this video, say you have cancer then put a better help sponsorship in. Really unthoughtful and disappointing
This video scared me so bad, but I'm glad Nate is well now. ❤ And a good reminder to me to look after my skin as a young person. Skin cancer doesn't discriminate among age groups!
Praying for healing for you and praying for you both
I remember when I was very young (younger than 10yrs) I had to get a freckle removed from my hip Bc they thought it was cancerous.  That was so scary I think my brain blocked it out of my memory 😅 But good for you, Nate!!  That’s not easy to hear that news let alone have someone dig at your skin.
This is so scary, I’ve had 3-4 scabs on my head. I chalked it up to dry skin, I was born with white hair & my scalp got burnt often as a child 🤷🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️ & I pull ingrowns out of my body often.
Hey Nate. I’ve been watching you guys for the last 2 years and I just wanted to say how much it helped during lockdown. My dad had skin cancer a couple of times and while it’s super worrying, it’s so treatable. You’re going to be great. Stay strong dude, and if you can’t stay strong, stay good. 😊
My son was diagnosed with Leukemia at 15, he's all good now, in remission but just wanted to say that, that quote is 100% spot on. Very happy Nate is cancer free. Sure, skin cancer if caught early is pretty treatable n has high "cure" rates but hearing you have any type of cancer is a big deal. Again, glad he's free of it ♥️
I've had twelve skin cancers removed in the past three years. I should have never moved to Florida, should have stayed in R.I.
Man youre so strong Nate and handeling it like a man, that you just sat there while they cut youre head open. There is no freking way i coud do that, like i nearly have a panic atack when i got my covid shots ore getting a blod test. so i woud have to be compleatly knoked out to do it. So you shud be really proud of youre self, and to have the curige to stand up and tell youre story.  Hope you and Kare the best and for a spedy recovery.
Thank you for sharing this with us. So glad you’re healthy and healing.
Couldn't click fast enough to see this video. Thank God your ok Nate and you can continue on these amazing adventures.  God Bless and God Speed on all your future journeys.
I am so glad Nate's diagnosis was do good! Hoping the pain won't be too bad and it heals quickly. Also so don't blame you for keeping this news quiet up till now. It's ok to not share everything. Enjoy Canada!
Im so happy nate is now cleared and that he's doing so well now. Seriously it takes a lot to share something like this and im so proud of you nate. Keep kicking butt you two. Love watching yous every Sunday. 😍🥰
Praying for years of good health for you both.
No!!!!
thanks god you are ok😊
Hang in there kids. We got "yer" backs.  ;-)
I cried for you Nate, so glad that both of you are okay ! ❤ Since you guys are coming to Canada, I really recommend you guys to go see Abitibi-Témiscamingue in the province of Québec, its my favorite spot and the nature is amazing 😊👌.
Man.🙏🏽 as a Nashville native and a dreamer... I have been attached to you guys over the years. You are genuine inspirers for me. Many of us deal with personal things that no one knows about so thank you for your courage and strength in sharing this. Nate's dad's quote "Health is the crown of a well man only seen by the sick"... Wow. I loved that episode when he helped fix the van. It definitely felt like wisdom is in making time for family moments like that... especially when you're adventure-ing all over the world. 😁 I'm sending you amazing positive vibes & healing for 100 strong years! Kara loving on Nate when it could be scariest... Hit me. We all need that.🙏🏽
So proud of you!! And so proud of Kara for staying strong that whole time and not crying until she finally heard the good news at the end!! Sending love and light! ❤️
I had basal carcinoma a few years ago. I went through the same procedure where they cut it out and burned it and sewed it back up. It seems minor now but was a bit scary back then. Make sure to wear a hat and sunscreen though b/c this stuff comes back.
Bless you.  So happy for you both
Health is everything. Wish you to be always healthy and vital. Thank you for sharing your story!
Not what I expected this Sunday but I'm happy that you wanted to share this. I really wish you a speedy recovery and that there are no setbacks. You're vlogs have become a big and important part in many peoples life's, especially during the pandemic. You guys are really the best ❤️ Oh, and that talk with Kara in the van around 5 minutes in made this tough guy start sob for real. Had to pause for a while 😂
Even knowing that Nate is okay I still found myself tearing up throughout the video. You both are so caring and loving towards each other. I’ve been watching your videos for years and I found myself genuinely worried for Nate too. I’m so happy everything is okay!
Glad you are cancer free Nate and for sharing your story.
It will be alright..you are young and healthy and modern technology Can and Will take care of it..🙏❤️🎈
Thank you for sharing this!!  We don't think this can happen to us in our 20s, 30s, and 40s. Full body yearly scans at the dermatologist are so important! Glad you all had a good outcome!!
Thank you for sharing your story. Just keep strong God is good.
Wishing you good health. Make sure your smart phone is on speaker and keep it far from your head, also don't use wifi, go back to hard wired internet.
Thank you for sharing. Glad to hear Nate is Cancer free.
Grateful for you and your journey and continue to live your dream! God Bless You both 🙏 Prayers for continued comfort and safety on your amazing adventures!! God is Good 🙌
Dude, kudos. It takes a lot of strength to take something like this on the chin, and not totally flip out!  You guys are just amazing. Thick, thin, up, down, over-joyed or nearly crapping your pants, you're in it together. THAT is why everyone loves you, because you're Kara and Nate, and you dont hold back.  Speedy recovery to you (I did notice the noggin cap in the vids with KingingIt and Eamon and Bec), you'll be fine. Just maybe remember the Aussie advice; Slip-Slop-Slap; slip on a shirt, slop on some sunscreen and slap on a hat! Stay safe. 👍🏻
No Worries Nate a Couple Years ago they Fixed my Heart while I was Awake. Easy Peasy!!@
You and Kara are young and strong.  The two of you can be strong together.  I am so happy you have each other along with the community you can turn to.  Best wishes to you both.
I noticed the patch in your last video and I almost said something in the comments but I realized if you wanted to share what was going on you would so I just said a silent prayer. Thank you for sharing your life with us, good, bad and ugly. We are honored to be a part of your YouTube family. Blessings ❤️❤️❤️
Nice job you guys. You handled this really well. Thanks for sharing.
Love you two!
Thank you for sharing this. I may have to do something like this in the near future and it gave a sample of what it’s like so thanks
So stressful 😬 But you were such a champ! And with some of my own health issues I know how it feels being the youngest patient in the waiting area by 20+ years 🤕
So happy you have the all clear 😅❤️❤️
Thank you for being vulnerable & open about this. Personally I know how scary getting that diagnosis is, because I went through it in 2019-2020 & now I'm Cancer free. I'm glad you're cancer free & healthy. Don't forget to smother yourself in sunscreen guys. xx
It shocks people have the audacity to dislike the video, hope your okay and love your videos
My jaw dropped reading this in my YouTube home page. I’m glad it wasn’t worst then what I expect😭♥️
🤗❤🙏🏽
So happy you’re okay Nate!!! Great job staying strong Kara! It’s gotta be terrifying to think you’re losing your partner!  All the love!
Thank you for sharing ❤️ we curious about the band aid in the last video. So glad everything is okay ❤️ Ps Nate went hard with all those camera shots the morning before the procedure!
Thank you for sharing this. I'm glad Nate is cancer free. I'm going to get the spot on the top of my head checked out thanks to this video.
So happy to hear this news!!  Cancer has affected many of my family members so I know how scary it is, thank you for sharing. Here's to fun safe travels soon for you both, I look forward to your videos and have watched almost all of them. Thanks again for the laughs, tears, fears and crazy adventures you share you guys make my day!!
Man, I don't even know you guys and I got all emotional. Cannot even imagine how emotional this journey has been for you guys! Sending you light and good wishes from Minnesota. Let's not have that kind of 'adventure' again, okay?  :)   Be well, and safe travels!
I cried at this. So glad Nate is well & you guys can continue on your adventures. Be happy💚
Wow, I have diabetes not the same but everyone has their own struggles.
Such a good story teller thank you nate for even sharing, I wish you the best as always. Im happy it’s nothing life threatening and that you will be okay, plus atleast you know your getting sun while living the best life!
My Dad had basil cell skin cancer & was treated several times for it over the years.  He saw the dermatologist twice a year & always came home with dark spots on his face where he was zapped with liquid nitrogen.  He died last fall at 103 from natural causes. So glad you were persistent with getting it looked at, it is something that can be managed.
Thank you for sharing so others may learn from your experience. Praying this is all he goes through!
❤️
💕
My uncle just had his 4th skin cancer surgery for his ear. He lost his entire ear this time. Yes, please wear your sunscreen, and definitely don’t forget to put it on your ears!
Watching from the airport today!!! Travel day!!! Only domestic but we had a great trip! Hope that makes you smile and thank you for sharing your story, you can save lives by encouraging people to wear SPF and doing skin checks.
So now you know that you can get skin cancer... protect your skin from the sun. Good ball caps, sun block, etc... Not everyone gets it but once you do, you run the risk of always having them pop up. My father in law has farmed a lot of ground over the years and he drives truck... he has skin cancer. They use an acid of sorts on his face that removes skin and he has to keep his arms protected as much as possible. Nothing fatal but very inconvenient and painful to deal with at times... The price you pay for loving the outdoor life and that sun... Good luck to you both!
This is such a scary thing to have and I’m so proud of your vulnerability I’m so sorry to hear about this stay strong Nate!
Poor nate:(🥺🥺🥺
he is cancer free but you put he has skin caner? click bait like?
Cancer had effected our family for over 5 years, so when I heard this it really hit home for us. My dad has lost an arm because of cancer and now we are praying it won't come back.  I saw your bandage on the last video and was a bit worried.  We are.praying for you both. This will hopefully go fast and smoothly for you nate and Kara whos by your side. We are sending you so much love and light. 🙏💗
Thank you so much for sharing this with us! Take care both of you ❤️
My mom had lots of these in her 60s that had to be treated. She's now in her 90s. Seriously, not a worry if it's treated.
So glad to hear Nate is fine. Thank you so much educating your viewers in skin cancers too. At least one of them will pay more attention to new lesions on their skin.  Love and hugs to you both!!!
Thank you for sharing your story. I’m so relieved for you both. Nate, you are one strong dude. Keep fighting the good fight for us. You guys inspire us! 🏆
I am in my late 60s and for the last several years, I’ve been having skin cancer removed…gets scary
Thank God you're OK!  Thank you for sharing your story!
Long time viewer, first time commenter. I also found out I had cancer at age 26 and again at 28. Been cancer free ever sense (age 43 now). Sorry for your stress and anxiety in dealing with this. You both bring me joy in your videos. Thank you and its nice to see you both strong.
Get well soon and will pray for you. Glad that you are cancer free😊😊
Holy shit man, I got so scared seeing the notification
I had skin cancer on top of my head. The spot had been there for years. Never dawned on me that it could be cancer. They cut it off but had to free a decent amount of my scalp to be able to close the wound. It was very painful for a long time, which surprised me. So I know at least a little what you’ve gone through. Prayers being sent your way!
Man that was so scary but eye-opening as well you two are stronger than you know. Take care you two. So glad that this cancer thing is over. Can't wait to see you guys on your next adventure.
Hey Nate, you seemed really strong and positive in situations such like these, im really proud of u and im wishing you two all the best in the future <3
Y’all handled the sharing of this deeply personal information with so much class and maturity. Thank you for being who you are. Prayers for continued health and wellness.
I'm glad everything worked out. You guys are amazing 👏. Can't wait to see what you do in Canada.  Ps Alberta is the beat 😄
Sending your my love and healing thoughts!  What a scary experience.  My two cents worth… make sure you allow your body time to rest.  I worry about how little sleep you all get on these overnight adventures.  You both are loved by many people.
SuperGoop makes a fantastic face sunscreen.  It even blurs everything on your face and it will make you camera ready.  And there are so many great sunscreen sprays.  Take care of yourselves! We need you!
My heart sank when I read this, but I felt better after watching your video! Kara, you need to watch out as well, be safe you two!!! 🧡
“Looking for words to do word things” is an accurate description of the shock/surprise/fear/timidity that surrounds a diagnosis like this. Thank you for sharing your story; hoping it leads to less work for skin cancer specialists world-wide! It’s really special that you share your vulnerable moments with us. Thank you for being so honest and open.
My mum & sister have had lots of BCC removed. Out of skin cancers they're the best. So glad you have shared as hopefully it will make others to get things checked.
Skin cancer is not a joke. Working in a pathology lab has taught me that people usually wait way too long to go get something suspicious checked out by a clinician. So, don’t wait around.
I had you guys are heading to British Columbia, such an amazingly beautiful place and I could visit it through your videos for now🤞
I had a basal cell carcinoma on my cheek when I was 27. I had to have a second bit taken out that day and was thankful for Valium lol.   I’m so so thankful for MOHS, especially for my face. Years ago they would be likely have removed more tissue and had less than idea cosmetic results. Being able to see in real time that they have clear margins and knowing which direction and depth to continue to remove is a medical miracle. My surgeon was amazing and even with 1+ inch of stitches, no one can even tell it was there now. 🙌🏻    If you have anxiety before your annual visits for a little while it’s totally normal but still so important to go. Thank you for sharing your story! ❤️
Hang in their guys! I went through  my health scares in 2020.. Don’t let fear and doubt consume you stay strong .listen to your docs and be faithful .. I’ll be 🙏 4 u all !!
Lost my mom to cancer, and a friend to skin cancer that he just didn't want to deal with. Thank you, thank you, thank you for sharing this to remind all of us to deal with this stuff, to do the hard things that scare us. I'm so glad you're well now!!!
I'm happy to hear all is well.  Thank you for sharing.  People need to be reminded to check their skin regularly, especially their heads.  I had a basal cell on my shoulder that was found by a wonderful Dermatologist on a skin check appointment, so kind of know what you went through.  I had no symptoms, no itching, nothing but she found it and I'm thankful.
So proud of you for putting yourself out like that❤️
God bless you both
It's ok Nate I had a growing mole on my left leg when I was 6. I had to experience the same thing and it was surgically removed. Still got the scar till today.
Glad to hear the good news! Wear a hat my friend, wear a hat.
I just had the same surgery but on my face last month.  Glad they caught it in time. Feel better!
Thank you for sharing your struggles, your victories, and your journeys!  🙏
I was told that I have two types of skin cancer on my arm and back these were found during my yearly body scan. Dr has scheduled surgery for October 12 . Keeping my fingers crossed that she gets it all 🙏
Glad to hear you are ok.  Recover and live well!
God bless you both , I don't know you guys personally , and i never realised how much i am attached to you people , this video makes me realise this,,, lots of love 👍😊🦄
Thank you so much for sharing. This is so important for people to realize that if you’re suspicious about a spot - GET IT CHECKED. I’m sitting here crying while watching this because I feel like Kara & Nate are my friends 🥺🥺😅
Hearing the quote from Nate's grampa:  "Good health, is a crown on a well man's head, that only the sick can see".   Man, I am so reminded NOT to take my health for granted, and thanks Nate and Kara for this reminder that sunscreen is NO JOKE! ✌️❤️😀-Stephanie (small town gal in NH)
Take care man ! Love the travels you two do.
Don't know what to say except I'm glad you're OK now!
Been watching since the start myself,,good to see you are on the mend Nate,, peace and happiness
It’s the LOVE  Kara has for Nate . You can actually feel it through the phone.. it’s an angel love .. she so caring and sweet and a very nice person … Nate Kara HEAVEN SENT!! So glad you are cancer free …
Thank you for sharing your journey ❤️
Thankful to God that all is well.  May God put his healing power all over your body.  Be safe and stay well.
More Power to you, more strength to you!!  More strength from Nepal
Glad you posted this for public awareness! Basal cell rarely rarely spreads, and it's extremely curable/treatable by removing it. BUT, there are definitely cases of basal cell spreading throughout the body in people who let it go for years and years without getting medical help, in which case it can then be fatal. Also even if it doesn't spread, it can burrow really deep and leave you with very severe facial disfigurement when they go to remove the whole thing. This is why you should always see a doctor for any skin lesions that aren't healing, or moles that are irregular in shape, color, symmetry, or getting larger.
🙏🏼👍🏼
Have a  swift recovery Nate!
I had basal cell in my arm.  It wasn't as bad as yours.  They just razored it off.  I went home and told my roommate "I'm a cancer survivor!!!" She didn't think I was that funny since she had leukemia twice and ended up having a bone marrow transfer (she's 8 years cancer free now) but I thought I was pretty damn funny.   Glad your okay Nate. The stress of waiting is the worst!
Im sending prayers im so so so sorry that you have to go thu this.
I feel that anxiety of waiting for results.  Ugh. The worst! Mine came back as a melanoma that had gone to 3 of my lymph nodes.  I am 3 years cancer free, but every 4 months, I am waiting for those test results.    So very very happy that everything worked out---palpable relief for you both.  Enjoy life as you always do!!  Thanks for sharing your story. :-)
You guys have become family. And trust me this got me crying. So glad nate's okay. You guys deserve all the love in the world.  Love you
Are we going to just forget the fact that he didn’t brush his teeth or wash his face ? But I’m so proud of you Nate good job I hope you get better ❤️‍🩹 sending all my prayers ✨
Its very shocking news for me.My Allah may give you good health.Love from Pakistan
When cancer is first mentioned, fear, panic, and anxiety are hard emotions to ignore where they're all turned up to eleven.  Glad to hear everything's ok. ❤️ Travel on!
I just went through the same procedure on my face. This is the second time in 8 yrs. GO TO THE DERMATOLOGIST AND GET A YEARLY CANCER SCAN!!!!!
Thank you for sharing Nate. This was a great message. My brother has battled skin cancer for the last several years. Keep wearing your sunscreen. Prayers and blessings for both of you❤️🙏
Better help- FYI- does not accept Medicare.
"have"? what wont u do for free clicks?
This video brought back the time I was with my best friend when he was informed he had testicular cancer. Saying I’m glad you’re doing better is an understatement. Be safe & enjoy your travels to Canada my friend.
I'm so happy to hear you're fine 🙏 and so proud of you for sharing your story ❤. All the best to you guys and stay safe
I had melanoma when I was 16. Something that stays with you forever. Wear SPF people! Tanning is not worth risking your life for and besides that it gives you ugly wrinkles as you get older😉
❤❤❤
This scared me watching it but I’m so happy everything’s ok 🥺❤️
Ysy that fantastic always use 30 plus sun screen in southern hemisphere
I’m praying for all the best for you, Nate.  🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I always thought how fortunate you were to be traveling and never have any issues that we saw. Like having to go to hospital or doctor. So glad Nate is ok.
As a multiple melanoma survivor I appreciate you sharing this! Most people let skin issues just go and say, oh it’s a scab or pimple. It’s so important to raise awareness and share stories like this!  Keep up with your Derm appointments!!
Thanks Nate for sharing this with the public and so glad to hear your cancer free.  Have fun on your trips!!
Happy to hear you're cancer free now. But, I think you're not being honest with the video title because you had it removed.
My brother (similarly aged to you) had a birthmark on the area just behind his temple and his hair line from when he was an infant. A few years back, around graduation from college age, it started scabbing just like yours did. Would bleed and scab, repeat. His turned out to be two types of skin cancer. Basal cell, like yours, and squamous cell. He had the same procedure you had. He sees his dermatologist regularly and has not had any other issues since.
I’m glad you’re ok Nate. You guys stay healthy and safe.
Thanks for sharing guys. God bless you both 😊❤️🙏
So happy for you guys! Cancer is the worst but I am so proud of you and how strong you are! Sending all the love from a cold Sweden!
This was so scary! I was in market when I received the notification "I have cancer" untill I reached home I was so scared and worried and sad at the same time, I don't know you guys in person but you guys are like a family to me. After watching the full thing I am relaxed. Lots of love and good vibes to you guys. Stay healthy!!
Take a deep breath Nate, it'll be okay! <3
Oh wow! Glad Nate is better now.
Hope he is okay
Watching this video made me feel grateful. I’m so happy for you Nate. Gratitude 🙏🏾
Thank you for finally letting us know that something has been going on behind the scenes. I understand why you did it. I am so relieved that they removed the cancer and I will continually pray for your health. Kara I will also pray for you because I know the love you have for Nate is unending and you have been through the wringers so to speak. God bless you both.
So glad it all turned out ok! My dad was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2017 and then had a spot of basal skin cancer found in 2018. So far still cancer free on both now! But needless to say my mom in 2019 was like “can we go one year without any cancer please” 😂
I am really happy for you that you are alright bro I was about to cry when I started the video I just started watching you guys a week ago but now I am connected like I know you guys since my childhood . I will pray for you buddy . Love from India.
Glad you're okay bro!
This was so Scary!  I cried !! Im so happy that you are cancer free . Y'all are always in my thoughts and prayers
That might have been the most effective advice ever when Kara says to wear sunscreen and not forget the ears as they cut them off all the time... Yikes!
Glad to hear it was benign. My mom was diagnosed with basal cell carcinomas on her face and other parts of her body a few years ago. She’s had a couple surgeries with a cosmetic surgeon to remove the really concerning areas in her face. Mostly she just has regular checkups with a dermatologist to check for any new areas or get some kind of like chemical swab of her face. It’s like ongoing maintenance. So def familiar with this kind. Hopefully you won’t have to worry about it after this surgery, and know what to look out for in future ❤️ Best wishes to both of you!
So glad you’re ok.
I know  October is breast cancer awareness month, but in general I’m so happy and glad you’ve made a healthy recovery. Y’all always put a smile on my face and I hope both of you all the best!
hope everything stays away 🙏
Couldn’t press ‘like’ on a title like that without commenting. Thank you for sharing your story and using your platform to spread sun safety awareness.  Love that you included the frustrating admin part of struggling to find the right extension number. Love your content, which is a wonderful mix of glossy highlights and gritty reality.  Glad to hear that Nate has the all clear.
I’m not crying you’re crying….
Oh my gosh Nate I’m so sorry you had to though all that🙁 I hope you have a fast heal😘
People really be doing to much for views
Wow. A great reminder that we need to take care of ourselves. Everyone please wear sunscreen it's so important. I am glad you're cancer-free Nate. Not only a sick person can see the crown but anyone who has seen their love ones sick. We can't take anything for granted. So love your love ones and tell them you love them.
No worries buddy.. I had to shallow melanoma removed at 71 y.o. so enjoy your lives together. We will pray for the 2 of you.
I hated to give a thumbs up for this video but it DID turn out to be positive. Blessings to you both.
I want to thank you for the love you have for all of us, your kindness that you show us by being joyful and humble while sharing your lives. I thank God you are alright. Prayers for you both
Thank you for sharing! You guys are amazing, just goes to show, you never know what’s going on in someone’s life so always be kind and loving to one another❤️ praying xo
Love to see the real side of things and I saw the bandage in the last video cause I stopped and backed up a few times. Just didn't want to ask what happned.
So glad that you are well and sorted. You are lucky to have a supportive wife so you didn't have to go through this alone. Happy for a positive outcome.
My mom had a spot on her scalp that ended up as stage one melanoma. Her hair stylist noticed it and then noticed it had grown at her next appt. Thankfully they got it all, but it put us all on high alert for getting checked, wearing sunscreen and hats. So glad you’re ok and got it taken care of. Your experience was important to share!
I've been watching you guys for like more than a year now, this video for sure made me tad emotional. This video also made me realize on how emotionally and personally invested I'm in you guys. You guys are too sweet and real to be true! You both deserve the best of everything in the world for being 'yourselves' for us! Also, grateful for everything you guys do, you guys are surely a blessing to this world. Love from, INDIA❤❤❤❤
Sending you both love and light. I was diagnosed with endometrial cancer earlier this year, so I know how rough waiting for results can be.
So glad everything came out great for you. It was just a bump in the road for you guys, but look forward to your next adventures after you heal up! 🍷 cheers to being cancer free and to good health!
I am 19 and have had two different surgeries on my arm because of basil cells. You are not the youngest person! Make sure to wear your sunscreen and go to the dermatologist at least once a year to get a full-body exam!!!
Basal cell is very common and usually treatable. Wear a hat and sunscreen.
So strong both of you ❤️ Praying for you two to remain healthy and happy forever. Love from India 🇮🇳
My grandfather has had about a dozen basal cell skin cancers removed over his lifetime - he turned 97 this year. Apparently it's the "best" kind. His experience has my dad wearing good UV filtering hats outside and he's been able to avoid the same issues so far. Hair isn't very good protection unless you have Kara levels.
Our thoughts and prayers are definitely with you. You are brave and a good person to share this expérience with people. Be strong and it is so nice to have a partner like Kara to go through god things and not so good things in life!
I saw the title and started crying. Glad to hear that Nate is cancer-free. All my best wishes to you
Mate your very lucky to have a wonderful woman by your side wishing you guys all the best and healthy life.
essiac tea, cbd oil, B17, these 3 are  good start .
Woo hoo....champagne time!!!
Wow. Prayers to both of y’all. Your strong and resilient 💜
Nate… thank you for sharing such a deep personal issue and so happy you’re on the other side of this.  Goes to show, this life is truly worth living… and from the two people that squeeze every ounce out of it, this is absolutely inspiring.
We all had no idea but I’m so glad your cancer free and I will always were suncream ❤️❤️ Love your channel
We are so glad so know that it was not melanoma cancer - we hope you are okay both physically and mentally ♥
Congratulations I am really happy that you're going to be okay
GOOD LUCK MAY COME BACK KEEP CHECKING .  UNCEL MOUTH WENT  AND CAME BACK SO HAPPY  GUYS LOVE SHOWNS XX
All those travelling locally and internationally, and not taking care of yourself has caught up to Nate. All the best and remember health is very important to all of us, so you should take care of it.
Thank God you are okay now. That's the only thing I could say. Please be safe both of you. Wear and reapply sunscreen all the time, esp. since you guys are out in the open all the time :"
We love you guys and we are praying for you. Thank you for your bravery in sharing this very personal part of your story. 🙌🏻
Thank you for sharing your story. Best wishes on feeling better quickly!
The way Kara and Nate connect with their viewers is mind-blowing. It is so great and refreshing to see such real and inspiring stuff. Wish you great health and happiness!!
Sorry you're going through this guys. Sending love ♡
you guys made me tear up! So glad Nate is well :) keep it up
Fight on friend.
So glad you are ok!!!!
watching this made me have anxiety for you both, Nate you’re so strong! Thank you for sharing this part of your life. I am now going to buy some sunscreen! Much love to you both🥰😇
So glad you are cancer free! 🥲
Best thing in this whole ordeal...is the support you had one on one from Kate⚘⚘⚘ This is a lifeline that can get anyone with any illness even terminal , to have a better day each day  One who has no more support, will be in severe pain & agony with mild illness let aside a diagnosis of cancer per se..they won't even enjoy a million dollar lottery Support from caring & loving one is life
I'm so glad that you are ok.  Cancer, even the non-life threatening variety, is a scary diagnosis.  Thank you for sharing your story.  I will always wear sunscreen.
I remember watching your 144 hours on a canoe video and being really worried about the UV reflection from the water and wondering whether you both have enough sunscreen on. Please take care of yourselves and stay safe.
Today I had my whole family sit down and watch your ragbrai video during lunch. I've been following y'all since so long and I love every single video you put out there. You guys are the reason I try to challenge myself too and doing things out of my comfort zone. So when i saw the title, I was taken aback. I can only imagine what you both went through while also regularly putting content out for us. I'm so happy that Nate is cancer free and the whole situation is behind you. STAY SAFEE AND TAKE CARE OF YOUR HEALTH GUYS! WE ARE ROOTING FOR YOU BOTH! LOVE YOU<3  PS: Kara, kudos to you for being the best support system everrr:)
Can you visit Saskatoon Saskatchewan I live there and I want to see if you like it because I hate it
Sending love and light your way. Thank you for sharing the good bad and ugly in life 💙💙💙
No word buddies . I pray God bless you guys with better health
Aw. The smiles while you’re eating lunch were the best. Second best part is when Kara silently  described how big the chunk of flesh from Nate’s head was.
Ahh im so happy that your cancer free!
You two are incredible! Thank you for being this vulnerable and sharing this part of your journey.  God is good and He’s got Nate tucked just perfectly under his wing. 🤍
Norm Macdonald had cancer for 9 years and never told anyone not even his family. Too bad you didn't follow his example.
Glad you're ok, Nate! That stuff can be scary. I had a lump on my scalp that had to be removed, pins and needles waiting for the results. No cancer, but it gets scary. Thank you for sharing. And ears! I never thought about that. Thanks for the reminder Kara, now I'll be sure to protect my ears when I go hiking.
Bill Maher riiffed on van life and rv  life, but he didn't mention how you guys know about and respect batteries, inverters solar power, and sophisticated electric wiring etc.  Bill is alright, he is the last of the rebels in comedy but he needs to see this video.
❤️❤️❤️
This 12:34 is hell of an UP & DOWN...
Wish you from the bottom of my heart good health and long life to live.
Glad it all worked out Nate. I can’t feel your pain but I do know your worries.  My wife has gone through it several times due to sun bathing at a young age.  Next step Canada, hope to see you on Eamon and Bec soon
I am glad that you are cancer free Nate. Unfortunately me and my fiance Akash are in a similar boat. But for him he is still fighting it. And for us financially it is becoming a lot difficult. Have spent all of our savings on his treatment, and surviving on just my income is getting really hard. I wish we find some support soon. Take care Nate. Hope you get well soon. ❤️
WOW that is not an easy story to experience or share publicly.  As soon as they mention the C word it really hits home.  We are SO pleased to hear that Nate you are ok - and big hugs to Kara for trying to put on a brave face for you - very stressful - thanks you for sharing and it's a lesson for all of us not to take our health for granted - Big hugs - Chris & Marianne xx
Thank you for being vulnerable and sharing your story. 💙 Happy to hear Nate is now cancer free!!  Wishing Nate a speedy recovery 🙏
Omg guys you scared me to death! I am so so glad that everything is fine. I wish you both the best and  I hope theese kinda of situations never occur in your lives again. Lots of love from Romania❤️❤️
I wish you all the best!!
You guys are so strong. Thank you for sharing this. We can’t take any day for granted. I love you guys 💜💜💜
Kara handled that like a G. I was expecting full-break down(Nate too), but she chose to be strong for her man so he wouldn't panic too. Much respect.
Thank you so much for sharing about skin cancer because my Grandpa had this also.✌️#davesandersstepdaughter
Please take care
Thanks for keeping your life adventures real. God Bless for the great news. Keep up the great content!!!
I’m over the moon your cancer free!  Unfortunately I lost my dad in July 2020 to lung cancer and my best friend is battling womb cancer.  Sending all the love, health and safe travels to you.  Xxxx
I'm so thankful you're okay.  The title literally took my breath away.  Thank you for being so vulnerable and open enough to share such a deeply personal and scary thing. I know I don't know you irl but I feel like I do. We have interacted in ur patreon group b4 and I feel a deeper understanding of the kind of people you both are. And im blessed to be able to watch your incredible journey through an amazing life. I'm a lot more emotional than I probably should be but you both have entered my heart and I'm just extremely happy that you are okay Nate. And Kara you were so strong for him. I kept watching your face to see if you were truly ok because I knew as a wife of 30 years to my love that you would not crack. That you were going to be the calm he needed in this storm. And you were amazing.  God has truly held you both in His loving arms.  I am sending prayers and love for your continued healing and great health. And I truly mean this when I say I love you both! ❤
Canada?!  That's where I live!  I hope you pop in and say hi... ;)
My surgeon said to me “The B word is what you want to hear when someone mentions the C word!”  The cure for it is to remove it!  I had a Basal cell removed 25 years ago and life has been great ever since!  Have a happy 90th birthday when the time comes!!!!!
Nates Grandpa is right. I'm OG Not OG OG but loong time subscriber. I went on your adventures w/you bc I can't travel too far bc of health. Now I have terminal cancer and hearing Nate had skin cancer was very scary. I'm thrilled cancer doesn't get a new warrior today!!! Never ever take good health for granted. If you have a roof, some food, clean water and good health you have the world.
i am happy that it didnt turn into something bad and thanks for sharing you guys!!!!!
Thank you for sharing this. We often do get to see only the glamorous side of things...even the hydrant showers are glamorous to us lol. Thank you for showing us we are not alone. My sister was diagnosed with breast cancer this week...she just fought cervical cancer earlier this year and won so I know shes go to beat this too. We are praying for you guys. ❤❤❤
I'm so glad Nate is okay. I live near Lebanon Tennessee and need to find a dermatologist for me and my red-headed boyfriend. We both get sunburned so easily and he gets sunburned quite often. I'm especially worried that about his nose. If anybody reads this and has a recommendation for a good skin doctor on the east side of Nashville please let me know.
So proud of you guys for sharing this !!! Thank you. It is so important to get things checked out when you don’t know ! I just love you guys and am so thankful Nate is okay and thankful for you guys sharing something like this !!! 🖤🖤🖤
Woke up to this video and news that my cousin had passed away from cervical cancer. I’m so glad that you were proactive and got it taken care of. Please monitor yourself and know how much awareness to this issue you have brought by just doing this one video. God bless
Stay safe!
I think I held my breath for like 10 seconds when I saw the title of this video…  I’m so glad to hear that you’re all good now, you scared the shit out of me. And props for Kara for staying strong ❤️
I've been an OG sub and have been watching you guys ever since and I've never missed a video. Thanks for sharing this with us. I wish you guys nothing but great things to come. ♥️♥️♥️
Glad your doing well but did I hear you say you’re coming to Canada!?
Glad you're okay!!!
I hope you get well soon and you have the right attitude by staying positive. I had a kidney transplant 22 years ago. What I have learned was not to take life for granted and try to experience as much of this beautiful world 🌎 as we can. You guys are already doing an amazing job of that.
So many young people get cancer and I think at times that is no showcased enough.  You are awesome.  Cannot wait to see the Canada vlog.
Thanks for sharing.  Easy to feel invulnerable when you are young.  I will be more careful from now on.
Thank you so much for sharing. So often the “younger” generations feel like “It won’t happen to me!” It is so preventable. We brush our teeth every day, why is it so hard to take a few minutes to put on sunscreen every day? So good to hear they got it all and that Nate will be fine! 😊
I've had five Mohs surgeries. Luckily all were benign. Glad to here about yours.
Nate you took it like a man!
So glad you are ok!!!
From one surviver to another well done.  Make sure you talk about how you feel as it can hit you up to a year or so later how close you came to it being worse, proud of you both xx
Respect your courage, Nate and Kara. May our Almighty God n Merciful Lord Jesus bless you to be fully healed from the skin cancer amd keep on living a blessed and Joyful life in Jesus name 🙏🏻. ❤️❤️
❤️❤️
So glad you are OK Nate!  The title gave me goosebumps, but so glad you are now cancer free!  NEVER STOP YOUR ADVENTURES!
Very glad you are okay. Skin Cancer runs in my hubby's family. We use SPFs higher than 60 and reapply is the key.
will be praying for you Nate  and of course Kara too!!
Oh wow, that's so scary. It makes me so happy that the cancer is gone. This shows to never take anything for granted as you never know what will happen next. God bless you all
Thanks for the comment saying he’s ok but I was in shock when I read the title
My heart stopped for like 5 seconds when I saw the title! I’m so glad that you are all clear and healthy. Sending best wishes and good vibes to you both. Xx
very glad to hear that Nate is free of Basal cell carcinoma.. very often we take our health for granted. I didn't press the like button because of the video's title..
Thanks a lot for sharing! I lost my mom to cancer in 2015. And then I lost my grandpa in 2016 to cancer. I know how scary it is to have health issues. But I survived 3 open heart surgeries! One pacemaker later and I’m still kicking. But god do I wish I was born healthy! But now I’m fine with what is wrong with me! Because it makes me different! And I love being different, I also survived 2 strokes! Sure there’s pain. But what in life does not come with pain?
Thank you guys for not keeping us in suspense and not describing the symptoms in detail. I was thinking of just not watching and leaving well wishes in the comments instead, because I have struggled with health anxiety and when I hear about a disease of some kind and someone talks about how they came to find out they had it, I start thinking I might have it as well. I was able to keep my anxiety down just when Nate talked about an infected hair follicle which I have had once before on my body, but I know it's because of grooming, not disease. Really glad to hear Nate is all clear and wishing you both happy onward travels!
I love you guys. Really.
to me it is incredible that you two still managed to keep your smiles on during the last few months videos while this was happening in the background of your life. That is true strength. I'm really grateful all is well now!
I FLIP FLOPPING LOVE YOU TWO SO MUCH. I have any been watching for a few months buuuttt... ive watched all your videos. im so happy everyone is back in good health <333 sending good vibes your way
Congratulations! I had a melanoma removed from my arm last year and it's very stressful. I'm glad your answer was as good as mine!
The worst things happen to the best people sometimes. Glad you’re on the mend!
I've had basil cell carcinoma removed twice now and while it is not pleasant it is far better than the alternative, or getting a more serious diagnosis. I urge everyone to get checked every year.
Praise the Lord  y'all received good news!  Thank you for sharing your heart with us about this and the good news you received!  Your followers love y'all on the camera and behind the scenes so thank you both for being real! We appreciate real! I will pray for you that it never comes back! My heart dropped when you first started the video but so very glad you had it taken care of!! Love and blessings to you both!❤❤
God and everyone's blessings is always with good people that you both are. Lots of best wishes and love. 💓
I relate to the sequence of you trying to call the doctors office back SO much. As someone with multiple chronic illnesses, I swear this is a weekly thing, and it’s just as frustrating each and every time. I’ve also been awake for surgeries (including a port placement), and it is totally terrifying each any every time. I also don’t respond very well to lidocaine (the medication they use to numb the area), so it’s also always quite painful.   I’m hoping you have a fast recovery and will be sending good thoughts your way! 💕
Just a little reminder for everyone with a part in their hair—don’t forget to put sunscreen there either!!
It's the second video I watch about skin cancer and I must say, I'm a little worried... I wan to get checked, but I'm scared, I feel like it's more common than we think and I feel like I could have it ... 😰   Still, I'm so glad he's Ok ! All the love and support for both of you ❤️
Glad kara said the part at the end.. doesn’t look like she wears sunscreen very often, hopefully this will change that
So glad he’s ok get better nate
My heart skipped a beat when I saw the title, but I read your pinned comment and I was so happy. I’d seen “the spot” on the back of Nate’s head during the last video and was curious as to what it was. Now it makes sense. I’m so glad you’re okay, Nate! Sending love from the Bay Area!
......
Reading this title literally broke my heart 🥺🥺 Thank you God for healing
So glad this worked out for you! I had the same thing when I was 20 and it is STRESSFUL and scary, regardless of how “not serious” it is. Gotta love the free face lift 😉 Keep up the awesomely positive channel, love you both so much!
I’m so glad that he is ok
Praying everything works out great for Nate and y’all continue finding health and happiness in abundance!!
Omg I am saying my prayers to u
Thank God you’re OK
I’m so sorry, Nate. I’m sending support and wishes for a full and fast recovery. 💗 🖖🏽
Best wishes.
i Am glad nate is ok
Get well soon Nate 🌹🌹
Happy there's a good ending. Just discovered you two about three weeks ago. Great content. Good Bless you both.
So glad you went back to the doctor and had it looked at again. It could've been worse if you had waited, more proof you should listen to your wife. Lol. Praying for continued good health for you both! Thank you for sharing your story with us! You could've just helped someone else who isn't sure if they should go to the doctor or not about a place on their skin.
So glad you shared this! Thank you for taking the step in making this public knowledge and I hope you feel lots of love and support! 🥰🥰
Good job Nate!  Thank you for sharing this.  It's very important for EVERYONE to stay alert of any type of mole, lesion, scab etc. that won't heal.  I had the same type of experience on my left arm, thankfully it was not skin cancer but whew!  The emotions you go through.  Both of you are very brave and thank heavens you are clear.  Stay Safe!!!!
i am so happy that you are ok from the skin cancer :)
Hope Nate is doing well.
Hope you guys the best, hope Nate a speedy recovery
Nate, I thank God you are healed!
So glad that everything turned out ok Nate.
Smooth recovery Nate  virtual hug to you both . Thank you for sharing ,you be suprised how many ignore  A plek on there body, thinking its Nothing . Yes sun protection  spf 50 at all times.  Plus a hat  (😅kara chop your ears off )  Take care 🥰
Hi there, I had a Basel cell carcinoma on my nose…..unbelievable……I had it removed but unfortunately it did come back about two years later almost at the same spot……I had it removed again…..and up until now it hasn’t come back thank God …….that was in 2014…..
Proud of you guys...really inspiring how you coped up with it !
This made me much more emotional then I thought it would have. You guys are great! And your explanation about what is put on social media vs behind the scenes was so honest and real. You guys are the real deal. Hoping for a speedy recovery.
Aww sweet Nate. I’m so glad everything is working out. You two are so lovely. Keep your heads up.
Wow it is so good to show videos like this... Totally agree with what Nate said at the beginning. Well done Kara! as a wife you definitely stayed strong for a while.
I'm crying 😭 i remembered my dad and his story with cancer 6 years of suffering and he did past away Allah yr7amou
I was fearful thats what the bandage was in the last video. I’m so happy he’s cancer free! Much much love and wishing y’all an amazing holiday season ❤️
LMFAO
Thanks for sharing this part of your life, I'm sure this was a difficult choice to make. I appreciate you guys being vulnerable to people on the internet and I love you for this!  Sending you guys much love from London
Glad to hear you’re ok Nate!
So happy you are cancer free. Safe travels.
My barber who is in his 70's and is light skinned and red headed, goes to the dermatologist once a month to have skin cancers removed.  They've removed parts of his ears, nose, etc and all of this is from not protecting his skin when he was young.  He's now paying the price.  Please protect your skin NOW, because if you don't you'll likely pay for it later.
So happy Nate received the care he needed and that the outlook is so good. Though I've never even met you, I feel like you're part of our family and I don't want you to be unwell! Take care of each other.
I just had my 7th basal cell carcinoma removed.  This time from my forehead and it was horrible. The anesthetic shots weren’t working right and it was excruciating.  They didn’t sew it up because I couldn’t take the pain.   Also, because they injected so much to try to numb it my eyes have swollen up and are bruised.  Never had it happen before.  I hope you feel better soon. I know how much it hurts. ❤️ wear your hat and sunscreen!!
My husband hates needles as well.  I appreciate you sharing this because you share so much too us and we are so invested. Sometimes it's nice to have everyone "with" you on something like this! Hugs from ND.
You guys are literally so strong I was so scared when I saw the title but I’m happy for the good news
it so  emotional seeing this Nate so glad your cancer free and Kara so strong and comforting . My Father passed away from cancer in 2010 only 59 so i feel a connection I'm so happy for you two safe travels
So good to hear the good report on Nate🤕Nate👍you tackle things that come your way with a positive outlook🙃 🙏for you both - continue to enjoy life as it comes😊
So, you don't have skin cancer??? Reading the Title, I'm confused.
Thank you for sharing Nate.  I've had MOHS twice and 2 Melanoma of scalp surgeries.  No fun for sure, but certainly pays to have your Dermatologist skin check on regular basis.  UPF 50+ clothing & Sun Block have allowed me to spend time outdoors in the sun. Love your videos!
OMG🙏...NATE....SOOO HAPPY THAT THE CANCER IS BETTER...I WAS VERRRY Worried 4 U @ 1ST....NOW U & KARA CAN GET BACK TO ADVNTURES!..GOOD LUCK & GOD BLESS YOU BOTH!💯👌🥰
I started watching your videos last year, and honestly think you both are two of the most positive people I have ever seen in my life.   I saw the word cancer, and my eyes welled up. I lost my mom 10 years ago to Leukemia, so whenever I hear or read about cancer, well, lets just say that its a scary thing.   I'm so glad to read and see that everything turned out okay, and I wish both of you and your families all the health in the world. It might be weird coming from a stranger, but I can't imagine not having either of you around and not being able to share your adventures from my sofa.  Thank you so much for sharing a part of your lives with strangers and I wish you awesome health and very very long lives
Puh, sorry for you going through this emotional turmoil! The diagnose cancer is always a scary thing. It does not matter if it's a non leathal kind or the horrible ones cutting live short in multiple ways. Just happy that the growth is out and you are aware for what to look for!
Stay strong brother Nate❤️ Love from Sri Lanka 🇱🇰
The best wishes and recovery ❤️❤️❤️
Mohs surgery is actually a little bit of a big deal, so glad that the margins are clear and they got it all.
Hey Kara and Nate.  My husband and I just went thru this starting 2020 and is in remission but still has regular visits twice a year...They did so many surgerys on his head but never gave him one of those big brown banages...They just used regular bandage.  Did not require any Chemo or Radiation.   Put vaseline on your wound to inhance healing.  Prayers for you both.   Danny and Jackie Rhodes.
I am so sorry that happened to you. I'm sooo glad your ok. As soon as I woke up today I saw the notification on my phone and I immediately started watching it. I was super worried. You guys are my heroes and I want to be like you when I'm adult.Please read this comment and reply. It would mean alot to me.
You two have become friends and I'm so thankful you're ok! God bless!
Oh Nate I just wanted to hug you both this whole episode. So glad things turned out ok. Lots of love. ❤️
Thank God that he is okay now . I will pray to God to heal you and protect you at all times
I from time to time get these blood vessel's on my body and go to dermatologist and the results thank g/d I keep on getting is benign
THIS SCARED ME I AM SO HAPPY HES OK 🥺
You guys….just when I felt like I was drowning in social media fake reality, you did this video and showed me how you can use social for good. Thank you both. And get healed fast, Nate!
Welcome to Canada. Enjoy you stay where ever you are.
Thank you for sharing this personal matter. Glad for the happy ending. Take care both of you.
You know what??? I saw a patch on Nate's head in the last video and just thought "maybe he hurt his head working out". Glad he's okay. Thanks for sharing your experience. P.S. That quote about health being a crown that only the sick can see... 🔥🔥🔥
Yup, Most people dont know the danger for the Sun. Wear sunscreen and stay in the shade if you can.
That explains the bandage last week. I'm so sorry you had to deal with that and that it took so long to get sorted. SPF 50 and sun hats! Your so brave to share and I'm so happy your ok!! ❤️❤️❤️🤗🤗🤗
Och, Jesus !! I thought you two were too cheerfull before, what are you going to be like now ? 🤣👅 Really glad it turned out to be nothing in the end. Best wishes to you both.
Nate, wishing you a speedy recovery
I just wanted to come on and say THANK YOU!   I’ve had an interesting summer that all started a with a tree branch falling on me. That proceed to a thumb fracture and the ligaments in that thumb needing surgical repair. So…..I guess I’m full of rare cases as having all round ligament tears in the thumb is supposedly fairly uncommon. After the outpatient surgery, I was placed on the icu floor for a day and night as I had tachycardia which isn’t that unusual post surgery. The one that I had however, had last way longer and I’ve just been diagnosed with POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome) that was related from the anesthesia they had used. Guessing it was some sort of extreme allergic reaction or something. But now they don’t know how long that will take to get better since being 6 week post op and I’m only seeing very minimal better changes. Now to add on to that the good part is that my thumb is now moving! But the bad part is the thumb has very limited motion and the doctor is in her words worried about how limited the motion is so now it’s a waiting game until further testing is done.   So after saying all that, I’m not trying to look for any pity or whatever but I just wanted to say a huge THANK YOU to Nate for sharing. This has really made me feel like I’m not alone in the experiencing weird medical phenomenon. It’s just really awesome that you feel that this is something that you can share publically.   Ps. Might be a great decision to not be under a tree! Tree accidents occur more than you think! And yes! Always wear sunscreen!   Again, thank you Nate!!!
I said the same thing about being the youngest in the office. MOHS is awesome. I too had BCC this year except mine was on my forehead.. and now I look like Harry Potter! Ha. Wishing quick recovery! And don't worry too much, the pain and numbness gets better over time. ☺️
I’m so glad to hear that it’s not life-threatening! Godspeed in your recovery!
Actually the SPF is not recommended since the Sun has been around for millions of years. Kinda the natural source of healing during the Roman or Greek era. It's only the advent of SPF (harmful chemicals) being applied on humans that gives rise to cancer
Hi Nate; my husband was diagnosed with stage 3 melanoma almost thirty years ago. He’s had to have three more biopsy’s of the area, but they’ve all come back clear. My BIL (my hubby’s brother) has also had basal cell carcinoma on his forehead; it’s something that comes back occasionally so you will need to keep an eye on the area and always, always listen to your wife. I was the one who kept nagging my husband to see about the mole on his neck that was changing, the surgeon told my husband that by listening to me, it saved his life.
Thank the heavens above! I’m so happy that you’re getting better Nate (aside from the wound haha). Literally cried with Kara when you guys found out it was benign. Praying for your guys’ health!
I am so so glad that you are ok 🥰🥰🥰🥰 that really choked me up for a while. You guys have made a huge difference in so many people’s lives and although we don’t REALLY know you both, we DO care and I for one and just so thankful you are ok 😃 rest up and feel better soon 😍😍😍😍xxxxx
4:00 That's when you went to Dr. Google uh?  lol btdt
If you want to travel to Canada travels you guys  should really come to Winnipeg there’s a lot of things to see here
I’ve had 3 surgeries on my head/neck so I know the tight skin being pulled together feeling, it gets better. It’s almost been 6 years
Kara and Nate Thank you for sharing your experience. 💜 I'm glad Nate is cancer free. We love you both so much!
I'm watching your count and like totals move faster than the dollar amount while pumping gas. Saving just one person by you coming forward with this will be so worth it. Ty ty ty!!!! #earlydetectionsaveslives
So this was all just click bait? You guys use to be cool and now you sell out for views? Disgusting I can't believe I fell for your bullshit thinking you are good people
Tense, but good to hear that it had a good outcome…be safe, be well, enjoy life…
When i see title of the video ,u just scare me a lot,,after watching almost all of yours video and folowing thru this voyage of yours,it just cant be ended like that,BUT huh lucky good doctors make that thing go away,,u see i m 54,i never be on trips like u do,this is my escape from daily rutine in life,THANk you for this,stay positive in good healt,anw i m glad u are ok after all drama,,(sory for longer post),,now lets get some coffee,,,and hit the road....
Wow. Thanks for sharing. You were amazing how you took it in your stride.....cancer surgery but still drives for a burger. Rocking the head bandage.  Xx
Wow! I’ve had a few spots checked over the years and I know even the stress in those moments can be a bit too much to handle. Glad you’re out the other side of this and have the battle scar to show for it.
It shocks me how these videos get dislikes. Who in this earth does it make sense to? To press the dislike button? Weirdos
For those of us who have had a spouse diagnosed with cancer, it is a life-stopping moment for both, but there is help out there and I am so glad you had a good result, as did my husband and glad you are coming to my home country Canada!!
Thankful  that it all worked out for you . What provinces are you going to visit in Canada. Hopefully Ontario.
Thank you Nate and Kara for sharing your struggle and joy. Nate wishing you all the best with recovery all SPF with high UVA's and UVB's.
They found Melanoma on me 13 years ago! I was in shock! The Doctor had already scheduled a surgery for the next day!  I went in and got it cut out of my lower stomach area.  We had to wait for the results to come back. I think it took a week or so.  It was a stressful time for my wife and myself for sure. The results showed that they got it all!
Sending you both all the love from across the pond <3
I didn’t expect to get emotional this morning. Don’t worry Kara, I cried while you kept it together on camera lol  I’m so happy Nates cancer free!  Love from a Nashville Native 💖
Sending you both strength and love! From a 14 year cancer survivor!!! You both are inspirational and as Kara said, “we’ll make the best of it.” Cheers!
Im going to put some sunscreen on right now.  Thanks for sharing! So glad it’s not that bad.
The love that you two have for each other is just so, so beautiful 💜 so glad you are ok Nate! Hugs xxx
Omg my heart jumped when I read the title!! So glad that your okay Nate!! Wish you both all the best! Your videos really brighten up my day, and I love watching you guys travel around❤️❤️
Congratulations on your health!
I do not think a lot of people consider initially that everybody is going through something and life hits you in the face back to reality, I'm glad it's reversible but it's still scary regardless, prayers for a fast recuperation
Thanks for sharing.  You may have saved several others.  So happy for the positive results.😎
My aunt had cancer and I remember asking a crowed she was lecturing if they remember when they were told they have cancer. Those words are a defining moment in your life!
I was worried this might happen because you two spend so much time in the sunlight and I wasn't sure if you were applying enough sunscreen. Hope you both heal and stay safe!
It’s still scary it’s just human nature ❤️
Love always
The first few words put a lump in my throat. Im so happy you are ok.
I think you guys are great but why would you sponsor a cancer video 😩 doesn't feel right.
Dear Kara and Nate, I thank you for sharing this part of your life. I know living in the spot light, is a hard thing, and sometimes, people need to see what does happen in the background. I deal with the public differently, as my job is dealing there cars, and I have gotten to meet lots of great people, and be apart of there lives. Those people tho, do not know the full background of me, and what personal items I deal with, in my daily life, and my medical condition. Over  this pandemic, I have picked up 6 vloggers, that I follow all the time, and a few others, to fill that void. Just in the past 6 months, all but 1 of them have taken us into a personal situation, with either having covid or some other medical issue, and shared their story. Each one, has opened a backdoor into their personal life, that we never see behind the camera. Nate thanks for sharing this, skin cancer is small but big scare, and I know it's helps with having family around, just like my mother and grandfather both had it, and had a family help. Like you both said and my mother, and grandfather dr said, wear sunscreen and cover up...
Why did you go to Chernobyl !
Really happy that you're okay, and everything is gonna be fine and beautiful. God is always with you 😇🧿
So glad everyone is ok! That quote is one of my favorites! I say it a lot to others... and those that have no health issues look at you like you're speaking another language and those with health problems have a complete look understanding. 😀 health is one of life's most valuable assets. So glad you guys are ok. That's scary!
Proud of you Nate. Your burning flesh smell is freaky lol
Nate and Kate, I'm in tears watching this. I literally just went through this with a friend of mine who had basal cell on her nose....She's been very depressed but she had it cut out and is doing really well. I've tried to encourage her.....I think she's slowly getting better physically and mentally....I will be praying for you, Nate and if you need to talk...Im from North Carolina...You're going to be fine!!! Just take your precautions and invest in that sunblock.....
We love you Nate. So thankful you are ok. ❤️
So happy that it wasn’t that serious and that your cancer free. So proud 🥲 f you guys for being brave and strong. Stay safe guys!😘🤗🌼🇻🇪
You both are so strong and I am wishing you guys the best after this little trial you’ve faced . 💖
unfortunately skin cancer is a prety normal thing here in australia and its just a build up of all the time u spend in the sun without a hat or sunscreen on. its simple take care of yourself and it wont happen. with the technology we got today theres no reason not to protect yourself
Nate and Kara.. I am so glad that you had a good outcome. I know how scary it is because my Husband had to go through the same thing Mohs surgery on the back of his neck and they had to take a pretty sizable section. It has been a few years and recently my Husband has had 2 spots show up on his face and is going back to the dermatologist this coming week. Am praying for good results and I know my baby will be okay just like Nate was ok. Please use SPF always and do not forget the tips of your ears, your nose, back of your neck ( the neck is a REALLY common spot that basal cell occurs) and also the back of your hands.  Those 4 spots are the most common spots that it shows up a lot on. Thank you for sharing this with us... In the process I am sure you have saved people from having to go through the same thing by educating them. Praying for you both always. :)
I’m so happy and relieved for both of you. Thank you for sharing. I love your channel.
I’m so happy you are ok, Nate!  I’ve got a spot on my leg that I keep procrastinating on. You’ve inspired me to get a move on!  God bless you both. ❤️
Dude It's Chernobyl Op
My husband had a basal cell carcinoma removed from his cheek when he was 28. Same exact process. Doc said he was very young to have this type of skin cancer. This video brought back memories of me feeling the exact same way Kara was feeling. Be strong but totally terrified at the same time.  My hubby has been clear since. He religiously wears sunscreen and covers his skin with SPF clothes now while mowing or fishing.   So glad everything came back clear for Nate. Cheers to good health going forward for you both!! 💛
My husband has had a ton of these basal skin cancers with minimal issues.    Good for you for your honesty.   Need to be vigilant.
You both were one of beautiful couple we have been watching for years. At the end of the video gave me a relief. Uff!!  Stay safe and sending in love and prayers!! Lastly the quote from grandpa - that's a perfect one in this age of fast food world.
Rip shit
Chernobyl Op.
I’m so sorry you had to go through this. I’ve had two melanomas eight years apart—I understand the fear. I Thank God you are well.
These are very common. I had one right beside my eye at the age of 32. Don’t not get this checked out because you’re scared. It’s a super easy treatment.
Praise God! And I love that quote! PS: Please use a natural sunscreen, not a chemical one. Putting chemicals on your skin every day can be more dangerous than getting too much sun. Don't block the sun all the time either. You need that vitamin D.  So happy you're ok! Praying for fast healing.
So…. The title “I have skin cancer”… is anybody going to talk about the fact that he actually doesn’t have skin cancer??  Just bullshit click bait, getting views by claiming to have a life threatening disease. Disgusting.
NATE:  YOUR HAIR WILL GROW BACK ONCE THE WOUND HEALS!!!!  It just takes time - patience dear grasshopper!!!! Hats, shirts and sunscreen!!! My DH hubby had basil cell on the top of his head.  Put sun screen through your hair and your kids especially when swimming.  You will tan with SPF 70!!!!!
I'm so grateful for three things: 1. Nate is cancer free. 2. Your promoting seeking out therapy.  It has made a huge difference in my life, and thousands of others. 3. While you didn't specifically talk about this, the importance of annual visits to a dermatologist, if at all possible.. catching things before they get worse is so important. You guys did a great thing putting out this video.  Onward to new adventures!!!!
I am so pleased you got the all clear. Hopefully sharing your experience will encourage others who have similar symptoms to come forward for testing and treatment. Here’s to many more years of following your adventures around the world.
Thank you guys for sharing and for being so vulnerable. My family has also been through cancer and I understand how scary and painful the experience can be- physically, mentally, and emotionally for everyone. Glad to hear the surgery went well and the cancer didn't metastasize. Thank you for spreading cancer awareness. Praying for a speedy recovery and continued health 🙏
This is kind of stuff influencers should be talking about and be open and raw about it and maybe oh maybe they can safe someone's life. I was diagnosed with melanoma in March at the age of 35. Because it was just a bit too deep I needed an additional surgery at Institute of Oncology to see if the cancer had spread. Luckily it didn't. I can easily say that was the most stressful time of my life. It didn't help due to C19 I had to be alone everywhere. But I got through it, this experience has changed me, it opened my eyes, I'm stronger than ever and I appreciate lil' things even more now. I slap on SPF50 like a maniac now, haha. Be safe xoxoy
RIP Nate
Wishing from my heart for Nate to get well soon. And I know he will. Lots of love 😘
Had a few of these mohs  surgeries. Always unpleasant but usually pretty quick. Except for that one.... had a cancer.return to a.spot from years ago. Had to cut out a lot and then take a graft from my forehead and sew it to my nose. I recognized all of your trepidations and had all of that as well. Glad you got thru it and hope no more returns!
Thank you so much for sharing this Kara and Nate, I can imagine it must have been very hard for you both dealing with this unknown for some time and you have so candidly shared the realities of life and the preciousness of health.   Really pleased to learn Nate is well, wishing you both good health and many more adventures. My husband and I love watching your videos 🥰
I’m so sorry
Crying when they gave the good news that they got it! Keep us posted! We pray for you and care so much!!!
🙏🙏🙏God's  Healing be upon you..Thanks for sharing...
I’m not crying, YOU’RE crying! Glad all is well ❤️🙏🏻🥺
So glad that you are okay!
You guys are one my of my fav couples ❤. So glad to know Nate is doing better. Loads of love from Oman 🇴🇲 ❤
I haven't been here long on this channel but when I found out I immediately fall in I love with you two and this channel, hope you are ok now, my godmother had cancer and unfortunately she died from it :(. I wish you and Kara only the best. I was wondering what that patch on his head was in previous videos. I was thinking oh he hit his head but there was no info about that anywhere, thank you for sharing and letting us know. Greetings from Slovakia.
I’m glad it worked out. We went through this with my daughter when she was just 4 and in a location that was never exposed to the sun. I’m a firm believer in having skin checks each year.
Sending love from Australia!! Thank you for sharing this with us, its a great reminder to routinely check our bodies and get anything odd checked out!! ❤️❤️
I think I want to know Nate’s grandfather. That’s extremely wise.
Why won’t you guys come to Wisconsin, it’s like you guys hate us and are purposely avoiding us
Blessed that you are doing better Nate. You are in my prayers. Continue to push through and strive for greatness.
I’m so sorry you had to go through this. It takes strength to share your story and I’m sure many look up to you for that. It’s a blessing you have Kara by your side, but I would have worried and cried like she did. On a side note, it was a recent video I noticed a small bandage on the back of Nate’s head. I didn’t think much of it because it was so brief I realized it could have even been a hearing aide. Sad to hear what it really was. But, hey not that you wanted the scar… but makes you look pretty tough that you can say you Kicked Cancer’s butt! Not like bungee jumping or doing things like diving with sharks hasn’t already made you look tough. Prayers to you and your family.
Omg my stomach dropped when i saw the title!  Thank god your ok!
Did I hear Canada?!?! Please come to the sunshine coast!  P.s. I dont have words, only hugs.
Take care bro..... wish u speedy recovery
Nate: ...not life threatening Me:. relief Time 2:00  Nate: ...bandage on the back of my head Me: Oh, that's what that was!
Deep breath before the video and after doing a big ole dance for you guys!
Can’t see this and not comment. 1. Yay!! 2. At first I laughed (a little) when you said you don’t like needles having just watched you screaming off a cliff with only a bungee attached. 3. Best wishes for continued good health for you both. I truly live vicariously through your videos, appreciating the honesty you share: the pluses and minuses. Entertaining. Educational. Thank you. God bless.
Thanks for sharing on such a massive and difficult subject. Maybe I myself should take note!
😱 OMG, thank God 🙏🏽, that scared 😨 me. I love watching your videos 😍
Thank you so much for sharing this video. I am in my 20s and just had a biopsy done. I still have my stitches in and luckily it was just a normal cyst and I am fine! Skin cancer is scary my dad has had multiple spots taken out. I'll be joining you in wearing SPF 50 every day!
so Proud of you brother keep up the positivity.
What a great quote from Nates grandpa!
hugs!!!!!
Hope that both of you will cover up using sun screen . Now that I had Mohls surgery in my ear it’s hard keeping it covered,  and the healing is taking awhile. But just another bump in the road. In 3 weeks I expect it to be given all clear sign and I’m thankful I have long hair to cover it.
so glad it is all good for you. i am a cancer survivor. in 1998 i was 46 years old, and told i had prostate cancer. i was also told to just get it out of my body, and not have to worry about it again. not to get into it too much, having the surgery back than, is not like it is today, and i lost all functions as a man. i go every year now for a PSA test, and the PSA is always below what it could be. so always listen to your doctor, and go for check ups when they ask you to.
💛✌🏼
I doubt there are any 20-30 somethings around thinking they might have to deal with this.  Just a reminder to pay attention to the "small stuff" before it becomes not small stuff. Thanks for sharing this very personal issue!!
Sincere good wishes to you both. Speedy healing Nate and then this becomes a memory.
I had parotid gland cancer, the tumor was removed via surgery last year and I’m cancer free. We discovered in its early stages and I do not require quimo or radiation. Check ups every four months , so far so good. We are all in this. Happy that Nate is part of the cancer free team!  My heart goes out to all the people affected by this terrible desease and their families, you got this! Thank you Kara and Nate for sharing your story!
`25 s
I’m so sorry you guys had to go through that!! Glad Nate is better though 💕
Glad you shared your story for the millions of people who might be suffering from this. You guys be strong and keep the faith. Still have so much traveling.
I thought I saw I bald spot on you, on the last vid but wasn’t sure but makes sense now lad you’re all good🤟🏼
Glad you're cancer free! Thank you for sharing your story
I got a bit emotional when results came back.....I can't imagine not having you guys here....you are blessed....
"You are all clear" are the best words you can hear. I'm very glad that it's taken care of.
I had squamous cell carcinoma cut off of my left leg. Small spot. It's even less threatening than basal. But I know how you feel kinda. Scary to here that. So glad that it's all gone and nothing too serious. Love your videos. Got say your grandpa is so right with his quote. Lupus warrior since 2011. Wear your sunscreen might need to do 70 spf or higher now. Wear your hat! Prays for continued health.
Best wishes Nate. Thank you for the courage to share this story with us.
Praying for the continual recovery Nate!!! Thank you guys for being vulnerable and sharing something like this. So thankful you’re okay and that this is over ❤️
you need to stop with all the cuts and edits of you walking, making coffee when its something serious you are talking about in the video. All the walking, getting out of bed doesn't mach the mood of the video.
I hope you’re okay 👍
Praying for the continual recovery Nate!!! Thank you guys for being vulnerable and sharing something like this. So thankful you’re okay and that this is over ❤️
I liked the comment Nate made about social media and the edited versions of people’s life.  Young people in particular need to hear that a little more often and stop putting themselves under so much pressure to be ‘perfect’.   Think it’s really great that you both shared this.
So happy to hear you're doing well Nate, onwards and upwards! Godspeed
Ty for sharing makes me give a 2nd thought about stuff on my head to go and get it tested :)
So shocked to know that Nate went through all those tough treks & challenges but always remained soo enthusiastic despite such circumstances....u guyz r very very brave! My love & good wishes r always with you....💝
Wow, thanks for posting this and being brave!
Oh
I guess the title of this should have been, "I HAD skin cancer."  Congratulations!
NOOOOOOOO dude I feel so sad for you I hope you can fight back your strong and you can beat the cancer
Welcome to my world. Skin cancer is very common. I have had numerous biopsies cut out, all which have been basil. Once a year I go in and they put the blue light on me and freeze off any suspicious spots.  Glad you found it and now be preventative.
My reaction was a f word when i saw the title first
Thank god u are okay and God bless yall
I did not need this emotional roller coaster in the morning. So glad it all worked out for you in the end. Props to Kara for being so strong for you.
Oh man!!!! I cried during the whole video, I am so happy Nate is ok!!! Big hugs guys
Yo, glad to hear you are done with it!  Been and big fan for a long time.  After seeing this thinking I may need to get a spot checked. Appreciate your willingness to share the good and the bad. Looking forward to see what’s next for you guys!
no because i knew everything was going to turn out good but i still kept tearing the entire time ugh. we love you guys so much!!! good OR bad we are always here to show love & support u guys! 🥺🖤
I had skin cancer on my nose. I feel ya when they had to cut it out 😭 It was horrible! The healing was just as bad! So glad you're better 🙏 Love from Colorado 🧡🍁🧡
I clicked SO fast
So glad to hear your ok!
Just so glad its over Nate and kara
Thank you for sharing your story. Happy to see you're in the clear. Speaking from someone who lived in Florida most of her life, your dermatology is right about the ears. I've seen so many seniors with bandages on their ears  and cheeks. That's why I wear bucket hats, straw hats, lifeguard/bushmaster/floppy hats or any other hats that covers the ears whilst outside and of course sunscreen.
😰 whew!!!!!!!!! I’m so glad that this chapter was short and is now closed. Happy for you Nate ! You were brave I’d have passed out for sure
I’m crying so happy Nate is all good🥺❤️
Hey Kara  and Nate amazing inspirational story about Nate. S skin cancer sorry ❤️🎗️💋💕
Sending love, hugs and good vibes xxx  I just had a skin biopsy on my forehead a couple of weeks ago, and another one is happening this week… man does the forehead bleed! It’s not fun, at all, to be scared and in limbo with answers. Thankyou so much for sharing your experiences. Glad you have been on a road to recovery:)
Thank you for sharing your experience. I work as a Mohs surgery tech and for us this procedure is typically no big deal and it is easy to forget how overwhelmed and scared a patient can feel.  SPF 30 everyday!!! UPF clothing and hats and never forget your ears!!!
Congrats Nate... Having lost loved ones to melanoma... I want to thank you for sharing your story... Education and early detection are key.
🙏 we  will pray for you🙏
Well done! It’s never easy hearing that sort of initial news, but bravo for not ignoring it. Plus, with Kara by your side you always had this licked, Nate!
I never put sunscreen in my ears.  Thanks for the PSA
So thankful that Nate is clear ❤️
Stay strong. I am a 20yr survivor of stage IV testicular cancer. Kara is 100% correct about nates uncle at 9:30. Great saying. 👍👍💪 stay positive.
Gosh I'm so glad you're OK, Nate. And thanks for being so transparent and vulnerable. As a Canadian (also welcome!), I'm curious how healthcare works in the U.S. Did you have to pay at all for this procedure? Or do you have insurance??
So happy you are ok. I was hoping to hear "basal cell" once you said cancer. I have had 3 of these. All on my face. I was fortunate to see one of the best Dermatologists in the country right here in Atlanta. You two as Kara and Nate are such a strong and positive couple. And that will be even more so moving forward.
Great Nate is better already! 🙏
My last name is Buchanan too! 🥰
I am just so proud of Kara for staying so strong for her husband, I know she was freaking out on the inside and that’s just awesome how you stayed strong for him. I prayed as soon as I saw the thumbnail to keep you guys safe and that everything is in Gods timing and that we can’t do anything about it but trust in him. I am so happy to hear he’s cancer free!! You guys are just so amazing and my comfort honestly. Will keep Nate and you in my continual prayers☺️ love y’all
I want to say one thing. Nate doesn't have to justify being nervous about a non-life threatening cancer. I dealt with skin cancer in a sweat gland on my knee about 10 years ago. It was rare, had a name a mile long (that I can't recall but have written down somewhere). The doctor even said removing it is the treatment, she even told me to consider it cancer light. She said it was the best cancer I could have because of how treatable it was. But when someone says cancer and they are referring to your body, it doesn't matter how treatable it is, you still feel the emotions. You still wonder what this will do to your life. You are grateful that it is minor. But someone said cancer while talking about you. That does take a bit to process through. Glad your diagnosis is great. I will say I wondered what the bandage was on Nate's head in last week's video. But as always, it is your choice what you share and what you keep private.
I tell my patients "don't worry till there is something to worry about". On effect, try not to let it disturb your adventure. You two are amazing people. Thank you for sharing this challenge. 🙏 Now come to San Diego and heal.
That quote is so beautiful it made me cry. Never heard it before. Nate's grandpa is quite something! What a gem. So glad you're alright. Much love.
I won't say I'm sorry to hear that instead I'm happy you can and able to fight that  challenge
well wishes to you
God bless. Be happy for ever. My best wishes. Love you both.
I hope you we’ll be ok
I lip-read it perfectly, gosh!
I have aspired to be like you guys for ages. If my channel got just a fraction of the subscribers you have, I would be so happy. However, I wouldn't want to change places with you on the cancer thing. The diagnosis looks good, so all best wishes moving forwards. Take care both of you.
Thank you both for always being so transparent vulnerable and real ❤️ so glad Nate is ok 🙏🏼
Oh man, sorry and sad to read that. I noticed it on the other video. Cancer is not the end, there are good ways to fight it and survive it. Wish you the best :(
❤️🙏
So sad to hear this Nate but happy you’re on the mend. So important to wear sunscreen! Keep safe ❤️✌🏼
I didn't want to like this, but I wanted to show my support!
SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESH!
Sending both of you some ♥️Glad this went so smoothly! And yessss, I agree with the doctor on wearing SPF especially on the ears!!
Great video! I needed that sunscreen reminder ♥️ Thanks for sharing.
Damn…..i have something under my hair for years that won’t go away…. Better get it checked out 😬 Happy for you Nate….. Memento Vivere!!!
Ohh man ..I read the title & chills went through my body.....May you two stay happy healthy together till you hit 100!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I’m praying for you both, and Kara, you were so strong for Nate when he got the news.  You’ve got this.  💪🤍
So glad your okay!!
Watching you listen to the results brought me back to when I heard my own wife's results come back as thyroid cancer, it's heartbreaking. I am so happy to hear you are cancer free. My wife just celebrated her 10 year anniversary of being cancer free as well.
Thanks for sharing!
God is great 🙏🏼. HEALTH IS THE REAL WEALTH!!!
Thanks for sharing this! I’ve had a minor bump on my arm for a while now and this has pushed me to go get it checked.
Dang man that sucks
We love you guys and are praying for a speedy recovery!!! Can’t wait to see the Canada vlogs!!!*Shout out to his family*
#natesupport
My grandfather had skin cancer (he was one of those people those nurses mentioned about having ears cut off 👂 ✂️ ). Despite that- he lived to 90+! I'm sorry to hear about the diagnosis, but glad that you're both doing well. Thanks for sharing your story!
So glad that everything turned out to be okay!! I know that had to be a scary expierence. God is good 🙌 ❤
So glad it's just BCCs. Welcome to the common disease of fair skinned Aussies! I've had 4 cut out now at 45. Always present as either flaky skin that won't go away, or red spot that occasionally bleeds and won't heal. My first one was not diagnosed  initially either, but I persisted and ended up full thickness BCC with a mini facelift (unfortunately that didn't last!! 😂) Now I just get the dermatologist to remove anything questionable then and there. Last one done in 5 minutes during a consult. It runs in my family, so keep an eye out for other types... and also, remember, you have to reapply SPF regularly throughout the day! Here's to a long, healthy life (albeit with a few scars 🤞❤) You guys are great 👍
Love and support from Spain! You are a great couple, stay strong and never loose that positive attitude you share with us always!
Nate your BLESSED,and in my prayers
This video inspired me to sign up for a skin check. I am sending you good thoughts and wishing you speedy recovery 🙏
Can't imagine how hard it must have been for Kara to edit this video.
Thanks for sharing - Good Video! Glad to here that all went well, and that you can Nate move forward, onwards and upwards with your life - relieved for Kara as well! Plus good that the Doctor told you to share the well know "secrets" for avoiding general skin cancer problems = wear a hat and sun cream! If ever you need us, we're here for you - Good Luck!
I have skin cancer it shows up in different places all the time. I now use spf 70 especially on all my exposed skin. I go every three months for a complete check up. Stay positive it won’t defeat you.
Thanks guys for being vulnerable with is your extended - extended family. I really appreciate this update, all the best and speedy recovery Nate. Rest up and we know Kara is taking great care of you.
Oh Praise you and Thank you Jesus..god bless with good health always  🤗
I hope that it never comes back! Thanks for sharing your story with us, know that we care and are thinking of you.
the seriousness of nate at the beginning is laughable. many thousands of people everyday are diagonosed with skin cancer everyday. it is nothing.
Im happy that you are okay 🥰
You're amazing so glad you're okay.🙏🥰
I never comment on any videos because I always assume the creators never read it, but I felt I wanted to leave one here in the off chance you two do read it.   Ive been following your journey for about two years and have watched all of your videos to date. You both inspire me to be kinder and in general be a better person. I was so concerned looking at this title before I clicked into the video, and I’m so relieved about the end result. You guys are truly amazing people, both of you are so strong.  I can’t wait to see how your journey continues in the years to come….Love from the UK ❤️❤️
Glad you’re OK Nate
You guys are amazing Love you guys like I was raised with you. All positive energy an you will overcome this. The most high will guide you ...🙏🏿
Glad to hear Nate is on the road to recovery! Having had Basel Cell myself on my ear and having Mohs surgery I understand what you went through. I'm about 12 years cancer free and pray the same for you!
Thank God your okay 👍 ❤🙏 Speedy recovery!🥰🥳😘
That's so scary! So glad you're doing better and that everything turned out well.
Please please please be sure to get checked every year. My mom grows basal cell carcinomas like it is her hobby and, honestly, after the first 20 or so you tend to stop taking it so seriously and being as diligent as you should about your checkups. (This is been going on since she got a bad sunburn on her scalp while on her honeymoon with my dad over 50 years ago and she was actually one of the first patients that they performed the MOHS procedure on in Indiana when they first started using it for dermatology.) Then two years ago one of the spots that they had removed previously came back and it was a melanoma. They got it all just fine, but it was really scary. Now she gets checked every 6 months without fail.
Ahhhh thank you so much for sharing. Wow. This is huge. Sending you all the love. Your ability to deal with all this stuff and still show up… is just next level. 💜🙏
HAPPY DANCE - great news!  Safe travels to beautiful CANADA🇨🇦, my home!! xoxo
Guys, wish you both health and plenty of love. Take care. Stay strong
Omg I was really worried when I read the title but I’m sooo relieved that Nate is cancer free and I hope it stays like that you guys are really awesome and deserve the love of the whole world lots of love and support 🥰🥰
Poor Nate, hope you have a speedy recovery to full health, wishing you the best from Scotland
Such good news, Nate!  Thank you for sharing.  I don't know if I could have done it!
Thanks for sharing. Life has highs and lows so enjoy everyday. Blessings.
I HAD A MINI HEART ATTACK WHEN I REFRESHED MY YT PAGE SOO GLAD YOU AND NATE ARE SAFE LOVE YOU GUYSSS :)
Wow that's not good!  God speed your recovery!
Love you guys from Iran-Kurdistan, keep it strong ❤❤❤❤
My mom had some melanoma in her right shoulder that she got cut out. So happy they caught it early. I'm so happy they caught Nate's early too! These early diagnoses can literally be life or death.  Stay blessed and healthy you two, you guys mean a lot to me. I want to travel and save money to do that because of you guys. You guys have inspired me in so many ways.
Nate, you are brave and courageous to share this.  I know it's scary, but you can do it.  You are young and strong.  Keep wearing a hat, all the time while you're outside.  You have this whole community who loves and supports you.  We are sending all the love to you and Kara.
Focktop bro
A M E N   !!!          LOVE YOU BOTH!!!!             GOD BLESS YOU  BOTH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I cried tears of joy for you and am so thankful for your vulnerability. God is good!
i was shocked to read the tittle. and glad to hear its not life threatening and been taken care of. get well soon Nate and we are looking forward to see your next journey.
Stay Strong !!
I'm happy you're ok Nate. You guys are awesome and I love your videos. I get excited every Sunday for y'alls post!
Love you both God bless stay healthy and safe
I really feel that part about being luckily while traveling.  I got very sick earlier this year, went to the doctor got sent to the hospital and had emergency surgery the very same day. I have been to some parts around the world with bad health care or no hospital close by. If I would have been in some of those remote places I might not be here today. I will continue to travel to places like that but I will also have to carry that tiny voice of fear in the back of my mind.
At least it wasn't between your eye and your nose... like mine. LOL  I remember my first. It was scary. Now, after countless years and hundreds of stitches, it's second nature. Get checked twice a year, brother!!  I'm an Irish, outdoor guy who lived in Florida. Not a good mix. LOL
Go Nate!!!
Im happy that you are cancer free nate ..i hope i am cancer free too 🥺🥺 take care always nate..
I'm really glad that Nate is OK! Also thank you for using your experience to educate others! 🙏 xx
I've had 6 Basil cell carcinomas on my face and 2 on my neck, it's not a big deal. Early detection is the key.
Glad to hear you both are doing well.  Keep trucking………
❤️💪 Thanks for sharing. You’re so strong to have made it through that and maintain your optimism throughout.
Love you guys… but this seems to be a running theme or narrative on each of these nomad channels. Eamon/Beck has same thing happen, almost to the exact video. Brian and his dog same thing. Praying all is ok
Hello Nate and Kara!!!  Good to see you both,  it's been awhile for me.   I seen this video and immediately watched out of concern.  Thank God it's basal cell and not the other!!  I had the same thing 21 years ago and they had to go deep to get it all out on my shoulder.  They advised to watch the area and if anything started to grow to come back.  Good news is,  it never did!  You both have this!!
Hello there. I have watching and looking forward to your videos every Sunday for quite some time and love all of your adventures. You are so lucky just doing the things you are doing and traveling the world. I think the things you share are just amazing and sometimes personal and that is what makes you both amazing. Wish you all the best Nate and of course you as well Kara.
❤️
So glad you are ok Nate 🙏 I don't know how people can dislike this
If I could just summarise what we should all take from this video.....  WEAR SUNSCREEN!  And I'm very glad that you're ok, Nate.
Me sad
When the diagnosis came back and Nate asked Kara if SHE was okay shows how much they really love and care for each other. Made me tear up :,)
Wishing everyone good health 🥺
try ivermectin..12 mg a day for a  month.. yes i know  it sounds crazy.. but it will reduce the severity and may even  stop it completely.. it  cant  hurt you..and  it  does work..you can use it with any other  medical treatments.. even if your doctor  refuses.. you can still get it online.. dr johnny nato sicily
Thank you for sharing this! I’m so glad you’re ok Nate.
So glad that you are clear! Have a BLESSED LIFE
Scary experience, but so happy that Nate is ok. All the best to you both! :)
I hate how easy it is for doctors to say “oh it’s this” and not actually check. My fathers stage 4 cancer was mistaken for arthritis for over 5 years I’m glad yours didn’t spread.  Take care of yourselves people you are your only advocate. Most doctors just want their $ (not all. Just most).
I just lost my aunt to cancer this past Friday. Seeing this video of my favorite couple on YouTube, really made me emotional. I’m so happy Nate is okay. Blessings to you both. We love you Kara & Nate! Thank you for your honesty & vulnerability. Take care of yourselves. 💖
Iv been in cancer free for 2 years now :) . Glad u are okay nate . Love your videos !!!
Reading the title made me mild panic. But grateful to know that Nate is cancer-free! Please stay healthy for both of you. Much love from Indonesia
Thank you so much for sharing and opening to us, and so happy for Nate that the cancer is officially gone ❤️
I am so happy that you are ok.  Here's to your continued good health!!
Congratulations and stay healthy.
the fact that i’ve noticed the scar on the scalp behind your head during the bolt farm treehouse video and thought oh what’s that spot on his head probably he tried trimming and that led to a small piece of hair come out! but now coming back to this video and finding out that it was cancer! you guys are really strong 🤎
Kara being silently being like OMG IT WAS FRICKING HUGE CHUNK OUT OF HIS HEAD 😂   So happy you’re safe and happy and healthy!
Blessings 💖💖
Big hug, Nate and Kara!❤️
God Bless you guys!!
Why am I crying? I don't even know you two. Just because I have watched all of your videos, I think we are friends. Wishing you both lots of love and good health, thank you for sharing.
They forgot to put on your cone.
so yall are telling me that he ran a marathon with skin cancer.... with a donkey at that?? girl I could not. I can barely run and I don't have it. like ok damn
I just almost had a heart attack im not even gunna lie
Heck yeah. Congrats Nate. Proud of ya. Stay strong
I had a basal cell carcinoma on the side of my nose 10 yrs ago (it was where my glasses would rest and I didn't think too much of it until it *tingled*). My derm surgeon commented on how tiny it was, how many people let them fester and he ends up rebuilding parts of their noses and ears. Wear sunscreen, pay attention to changes in your skin, and if you are able, see a dermatologist for an annual skin exam. Most skin cancers are easily treated if caught early.
This video was literally so conferring Nate you where so strong for everything Kara you did amazing to help Nate . Love y’all 🤍
Such a beautiful video! I'm so happy Nate is OK. And thank you both for sharing this video and the information. I wouldn't have thought that a scab that doesn't seem to heal could be cancer, but I'll know now to get it examined if I ever have one. You both are so inspiring! Thank you for doing all that you do! <3
It feels weird to hit the Like button on a video titled "I have skin cancer" but I can't not hit the like button on a Kara & Nate video!  Sorry you've gone through this but I'm glad it worked out okay and that you have each other and a loving, supportive family as well!
That is such a true quote. Thanks for sharing!
TYSM to continue making videos during a stressful & uncontrollable time in your lives 💞💫
That is sad
So pleased you're ok! I literally gasped, when I saw the video title! (New subscriber here) Absolutely love your vlogs, and positivity! 😊
sending love from me to you guys❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Blessings on you both.  I am so happy it could be taken care of right away.  May the rest of your life be filled with love, joy and good adventures.
Thank you for posting this. It lets others know that we aren’t alone going through stuff like this. I had skin cancer removed back in 2007 I was 18 and now I have another spot on my back they are looking to biopsy. Just know we are praying for you and I’m so happy you are cancer free. Me and my kids (5yr & 9yr) watch you daily and they saw the title today and was like “Aw poor Nate we pray he gets better”! 🙏Prayers for safe travels and quick smooth recovery! Love y’all!
Sending many prayers
You are not struggling alone i have my sister who is Paralyzed
Thanks for sharing  <3 encourages people to go take care of themselfs.
I’m so happy Nate is ok!! I saw the title of the video and my heart sank. Thank you for sharing this with us, god bless 🙏🏼❤️😊
If the smell of the burning skin bothers you, don’t go to cattle  branding.
You guys are awesome and I wish you nothing but the best! Please, Please, Please take time for yourselves and  to keep yourselves healthy and happy. I’ve enjoyed sharing your adventures, and look forward to the future, but for now, and whenever necessary, take care of yourselves and each other, and know that you are supported. ❤️
Oh that’s scary I know! I had a nice chunk out of my left arm for the same thing. It’s humbling in a way you can’t understand until it happens. I’m glad they got it all and you’re on your way to living life again. It’s gonna feel weird for a while. This will pass and you’ll be like..remember that time? Parts of it will always stick with you but it won’t be something that you dwell on after a while. Just wear your sunscreen and do your best.
Glad it all turned out alright. Bless y’all.
NOOOOOOOO
I literally just watched the last video of the cabins... I was like have I missed something, why does Nate have a band-aid on his head.  Well this video clears that up.  I'm super glad to hear the good news.  Speed recovery Nate... Kara is such a good soul, so supportive.
Hi guys. Thanks for sharing this video. I am waiting to find out if I have cancer in my belly. Test upon tests and Im still waiting to find out. It is a tough thing to go thru. I love this channel. You both ROCK!.
So glad you did this video showing real life! As retired healthcare professionals it's good to get the word out not to ignore a non-healing skin lesion since some skin cancers can be deadly, and its so very important to use good sun block. Cheers to both of you!
Thank you for sharing 💗 Sending love and hugs 💗💗💗
thanks for sharing this guys.. its not only the good times..thats life. we wish you all the best 😇
Not life threatening you are lucky👍
I'm so glad that you're alright now! I pray that you stay healthy and happy and that this is a one-time thing that never returns/happens again. You are both seriously incredible for staying so strong and doing so many awesome things while going through this whole process. Have a great time in Canada and looking forward to your next video 😊.
I think in your faith "the lord shone his face towards you and gave you peace" and everyone needs the reminder to not take good health for granted. Thank you so much for sharing and giving us that reminder.
Damn so sorry to hear this I hope you best
I’m so glad that it wasn’t more serious. But I really do find that ppl  in the northern hemisphere don’t take skin cancer seriously. Burn is bad, and a tan does not equal healthy
❤️
love u nattteeee be safe n get better ^_^
That's awesome. So glad ur cancer free. Now let's see some more awesome videos.
All love to you, I've been following you for  years, you'll be okay and well soon. Take care
Stay Strong
Thank god good luck to both of you!!!!
Congratulations on being given the all clear get well soon 😊 👍 👏
Thank you Lord keeping Nate healthy in the name of Jesus Amen.
That's bad. Happily he's now safe
Nate congratulations on the good news. The world is a better place with your talent and fearlessness. Thanks for sharing such an important reminder as cancer effects so many & Kara I love Nate’s grandpa’s quote.  I look forward to watching you guys every Sunday, I can’t wait to see your Canada videos.
I’m so happy to see the good news. My family has struggled with basal cell and squamous cell cancer too, and I think it’s wonderful that you’re sharing your story so people are reminded of the importance of sunscreen and hats. And periodic skin checks with a doctor too - sunscreen isn’t perfect. I’m all caught up on your channel and a HUGE fan. God bless you both, and get well soon, Nate!
Omg this is crazy, my boyfriend just found out this week as well that he had/has basal cell cancer :( He also had a scab that would not heal(middle of his forehead) they just removed it and diagnosed it and it came back positive. So we're hoping as well all is well from now on. Wishing you guys the best and good health going forward! Thank you so much for sharing ❤️
Glad to hear Nate is on
Love you guys so much! Sending you a big hug and prayers that God covers both of you in good health. Happy to hear the good news!!💙💙
You guys have got a massive amount of support from your community. We love you both and thankfully, Nate is back to being cancer-free. Much support from Denmark once again!
Keep strong and healthy  Nate !
Nate you are so strong and now you can go out and do more adventures and have fun and not have to worry about it😊
I feel like I know you both, so glad it could all be excised, even though this was a bunch of hard and icky!
Oh gosh I wouldn’t wish to anyone to experience these feelings when waiting for biopsy results… had it twice…   I’m really happy that everything ended up well and I wish you a lot of health!  Love you guys! 🤩
My heart sank when I saw the title of the video and I'm so happy and releived the operation was successful. Sending you both a big hug, positive vibes and many blessings from Ontario Canada ❤🍀🍃🍂🍁🍂🍃🍀❤
The worst three words you can ever hear is “you have cancer.” I heard the words “your daughter has cancer” in the ER when she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer at 17. Sooo happy you are okay Nate!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Thank you for sharing we had the se scare with my partner. So happy Nate is healthy
Have/Had the same. Have #1 Dermatologist so not worried. Just keep after it and all should be good.
❤
So happy for the good news! Hopefully this will encourage you, Nate: my mom has had multiple basal cell removals since her 40s, and she’s 80 and still thriving, and my dad had a melanoma removed about 5 years ago and is still cancer free (he’s 82). I tell you that to say you are not alone and your future is bright! Thank you for sharing this with us - I will be praying for both of you to feel a strong sense of peace going forward! 🙏♥️
Get well soon we are with you
Ceep fiting
Omg im so so sorry!
Every single one of us have things going in our life that we don’t share as you said at the beginning we use to always see the best part in social media. By sharing this with us is I think a good thing for you ! By that I mean looks at all the comments here it says it all. Keep going !
I saw the title and literally started crying, sending lots of love and a huge congrats to Nate for officially being cancer FREE!!
WOW such a scary action to read.  My heart dropped. I'm so happy to hear Nate is cancer free.
Scarey health moments are easier surrounded by love.  Sending healing  vibes for lots of healthy years.
Thank you for your vulnerability in sharing this. PTL that Nate is ok! 🙌🏼 I’m praying for an easy recovery. Y’all are such a light and I love following your story!
All a doctor does it sell advice. The first doctor didn't know what it was and was to proud to tell you that. He was supposed to tell you to watch it like you did. EVERYONE practices medicine. I hate people who call themselves Doctor's. The people who watch you are people to. A we are more responsible for eachother as men than people want to know,we will answer to God for our relationship's.
I know it must be tough to share this.   But you never know who your helping by doing so.  Someone may finally decide to get that lump or persistent scab checked out .  You may be saving a life by sharing this journey.  God bless.  ❤️ ❤️❤️❤️
I'm so glad to hear that everyone is doing well now!! Love you guys!!
My mother is a skin and breast cancer survivor. That is so scary! But im so happy you are okay and that you will be able to continue your travel and love story! And thank you for your transparency
That is a good PSA Because, Knowing is Half the Battle. GO JOE!!!!!
My heart stopped for a minute when I read the video title. I'm so very glad to hear Nate is now cancer free!!!   Thank you for sharing the good and the bad of your life journey with us. Enjoy your next adventure as you take us along for the ride! 🙏🏽😊
I see what happened they couldn't close you up until they tested the skin incase they had to take more. I'm sorry it still is scary hearing cancer. I think of all the times I burnt my back swimming.
Happy you’re OK Nate, I had a BCC removed from my neck 5 weeks ago and happy to say I’m cancer free too, but the worry up to that point was hard. Wishing you both good health and lots of sun screen ❤️
My Grandfather had 4 Basal Cell skin cancers. He lived well into his 90s. Thank you for sharing your story and you message of importance of sun protection!  Sunscreen, hats and light long sleeves are essential for protecting our skin!
🙏🏽🙏🏽
It is great to know that everything ended up well! Just a piece of advice: pay lots of attention to new marks on your body and do not take a long time to go to a doctor to have it checked should this happens.
🙂🙏🤗
I broke when I read the title of this video
New message Do A Nate get it Checked.  Sending you both hugs this would have been hard to share but may have saved a life. As ex nurse I know men especially reluctant to seek medical advice and if like happened to you initially told nothing to worry about and issue persists they do not go back unless dragged usually by partner.. I can not say loud enough if you have symptoms or concerns about something do a Nate get it rechecked. My best friends husband presented 8 times from 2018 to Jan 2020 with blood in poo told by Dr haemorrhoids/piles..no investigation req only other symptom extreme fatigue we eventually got him to see different GP....rapid referral for scans told massive tumour in bowel.. Then Covid hit... This year has had  radio and chemotherapy, tumour removed and given Stoma has just had Stoma reversel and will now be monitored.  Anyone who has symptoms especially if they persist please see another Dr go with your gut instinct. The Sun Protection advice follow it plus wear a hat it reduces risk..  Now everyone go share collectively this will save lives.
My aunt passed away from colon cancer years ago and hearing that you are cancer-free gave me so much joy that I started crying. I have been watching you guys for a while now and this is the first time Im commenting, thank you for showing us this side of your life. Best wishes to you guys
Yes !!!!! Gosh ... thats stressful watching it ... Thank god its over ...
Good public service announcement KaN. Thanks for sharing. Continued prayers for y'all!
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🤗 yayyyyyy!!!
I'm glad you had it checked Nate.  Basal cell is easy to treat, as you found out.  I was diagnosed with a small spot of melanoma on my face.  It's nothing you want to mess with.  I have a nice scar now, but no cancer....so I'll take that any day.  Please be vigilant about your skin checks.  I had to go every 3 months for a year and now I'm down to every six months.
Both of my parents were diagnosed with cancer within the last 4 years. It’s hard and yeah it sucks. But we came out of it stronger as a family. I’m sure you have grown so much together from this and will continue to grow closer together. God bless you Kara and Nate!
Nate I Believe in you you can buy-pass this
Scary stuff Nate. Glad you got it fixed!! Hope it doesn't come back, I have multiple BCC's all over my body... I get them constantly removed monthly but they tend to come back because I'm higher risk. Keep on making great content guys
Kate proves it Women can be strongest when they have to be, love the way she supported you through this all the way 👍. Wish you speedy recovery Nate, May Allah bring you health and prosperity, continue to be strong.
I teared up...we are always your support!! Remember to always keep going! ❤️
So glad Nate is ok! Keeping living your amazing adventures! Hugs
A bit dramatic, but...
Thank you for sharing! Sending healing thoughts!
This one was hard to watch. My Mom had the same cancer, twice. I haven't been in the sun for years for the same reason unless I am buried in sunscreen and a long sleeve rash guard. Thank you Nate for being diligent and following through AND for sharing with us. You will reach many people that live lifestyles like yours and Kara's who don't think about things like this at your age. A half a box of Kleenex later, I am so glad that you are better and so grateful that you shared. Thank you!
✨🙏✨
Wow this has knocked me for six well done nate
I’m so happy Nate is clear!!!!
Thank you for sharing a real life story with us. I am so sorry you had to deal with this theses past few months, but I can only imagine how relieved you must feel ... I've been following your amazing adventures from France since the beginning  of the pandemic and I really write comments because I'm telling myself you receive so many that you probably don't read all of them, but today, I hope you'll read my comment. Just wanted to tell you how much I appreciate both of you. Of course, as you said it, you only show what you decide to show us, however, I can feel how wonderful you are both. You are both very generous and so sweet. Take good care of you and have an amazing day ! Thanks again for sharing this real life subject with us. 🥰❤️❤️
My heart skipped a beat while reading the title of the video. I'm glad that you are okay, Nate! Tough experience but a valued one.
My sister has been going through the skin cancer battles, staying on top of any spots and getting them checked out is so important. So glad that Nate is okay…take care and stay safe and well from Debbie in Sydney Australia x
when i saw the title it broke my heart i was like oh no what happend  but  dude i hate needles as well i need to get my teeth took out and im so scared
Thank you for sharing a vulnerable part of yourselves, that cant be easy! I am so grateful you are both safe & healthy 💜. It has been amazing to watch your channel over the years, such a phenomenal inspiration and reminder to enjoy life to the fullest. Thank you for everythingyou do!!!  I just got to Canada myself, so I'm excited to see where your adventures take you.
Much strength and love from India ❤️ you are gonna get through this
My nana Has cancer
❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
I watch your videos all the time . I am happy Nate's cancer was minor compared to what it could have been scary as it was  . I wish you the best trip to Canada after that event . Peace .
Not to be mean what why does every  Youtuber  think we need to know every  little detail in their lives ,not only this channel  but others ,?
Awesome news  I had Basel cell carcinoma. On my face all turned out well too ❤️
❤❤
hello thanks
We're with you :)9
Wishing you all the best, heal up and have loads more adventures!
my best friend was diagnosed in January with Hodgkin’s lymphoma. after 8 months of intense chemo treatments and a month of radiation, her oncologist said she is CURED. we’re both healthcare workers and only 21 years old. good health is a crown and i wear mine with grace.
I too had a Basal-cell removed from the crown of my head about 2 years ago. I’m in my 60’s and am surprised that I didn’t get it long before this. My procedure was very similar to yours and for me, the worst part was the stitching it back up. Instant migraine happened when they pulled my skin together to staple together! Now I worry about all my future ones ☹️. I use sunscreen daily and get on with my life. Thanks so much for sharing this as it can help people get over the fear of the unknown!
Wow, thanks for sharing this, God Bless You!
Love the quote from Nate's grandpa! Wishing you both all the best!
Let me start by saying I’m a multiple multiple time skin cancer survivor, 6 MOHS surgeries and one was 9 hours and I lost all muscle and fat from the right side of my face along with half my nose. So let’s go light hearted with this, if you’re gonna have cancer, Basil Cell is the one you want, not to down play it, it’s still freaking cancer and it sucks but thankfully not life threatening. I’m so incredibly glad you followed through with it and didn’t play it off as eh whatever. MOHS surgery is a piece of cake, seriously Nate zero pain during and zero pain in recovery, I promise. Please feel free to message me with any questions, I can also give you some tips to make the surgery day go smooth.  Good luck buddy, I’m rooting for you 👍🤞 💪
Just the word cancer is scary especially when its being directed towards yourself or someone you love. I know that phone call was such a relief. You guys wear sunscreen. I'm very happy for you and Kara. Thank you for sharing.
Imagine getting Mohs on your nose.  That's what happened to me earlier this year.  Happens to the best of us. Your good man, just keep that sunscreen flowing.
feel mo better nate :)
That is good news Nate. Keep the good health moving forward. Stay blessed you guys!
🙏❤️
So scary! My auntie is dealing with some health issues as well. What part of Canada are you guys visiting? I live in Alberta!
😁😁😁😁 Im soo happy ! Really Happy ! :)
Hey nate you look great 🙏
Oh gosh you guys 😭 this was so scary! I can’t imagine how terrifying and stressful this was to deal with especially the waiting for answers and STILL showing up making vids. So glad the results turned out well in the end!
Happy you are ok Nate.
So glad you are OK, best outcome and thank you for sharing. I had melanoma and was exceedingly lucky that they caught it before it spread 🙂
Oh wow! My prays go out to you for your future
Thank you for sharing. I'm never met you and Kara I feel like you are family and we are here for you through good and bad 🤗🤗❤❤ 🙏🙏
Feel better Nate
Thank you for opening up about this experience. I would have never saw it coming but your positive outlook is always so inspiring.
I was shocked and worried by seeing the title. But it's such a relief after watching the video. Get well soon Nate. Wish you and Kara all the best. P.s. You still look good with that bandage on. 😅
Luckily most skin cancers are easy to deal with when caught early! Take Care.
So happy Nate is cancer free!  It was so sweet to watch you both holding it together for each other. ❤️ you’re blessed to have one another. Thank you for sharing. ❤️
I appreciate you sharing this and also commenting on how social media tends to be a highlight reel. I'm so happy things worked out the best they could given the circumstances and that you're cancer free now 💕💕
Thank you for sharing your ups and downs! 🙏🏻❤️
I went through the same thing 6 weeks ago. I found a spot on my neck that I thought was nothing, but my husband urged me to get it checked. I was also surprised by how fast it was to remove it. Love to you both!
Thank you for sharing. I’m so glad Nate that you are cancer free. Hugs!
LOVE LOVE LOVE ya guys!🧡🧡🧡  CaNaDa?!?!?? Eamon & Bec appearance??? 😮😀
💔
Nate, I've been following the channel forever and have been in a family who has been impacted by skin cancer. My great grandfather, grandmother, grandfather, and other grandfather all have skin cancer. Keep up the fight man. Never let it get you down.
I am so happy that its all gone! I hope he heals soon xxx
Try to don't look up on Google about it,I'm shure u are going to get through this process cheers
Got me crying sad tears from happy tears real fast. Wishing he gets real good real soon. 🤍
Moes is amazing!
Get well soon!
Thank you for sharing your story! Keeping you in my thoughts!! Stay strong!
Really happy for you guys Keep up the good work thank Jesus for good health 🙏
My husband had Basel cell cancer on his ear. They ended up having to take tip of his ear. Long healing. And his ear is still growing back… it’s been 6 years! Definitely learned the importance of using sunblock and not forgetting the ears!!
Woooowwww......I am still searching for a perfect words to describe your video,sorry i failed
I'm happy you're cancer free Nate. You did so well xx
First I'm glad you are in the clear Nate. Now Kara you hit the nail on the head at the end. I hurt my back and went to the doctor to then be sent to the hospital. Then sent by ambulance to a different hospital. Where I spent 6 days and 14 hours. I had a surgery and I am 13 days post op. But you know what? My right foot doesn't work correctly, muscles in the leg also aren't engaging. It might never work right again. I'm 37. My life is on hold for at least 4 more weeks and then I might go back with a cane; when my mode of transport is a bike. STAY HEALTHY PEOPLE!!
Im grateful for your health too. Im in hospital with my daughter often and although hubby and I used to travel a lot, our lives are very different now. 🌷
My husband had the exact same surgery in same spot on head about 5 years ago. Thankfully he's clear but he has to keep an eye for more cancer to pop up. He had to have another removal from his back, and one is forming against his nose. Not really too concerned. Just keep an eye for those little itchy bumps. I'm thinking all the years he was fishing and camping without sun protection (hats) is catching up. Good luck!
Thanks for sharing this story with us! So glad it has a happy ending! <3
Thank you for posting this video! As lifestyle and travel bloggers with such a large following posting something like this may just happen to influence someone with a hidden medical issue they were afraid of to seek medical help. Hopefully Nate recovers from his procedure and goes on to live another day to jump off another cliff! My best to you both as you travel up to Canada.🙂
Whoa! Thanks for sharing as a reminder to wear our sunscreen and sun protection. Hope you have healed well and I look forward to many more adventures!
Thank God nate u r ok hugs to u for being so brave o he'll I would have passed out lol
So happy for you Nate!
So glad this was just a little bump in the road for you all. Can't wait to see your Canadian adventures! Wishing you and Kara the best of health along the way <3
Thanks for sharing, Nate, especially because you will help so many other young and older people realize the importance of sun screen and going in to have it taken care of.  Many just wave it off and do nothing out of fear or thinking the spot is really harmless.  I am an older follow (72) and have been outdoors all my life thinking nothing about not wearing a hat when I play golf or putting extra face cream on when playing tennis.  I had 2 basel cell spots on the side of my face...one was easy and a one taking about 5 hours for the Mohs surgery.  Not fun and the healing on the face was ugly--but now?  You can't even see it.  It's good this caught you when so young...you will take care and so will Kara and thousands of others too.  So glad you are cancer free!
I watch your videos every week! I’m 36 and have had Mohs surgery three times. Thanks for sharing even more of your story and giving us all something to relate to. ☺️
BROHHH I WAS SO WORRIED IM SO HAPPY THAT YOURE ALRIGHT PLEASE TAKE CARE OF YOURSELVES BOTH OF YU MWAH MWAH MWAH LUV YA BOTH
My heart dropped to my stomach when I read the title, so glad you're ok. Now, I'm gonna watch the rest of the video. Lots of prayers!!!
Take Care guys! May you be blessed for the rest of your lives.
I had a basal cell cut off my back like 10 years ago......been absolutely fine ever since. Runs in our family and literally everyone in my immediate family has had places removed and been totally fine after. I'm also a nurse. Basal Cell is the best you can have. Dont worry, you'll be fine!!
Jesus is Lord love watching you all
What a valuable episode! You two knock it outta the park every time! Grateful and relieved that Nate is ok and that more life chapters are ensured. Enjoy enjoy enjoy!
i was literally crying by seeing the title but i am relieved and btw is someone has cancer then He/she will be cancer free by watching your videos
"Health is a crown on a well man's head that only the sick can see."  Nates grandfather is a smart man, and that's an incredible quote! Ps. So glad you're cancer free!!!
Be strong Nate ..keep away from direct sun and enjoy the Life
Man fuck cancer...I don't like seeing that notification from anywhere on my phone.
wish you a speedy recovery!!! Loads of Love from India !! Stay strong Kara and Nate
It was great to hear that you are ok now 👍
Thanks for sharing Nate🙌🏽🙌🏽 ❤️… don’t worry even with the bandage u still look like Cristiano Ronaldo lol … love u guys 🤗
Thx for sharing…sending hugs and prayers your way❤️
Sending you both the biggest hug!! I’m so sorry you’ve had to deal with this the last few months. You’re two of the toughest people we know so I know you’ve got this! Hopefully we’ll get to give you hugs in real life soon ❤️
Love you both so much and so happy Nate is on the mend (I also hate needles Nate but this makes me feel like more of a wimp for complaining about the dentist this week). Also, I almost always carry an extra goofy safari hat with me so happy to share the wealth moving forward. :)
Well done for putting this out there Nate . I have just undergone a WLE and node biopsy . Skin cancer is rarely talked about . Good luck to you both
That was a relief 😊 (I was shocked at first tho when I saw the new video notif).  Still, sending you both all the love and prayers from PH 🇵🇭 (esp. to Nate).  You guys and your channel kept me sane for quite some time now. Stay safe and healthy!!! 😁
I also was diagnosed with BCC. They had to go in a second time and removed an area the size of a nickel from the tip of my nose. They did a forehead flap to correct the removal. So, today a piece of my forehead is on the tip of my nose. But I too have a history of ingrown hairs on my scalp. Time for a closer look..
You’ll be fine, Nate! SPF50 for life (as well all should) and no more fear of medical procedures!
So so glad you are doing well congratulations and God bless
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Good to know it's all better now. Thank you for sharing. Please, continue to take care of yourself
I am so happy everyone is okay Reading the Title made me so damnn sad But after watching the video I was happy again Thank you for always being there for all your Subscribers <3 I love you guys so much
Thank you for sharing. As someone who has had melanoma, skin cancer is not something to mess with. All the blessings to you both on your adventures.
So happy that you are all clear.... Praying for a complete recovery.... ❤️❤️❤️ Love you guys!!!
Aw....Praise the Lord for His care over you!!!❤️❤️❤️
Hang in there and take care of yourself.
Aww so happy to hear that! U guys are the BEST! I cant help but worry for Nate! God will Bless u both always!!
Thank you for sharing your brave story!
So glad you're ok! Sending all the love! ❤️❤️
I understand. I had malignant melanoma on my upper back almost 30 years ago (when the survival rate was only ~65%). I was so lucky that they were able to cut it out, but I know what you mean about the ponytail feeling. Because of how much they took out, my shoulders were pulled way back and I felt like I was saying, "Here's my bust, everyone!" I'm thankful you're healthy now, and that all of your followers will now think about preventing this.
I lost my mother to cancer in 2005, and I appreciate you sharing your story to highlight this horrible thing that can affect all of our lives in many ways. I will admit I had a tear in my eye when I read the video title, but it's good to hear Nate is recovering.
Wow what an amazing story. Keep pushing through Nate and thank you so much for being willing enough to share this. We are all here to help
I'm glad Nate is ok! but this was the reminder I needed to buy suncreen😭
Yay all clear!!!!!  I am in joyful tears.  Thank u Bo h for having courage to be willing to share the personal parts of ur lives
That's why nate has a bandage on his head in the last video. Its great that he's okay now.
Really glad you decided to share. We really do feel like we're your friends and family at this point. I just finished the world nomad games vlogs on my journey to watch every video and it's crazy to think that it started back then. I'm so so glad that Nate is okay and that you guys can continue your amazing adventures with a more in depth view of life and what to be thankful for. I love that you guys always try to make the best of every situation. My Sunday morning routine is officially done once you guys upload.
I am glad y’all got a chance to see Kingin it and Eamon and Bec in Canada. It seems like a friendship you all need. So relieved to hear what type it is. No melanomas here!
Guys, don't minimize....it is scary,,,cancer is no joke, regardless. It was scary just watching the video never mind going through it all.   God Bless.  SPF ...Don't forget ears ..check
I'm so sorry you've been going through this. Thanks for the update and glad you have the all clear. My heart sank at the beginning of the video..Im so glad I watched to the end..I hope your head gets better soon. Wear that SPF people!!!
Im sorry u go thru this , i too found out last yr i had a pimple which wouldn’t heel ,i went to dermatologist and they said it was cancerous , i was shocked because i believed in psalms 91 . They did mohs surgery and cleared the spot . Now im dealing with lymes ,lol it never ends in this body of death but Jesus said all things are possible in him  right so theres great hope no matter the storm were in the middle of Jesus can be our hope and strength . Ty Jesus the enemy comes at us to try and take away life but Jesus ur the promise we have and yr life no matter the battle keep asking for deeper faith everyone Jesus is real and we can over come . Blessings. Canada ,wow Emon and Bec here we come :)
i’m happy this didn’t break your travel spirit. even if you wanted to “take a break” that’s fine too. loved nates grandpas quote.
Lots of prayers for you. Hope you have a speedy recovery
My heart dropped when I read that. Then I immediately turned to the comments. Thank goodness!
I'm so pleased that you're going to be okay. If nothing else, this video has made me pick up the phone and call my doctors about a raised mole on my hip that's been looking worse and worse for several years now... I'd buried my head in the sand a bit and told myself that I'm young so not to think about it, but you didn't make it look too scary :) Thanks for the push I needed👍🏻 Again, so pleased that you're both okay.
God bless you both...good news!
I have never been more happy from a video before, congratulations guys!
So courious why people are disliking at all
Thank you for sharing this difficult journey. Congratulations on beating this. I look forward to watching you both for many years to come. Blessings!
I’m so happy that you are cancer free you did so great in your surgery I pretty sure it was surgery I been waiting for another video I’m so glad your cancer free love yall

GWS Nate!!!
May blessings locate you today from all the corners of the earth and fill your life with peace. Have a beautiful Sunday.
❤️❤️❤️
:so i am sat here in tears and then you decided to monetize your cancer with a sponsor? I don't know, maybe this is the right moment to stop watching.you guys.
You guys are strong together, that’s enough to face anything that life throws at you!!
I hope it get beter soon and you over come this. Cancer of any kind isn't nice.
Wishing you both good health and lots of happy travels!😘
I am glad that Nate is better
Yep, crying along with Kara when y'all got the "all clear" call. So glad things are good!!
🥰
So glad you're okay.  Well done Team K&N for getting through a truly scary time.
Sending so much love to you both. Continue to heal and bask in gratitude for life and early detection. Collectively all of your tribe here is over the moon that you’ve been treated ❤️❤️
So glad you're okay Nate ❤️🌹
It’s so sweet how your main concern was Kara’s feelings. Sending you both lots of love, positive vibes, and prayers!!
I should add thats she's been cancer free for YEARS! ❤❤
I think that was really nice that you wanted to let everyone know what was going on that you had had cancer and there you were showing everyone around the world that you can survive at your young age and that doesn’t matter if you’re young or old you can get through this even in a pandemic
Glad you are doing fine. Hope you heal soon. Hope everyone remembers this when they compare their lives to influencers.    "What you see online is a curated highlight reel of what that person wants you to see"
Big love and hugs. Stay strong
Thank you for sharing - as someone who has went through something very similar sometimes you feel like you’re the only one. You know you’re not alone but at the same time you don’t see it often, so this is really helpful to see. Really. Thank you!
Serious or not serious, you both have become part of all of our families. We all really care about your health and safety. Thank you for being open to share with us. “I will restore your health, and I will heal your wounds,’ declares the lord.” Jeremiah 30:17
Hello Kara&Nate! I’m happy for you Nate that the skin cancer has been removed! In Prayer on your Behalf to God The Father for complete Healing in Christ Jesus Name! Big Fan of your Channel!! God Bless 😊
I'm so glad that they were able to get it out and that you're OK.  My Dad and aunt both had skin cancer and both also had it successfully removed, thank God.  I normally stay out of the sun like I'm a vampire as a result, lol.
I’m so glad you’re okay 💜
Prayers for you buddy.
I’m so happy for your recovery ❤️‍🩹 and that all it well. My mother went through a similar experience (right cheek) and the wait is the scary and most stressful part. It always good to have that support from love ones.
oh my gosh nate, i hope you are okay, sending my support over to you both!
Hi
Thanks god you are now good and safe nate !! 🥺❤️
Prayers to you brother you guys are awesome
You have to be a different kind of strong to provide us with such amazing content while dealing with  this behind the scenes. Respect and Love to both of you.
GOOD VIBES TO YALLL. I really love y'all and what y'all do.... y'all make me happy and I'm really glad y'all are being vulnerable with us.
Wow, I was playing piano as YouTube drops this Titel on my iPad. I was unable to play and started immediately with this video. Thank god you’re okay. I was so sad to hear that news and wish you’re both all the best.
Praying for you love yall
I actually got goosebumps reading the title, but I'm so glad that Nate is ok. I felt bad for him during the surgery. I had over 60 surgeries.
I am so happy that Nate is okay!! Safe travels! 💛
Thinking of you guys! Xx
You sharing this will no doubt be the push that someone needs to get their issue checked. Thank you!

Omfg so grateful that you are okay.🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺

Sending lots love and prayers to you guys. This made me shed a tear if not more but I have high hopes for you fam. 🌻
Just before the notification popped on my phone, I saw your insta post and my heart went from super sad to super glad in secs... However, for you all to have to go through the whole process would have been unimaginably hard and yet make the most amazing videos.. Love you both.. more strength and power to you guys.. cheers
So happy you are ok! Stay safe….
Crying 😭 watching this u2 mean a lot to us out here
Fuck Cancer now I know about 2 YouTubers that have cancer , the first one is Technoblade a famous Mcyt and now Nate

I love you Kara and Nate thanks Nate for sharing your story. Kara thank you for not making us cry and making this situation better than it looked.
I wish everyone the happiest lives they could live. You deserve it. You’re worth something, don’t ever doubt it. 💕
Only the best of health to you both.
Omg, so happy you're okay. Thank you for sharing,  it can certainly help people going through something similar but also to remind younger generations about skin cancer! What a perfect time to go visit Eamon and Bec too with the similar scares. God Bless!
🥰🥰🥰🥰
So happy Nate is now cancer free! I am glad you posted ...someone else might see this and get a spot checked out!  You are both awesome!!!
Praying for your speedy recovery
Thanks GOD for MODERN medicine.
Thank You both for sharing this with us. This is probably the most important video you have made so far. Love and blessings to you and everyone watching this video.
I can't imagine how hard it must've been to share this with everyone. Ya'll are each others best support system. I'm praying for Nate and for Kara as well. You'll get through this.
Im sitting here crying. Glad Nate is ok. Prayers for great health going forward! 🙏🙏
Love you guys! 💕💕So glad to hear Nate is healthy!!
Love you Nate! Trust in the Lord and His love for you! You and Kara are loved by so many!
Was watching this and was thinking about my mum.  She had the same thing years ago.  As I thought about the moment she commented about having a free facelift.  You said the same thing.  So glad you got the all clear.
Praise God!! So glad that Nate is well. My heart sank when I saw the C word. Blessings to you both. ❤️
I've had six or seven Basil Cell spots taken off with MOHS.  The best advice I can share is don't think about it and just move on.  It is just part of the aging process.    Btw, I used one of my MOHS surgeries to take a 2 week Virgin Island vacation complete with FB posts and pictures.  My boss didn't like that I was in VI on sick leave but there was nothing he could do, I was following the doctor's orders and restrictions.  It wasn't like taking sick days is equal to house arrest, you know.
Praying for y'all. I'm so thankful it wasn't more serious than it was. I'm sure a weight has been lifted off your shoulders after the surgery.
Kudos for documenting your journey. ✊🏻
holy cow. I got so scared after seeing the title of this video in my notifications. im really sorry that you had to go through something like that but im so glad that everything's over and Nate is good. wish you all the best <3
I am really sorry about you guys....I know the pain cause my mom was also fighting against cancer since last 3yrs and she passed way last week.I hope you recover soon,may god bless you both.
You're  young still so wear hats and sun block. I've had 3 cancers removed so far.
So glad to know that Nate is okay. Sending you both love and prayers
Health is the crown on the well man’s head that only the sick can see. I love that quote, I’ve never heard it but it gave me a moment to value all that I have and my family’s health. Glad you are both okay! Sending love 💖
My prayers are with you!! I am so glad and happy  that the cancer is gone!! I love your videos, they make they dream of traveling. But being handicapped doesn’t afford me the ability! Wishing you all the best! Sarah
Stage 4 cancer here, so my heart goes out to you 2…. Pls never take things for granted…but live ur life full tilt ahead….and cherish every moment…prayers to you both💜🙏🏻
So glad they caught it early......it just shows how vulnerable we can all be......happy travels guys !!
damn dude, im glad its not worse. Be safe and I hope you have a perfect recovery!
I was so worried to see that title but thank god ❤️
Because of you guys, I got betterhelp! And it's helped so so so so much. I'm so glad Nate is okay!
Your video title literally made my heart skip a beat. It's a relief to know you're fine. God bless you
Thank you for sharing this with us. Happy to hear that you are already clear. Get well soon and stay healthy you two! ❤ I really appreciate the wisdom of Nate's Grandfather - we really take often our health for granted and only in such situations we remember. Sending much love ❤
I'm glad everything worked out. 🙏🙏
Thank you for sharing your story, Nate! I can only imagine how hard the last few months have been. Thank you both for keeping things real.
Thank you for sharing the "not-so-great" part of life along with the super fantastic parts! I'm hoping your head didn't hurt too much for too long. Enjoy Canada and can't wait to see you with "you-know-who" there. lol
I had exactly the same thing on my face. Had 1st op at the beginning of lockdown ; had to have a second op to make sure it was all gone, but it's healed now and all good. So I hope that is a bit of reassurance for you. 💕
I hope you feel better soon and I pray for you best recovery.
Thank g-d it’s was not life threatening and I know it’s was a hard thing to go through but we are all hear supporting you and Kara and we are sending out love and prayers to you guys it’s something scary to go though and I can’t imagine what your thoughts had been during this time
IM SO HAPPY THAT YOUR CANSER FREE I LOVE YOU KARA AND NATE♥♥♥♥
Best wishes Nate! Thank you for sharing!
Thanks for showing the not so good.  A necessary PSA.  I've had a significant amount of basil cell areas removed from my scalp.  I consider it a free face lift on the side as they pulled the surrounding skin upward as well.  Of all the cancers, its the least life threatening but should be treated to avoid worse situations.  I now treat every spot with concern and will continue to do so.  EDIT:  Yes wear sunscreen all the time.
God is good!
Kara trying her best to keep it together and be strong for Nate broke my heart. </3 So glad you got it sorted out this quickly!
So thankful you’re now cancer free. Thank you so much for sharing this vulnerable side to you. Remember you’re stronger than what you think. Keep going & hope you remain cancer free ♥️♥️♥️ xxx
Maaan your so great! I respect you!
Nate, I am yet to watch the video, but the title really shocked me for a second. Am so relieved that you are healing. Take some time off to rest, relax and heal. Take Care ❤️ will keep you and Kara in my thoughts (as always) 😊
Go celebrate 🎉 Some might call This a little victory  But this is a huge  Victory  💞💞💞
So glad you're ok!
Wel this was a roller coaster 🎢 of emotions. Glad to hear you are doing good Nate. No type of cancer is fun and it is always a time to reflect when going through something like that no matter how small it is. I am glad you are doing better now and can’t wait to see what comes next! Also good job for Kara for keeping it together! 👍🏼
I’m so glad that you’re all clear now! Safe travels!
My mom recently passed from lymphoma, I completely understand what your going though
You are lucky they caught it early and it didn't get a chance to spread to worse. Now he needs to start wearing a hat when outside in the sun.
I am so thankful that Nate is cancer free. Love you guys.
Congrats on the good outcome and thanks for sharing!
Glad the situation turned out as good as possible! Hope yall have a great time in Canada. I'll be exploring southern Canada in early December.
Thank you for sharing this with us. Just know that whatever happens, there are 2.62 million people (and more!) who are here by your side! Very happy it’s cancer free! Sending lots of love <3
Love you guys!!! 💗💗💗
Ah my heart broke when I read the title. I’m so glad you’re cancer-free Nate!! I’m proud of both of you for being so brave and I wish you both a safe, and healthy future! ❤️
proud of y'all... sending loads of love from India.
love you guys!!
Glad you are on the other side now. Take care!
I hope everything else goes well. I know it might’ve been hard to share but y’all are amazing. Safe travels, and don’t forget your ears!
Been watching you guys for years. Wish Nate all the best. Stay strong and stay safe.
My aunt has scars all over her body from having skin cancer. It's definitely not something fun. Thank you for sharing your story. ❤
Love you guys!❤️ hope you all are ok!
So happy it was not more serious!! 🤗
Kara, I have to disagree with you. There are no major and minor cancers. Cancer is cancer and it is frightening. I am 14 years with incurable cancer.. you are so blessed and fortunate.
Thank you for sharing your story Nate. I'm sure it will be a ray of hope for someone going through the same thing. Congratulations on being cancer free
damn, thats hella crazy. just found out my grandma has breast cancer yesterday. which sucks bc she's been paralyzed for over 30 years bc of a car accident, now this. health is wealth 🌞
Such an insightful video. So glad that you’re okay Nate. Well done for staying so strong for him Kara! Sending love from Manchester, England x
So glad y'all are seeing health as a major priority. I wanna see videos for the next 70 years!
Wow just wow, thank you for sharing. Such a lovely partnership you two together. Love your channel and you sharing your life with us all. Best of wishes always for you guys

Wishing for speedy recovery ♥️
Another youtuber, Chris from B is for build also was diagnosed with cancer (melanoma) . Hope everything goes well for you Nate.
Glad you’re ok! I had my first Basal cell at 33 and had MOHS too. 🙂
Now I won’t take SPF for granted , even on the ears hahaha
Good God I hope you are okay...you are my favorite YouTube couple ❤️
Dammit man, this is the only time ever that i was hopping this was click bait, eventhough you are not a clickbaiter. I hope all is well man, you guys are like family and we care about you
Glad Nate is ok! And yes, wear the sunscreen! I worked with cancer patients for 3 1/2 years and it’s a terrible toll! Keep taking care of yourselves! Take any time you need! ❤️❤️❤️
im so sorry you can get through this i belive in you!!❤❤
Thinking of both of you. So thankful Kara is there to support you and help you as you have such a tough event happen in your life. You got this!
Sending the both of you alll the love and strength and healthy adventures ahead.💚
Omg! Thank you for sharing. Skin cancer is more common than people think. Wear sunblock as much as possible and avoid the strong hours of the sun if possible.
Proud of you Nate, top lad 👊🏼
So glad you’re safe and healthy!!! take care plsss!!! ❤️
💜💜💜
😮😮😮 I hope your journey through this goes well. Thanks for sharing. You have proven many times, from what I've seen,  that you are a strong, resilient person. I would have never guessed that you were going through this.
I wish you a speedy recovery and say hi to eamon and bec for me I hope you have a wonderful day.
I'm glad it wasn't worse! Speedy recovery Nate! 💖
Happy to hear you are cancer free. Both of you are truly an inspiration.
Love to you both. Glad you got the all clear Nate x
Thanks for sharing.  I (too) just had a basal cell removed from my forehead.  I ignored it for about 3 years.  So foolish on my part.  Moral to this story:  protect your skin and pay attention to suspicious spots.
(After watching) Oh thank goodness I freaked out when I saw the thumbnail. Thank you for sharing it with us.
Thanks for sharing....yes it is easy to see online people as having it all together and not facing big issues.....but this is real life!!!! And watching this on one of the crappiest days of this year, it gave me encouragement and will to keep on going!!!!! Praying for complete healing of the wound, Nate 🙏🙏🙏
I’m glad Kara is doing well being brave! I on the other hand am about to cry.
Thank you for sharing. Ever since I started working in an OR and seeing how common it is, I've been a fanatic about wearing sunscreen, hats, clothing with sun protection, etc.
OOO Fuck
Way to cover his eyes Kara while showing how big a chunk of Nates head they took out. Hope Nate never watches the video. Hope you have a speedy recovery Nate.
Praying for you!! You’re my heroes!
🤍🤍🤍🤍

Omg nooooooo!!!! Everyone my dad knows who has had a biopsy has died within that year!!! Don't die nate!!! Love you guys!!! Nate you guys stay healthy so I hope all is well!! Have you guys in my thoughts!!! Stay well guys!!!
Been there, done that. Several times with moles on my body. (Only one has been cancerous.) It is still nerve wracking. Now, make sure you are consistent with annual dermatologist visits! (Also, the burning smell grosses me out too.)
Wish you both well ✨
Thank you so much for making this video 💕
Sending prayers and best wishes to both if you.
I am so glad that you are OK finding out that you had cancer is hard I survive cancer

I have a benign lesion on my chest, I was told I can have it removed, or not ... I've been putting it off because I too don't really like to go to the doctor.
We forget that the sun is radiation….You two are outdoors all the time…Bound to happen .
This video was a rollercoaster of emotions.  Sending lots of love and prayers!!!❤

So glad everything turned out good. My husband had Moses surgery inside his ear. They actually did a small skin graft inside his ear. Everything is great and no scar!  Bad news is he is prone to this and visits his dermatologist every three months now!
I pray all the blessing for u Nate and Kate. God and divine is with u. Thank u for trusting us and sharing. We love u from India and all over the world.

Stay strong.
I am your subscriber form India 🇮🇳
Early and I've been watching your videos for moths now you videos are amazing!
Hi
hope you the best!
Thank you so much for sharing this, most of the time you guys seam super human. And it's good to be reminded that no one is. I also shread a tear for you and I wish you all the best and send you lots of love. Your channel has been a light in dark times, and truly inspiring.
So glad that Nate’s ok! Blessings on y’all’s future travels 🙏
Glad to hear they got all of it. Skin cancer is no joke. We're from Australia and skin cancer is really common where we're from. Good thing you caught it early and got it treated.
I am praying for you 🙏😔
Nate, your story is exactly like mine. I had a scab that didn’t heal on my forehead for 2 years that I finally got checked out. It was basal cell carcinoma and I got Moh’s surgery (I was the youngest in the office by 50 years 😂). The surgery really wasn’t that bad and I haven’t had any reoccurrence. Thanks for posting this video. It will help so many people go get checked and take care of problematic spots.
praying for y’all ❤️ thank you for sharing your story
Wishing you will recover nice and we'll, and hopefully soon. It was a shock hearing this and will pray for all the strength to you and for your loved ones.
Omg i was literally shaking when i saw the notification of the video ,  i m glad its not so serious and nate is fine ,, come on guys don’t scare us … please takecare happy for you both ^^
Kara and Nate, you guys are so amazing and strong! You’re an inspiration and to see your personal experiences it’s beautiful you two are a wonderful team
Hope you are all better soon. When you said you went to the first dermatologist and they said infected hair folicle I just shook my head. Some dermatologist don’t really care to give anytime to check you out and actually investigate the situation. I had my own bad experience this past March where a dermatologist quickly looked at my skin and diagnosed me with Rosacea and gave me a cream to use. That cream gave me such a bad reaction that I am still trying to recover from the effects of it almost 7 months later. If the dermatologist had properly warned me about the medication and actually looked at me as whole person maybe she wouldn’t have prescribed it and I could have enjoyed this past half year. Sorry I just feel so frustrated for you that you were initially misled by a dermatologist that didn’t properly exam you. Best of luck to you!!
Thanks for sharing your story.  We love you!
Get well soon Nate.. you are strong you will definately get through it💜
STAY STRONG
i’m keeping you in my prayers ❤️❤️
😟😟😟 So sad to hear that.Stay strong.
prayers for yall ! we appreciate you guys !!✊

Sending loads of love & good wishes ❤💕💖 My husband had similar, he,s OK now though...
It broke me reading the title 😔. I’m so sorry this happened but I truly believe that you will make it through this difficult time, you are a trooper, an inspiration, and a light in this world and I know that even cancer can’t put that light out. 🤍 I watched the video further and I am so happy that everything is ok!
IM SO SORRY FOR YOU

The cure for Cancer is Soya Lecithin capsules you can get from the CVS Pharmacy. I have saved over 175 people. The capsules are 1200 mg and take three 1200 mg Lecithin capsules twice daily with a full glass of water 💦. I also give them to my dog.
Sending positive healing thoughts and lots of love Nate 💛
Just so you’re not watching in suspense - please know that Nate is officially cancer free, and we are so grateful 🙌🏻 He just has a hefty wound that’s taking awhile to heal, and has to get checked yearly for the rest of his life 😅  Wear your sunscreen 😎 Don’t forget your ears 👂🏻 and remember you are not alone in your struggles. We all have ups and downs. You are so loved and appreciated.  Thank y’all so much for the ongoing love and support 💞
Hope you are doing good now. TC. Sending lot and lots of prayers for you .

Congratulations for being cancer-free!  You guys are so strong to be able to go through all of that. I, from the very bottom of my heart, hope that you will remain cancer-free!
I hate this year. I've lost someone to ovarian cancer back in May and two of my friends have come down with cancer. I'm wishing you the best, Nate. Speedy recovery. You got this.
Man, this has got to be the toughest challenge yet. Heal up, my guy! 🙏
Well now my question seems so much less pressing! I am a burgeoning travel vlogger who was interested in taking your premier pro course but every time I try to download it it wouldn’t let me. Am I doing something wrong? Or did the course come down?
My cousin’s  grandpa had skin cancer and he is fine .Nate you will fine
Wishing you continued good health!! 🤍🤍
We love you even God loves you more th anybody we praying for you my brother
you are the 2nd channel that had came out now with having skin cancer. Its crazy to me at how young people are now and getting diagnosed with it. Either that's good on you guys from getting it check. Or just shows how advanced with have gotten at detecting it early. Hope for a fast and speedy recovery on your way to being cancer free <3
God bless
Early!!
