Stop saying Erling Braut Haaland, you tosser!
As a rangers fan because of the snp and the racist tartan army ive lost the Scotland cause but I enjoyed tha
STAY HUMBLE NORWAY!
Build in Paisley ❤
John McGinn: "Yeaaaah!" Scott McTominay: "Come on!!!"
I keep coming back to this because its all i have.
Haaland so talented he has to cheat, Norwegians must be embarrassed
Very good
Come on Scotland, it's Germany tonight 👏👍
@1.33😊
Love the Referees non-reaction when McLean scored. ( What just happened.)😮
It's wierd Haaland is unbelievable for City But when he plays for Norway He's crap
HAALAND PLAYS FOR A CHEATING CLUB THAT BREAK ALL THE RULES AND THROWS HIMSELF TO THE FLOOR FOR THE PENALTY CHEATING JUST RUNS THROUGH THE BLOOD OF MANCHESTER CITY PEPS CHEAT BOOK BUT THANKFULLY SCOTLAND WON THIS KARMA WILL OUT ⚽🥅🏐
4:40 THAT commentary is pure passion. It means a lot for the tartan army. From a pole, well done.
RIP Benny Harvey

Shuv yer poxy union
Back to watch again after the Euro draw lads!!!  Mikey Stewart seems to celebrate the winner before it’s even in? Must have had a good angle.
yyaaaas!
The setup for the second Scottish goal is perfection
Imagine a country given the best salmon, whisky and great people the God must have loved Scotland 😃👏
The commentators when the equaliser and winner goes in..... epitome of the whole of Scotland...
Hearing the commentator scream "YAASSS!" sums up all of Scotland in the moment of equaliser.
OVERRATED USELESS HALAAND.NOT A TEAM PLAYER AT ALL.DO IT AT INTERNATIONAL  LEVEL WHERE YOU CANT HAVE 5 TOUCHES IN A GAME.COMPLETELY USELESS.PEOPLE EXAGERRATING SAYING HE IS THE BEST PLAYER IN THE WORLD AND THE FUTURE OF STRIKERS AND FOOTBALL BECAUSE HE SCORES A FEW GOALS IN THE KICK AND RUSH 100 MILE AN HOUR PREM 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂HE DOESNT REALISE THAT BEING AT MAN CITY IS AFFECTING HIS  GAME IN A BAD WAY
"Here's Armstrong, do Scotland have something else up their sleeve here. McTominay, if Dykes can get the flick on here. It's John McGinn, It's Dykes, its Ma Graaaaaaaaaan" My gran Scored the winner
Karma at its best .. Haaland cheating for pen  Come on Scotland!
Who’s back here after Scotland qualified?
You can see in haalands face, he dived, and he just looks guilty, but in the end, scotland win, i am from Liverpool, but i want scotland to do well, more than england la.
Very good at Scott and Kelly McLean
Mctominay... if Dykes can get the flick on... it's McGinn... it's Dykes... Mcleaaaaaaaaannnnnnn!!!!
That 2nd goal is world class, go on Scotland. 🍺🍺🍺
Watching this in September, Scotlands 2nd goal was pure class.
Commentator is cheering before the balls went in!  :D
A little prayer: please do not screw up at the latter stages of qualification and if we make it, could we please make it out of the first stage? Thank you.
The defence of norway tho 😂
Watching this again waiting for Friday Vs Cyprus a win in that match will be enough to get us over the line and off to Germany next summer and I will be there
I’m a Norwich fan, well done Kenny! 🔰🔰🔰
this is one video I never tire of rewatching
Haaland, talented but made a fool of himself on that Hollywood dive.
BAHAHAHAHAHAHA.

Going to be an awkward return leg if an Orkney referendum happens
Saturday 17th June 2023
Cmon
I could watch that second Scotland goal a million times n a million times again <3 Moan the SCOTTS!!!
That`s what happens when you move the ball forward rather than the dire defensive pish we witnessed for 80 minutes. We make average teams look like champions, they are 44th in the rankings.
Never a penalty
That winning goal is prime barca
Great striker, but big dirty diving bastart, never a pen, GIRFUY :)
Here for my 2,437th view. Does anyone know a helpline to get back moving with normal life?
Keep Michael Stewart on commentary... Class 😂
come on Scotland  🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
When my club West Bromwich Albion sacked stevie Clarke, i said it was a huge mistake, west brom have gone tits up and scotland have gone into another stratosphere, under this great man have gone into dreamland.
They bet the Vikings 🇳🇴.Well done Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
That ball from Mctominay that lead to the 2nd goal was class. Pin point precision.
Magnitude of magic magnificence, marvelous
That 2nd goal was a thing of beauty ❤ fair play

Days later and whats ringing in my head. Mctominay, Its John Mcginn, Its Dykes, Its Maclean! You could literally make a song out of that commentary, Mctominay, Its John Mcginn, Its Dykes, Its Maclean, the boys in blue,  as they do , at it once again
Haaland ghosting again💀
what a shameful dive from Haaland
Always love hearing the Scottish commentators when Scotland or Scottish clubs score crucial goals
Diving rat. Roy Keane will say the same about his father. haha
Cmon Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 what a comeback cmon
Why all the love for Scotland from English fans? They hate us
One man team in Norway.
Well done Scotland, from a jags fan 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
you all saying cheating dive about Haaland now sure Imo that was a dive  or maybe even a slip but to call him a diver after like 1-2 dives is crazy yall hears of neymar?
👍🏻
I know the feeling is hardly ever reciprocated but as an England fan, I'm always happy to see Scotland win. Had goosebumps when they scored the winner. Hope you go far guys!
Means nothing.   They won't even get past the group stages.
HI I  AM NOT A SCOT BUT THAT WAS FANTASTIC.
What a goal that second was!
FFS,How unlucky and crappy Norway have slumped to, couldn't see anyone losing to shotland .

As an Englishmen, I'm glad for my fellow brothers - Scotland - Norway are a tough team GREAT WIN. 🇬🇧❤️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Class assist from Dykes on that second goal there. Great job Scotland!
I'm half scottish I hate England. What a game
Michael Stewart is shocking , terrible from him, hate ye
Well done scotland from an English man
What a game it was Scotland top top result 👏👏👏👏👏👏Liam cooper had a cracking game as well MOT🤍💙
payback for cheating haha haaland
I live in Scotland for 12 years. Congratulations Brothers, I had a tears on my eyes after 2th goal. Well done
Mad Scotland man ❤
What's the point of VAR if it's not used!The most expensive player on the field is a cheat and a booking would have been the correct decision!  Nityananda
Scotlands on fire
Omg,just watched this and my heart is pumping!!!🎉🎉🎉good luck for Tuesday night🎉🎉🎉🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿❤️
'its John McGinn... Its Dykes... Its McLean!' YAAAAAASSSSSSSSS great commentary
Sad to see Erling’s diving, he is better than that
As a Welsh lad I love Scotland and love seeing them succeed!! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿👏💪🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Under the cosh most of the game, but Dykes never stopped running and was feeding on scraps but the big man does the business again. Lovely little assist for McLean.
Funny how haaland is an absolute unit who runs through everyone then he meets the Scot’s and he’s falling over like a peace of paper
well done to our scottish cousins in the north 👏🏻
The best Scottish side
Terrible dive by Haaland. Learned that at the tin pot club he's at now.
3:47 the passion from big John! 😂
Great result but let's just keep our feet on the ground until the Georgia game. A win on Tuesday night, we can then have a few celebrations
Take Harland out of that city team and he's just average
YAS!
Believe it or not we were on the moterway back from our Norwegian cruise and just passed the Scottish border when we scored both goals!😆 What a welcome back into the country we were treated to haha!!
How good are Scotland looking now under Clarke! Wonder where they are inFIFA rankings? Good work. PDW
Wow! What a great comeback from Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Never a penalty
Scotland will flourish 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Second Scotland goal was class.
1:53 you can see Ødegaard trying to choke haaland because he took the title away from us 🤣
This is the best team scotland have had in years,such a difference, unbelievable style of play ,well done lads,from a english /newcastle fan
😮😮
Haaland is overated
Norway deserved to lose, when you cant provide the worlds best  striker any good chances, except a  controversial  pen, thats a poor team.
I would give my right arm to have seen this played in Scotland. The noise of an entire stadium filled with Scots when that last goal went in would have been something else entirely. Well played Scotland!
Beat Georgia and we're through.
Wish Wales was doing this well 😭well done Scotland.
well done Scotland - from an Irishman. Keep up the good work
As a QPR fan I’m shocked to see dykes score and assist or do either 😉😂
Has there ever been more of a one-man team than Norway right now? They take Haaland off with 5 mins left and go from 1-0 to 1-2. Pleased for Scotland though
You got to wonder why Man U fans think McTominay isn't Man U class. Two goals against Spain, and his touch and ball for the second here was sublime. Hope he signs for Newcastle.
Haarland is the cry baby of football. He should have got sent off for that blalent dive.  Really happy that Scotland won. They fully deserved it.
Well earned, Haaland ought to be embarrassed for throwing himself down like that. Biggest bloke on the pitch and he does that, pathetic.
well done scotland. have to say the commentary at the end! amazing! thats passion!!!
As a haaland fan that was a dive
Disgraceful pen...ref nearly cost Scotland a perfect start. These dodgy refs are not fit for purpose.
The smackheads won a game, woohoo
The comments have been amazing. Obviously there was huge bit of luck but both goals were taken well.
Norway have got to be the biggest underachievers ever, best striker in the world and odegaard and they can’t even beat Scotland and Georgia
We are determined to be in Germany (and how is Georgia 2nd in front of spain
As a Lithuanian living in Scotland I'm so proud of this team. Also spotted the Ukrainian flag amongst the Scottish fans and just want to say a massive thank you for supporting Ukraine, to an extent where the support is shown abroad too ❤
Hung in there like a real team and perhaps we got the breaks we never seem to get. It doesnt matter - 2-1 Scotland and we top the Pool. Well done Steve and the Bois  🎉
Saddened to see Haalland dive like that.
Modern football at it's most Comical.
I’m a Haaland fan, but he deserved to lose after that dive.
Why were Scotland celebrating their equalizer, when they were wasting time?
Every team cheats, but it doesn't make it right
Haaland another cheap cheat
2nd goal, one of the greatest goals scored. That was pure beauty!! Art 👏👏👏👏❤❤
Best scenes since Leigh Griffiths ❤
Great result from Steve Clark and the boys.👏👏👏 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿. Solid performance and what a finish! Class commentary too, makes a great change from the miserable bbc sods.
I hope haaland is ok after he was smashed to the Ground for the penalty. I'm surprised the defender was shown a straight Red .what a cheating bstd  Anyway justice was done as the lads never gave up and it's a massive 3 points. Well done Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Brazil would have been proud of that 2nd goal
Well done scotland, it's normal that scotland loose in the last minute, lucky yes but we done, scotland due a wee break glad that they got it...
That lay off from Dykes to McLean is a thing of beauty.
52 goals in 53 games and still a diving cunt haha
Well done Scotland, from AussieMart down in Stoke.
Congratulations on beating norway lol
Ha😂 fk Norway
Porteous gives away a penalty, why is he even in the squad, Hibs was his level.
Great goal to win! Scored 8.5 for Harlan’s dive, Tom Daley would have been proud of that one lol 😂
The never say die attitude of this team says it all. Lyndon Dykes having a far bigger impact than Haaland says it all.
Not defending Haaland but possibly an explanation A few minutes earlier he had went down in the box and quickly bounced back up. A lot of the Norway players weren't happy with him Next time in the box he dropped like he had been shot. Ref bought it.
Scotland were terrible in this game. Haaland was just as bad until his dive. We didn't deserve to win but then again neither did a non penalty.
Well played scotland and im english
Some goal to win it! Well done Scotland
It’s a bit early but I fell like we might win 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Haaland should’ve been booked for that . Dive clear as day .
Haaland with dishonest penalty got the Norge pay the price..
Never a penalty.
Best Scottish team in decade! Just a shame were not an independent country yet!❤🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
This is brilliant!! Well done, Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 As an English person, this is lovely to watch! ❤️
Talk about a turn around.
take that Haaland you diving cheat
It's been a long time, but this current national team is making me so proud to be a Scot again. Fantastic work Steve Clarke has achieved with this team 💙
Not an excellent performance but an excellent resujt
I’m Scottish, and was never really a football fan, but I did go to the 1977 World Cup qualifier against Wales at Anfield. First time I’ve had a feeling of real potential for the Scottish team since then!
Un fucking believable from Scotland
Great goal fair play
Haaland the cheat still lost 💀💀💀
Hold that diving bastards
Haaland ballin dor what a laugh
Well done lads.
Steve Clarke deserves a lot of praise, he is an outstanding coach/manager. Man management skills, tactics, knows how and when to change things. EPL for him before to long unfortunately
World class forwards, pub class defenders for Norway
Norway and the ref got what they deserved
Yesss g, Scotland just won me 16 quid bless up
I thought this is Norway not Arsenal
🎉❤ Well done lads showing the grit and determination o the Scottish played some brilliant football well deserved 🎉 scalped a few big names on the way we proud o the team ❤
Justice done well deserved Scotland. Now go and win the group. From an Englishman ..
Well done Scotland, 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
that second goal was epic
Englishmen happy for a Scotland win 🤔…get a grip…obviously looking for likes 👍….
What a Scottish match
Thankyou Englishman , Scotland r finally a team to be reckoned with, imagine a Scotland v England quarter,semi or a freeking final in the euros , let's have Mon the scots ⚽😉👌💙.
That lay off for the winner was boss!
We may hate each other when we play each other and though our brotherly nations Wales ,Scotland and northern Ireland may cheer for England's opponents I still root for fellow brits well done Scottish keep it up😊.
They have (probably) the World's best striker but also the World's worst defence!! How did that work out?🤣😂😀😆😅🤣
Lovely comeback from Scottish players. It is a very very clever to bring it in near the end where the opposition has no time recover
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Well Done Scotland.
im up to about 15-20 times watching these highlights..hair stands on end every time
Well done Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 👏 justice served.
Evidence that halasnd is just nothing and its gis team mates at mancity who make gim score goals. That is a test of how good a player is to bring his team not his team bringing him
Haaland dive to get a " great " goal well the dive and the bad decision would not be a great goal
Haaland’s size and strength and he went down like that? Learning to cheat with cheating city no bother isn’t he? Pathetic but justice was done, on we go Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
come on you sweaty socks!
RESPECT HAALAND 💙💙💙😠😠😠😠😠
Scott mctominney winds me up .been praising this lad at utd for years and then when he plays for his national team . He is incredible
Scott McTominay beat Erling Haaland 😂😂
Why are Scottish players screaming Vamo/Vamos 😂
Well done Scotland / you’ll win this tournament / I can feel it coming 👍
(Winston Ingram )Scotland ,Scotland, 🧻🧻🧻think you might be needing that rest of the world , you must be shiteing yourself 😂😂😂🏴‍☠️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴‍☠️
Germany Germany and all that
Wow the passes for the goals I lost count ,great show by the lads,best Birthday wakened up to that 👏🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
The joy on the Scottish players faces brings a tear to the eye.
John McGinn roaring 😂all the feels ❤
amazing
Kinda sad that they needed this that bad
if brazil or man city scored that 2nd scotland goal everyone would be talking about it. team play from back to front. excellent stuff
The wee Norway guy feigning injury when he assists Dykes, love it
PenLand  will never be like Penaldo or Pepsi 😎😎
Folk forget that this is a relatively YOUNG Scotland squad but if Steve Clarke wants us to improve and evolve technically then he has to now unleash our wonderkids into the equation to really go to next level football...   Leon King (CB) Rangers  Nathan Paterson (RB) Everton  Alex Lowry (CM/AM) Rangers  Ben Summers (LW/AM/RW) Celtic  Ben Doak (LW/AM/RW) Liverpool  Rory Wilson (ST) Aston Villa  We hold our most talented kids back far too long hence our slow progress producing youngsters. Most other nations play their wonderkids at 16/17 and that's why some evolve into World Class players... it's not rocket science, no Einstein equation needed!!
Another Englishman here to congratulate the Scots. What a comeback and those commentators were epic :)
Go home Norway 😂
Disappointed as usual with so called (world class) players cheating. The media in his future interviews will not mention you're a diving/cheating git or face any punishment from FIFA or his team... Well done Scotland
Erling Haaland , hiiccc , still half stewed ....
Assuming Haaland wasn't injured, it seems strange that the Norwegian coach substituted him before the end. It was as if Norway were settling for the draw, which seems a bit negative. For those of us old enough to remember the qualifiers for the 1966 World Cup, what really did it for Scotland then was a home defeat to Poland, who were not very good at the time, despite Scotland beating Italy at Hampden in the group. So I am not getting my hopes up just yet.
The play for the 2nd was class
A pHaantastic win!
Haaland being coached by the pep penalty coaching system…..!! Justice done…..we are the people….!⚽️⚽️
well done scotland
Such a shame that some of the world's greatest strikers like Haarland, Gareth Bale and Harry Kane dive like that. It totally detracts from their talent and is the sort of cheating we used to laugh at foreigners for doing. No doubt people like Iam Wright will say 'he buys a lot of penalties'. That means he cheats. Give him an honour....
Another Englishman happy for Scotland winning - but more than anything that penalty is an absolute disgrace. The idea that the towering 6'5 Haaland was floored by that minescule little nudge is laughable. Obvious dive.
Bro Haaland is just gonna be another Zlatan.😂
So Proud. ❤
I was watching the 2nd half on the bus from Edinburgh my phone died just before the goal 😂
Norway, your boys took one hell of a beating.
Haaland learning the dark arts of cheating at Mancheaters City. Glad  that penalty meant nothing.
Brilliant result.
Woah Scotland broke the comments section lol! Was that Scotland at the end or Brazil? Ruined my bet lol should’ve cashed out 🙈 but I couldn’t be happier for you - bloody awesome! 👍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Even though I'm English it's great to see Scotland doing so well. Great game and a fantastic team goal at the end. Look forward to beating you in the euros 😅
People saying it wasn't a penalty and yet hardly any of the Scottish players objected to the decision.
Nice dive Haaland !! Should have worn swimming trunks instead of football shorts !
Absolutely brilliant love hearing the commentators going mental!
amazing
Awesome Scotland great comeback, from an England fan
What the shite game… hahahahaha
Get it right up ye Haaland!
Excellent result!
amazing
Proud 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Another Englishman here well done to Scotland,very soft pen well done to Kenny and Angus Gunn from a Norwich city fan
2nd goal was class
Haaland went down too easy. The ref should've seen that.
Genius tactic taking off Halaand thanks from a Scotland fan
Tf is that defending it's horrible, how do these guys make it proffesional
Love these moments this Scotland team can produce bringing close friends from the old firm a reason to enjoy football and celebrate together and I fucking love it!
amazing
If only we had a striker like jordan, then i would definitely say we had a chance of actually winng it.
Powderpuff penalty! Big Jessie!!
Well done Scotland from a Englishman nice to see revenge when players cheat for penalties 👍
Diving prick
*YYYEEESSS!!!* Scotland deserved that win more than any I’ve seen in a long time. I like Haaland as a player, but that was one of the most obvious dives I’ve seen in ages!! And then to add insult to injury the ref books Porteus! Where was VAR? It must’ve pissed off to the bog at that bit…. Scotland deserved that win for their dogged tenacity and refusal to quit. The look on those Norwegian players and fans faces was priceless, even more so as it usually the other way round. But after the Spain game and now this, Scotland have got that bit of belief back in their squad that makes all the difference.  *SCOTLAND!🤩🤩🤩🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿*
That result will do just nicely, thank you very much.👍  Given the presence of a certain player on the pitch for the Norwegians, the significance of this result cannot be underestimated.  Well done, Scotland.👏
Massive physical striker falls to the floor from a little shirt tug
Where was VAR on the blatant dive by Haaland? Brilliant result Scotland - from an Englishman.
Looks like halaand will never will world cup 😂
26 and I have never seen scotland like this its great❤
I am Scottish but want all the British sides to do well, except if we play each other. Friendly rivalry. Scotland have been brilliant.
Well done Scotland
A beautiful summer's evening in Oslo, ideal time of year to be playing the fixture.
Has Erling Haaland been training with Tom Daley?
You've got probably the best player in the world on current form and you take him off holding a 1-0 lead 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Never a pen glad Scotland came back fully deserved after a shite call I wanna see Scotland at the euros probably the only Englishman who does haha
Referee has Haaland posters on his bedroom walls.
Dom Hyam🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Norwegian tv producers chose the worst camera angle of the Haaland dive. There’s probably 10+ different angles yet they choose that one.
That was a total dive from Haaland. Both had hold of each other, he just hits the deck.
That was some game, well played Scotland and those two quick goals. Amazing. John McGinn is always there to set up a goal, what a player.
The commentary the goal the limbs I love it 😍
Viaplay gotta be the worst. Barely shows the haaland penalty incident. Such a bad angle
Haaland began the shoving match which he ended by diving. Justice done.
I’m English and proud but really glad the Scots look to have a quality side going forward. Steve Clarke is doing a proper job.
Absolutely embarrassing commentary. You're supposed to be unbiased. Absolutely embarrassing! Talking about penalties not being penalties when they were lucky not to have 2 against them. Just soo biased!!!!
Is it to early early to get the flights booked for Germany?
Embarrassing that the penalty was given, both were at each other but one jumps on the floor; pathetic. So pleased for Scotland; beautiful winning goal. Felt like justice to be honest. Come on Scotland, please make the next Euros. Such a great opportunity.
Joke of a penalty. Well done Scotland!
This one’s for you GORDON MCQUEEN ❤ RIP legend ❤️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Haar land is shit for norway plus cheated for thr penalty
As a City fan I found Haalands behaviour rather disappointing.
Well done Scotland! Just goes to show! Without those big team players around Halaand. He struggles! He had to resort to DIVING to win a chance 6 yards out! I honestly can’t believe it! A really tough group and we sit top with maximum points! I’m honestly punching myself! I hope this dream never ends!
I think Scotland can lift the trophy, put my house on it
That second goal was absolute quality. Not a Scot but this is the best team they have had for a long time
This is the greatest Scottish side I’ve witnessed in my 20 years on earth. Disappointment after disappointment… year after year… this is a new era and I for one could not be prouder to be a Scotsman. Well done lads  Ps. Erling Haaland disgusting dive for that penalty
Not bad at all for a football minnow.
Wye aye man
Only good with a team full of 100mill plus players 😂😂
Fantastic result!! The patient build up and execution of the 2nd goal was world class!!
Please Haaland don't be C. Ronaldo please...that was a cr level dive difficulty.
Nicked it!! Gotta love the beautiful game
mcginn is some player for scotland
Dive
Great recovery after Haalands shameful  penalty dive.😂
Looks like this has left Norway  with a fight with Spain for 2nd place
Haaland is a diving bastard lol
Well done Scotland you deserved that great win and this from a Englishman 😂😂
Allan McGregor would saved that 😂😂
Sponny Botland 🥴
Crazy how we are going to win the euros 😂
who is halland? lol
What a great 2nd goal.  As an English man, I hope that Scotland progress through a major tournament - it's been way too long.  My boyhood heroes include Hendry and Gallacher, so I've always wanted Scotland to do well.  This seems a proper team again, so fingers crossed for some good times.
Well done Scottie land. Bit of a lame penalty, Herland is a beast. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Well done my porridge hovering friends over the wall. Proud of you.
Haaland has been learning under Peps dark arts
Scotland's second goal was simply world class
I thought the standard of refereeing was truly awful, no card for Norway 4 for Scotland. Hadnt realised until now how dirty a player Haaland is.  Fantastic comeback from Scotland and it was deserved , more dangerous going forward.  9pts from 9 Georgia next at Hampden,  wont be underestimating them but beat them and only Spain can stop us.
steve clarke has done an outstanding job 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 finally starting to see it all come together 👏  he deserves a lot of praise 💪
"but Haaland is so good" Yeah crazy how he isnt so good when his team isn't paid for
Football team seems to have improved since the SNP crashed and burned.🤔🤔🤔
"But Haaland is so good..."
Think we will win the euros this is our time haha but  clarke has built something special solid defence made us hard to beat can tell just with the offside trap how they stepped out perfect time and every norwegian wad offside thats players working as a team
The great one turns out to be a diving tosser.😮...well done Scotland 💯
Ha ha ha ha wee Scotland beat Norway !!! What a laugh 🤣🤣👏👏👏👏
Beat Georgia twice and Cyprus and we're there
Cheating harland HAHA
Haaland likes to boggie 😂 Well done Scotland I will always support you over any other team but england 😄👍. #englandfan
As a Eskimo I'm over the moon for Scotland. As a Zimbabwian it doesn't matter that your English and your happy for Scotland.
Poor haaland. He will NEVER win a world cup or european cup with playing for norway. Cos norway are crap.
Feels absolute amazing
Congratzzz to Scotland from your neighbour in England, well done lads
Why are people saying Scotland are on "another level"   You're still on the tutorial level fellas.
McSauce for the ballon d'Or
Never a pen complete cheat shameful. I'm so glad Scotland won. 🇬🇧
You can't beat a " smash and grab", Norway one of those teams who can be very tricky opponents at times.
Well done my Scottish brothers. Love from an Englishman. ❤
I'm a Sheffield United fan ,I've only watched the highlights. Sander Berge is a 6'4" Nancy ......His heading abilities are atrocious, and he's too much of a pansy in a tackle .. Well done Scotland
Nice to see Scotland flying high 😊
Well done Scotland and very well deserved after a blatant dive from Haaland . Stevie Clark is now getting a nice tune and fight out of ye lads
Nice to see Norway and Spain not got the balls for a fight
Diving Haaland, the big gimp.
McT's contribution to both goals is him all over.  1st receives the ball on the half turn, lovely wee ball past Odegaard to McGinn. Then he's powering alongside Dykes as he puts it in!  2nd, just look at him! Everyone else blowing out their arse, McT gliding on and picking a cross of real quality.  He loves the tartan army. ❤😂
Great penalty by Haaland….the Sweaty Socks extremely lucky to win.
How can the ref buy that penalty. Haaland cant be thrown down like that the man is a monster. Justice
RIP big Gordon McQueen....he would have loved this
Trying to compare Haaland with Messi...😅😂
Sweaty Jock cunts. Still a long way to go yet!!
Nice, Scotland. Even as an Englishman, I'm enjoying your recent successes. Keep it up lads.

Screw your dive and your 10 pound pints
Norwich City > Man City
For me on paper and In  Reality a his Gunn didn’t get a clean sheet however it’s a pen and he was close to it so I think it was a clean sheet for him😂
Huge grtz Scotland!
Hahahhahahahland ya filthy cheating lump of shite. C’mon the Scots!
NOT very classy by Haaland 🫤
Edvard Munch, Anni-Frid Lyngstad, Roald Amundsen, Edvard Grieg, Marit Bjoergen, Kygo, Fridtjof Nansen, Morten Harket, Harald V, can you hear me? Harald V, your boys took a hell of a beating, your boys took a hell of a beating!
4:39 the commentater cheered before the ball went in the net 😂😂😂
... CHEATS NEVER PROSPER Mmmmm! 🇸🇯 5:58
I had a bet on 2-1 scotland so the last 5 mins was squeaky bum time

I’m pleased for Scotland after going behind to a blatant dive. VAR my arse
THERE IS SOMETHING FUCKING SPECIAL ABOUT THIS TEAM
Serves you right Haaland. That’s called Karma! You smart arse
Haaland isn’t the player he is when he’s at city
come on scotland🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿from a england fan🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
No surprise that the Real Madrid reject captain clueless Missing Odegaard went missing again  They hype behind this clown is unbelievable and it's fitting that his shirt number sums up his whole career 10 - Won Nothing
Smash and grab 😄 flights now booked for Frankfurt June 14th 2024.
I amscottish and im just so happy and relieved❤❤❤
Beautiful football was shown by Scotland. Congratulations . Norweigh has Erling Harland the goalscoring machine but he was completely barren when faced Scotland
Well done Scotland.  Greetings from Poland 👍🙂
gwan the sweaties 💥💥
Fantastic 🥃
Well done Scotland
Haggis!!!!
No Scotland no party
Let me just do the I told you so dance for a little longer. I remember being absolute delighted when killie hired him as manager. The only thing that softened the blow of him leaving was he was leaning to Scotland !  I knew he was perfect fit, he has been fantastic and honestly not to my surprise. The man is class.  Where are all the Clark out idiots now ?  Honestly any of those “fans” can honestly go support someone else. Leave the real fans to enjoy the success we have waited so long for
Gosh as a French I fear Scotland 😅, they are Brilliant and always progress at the moment! Well done Scotland
Great stuff for the Scots... Howey the lads
John Mcginn in the thick of things again Love mcginn = love villa
Haaland is a cheat
As an Inter fan all i can say is...karma. Well done Scotland
As a proud Englishman with a Scottish father - over the moon would love to see Scotland In Germany! (just not against England...again haha)
Well done guys, you've made our country great again. As for Haaland. That was a well-acted dive for a penalty that should never have been given. In fact, he should have been sent off - prick!!
Great comeback, yes the 2nd goal is a thing of beauty. Well done. 🇬🇧
Diving should be punishable with a straight red card & a 3 game ban. That'll sort the cheating fecks out. Haaland you big fairy 🧚‍♂️ Welldone the scots, you deserved that one. Mcginn doing bits again aswell. UTV ✌🏼💜💙
So glad Scotland won after that wrong decision on a penalty
Amazing grit from Scotland again , halaand just confirmed he is the worlds biggest cuckold with that dive hopefully big porteous leathered him in the tunnel for being such a pathetic pillow biter
Paaland 😂
Haha choke on THAT Haaland. Justice done. Haaland the white Sterling. Cheating fkr.  Great result for us tho keep it up. Their manager obviously thought the game was in the bag so haha. GIFRUY
Stuart Armstrong pass at that time in game made up for eggjand mistake
WHEN YOU HEAR THE NOISE OF THE TARTAN ARMY BOYS WE'LL BE COMING DOWN THE ROAD!!!
Loved both Scotland goals, very clutch but determining victory ❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
COME ON SCOTLAND!!! SCOTLAND THE BRAVE
Amazing!!!
Accept it troops, we're a hot country now and we're brilliant at football   🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Erling Haaland you're having a laugh.
So they said the header down to Dykes, " we give him the doubt" after constantly saying Dykes was always in that position. The Dykes pass to mclean, then his goal was magnificent...🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🇬🇧
scottish footy is murd...seriously its fucking abysmal....11 smackheads v 11 crackheads fighting over a deep fried marsbar!..(the scottish championship) lmao....which is a trophy shaped in the image of Nicola sturgeons cock.
Robbo led like a proper captain ! Scotland sure do have a grit about them nowadays which is great. Also Haaland dived. <England Supporter>
Absolutely brilliant.  The spirit in this Scottish team is in a different level.  It’s gone from shit players like Fleck and that idiot McBurnie saying they didn’t want to even turn up … to guys fighting for the jersey and the country.  I absolutely love it.    What’s even better is Spain and Norway saying Scotland didn’t deserve it.  The fact we have beaten them both shows this is no fluke.  What a come back, let’s get this group done now Scotland!! Yasss
Dukes for Balloon D'or
That was a beautiful 2nd goal for Scotland. Well done.
Awesome second goal 👏.
1:33 Hot chick alert!
Well done Scotland..much love from Albania 🇦🇱 ❤❤
U scummy Scottish wan##rs let me diene 700 didn’t deserve nothing out that game u boring scummy team I can’t stand mgginn ugly face either
Scotland come clutch with 2 goals in 2 minutes - what a turnaround
Mon the fuckin scotland!!!
Didn't expect that. Turned over at 84 mins. Ended up 50 bucks 🤣
Justice was served, never a penalty in a million years, Haaland is a diving prick ! (and I'm English)
Super John McGinn !!
Did Gordon McQueen proud with that result! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Well done Scotland! FROM AN ENGLISHMAN, WHO'S ENGLISH BTW
Just OMG! What a sensational comeback. Well done Scotland!!!!
Remember what happened last time underdogs finished above spain…. I’m confident!!!
I’d love to meet Halland in the pub, hopefully he would go down that easy the disgusting cheating piece o 💩
So wheres halaand 🤣 only scores pens or tap in
The question is, which is the bigger result? This, or when they beat England 0-0 at the Euro's?
Inject it
Trying to tell people. This Scotland team is growing. So many talented players. The determination from the individuals become an immense threat as a collective. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿❤️
Amount of support from English fans to the Northern border makes me laugh. These lot will still turn up in their jerseys supporting who ever England play.
Well done lads doing the country proud ❤️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
The Penalty was far too soft, that second goal was fantastic well done to Scotland for not giving up and fighting till the end 💙. Norway taking Haaland off thinking the games over well that taught them a lesson
Fuckin Yaaaas
Well done Jockland that Norway pen was bs! I know you need a hate rivalry but the unfortunate truth is we want you to do well unless it's against us hahahhaa 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 well done 👏🏻
Well done Scotland. You can thank the English premier league for finally creating a squad that can compete 😂
Played shite and won!!  Makes a change from playing well and not winning which is usually the Scottish way. Get your passports looked out Germany here we come 💪🏻
Haaland could of played for England he is going to miss out big time

Dating is only fun with traditional type women and they do exist. They are the type of woman that are still ashamed to admit that they’ve met someone off the internet. There is a sector of the dating market that still wants to meet men the natural way ie at a bar, through a social circle etc. These are the women you can have fun dating because there body counts tend to be lower.
There was only about 25 seconds of football between the restart after the equaliser and the winning goal! Effectively, Scotland scored twice in less than half a minute. That's why you should never give up.
As an Englishmen . I always want the Scottish to do well and fair play to them what a cracking performance and haaland defo dived
Still a good few games to play yet. A good start but need to continue
The celebration was next level and I’m half Norwegian 😂
The squad is full of EPL level players, unforunately theres very little attacking quality, its all centre mids and fullbacks, Clarke has found a way to get them all on the pitch, its not pretty to watch but theyre a physically strong team thats hard to break down and you can sneak results from that solid foundation.
Most kids in Scotland can’t even count to 9. Steve Clark’s doing wonders for our education system!
Another fantastic result, Well done Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Sublime football for Scotland’s second goal. So calm.
Restoring pride one match at a time

What a goal 🎉🎉🎉🎉 lets fuckin go
Get it so round they Norwegian kids at 1:57. I hope they cried after the game. Mon Scotland.
Karma at it's best 👌 Take note Haaland.. ya big f@nny 😝 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿❤️
Great comeback Scotland, (begrudgingly).. best of luck from south of the border... well until we thrash you in the group stages obviously 🙄 😮😊
Watch for the wee bunch of Scottish fans behind the goal in the Norway end at McLeans goal 😂 guy in white aint happy 😂
How do I leave this on repeat?
For gordon mcqueen.
im so happy because norway was cringe they thought it was easy sailing hahaha
Well done Scotland, I would like to see you on finals😊😊😊
By the by........Harland IS a cheat, my granny would have stood up.... ...but then arent City cheats....FFP. ???
Well done mate from and England supporter 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🤝🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Porteus is as consistent as Haaland
Oh God. Every commentator is trying to emulate Ken Wolstenholme with his "they think it's all over....." They never will. His was spontaneous. Natural. Today all commentaries are contrived. They're looking for that same immortality ........ Stop trying. It's boring.
This game has proven that this is not a one man sport. No matter how exceptional a player is, you still need the support of the whole team to succeed. Often the star players forgets this. Example PSG who have Messi, Mbappe and Neymar and yet their team never lifted a Champions League’s trophy.
What an excellent second goal.
Aye becoz beating norway is the same as beating spain......   delusional scottish fucknuts
Glad that u like in the Premier League that the commentary team called Haaland by his full name.
Michael Stewart just canny not sound like a mongo can he
How on earth is that wee fuck ryan porteus not seen a red card?? Sxotland will still choke in the late stages
Well Norway got raped there...
The hell is Østigård doing defensively...
Taking Haaland off at 1-0 up with 10 mins to go is possibly the worst decision made in Europe since Brexit.
Love Scotland 👏🇦🇿
Congrats Scottieland, have a square sausage as a reward, you earned it
They beat a not very good Norway
norway such great players and they play badly. rich country and they can't afford a coach, they take some local amateurs.
They said last week just formality to beat us we soon showed them nvt right us of
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, Morten Harket, Edvard Grieg - Your boys took a hell of a beating!!
Norway are overrated
Justice after the cheating from Haaland.
Good to the the Scots having a good team again.
Dykes is not a player with silky smooth skills. But he gets it in the back of the net, and messy goals count just the same on the scoresheet.
GERMANY 🇩🇪 GERMANY 🇩🇪  WE ARE FAMOUS TARTAN ARMY AND WERE GOING TO GERMANY 🇩🇪
Haaland horrible dive. From a player of his level… why?
Anyone knows how to get tickets for the Hamden game? Would like to see Kvaradona the Georgia magician. Let’s go Scotland. Looks like everything is sold out maybe the Ranger stadium is small. Murrayfield is a 60k capacity why don’t they play home uefa games there? Even the November 2023 games are sold out. There must be other ways to get these tickets.
Scotland are on the up
From a Englishmen well done Scotland
The fact that Haaland had to cheat to get the penalty and still lost the game 🤣🤣🤣
Show’s how poor Norway are that a blatant dive couldn’t beat us. We have a great team. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Wish it was in front of Scotland fans to see the limbs
Mcginn since Emery is disgustingly good
Those screams of joy from the commentators.  I love being Scottish
Outstanding goal to win it for Scotland. If a more "fashionable" team scores that the pundits would be absolutely creaming themselves. Fair play to the lads involved; nobody panicked and they got their reward (from an Englishman).
Also, second Scotland goal was a belter.
Lyndon Dykes is such an important player for us. Love him to bits!! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Will I finally be able to see my country compete for a major tournament? Not counting immediate loss in group stages
Haaland born in Leeds. Should have chosen England.
Please tell me that shi*e is not creeping into Haaland's game already? fckin Norwegian Harry Kane here we go...hope I am wrong.....
Well played Scotland, awful back line by us. You people deserved this win. Respect from a Norwegian fan  🇳🇴🤝🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Go on the Scots...brilliant 2nd goal...brilliant win!!
Go on Scotland
Fkkkn yaaaas Scotland oan fite
What a finish Kenny 🔰
Scotland are a winning team. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿❤️
UTV
Englishman here feeling a little jealous of that second goal. Absolute quality!
The difference with Steve Clark and every other Scottish manager is that Steve served his time actually coaching players long before becoming a manager. He turned a dire Kilmarnock team into a credible unit and is replicating it with the national team . Ps that flag in the Scottish end .. Scottish Republic? Keep yer politics out o football thankyou.
Very satisfying
Porteous should’ve got a yellow for the heel flick. Norway should’ve got a penalty for the Hendry arm pull. That penalty was nothing.
Piece o piss! 🍻
Yes a fantastic finish to win a game!
Kenny McLean ... take a bow ⚽👍
As a Scotsman get in there ya beauty was never a penalty halland Ur a cheat simple as that justice was done delighted what a result halland u might have been on a team that bought a treble but Ur nae going to Germany get it right up yus ya bassa woooo
everyone slating Haaland for that blatant dive, no even challenging for ball, but real focus should be on referee what a terrible terrible decision to give a yellow card and penalty when it should have been a yellow card for diving , that could have had a massive outcome if it finished 1-0 to Norway
As a Romanian living in Scotland, I can say I’m so proud of this team. They have an unbelievable fighting spirit.🫡
Fkn diving c*nt. We should be beating these clowns. always make it hard on ourselves. Mon the Scotland!!
Excellent jock performance
thats as far as you jocks go   RULE BRITANNIA
Go on Scotland!!!!!!!!!!!!
Haaland doesn’t deserve the Ballon D’or. What has he actually done. 53 goals. Idc He should try carrying his national team to a World Cup spot firstly and then score against REAL opponents like Real Madrid and Inter. He had the same number of touches (3) as Mbappe had goals in a WORLD CUP FINAL (3). His fanboys really make him seem like a ‘robot’.
👍 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Just basically carrying on we're they left off. Scotland awesome with this team n manager.
Go on the tartan army, our fans  need to be in a tournament together before Im using a Zimmer.  🐋🐋
True passion in the commentary dont hear it enough!
Lmao cope and seethe norgies
Well done Scotland, happy daze.
Baffling how liam Henderson didn't even make the squad
All Hail Caledonia!
Well done lads😊
Potential ballon dor winner according to some is a tap in ghost again 😂
Imagine winning everything in the game only to get beat by Scotland 😂😂😂
WELL DONE SCOTLAND!!!  I am not Scottish, but that was a well deserved win. Haaland went down and HE should have been carded for the dive, rather than a penalty given. Referees have got to wake up to cheating divers or find another profession. Scotland carried on fighting and that got the right result. Well done Scotland.
Beautiful football lads
Pretty sure Odegaard says "fucking Scotland" at 5:57
Gratulation Scotland from Algeria 🇩🇿❤️👑👑
well done scotland like we always say its not the easy way or the hard way its the scotland way think we did the scotland way tonight
I haven't felt that good since Archie Gemmill scored against Holland in 1978
Erling Who-land? Nah, mate. Give us Lyndon Dykes any day!
Beautiful winning goal. Class.
Steve Clarke is the man
As a Scotsman, what a refreshing change to see us win from a goal down with 5 minutes to go, so often it was the other way around! 😄
What is happening man I'm not used to this haha we worked so hard we didn't play our best stuff and it was a fairly poor game overall but that 2nd goal was filled with so much quality happy for Dykes he worked his arse off and got his rewards I'm not a huge fan of Clarkes footballing style but I've got to give him credit his subs worked and he has this team fighting for the shirt FUCKING GET IN SCOTLAND.
Some people haven't felt this good since Archie Gemmill scored against Holland in 1978.
What a beautiful play for the last goal 👌
Book yer hotels!!! Shite ref though
I guess Haaland might never even taste a major international football event in his entire career (Euros or World Cups).
That’s Not Football 😂😂😂😂
Congrats from England !! 🇬🇧
Bloody well done Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 👍
Ridiculous penalty decision against Scotland. Haaland the man mountain blatantly diving. Pathetic.
Senzațional,sensational..nice game
Football allows you to make your own destiny. Scotland are doing this. Not the best in the World by any stretch but they're better than decent and sometimes that's enough. McGinn is quality and Steve Clark is a good Manager and a realist. Not a Scot but I have some. I wish them well.
Haaland does 0 without the best playmakers in the world laying the chances on a plate for him.
What a team. What a country 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿   FKN CMON SCOTLAND!!!!!!!!!!!!
Well done Scotland
Go on Scotland lads! In tae them!  Hope to see you lads at the next tournament with England. Wales too.
Dykes was so unselfish in laying off the ball for Kenny McLean for that second goal and so determined for the first goal. He’s a no frills striker but he puts himself about, bullies defenders, and he has goals in him too.   I thought McGinn was going to try for goal instead of mishitting it to Dykes! 😢
Haaland certianly went down like a sack of tatties for the biggest, strongest forward in the PL, haha what a guy, chancer.
Smash and grab 👏not Scottish but judge this team on if they can get out of the group in the euros and make history
No words can explain how I feel tonight. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿❤️🍺
The more I see that last goal, the more it gets better! Well done, men!
Glad they won But a massive fluke Commentary on the tv said same Scotland played really poor this game.
Went for a cigarette I know bad habit but when I was doing that I was like to myself Ach that’s it done heard the commentary I was flying into the living room to see and went back out again celebrating and before u know it another goal was scored couldn’t believe it thought I was hearing S#it. On you go Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Hahaha. Well done Scotland 😅
Jusitice!  Well done Scotland.
WHERE THE FU*K IS McCOIST ON COMMS DUTY?!
Who the fuck edited this? Absolutely horrendously cut together, felt like I was watching one of those shitty Middle Eastern pirated YouTube highlights videos with the Arabic commentary 😂
I see Jack Grealish's 'talent' has rubbed off on Haaland.   What a cheat.   I'm glad he got what he deserved in the end - nil points.
And haalaand is a diver too 😂
Really pleased to see Scotland win, penalty for Norway was a joke. As a Englishman always glad to see Scotland win, other than when we're up against each other!!!
Why they take Haaland off? He's literally worth more than the rest of their team.
I am English but it's great to see Scotland doing well
I just love my Scottish people..
The 2nd goal is a great team goal.
Reminds me of when Saudi beat Argentina. But people don’t talk about that after Argentina got awarded 5 penalties and Qatar ignored all hand balls
As a blue collar worker from southern bulgaria who goes on holiday to Croatia once a year and whose favourite food is cod fillet I would just like to say congratulations to Scotland on this great win!
Scotland were comfortably losing until the Norwegian defender decided to send a gift 😂😂 Second goal was nice though, Norway had lost their heads by that point.
before the first Scotland goal, did they have a chance before that? doesn't seem to have made it into the highlights
First rodri now Halland the Man City treble winners trying to cheat Scotland time and time again. So proud of our boys keeping strong and getting the points.
As the old saying goes - cheats never win 😂
Haaland, 6'7" pulls the other smaller player who stands up  but in return, lightly tugs on Haaland who falls to the ground as if shot! Cheating cnut, VAR should have overturned the penalty.. glad the cheaters got beaten
The build up for the winner was a joy to watch. Great stuff by the Tartan Army 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Get it right up haaland. Cheating wanker
I'm actually glad Scotland won after what Haaland did to get that penalty. Clear dive there.
Imagine being one of the best footballers in the world and yet DIVING against Ryan Porteous he ought to have some shame   So proud of our Scotland team
So glad to see that blatant dive punished. Go on Scotland. I'm English but I want to see all the home nations doing well.
a moment of silence for scots 2nd goal that literally killed Norway , wat a classy finish salute , Spain , Norway , clark is doing bits wid dis squad
Cheating barsteward Halland. Yes, his jersey got held..but by feck..didnt he use dramatic licence to get the pen.
Haaland is an absolute cheat. Fits right in at City. 115. Fantastic result Scotland. Well played 😊
I was just thinking when we went 2-1 up, keep the ball away from Stuart Armstrong as i still havent forgiven him for England
That winning goal was incredible!
familiar feeling 4 odergord lol go on you jocks
Englishman but happy to see Scotland stuff Norway, diving when you're the best goalscorer in the world at the moment.. disgraceful. Well done Scotland and the last goal was special.
Ally McCoist...best co-commentator around.
Robertson in Midfield,I Just Hope Jürgen Has Noted His Class Performance,Klopp Could Save Million By Moving Andy Into Midfield & Liverpool Already Have Robertson's Replacement In Tymmikas... #YNWA
"Scodland....gedding...etc" Fuckin speak scottish, eh.
This Scotland side,could give England's third string,a decent game.
Well done Scotland. The 2nd goal was class. Haaland, what a blatant cheating dive...justice done.
He’s build like a brick sh*it house hows he gone down like that!!!
Well done Scotland , from a Man U fan, delighted for Mctominay,want to see him play in Germany next summer..Also, Its actually quite  disturbing how much of an ugly kunt Haaland is- he's hideous. Also , He's a diving, sly cheat of a player, but nothing new there...
The nation of Scotland has been exalted to the nations of the world with this performance. Scotland’s mind set must be to ruthless winners at all costs. Qualify for the Euro’s and I want players, staff the manager even the cleaners talking about and believing that they can win thus resulting to their exploits on the pitch being triumph. If you just going to the Euro’s just to compete like you normally do don’t bother qualifying and wasting my time and every other Scot. Talk about players demanding that they must win the competition and lifting that Euro trophy.
Scotland's second was absolute quality
what a result go on 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Norway thought they had won.. never underestimate us 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 💪☝️
Cheating git halland but all the fault is var and the ref are they blind
Ha ha f…k you you city c..t
Yaaaaaaaaaaaasssss
Let’s qualify from the group and not go through a play off again
Such a great result for Scotland, so proud of the lads👊
to be fair great 2nd goal from the scots
Wallace and grommet ? Halaands so ugly hes like a cartoon
WTF😳
Great result keeper was unlucky for the penalty too two late goals usually seals Scotlands fate well done they should be proud of the last few performances 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
A win against Georgia on Tuesday and we only need 6 points to qualify. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
What a result by Scotland. Well done you guys. A real solid performance and a thoroughly deserved win-and that’s coming from a sassanach! Keep it up. You really do deserve some success in international football. Let’s hope your time has come at last! Brilliant!
Absolutely brilliant!  And I'm English.
Lol Rodri doesn’t like Scotland. Neither does plastercine Wallace and grommet face Haaland. Rotten
Haaland plays for cheating scum (Man City) of course he’s going to dive around, it’s in his blood, get fucked you ugly rotten prick! Can’t wait till his “treble” is taken away from him and his career comes crashing down/
Haaland ya cheat.  You deserve nothing. Well done Scotland.
Well played scotland karma a bitch Norway
Pick it out Landreau!!!!
Well done Scotland, you were brilliant. Hope you go all the way in this group, and I'm Welsh.
What a moment that winning goal is
Well done Scotland. 🤣🤣🤣😂
Brillinat result for scotland but wtf were norway thinking, that defending for the 1st goal was below schoolboy shit. 86 minutes and your trying to take a touch on the edge of your own box 😂 just get it away.
No Scotland no party 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Brilliant, well done Scotland  :D
The wee man hit the deck likea sacka shite
Stunning result, well done Scotland.
such a great goal to seal it 5:06
We are such a good unit if we could find a striker that can bang in some goals no reason we can’t go deep into a euros
Viva Scotland
I was watching with about 50 people at my local golf club and when Scotland scored their 2nd everyone went insane
Well done Scotland  from a Welsh fan .
Can we take a sec to appreciate Dykes' perfectly weighted pass at the end.
Brilliant Scotland.Great result
Don't Referee's Ever Watch Football Matches When They Are Not Working ?  Haaland is built like brick wall yet the slightest nudge and he falls over...Blatant cheating, pure and simple.  Glad Scotland Won To Wipe The grin off Of His face..
Imagine being Norways manager, having all of those top players, and not getting a point. Retire mate, retire now.
Seems like the first minister of Scotland, the affable  Hamza doesn't like the Scotland shirt, too white.
Well done Scotland, but Haaland will regret choosing Norway over England.
Well im almost 70 yrs old and have just about witnessed everything in my time! - apart from the Wembley Wizzards of course!! - These recent times are just amazing, on a par if not better the the 74 squad! There is an amazing togetherness with this squad of pure hard working guys. Steve Clark has done nothing short of a miracolous job with the whole squad.!  LOVING IT!!
Stupid mistake holding onto Haaland in the box whilst ref was standing 10 metres away... nearly every striker on the planet wouldve done the same.
About time things went Scotland's way. Keep going lads. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏆
Good comeback, but Shankland has scored three times as many goals this season as Dykes, and can't even get a game as a substitute. Playing for any other country, he would be the first name on the team sheet.
Great the jocks like! Robbo is a gangster
We're on our way ✊🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Lets dedicate this win to Gordon McQueen!❤
That is one beautiful assist. Weight of pass, awareness, composure ….. I’d have said I enjoyed it more than any goal I’ve seen this season if I hadn’t seen the Wales game last night.
Only soft when it’s done against a British team. It’s a professional penalty the other way around. What you guys want the striker to do? Push the defender down in order to get the ball? Please stop picking and choosing whenever it suits you. Thanks
I know it’s not the done thing from an England supporter, but there’s a lot to love about this Scotland team. Should be very proud.
Penaaland, without pens this season Salah would still hold the record for most goals in a season and still holds record for most goals scored in a season minus penalties.
1:34nice pair 😉
Should football keep VAR if all officials will not use it correctly because that penalty should have been looked at again
Go on  The Wee Scotland . Had a friend who sadly passed away a couple of years ago  , he would’ve been been elated .This one’s for you Mac xx
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿😁😁😁
English and loving Scotland's resurgence. Great spirit and resilience shown. See you at the Euros sweaties
The ref. could easily have given a penalty against Hendry beforehand
Once again a fantastic result and performance well done boys
For a 6ft 3 lump of shite Haaland is one diving bastard. How did he hit the ground there and how was it physically possible for him to be pulled down like that. Shocking award.
Fair play scotland from a half englishman, love the passion from those commentators aswell, very good team and hopefully we will see you in the next euros 😊
Scotland are going to make it to another euros
ya dancer , get it up e ya big diving wank .
abdul
It's John Mcginn, it's Dykes, it's MacLEEEEEEAAAAAAN! 💙🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Fair play Scotland 👏
Haaland can’t be considered a great player if he doesn’t play at a World Cup or euros...  Big freak😂
Keane did nothing wrong.
From a South of the border geezer. Brilliant. Go on my sons. 👍
haaland will be the worst player to ever win a ballon d'or.
Halland ya diving bastard.
Just watched highlights buzzing for the sweaty socks
How did Scotland win that?
I'm a Fan of Haaland but THAT WAS A DIVE!!! ⚽
Justice done !!
Norway are so bad it's unreal
200/1 to win the Euros 🤔😄
1:34
Scotland yassss
Great result and haaland hasn’t beaten us so double happy
What a brilliant goal from McLean. Pub went mental when that went in! 🍻👏👏👏👏👏
Wouldn’t of even known haaland was playing until his dive! Well done Scotland!! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Angus Gunn really unlucky with the Penalty . And to be fair never a Penalty . How easily and quickly did Haaland go down. 😤
Halland is still hungover from man city, no way this happens otherwise
Happy about Haaland's injury, he's a cheat.
Superb Scotland and Stevie Clarke. Keep it up we ARE behind YOU ALL THE WAY.
In calling hacks for the scotland 2nd goal hahah yasss we'll be coming
Haalands home coming get pumped by Scotland fuckin brilliant 😂😊
I like Scotish Higlander. Well done.
Brilliant Scotland! Glad to see Haaland punished for his cheating. Stick your treble!
YES! Richly deserved Scotland and Norway got what they deserved...Nowt!
I'm starting get good feeling about this Scotland squad
notice around the 4.15 mark norway player grabs his legs as the goal goes in. Shit 2 cheating fuckers in the same team
Halaand clearly been playing for city it seems 🏊‍♂️ 🤿
That was the best Scotland goal since Archie Gemmils classic in the World Cup against Holland (1978). ⭐️
Well deserved!! Congrats Scots !!😊
Wow
Haaland should be ashamed of that shite dive , well done Scotland for keeping going til the end
My boozer went wild after our second goal. Magical team management and fans ,❤️
Well done Scotland
Not sure about the penalty, I think you shouldn't wrestle anywhere on a football field & Haaland made a lot of it. But Scotland did the business, nice one.
Not surprised Scotland are in white.  They're used to surrendering. 😂. !!
Incredible
Unbelievable
Years of utter garbage is finally getting cleared oot, always loyal and well deserved from a geordie
Second goal was class
Well done jockistan.!!  Ayatollah hogmanay will be proud.  😊
Two thumbs up to the brave Scotland team  Two fingers up to the greedy SFA that make the fans at home pay to watch their national team on TV.  England, Wales, NI, ROI fans can all watch their teams on terrestrial TV. But not Scottish fans. The SFA are disgusting.
Ya dancer ye!! Germany get ready, because “When you hear that noise of the Tartan army boys, We’ll be coming down the road” 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Credit to Scotland 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Haaland is the best striker on earth, but he has no fucking class whatsoever. Pathetic behaviour, glad he got what he deserved in the end, but then he plays for a club that has been cheating for a decade so why wouldn’t he think that’s acceptable
Steve Clarke has done amazing for Scotland.. I honestly can't even remember the last time scotland got beat tbh
What a finish Kenny McLean.....played dung but what a turnaround
Thats what ya get ya diving ……..
1:33 How am I supposed to chip with that going on Doug?!
Revenge for a blatant dive 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
In a way I felt sorry for Norway, but Haalands' dying -swan act deserved to be punished in the end.
winning goal was a FIFA goal that you would be proud of
Just give us the trophy now.😂🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Snatch!! and grab!! Love it classic 😂
Sack the manager, he is a total shit...
Yaaaaassssssss!!!!!! ⚽️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
It will all end in tears
Buzzing after that brilliant result. Get it right up ye haaland ya big  cheat lol
Not a great performance but a good result ,and what a goal to win it. Confidence oozes through this team.On this form they could be the first to get out of the group in Germany.
About time they won something
Now Scottish babies crying about Haaland, if your man main Dykes won a pen like that and you won , you wouldnt say shit 😂 You worked hard for the win and deserved it but Haaland didnt dive, its just something strikers are told to do
He knew what he was doing in prem he bully's anyone who comes near him and always beats his player but he knew pen was very likely , either a pen or a red card for simulation . Hard call for ref
Slight shirt tug isn't a pen...
LETS GO SCOTLAND!!!!
Doesn't feel right, this usually happens to us Scots. Play well and get nothing, this evening was the most opportunist of smash and grabs and if thats a Argentina, France, top tier side scoring that second goal you never hear the end of it a fantastic bit of play. Oooooohhhhhhh yes sir, I can boogie..
go on scotland.
Easy 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
One of the best comebacks I ever seen... the pitch isnt a swimming pool Erling, what you diving for mate 😂 100% deserved win
That second goal was superb.
From English to Scottish, Well done lads!
The referee was conned.
From an Irishman ☘️ well done Scotland. Certainly not the Scotland team of old, a team worth the watching under SC.   Just wish we could get things moving here in Dublin 😢
Haaland cheating gimp, cheers to all the English, Welsh other nationalities commenting x
England approves this win. Well done Scotland.
Ha fucking ha land. ...he's the best of the best and can we really expect more from him when every exceptional footballer is also a cheating c**t??
Cheats, he should be in the diving team, no the fitbaw team 😁 Well Done Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Big haaland down like a ton of bricks he been watching too much of his mate jack
SCOTLAAAND!!!!!!!
We played a back 4 for 12 minutes and scored 2 goals. We were able to pass through the lines, something a Steve Clarke Scotland team has never done with a back 3. We looked dreadful all game and all people can talk about is team spirit. 3-4-2-1 has never done anything for this group of players. I thought Norway had better players than they actually have. I am glad I misjudged them. 4-2-3-1 against Georgia and we win 5-0
Haaland looks like the prototype of shrek
haaland diving.a man city player cheating.never lol
Am just gony say, a love ma country n as a proud Scotsman n rangers fan, a hope that we aw can get behind this team n be an actual nation again without aw the negative bullshit. Remember that rangers fans make up n have always made up a huge proportion of the tartan army n the sooner we get away from this tribal shite the better. DALRIADA FOREVER
That second goal, pure class
Haaland a dirty cheat just like his manager and his club.
Can't believe nobody else has watched these highlights yet cause those 5k views are all mine. Mon Scotland!!!
The 20% Scottish blood in me has just blown the 20% Nordic blood a huge raspberry with accompanying fingers. The English 60% is keeping quiet.
For a big guy,Haaland doesn't half go down easily! Well done Scotland from England fan.
As soon as haaland went off it’s a different game …and scotland brought that game …well done us
I remember just after the Falklands War, in the World Cup, Scotland supported Argentina over England in their match!! I have never wished Scotland success in anything since!
Great result Scotland, passing on second goal was excellent. Well done, from N.Ireland 👏
Fair play Scotland, from an Englishman with Scottish roots in the family 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🤝🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Norway cheated on BGT by making the public win for him. ITV sucks ass now. STV Player are showing Brookside
Haaland balloon d'or
Haaland is average without that great midfield behind him tap in king
No big superstars just scotsmen giving thier all for the jersey 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
That finish from Dykes 🔥
Massive result for the Scots, No doubt Steve Clarke is doing a tremendous job & has completely altered the players mindset
well done scotland after getting cheated with the pen
That second Scotland goal was a corker! Well laid off and executed 👋
Haaland should've played for his country of birth 😉😉
I'm surprised VAR didn't overturn that penalty, these clear and obvious errors should work both ways. A blatant dive, they both had each others shirts and Haaland just throws himself to the ground when Porteous does nothing to make him hit the deck.
Love football man
Was VAR in use?Anyone watching a replay of that can see Haaland is a cheating bastard.The VAR bloke should have said it’s not a penalty,rescind the yellow card and give Haaland one instead.This diving shit is being encouraged by the officials.
Good to see Scotland doing well & pleased to see my captain McGinn had a big part in the build up to both goals, can always count on meatball
Get it right up ye Haaland ya cheating arsehole 😂😂
Well done Scotland. Proud of my country!
I fucking love you, Scotland ❤
Well done Scotland from Ireland 🍻
It's not Nations League it's euro qualifiers '& Halaand is a 6ft 4" weakling.  Come on ye Scots 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿💙🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Haarland so overrated - beaten by this mob of no marks LOL
Cheat penalty
That second goal 🥵🥵beautiful 👌
Not sure what I like best, the second goal or the commentator’s reaction? 😂
I was at this game Scotland cheated and fouled every minute
So where's that "golden generation" everyone was talking about? Norway is shite at football. Always was and always will be! But big fat congratulations to Scotland. They always show some fighting spirit on the pitch. I'll be looking forward to seeing them at the euro. UP THE TARTAN ARMY! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿💪
a win to go nowhere😂
Talk aboot the old one 2 well done lads 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Unbelievable win ! The game looked to be petering out to a 1-0 . Norway having the best of the chances although the pen was a bit suspect. Two good finishes , the winner was brilliant  piece of play.
Norway must’ve been so confident with their elite players in their team but the best they could do was cheat, they got beat.. HA HA HA HA HA
Dear Erling, this is what happens when you don’t have oil behind you 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
The only thing could have made it better was Super Ally on comms ❤️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Everybody just assumes Spain will win this group but Scotland have a good chance of winning it now. Hopefully they can their fans are amazing
Justice for Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Top class commentary 👌🏽🔥
Well done men, great job, showing real character and skill. Keep it up, you guys are great, just believe in yourselves. Lost a lot of repect for Haaland, really thought he was a better  man, sadly not.
2nd goal… absolutely world class , simple!! 👍🏻
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
GET IN SCOTLAND ⚽️⚽️
Justice served because Haaland dived so well done Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿💪🤣
HAALAND     TAKE  UP  OLYMPICS     ESPECIALLY  SWIMMING   U DIVING   CU#T
should of joined england haaland
Norway should only play haaland upfront as good as sorloth is the system don’t work with 2 strikers better off building team around haaland like Barca did with messi or ronaldo with Madrid etc
Karma.
Get it right up  yeah   (  REF  ) absolutely   shocking   destruction   in  your  call  decisions     thx  F#ck    you lost  your  Bet    on  the bookies       with   ❤  frm Bonnie   Scotland
Diving Haaland…I tell you, your boys took one hell of a beating!
Pray for Haaland 😂 Cmon Scotland 🎉
The key is confidence and this Scotland team have confidence,just watching these highlights the build up to the second goal was brilliant great to see Scotland playing like this and not just lumping the ball into the box for the big guy,as for haalands penalty var should be used for decisions like this it was never a penalty
Pure gold well done Scotland go all  the way the roar we all love 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿👍🤗
McTominay seems to always perform in a Scotland shirt, glad to see him contributing well
never a penalty , obvious dive from haaland he will not win many friends doing that
As a qpr fan im praying someone buys Dykes
Congratulations Scotland, its a pity we didn't see that sort of passion from Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
Well done, Scotland. From a sassenach.
Get in...even better with that cheating diving twat being humbled...brilliant
Haaland has it all in his locker - even diving!! 😂 Well done Scotland ❤
Anyone from the isles has got to love what Scotland are doing 🔥 Steve Clark been cooking !
Good job Scotland! Love haaland but that dive made me want Scotland to win!
😁
For Gordon McQueen.
It’s about time some VAR refs learnt some basic physics. Pulling your shirt backwards, does not make you fall forwards. Probably should be a penalty for the shirt pull, but I’d cancel it out and book Haaland for the dive.
Fantastic comeback! And with wins over Spain and Norway already Scotland are close to guaranteed qualification, no playoff.
Based on the highlights, Norway was unlucky. But that wasn't a penalty.
thats what use get for cheating go scotland go what a result
Never a penalty  what is the point off var
What a finish for the winner, super teckers
Referee was a disgrace. Penalty was ridiculously soft and his reaction at the Scotland goals, he doesn't even signal for goals, he just looks stunned
Go on dykesy proper qpr
Get in
Top class yessa Scotland and haaland dive just to get a goal shocking from him tbh
Well done troops
scotland celebrating like they beat brazil lol.
Welshman here. Great job Scotland, this made me feel better after losing 4-2 Armenia 🤬
What a result 🎉Mon the Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
lol @ Haaland how does that feel you big donkey
Cheats Haaland never prosper😮
Well done the Scots
In my 30 years on this planet we’ve mostly felt disappointment. This team is different. It’s starting to finally feel like it’s our turn to enjoy major tournaments 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
It would be great if England and Scotland both qualify, both on their way at the moment. If it happens, hopefully we can avoid each other in the groups! As much as I enjoy the rivalry, it would only get too hyped up in the media and the match possibly not live up to expectations, for England anyway lol. (England fan).
First half was poor on both sides, Norway playing route one football, and Scotland being to defensive. Second half was better and the class and passion our Nation has I'd class bring on Germany
Norwich Boys doing the job
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Proud of Scotland From A English man living in the Highlands
Fkn magic!
Well done Scotland, amazing late comeback! Hope we both get to the euro finals again (England fan)
Love to see Scotland playing well and winning! Another Englishman rooting for the Scot’s 👊🏼
Scotland keep winning, strange times.
I must be dreaming... Scotland has a chance to top a group that has World Cup-winning Spain and Halaand's Norway... Only a couple of months ago Scotland lost to Ukraine 3-0.
You know what they say cheats never never never never win 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🎉
Get it round ye ya cheating big dick Haaland 😂
Great dive from Haaland...he got his comeuppance though!
Before the game it was what big Jessie(Harland) was going to do to us 😂😂
It’s mad to think that we’ll be European champions in 2024
Massive result for Scotland!  Next two fixtures are Georgia and Cyprus, they could be sat on 15 points going into the final three games.  I would expect Spain to be a tough game but then Georgia and at home to Norway in the last two games…  Looking positive at the moment for them!
Love it 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿Get in !!!
What a nice feeling when cheats lose.  Well done Scotland, that second goal was a peach.
The arrogance of the manager taking his biggest threat to Scotland off the pitch thinking the the game was won ,but it wiznae wiz it ....🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
If Scotland played like that each time I think Malta and Lichtenstein would struggle to beat them
Scotland showed them how to play football
The ref looked pissed off when 2nd goal went in.. at 4.41 mins
WERE WINNING EUROS
Marvelous
Fantastic result , well deserved .. great game and a great team .. thanks lads 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿♥️
Diveland.  Get it right up you ya cheating bastard.
Someone wake me up lol this scotland team are on fire 🔥
Great second goal
Beautiful winning goal,well done Scotland from an England fan
Just remember scottish players carried English teams in the 80s so we can't be that bad
lol
Fucking brilliant to be Scottish tonight
Norway are absolutely shocking Haaland should just retire from international football
No way Scotland 😳.. excuse the pun. All the best from your superior neighbours  🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Karma. Simple. Congrats to Scotland!
What a result Scotland 💯 😊✅
Diving needs seriously sorting out its a disgrace especially from a player like that
Haaland dropped to the floor never a pen
As an Englishman, I doff my cap to Scotland. Fair play 👏👏 also, dykes assist for the winner was quality
28 goal poacher on the bench in Shankland also which makes me think he will play on Tuesday at Hampden when we pin Georgia back and need clinical finishes as Lawrence gives us.  ps. Celtic fan here but Shankland is Scotlands BEST striker without a doubt!! You want goals...
Absolutely Buzzing this evening! would have been over the Moon to get the Draw but to then instantly score a winner it’s Fantastic get in there Scotland well done lads 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 👌
Am fully convinced that we could play anyone and come away with a result right now
give me pidol Paaland and Podegaard premier league or they will retire
Well done boys
Cheating bastard halland
That's wot u get for going down like a 5 year old haaland,
As soon haaland goes they lost what idiots
For en skam, æsja meg, skulle vært 3 enkle poeng dette her
Brilliant result, brilliant patriotism from the commentary, thank you Stevie Clark, C'mon the Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Get it up ye, haaland. Diving clown.
Couldn’t be happier and more proud to be Scottish at the moment, ref was biased to us all game and we still came out Victorious at the end of the day 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Well done Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Haaland is starting to get found out, resorting to cheating is never a good sign!
The difference between Scotland and Wales is that-Scotland National Team always bounce back, because Scotland League is strong with Celtic and Glasgow....Wales need good Welsh League with Cardiff and Swansea playing in it ... otherwise....gloom and doom without Gareth Bale....if Welsh League doesn't care...No one will train well those young Welsh Football players....well done Scotland.... greetings from Legia Warszawa Fan💪💪💚💚
Yasssss
Haaland and THAT dive... pathetic!!  Scotland's 2nd goal was sheer class from start to finish! 👏👏
Gunn composed himself well considering the chebs on display behind him
Haaland is a typical bum. Can't even help his country reach a Euro at the expense of a weak footballing nation like Scotland, despite even attempting to cheat to win. What an utter joke of a player he is. Imagine thinking thos scrub is remotely even elite, much less an all time great in anyway shape or form.  He is an utter disgrace to his country, has done nothing but let them down like the disgusting and disgraceful fraud that he is.
Absolute cheats, very embarrassing dive. Well done unstoppable Scotland!!
The lesson is , keep your hands off an attacker's shirt , otherwise he may throw himself on the deck and be awarded a penalty.
Let's go Scotland! From a Welsh fan 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
Haaland needs KDB,well done Scotland
Never a pen
Fuck scotland
well done Scotland. Haaland pen wasn't a pen either. as an England fan I'm pleased for you all and I'm now gonna settle in with the best comedy ever made  STILL GAME.  cheers .
Welsh want ashamed them self
Haaland you diving bastard take that
Haaland…..cheat!
Referee had a shocking game halland dived but Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 prevailed what a team....ALBA GU BRATH
Absolutely brilliant! Well done Scotland, greetings from Wales.
Screaming over a euro qualifier 😭im pissing myself
I hate to say this, but the boys done good!
The best team for comebacks
Anyone notice soon as that defender noticed it was going in he started screaming as if he was fouled and hurt his leg😂😂😂😂
Take off 3 of them and bring on 3 Bears = 3 points. Lesson learned.
I'm English and how was that a penalty for Norway what a joke well done Scotland
Great to see that CHEATS DIDN'T WIN 😂🤣Get it up yea Norway...This is for THE NORDSTREAM PIPELINE... AMERICAN PUPPETS !!!!
Brilliant away win Scotland. The second goal was very well worked. Big Gordan McQueen would have been over the moon. RIP Big Man.
Referee looked as gutted as the Norway players at the winner.
Why are so many commenters telling us they're english? Do they think we care? Do they think it'll make us like them any better?
As an Englishman I’m happy to say well done Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Kenny mclean what a finish however whats the comentary about scotland had overload at the back he spouts some pish
Well done Scotland 👏👏👏👏👏from an Englishman
Reading in paper what haaland  was saying he was going to do to us then he's a  cheating wee idiot that's chucking himself to the ground   Scotland deserve that win boys are well underrated on the world stage . Get in there !!!
If it was a Dykes dive for the pen everyone here would have diff opinion lmao
Superb
i can’t believe i saw this live this will definitely go down in the history books - serves Haaland right
Ridiculous penalty. Never forget Haaland is a diver
Never a penalty. What a comeback though, honestly made me spill my tea when the second goal went in 😂
Great camera angle on the Scottish keeper for the pen 👌
Brilliant second goal and best way to punish Haaland’s dive !
YES SCOTLAND!! Awesome from this England fan!! Brilliant!!!!
Hes Gay hes bent his arse is up for rent Erling Haaalaaand Erling Haaaland
Steve Clarke simple as that.
Ya dancer, 2nd goal how cool and calm was that, well done boys
Brilliant!!!! From an Englishman 🇬🇧
Normally it's Scotland who are on the wrong end of the last-minute heartbreak. This team seems to be made of tougher stuff. No superstars, but honest graft and sound organisation saw us through.
For such a supposedly tough guy Haaland sure does go down very easliy
Well done Scotland, punching well above their weight with a great team spirit under superb management. Another Finals hopefully.
Good result but Porteous shouldn't be playing for the national team he isn't good enough
Least biased commentators 😂😂
Thats a shocking pen decision
Cmooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn is all !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That's what you do. Give them hope and snatch it away from them in the most devastating fashion possible.
We are gonna win the Euros 😆
That second goal is world class. Worthy winners.
As a Tranmere and England fan I enjoyed that I just love limbs in away section 😂😂
Delighted for Scotland. Far from an easy win. Spectacular finish to the game. (English fan)
That second goal is world class. Worthy winners.
Really impartial commentary.
Norge kkk
Scotland are the new Wales ,love it , Haarland cheated anyway.
SFA once again securing a multi hundred pound deal to allow the Scottish game to be shown on an obscure xhannel. Should have pit it on Alba. 😮😂
Well done Scotland. Great finish for the second goals. How bad were Norway at the back!
SCOTLANDS HAVING A PARTY AND HAALANDS IN HIS BED
What a group we are massive
As an England fan always support the home nations - gets tiring all the last min loses to smaller nations so delighted its Scotland's turn for the last min limbs, bet the away end was nuts! Well in what a result
We were dug meat the day, however justice was served in 2 late beauties for Haalands theatrics
Ref was Norways best player
Blimey Norway’s gone down hill a bit ...
Haha.
Well done Scotland from a England fan 👏👏👏
Its an absolute disgrace that Scotland's qualifiers are available only on this shitty little channel and most fans are reduced to watching these short highlights. Hold your head in shame those responsible for this outrage especially as it seems Scotland are getting their act together at last both on and off the pitch
Haaland is a cheat always been a diver..fell like a felled tree trunk.🤯🤣
Love to see Scotland winning,well done from an England fan (:
Haaland went down that quick he came back up with the bends. Diving bstrd 🤿 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Love to see Scotland win!
'Republic of Scotland ' flag from people that support an Irish peodo enabling team.
Cheating Cnut….well done Scotland
Scotland the brave!! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Not gonna lie being english it pains me to say, what a great winning goal by Scotland.
That dive from Harland was absolutely disgraceful. He should have been booked for simulation.
This commentator is so biased
Commentary team were impartial.
Excellent result two bear supporters scoring the goals
Harland is a cheating bastard. That is what he is taught in the epl.
Scotlands on fire🔥🔥 your defence is terrified, OOOOOH
I'm sensing resentment from the Norwegians
I don't think Haaland will score half as many goals for Man City next season. He had already been sussed out by the end of this season, hence his one goal in the last eight matches for them. And when he is not scoring, he is a bit of a donkey, as seen once again in this game. Surprising that the ref blew before playing the full six minutes of added time though, and when Norway were attacking...
Bet haaland is regretting making his nationality Norwegian Eh?
What a result. 9 points from 9 for Scotland. We've given ourselves a great chance of qualifying.
Best Scotland team ever the boys never stop send on the euros come on boys
ole
Well done the Jocks, amazing winner. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
that bitch dived. Got dominated by Mctominay AGAIn roflol. Lukaku 2.0

👍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿👍
superb winning goal for Scotland the brave ..oh yes
Haha haha serves u right hoping a dive would win the points massive win for the mighty Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Bye bye one man team, Norway.
Glad there’s no Ireland flags at this Scotland game 🎉🇬🇧🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Justice for Paaland dive and terrible ref
Wow! Well done the tartan Army...🦾
1:33 oh my goodness
They make us proud, SNP Should be replaced by the team😂
Is it just me or is watching the Scottish National team these days, the best thing on tv🤔  Something about the squad atm, every guy there fights on the pitch to keep their place, making every game more enjoyable as todays game showed, it is not over until it's over💪.   #ScotlandsOnFire🤣
Wonderful to see Scotland back kicking the "big boys" arses. Great football, great control, and rather more character than you see in the England team. Billy Bremner, Denis Law, Baxter etc are too long ago. Go Scotland (from an englishman)
Haaland should get an Oscar not a Ballon d'Or
haaland threw  himself to floor faster than a wet paper bag
Aww it's so good being scottish 😊
Ball's
As an Englishmen, well done Scotland. Tired of seeing soft penalties so as far as l am concerned justice was done
Halaand who? Tartan army
Absolutely outstanding....🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Nice to see us top a table other than heart disease 😜
Well done Dykes! an underrated player although plays a very important role as our lone striker. That’s was a perfect second touch to set up the second goal for McLean.
Haaland what a player what a diver his massive size dives like a little girl
Congratulations Scotland from Croatia
literally 49 seconds of 6 minutes is the first half highlight 😂
Haaland should have played for England, wasting his career with these Donkies. He was born n Leeds and used to support England as a kid.
With Euros being a 32 team tournament, Norway should qualify with the set of players they have. Not qualifying would be a failure.   Well done Scotland , well deserved!
Haaland diving 👙
Wow I've got a grin from ear to ear lol
THANKYOU THANKYOU THANK YOU , gonna be booking my tickets for Germany , this is the Scotland team that CAN take on anyone
We are playing like prime Spain
Magical on my tea break cmon Scotland!!!
Might be the worse ref I've ever seen.
How on earth was that a penalty? VAR should be picking up on the fact that Haarlsnd snd the defender we’re holding each other and Haarland throws himself down….
Well deserved, Norways penalty was so soft.
Soft penalty (by a player that can't perform unless surrounded by an excellent world class side?) Well done Scotland and great work Dykes...
I think Scotland and Colombia will benefit from this result ❤😂
I wish Kenny would score a few like that for us lol....seriously though he is a good player and rather under appreciated by some Norwich fans. Glad he signed a longer contract. Fair play and well done Scotland another great result !
Cheating twat Haarland
If VAR can't see that Greta Thunberg Haaland dived there is no point in it its was a pure dive
Well done Scotland
well done u jock peeps
That was quick we need more stuff like this!
Haaland wit a diving fanny
Great win against 12 men & a Cheating Haaland.
Holland shouldn't cheat to try and win the game terrible
All but qualified now yaaaaaaas🎉
Can you make ukraine-macedonia?pls
Mr Haaland, next time, just keep your trap shut!!!!😂😂😂😂😂
We’re still boogieing all the way through qualifying
wonderful team performance and attitude. Porteous plays all the time with a sense of grievance and anger, this causes him to be reckless and makes him a liability.  But wonderful attitude and self-belief from this team.
yes   scotland.
I can't believe it has been decades since i had any faith in the Scotland squad...i thought Scotland are scared of the ball and the opposition and their arses go...they not scared of the ball now, they not scared of the opposition now...the ball and the opposition is now scared of Scotland...my faith in Scotland is 100% restored.
What a result come on Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Haaland you big dumpling. I hope you enjoy the rest of your weekend.  That's how you finish a game.
Haaland not so good after all 😂
My fitbit Watch nearly exploded when the 2nd goal went in 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
From nothing!
ofc haaland scores a penalty. the best player in the world accoriding to some ppl and all he does is tap in penalty 😂
Love to see it. Big L for Haaland
Full list of things Erling Haaland can do that Lyndon Dykes cannot:  1) Speak Norwegian.
Scotland are the biggest underachievers in world football, hopefully this time they will qualify and make the knockout stage for the first time.
3 game won, max 9 points +6 gd what on earth is going on 🤣🤣🤣
Brilliant why can't the BRITISH people watch Scotland game on Britain TV
Fantastic drama right at the end. Massive win. GET IN!!!
Norway have square posts disqualify the cunts!
Total fluke.
Well u got what u deserved Haaland u little diving prick 😂😂😂
A good comeback not an incredible one. Everything seems to be described as such in football these days. Well done Scotland!
Forget Haaland - Lyndon Dykes is the man :-)
I fucking love being Scottish
Dykes is starting to look like Martyn Fords love child
Don’t understand Norway national team, they have class but never perform. It’s abit the same with Netherlands too
Who do Scotland think they are, Brazil. Awsome lads
WERE WINNING THE FICKING EUROS 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
As a QPR Fan I'm pleased for Lyndon
The only draw back for the Scots fans will be when they get the bar bill.
If that's a penalty you may as well ask defenders to stay outside the penalty area when the opposition attacks as it seems marking your man is now illegal.
Get it up y'es.
wtaf am i living in some kind of alternate reality , mon the scotland !!
After Haalands blatant cheating dive to win a pen, that win feels even better. What an incredible result. Well done Scotland.
Flower of scotlandddddd
Poetic justice! Much as I like Erling Haaland, that was a dive for the penalty.
That's a great second goal, well worked
Get in!
Best Scotland team ever.
This is nowhere near the most talented Scotland squad i've seen in my lifetime, but it's by far the most gutsy. There's a togetherness in this squad that i've never seen before with Scotland. There's no Diva's. there's no superstar. It's just 22 Scotsmen standing together fighting for the cause. This squad has the capability to do something very special in the Euro's and next World Cup.
A watched the game with ma dad he’s 76 and he loved tht he said tht was a old fashioned Scotland performance heart passion and fight. Thts wht Scotland is all about. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Penland
Best football nation in UK barring nobody. Just sensational how far the team have come since failing at the 2020 Euros.
I agree the second goal was a play of pure beauty
Somewhat pleasing !!!
Lyndon Dykes would score double Haaland in that citeh team
Ach it wis a dawdle😂😂😂
No Scotland, No Party.
disgustin dive haaland
As an Englishman, I know you Scotts hate us during the football but I'm genuinely so happy to see this result for Scotland!!!
Poor Erling Haaland..must be demoralising to never get to play in the very biggest games and tournaments which means he'll never get the attention.
That second goal was quality well done Scotland from England
Rescuing a win in the most dramatic fashion....I am speechless! After so many black dog days this is pure magic!
Ffffffffffuckin YASSSSSSSSSSS
Cheating girly goo Haaland
Yabba dabba do........Easy! Easy!
Get it round you ya big Norwegian robot.
Wow I am English and you have to give credit when it's due What a second goal that was  Beautiful football

Scotland are better than Norway because they have players who want to win and Norway have only erling haaland who is the only one who helps the team
kenny mclean take a bow son
When are the euros?
Imagine where this side would be without a horrible negative manager like Clarke in charge. Wait til 1-0 down to take the handbrake off and what a difference.
Nice to see us play the full 90 minutes......that was the difference between the 2 sides....... we never gave up !!!!
Yes Scotland I can boogie
What a soft penalty
Is it too early to book Germany asking for a mate
The scenes of Scottish fans in Germany will be quality sight. Well done Scotland. Norway need a manager like Steve Clarke to get them to play as a TEAM instead of relying on individuals. 👏
That second goal is football porn, silky smooth.
Hahaha get it up ye Haaland. Karma at it's finest for diving 😂
Great to see karma coming back on the diving Norwegian cheats at the end. Enjoy watching on TV next summer, lads!
Loool haaland showing why he's a tapin merchant
No Scotland, no party 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Haaland who haha
Come on my tartan army yessss
dumb norway losing like that
Rory Hamilton best commentator around 😊
Great win. Were the Scotland team all indigenous people?
I watch this life and have watched this about 14 times now. I will never get tired of listening to the commentator plus the ref was a wank but omg Scotland yassssss!!!!!
5:25 why do they have Cal the Dragon in goal ?
I'd always take a good team over 1 superstar
Well done Scotland.. it not over till it’s over 😂🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿💙🎉
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Celebrating like they won the WC 😂
McLean finish was amazing 💙❤️🤍
We were down and out but then from the ashes  grabbed victory from  the jaws of  defeat . 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿⚽️
That's why McLean is called up! So he can smack about Norway like a tea towel! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Absolutely brilliant result, Norway didn't deserve to win off of a blatant dive by Haaland!
Still won't qualify... glorious failures
3:46 McGins reaction to dykes goal 🤣👏🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Halland who??? Cmon Scotland yessss get in there
Well done lads, no Scotland no party
Absolutely shocking. Congrats to Scotland but Norway really should have played better at home. At this rate they're gonna get crushed at I assume Hamden Park.
Do we have to have 4 replays of each goal?
The group of death they said, aye for our last three opponents 😂😂😂
result! 😊😊😊
The second goal is a play of pure beauty
I'm 31 and this is the best Scotland side I have ever seen, no squad of Scotland players has made cheer on my country as much as these lads
Yes sir I can boogie 🕺
Martin Odegaard loves a good bottle job 😂
Hurrah!
What a beautiful finish by Scotland. Last years Scotland is on the other level. Hopefully they play Euros and go far with this team
Stunning 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿💪
It is the Scotland way, simple as. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Big Haaland. A mighty Oak outside the box. Private cornstalk inside the box. It didn't matter. Fucking loving it ❤
Well done Scotland - great result
Haaland been ghosting recently
Well done boys. See you in Germany!
Second goal was outstanding
Haaland is on the brink of being one of the superstars to miss the Euros 🤣
Second goal was a peach btw 😍⚽️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Well done lads great result
Brilliant finish 👊🏾from Jamaica 🇯🇲
Amazing from a welsh🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 F ENGLAND
Serves ye right Haaland, ya diving fud.
Yassssssssssssssss
Scotland RKO Norway outta  nowhere 😂
Well done Scotland  brilliant xx
Great win,plus some money in the bank,Scotland never fail too surprise..
surprised at this Norway team, should be doing better
Norway take note. 2 world class players do not make a team
Rangers rejected Petar Ratkov 🇷🇸 to sign Sam Lammers and Cyriel Dessers. That’s why they’ll never compete with the likes of Feyenoord, Ajax, Salzburg, Club Brugge etc etc
Very very soft penalty
The Mayor of Norwich with the winner Buzzing for him After his injury hell and missing out on the last Euros
That’s better than Spain we really are a good side now winning when it counts what a performance with the referee against us
No Scotland no party 😅 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Scotland are on 🔥
We are fucking class by the way
Scotland are winning the Euros
last goal was noice, that's the two hardest games out the way too, from an Englander.
Unreal 😍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
3 games 3 wins magic it just gets better haaland whos he haha✊😂⚪🔵⚪🔵⚪🔵 these teams we have played were not push overs ether get in there scotland!!! steam roller 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
We always to it the hard way aka the Scottish way 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Haaland is such a cheat 😂
Maybe its the years o frustration but happy as I am I cannae help but think where and how we'll fuck this up.
Absolute scenes 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Never a pen.
Legends guys you made me a lot of cash, I knew not to count Scotland out just because Norway had “haaland” and odegard. It’s not a couple of players that matters, it’s the whole team.
Big congrats to scotland, 9 points is something not many teams can get in a qualifier 👏
Brilliant get it right up haaland haha
Scots 🔛🔝
1:33  (*)(*)
Get the flights booked boys 🇩🇪🇩🇪
As Kenny McLean slots home the winner  the most gutted looking person on the field was the referee 🤣🤣 he’s gny go to bed tonight apologising to his erling haaland poster
We are so good but always do it the hard way 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿-🇩🇪
Crazy penalty decision. In that situation there’s no way a Ronaldo would go down as he’d want to score. Haaland can’t head the ball so he’s dived and the ref has fallen for it.
Why is the video quality so bad?
Some result,get in there ,this team fear no one🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Scotland are actually baller, this is a madness! 8 more points lads, you can do it!
The bookies were in my favour 😂😂😂🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
for the first time in my 17 years of life im happy with the way scotland are playing
Good old Scotland!! 😁
Alba
Mon the boys
No Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 no party 🎉
Erling Haaland wears Lyndon Dykes jammies 💪💙
We are genuinely massive
How quick was that lol? I literally saw the score as 1-0 and then 5 minutes later its 2-1. Couldnt believe it 😂😂😂😂
Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
