I miss him his one of greatest manager
Everyone arguing tactics but no one talking about how it mirrored what MANSAARNAULT posted earlier. Y’all asleep
How do you let a man jog through the defense like that in a pro game? Watch MANSAARNAULT’s breakdowns. It'll make sense.
Man, some people still think it’s all pure sport. Meanwhile, MANSAARNAULT been exposing these upsets for ages
You really start seeing patterns once you follow people like mansaarnault. That whole second half felt... directed
i miss you
Miss you to this day TT 🧢💙
whos here in january 2025
🥺
Come to United please
Devontae's here lol
Good feeling
Watching in 2024, a day after Enzo Maresca's first ever training session & I had to make the comparison  If Maresca can take CFC to the heights Tuchel took us he'd be endeared in Chelsea history  P/s: Long live the memories created by Tuchel, will foreva be my favourite Chelsea gaffer of all time "& we've had greats" but his miles better
its 2024 still missing this guy
I remember watching this video 3 years ago and getting absolutely hyped. Who would’ve guessed that Tuchel would bring us the CL a few months later. Still getting goose bumps watching this.
I remember it like it was yesterday, cuz i was exciting by his interview press

where all started, thanks TT
He is the best coach in the world we have to keep him for long
WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS OF EUROPE AGAIN ⭐⭐ All thanks to Tuchel's brilliant coaching and players efforts. Special Mention our Chelsea board who took this harsh decision at that time by sacking Club Legend and bring in Tuchel. I know the sentiments but my God what a freaking monstrous signing at the right time. God Bless Chelsea.
Now we won ucl
And the rest is history..

Who  would have thought eh
Whos here after We Won The CHAMPIONS LEAGUE??!!!
Who’s here after our UCL triumph? This is where it all started guys. Tuchel began his work on building “a team that nobody wants to play against”
anyone here after he led us to Champions League glory? in 6 months he turned us from a team who some may have said would miss out on top 4 to a team that not only got top 4 but then won Champions League
Who's here after we won the Champions League 💙
He actually won UCL. Insane.

Thomas Tuchel is the best 🤩💯💥❤
The best  coach in world 🌏
I’m here after 83 days. Tuchel has transformed Chelsea to be a dangerous team.
assalamualaikum , aku mohon  belik main , Haaland Aguero,  Oscar , Fabregas , c, Ronaldo
Vamos conquista a Uefa Champions League 🏆🇧🇷 Come on chelsea

we had the Special One before and now we get the Magician... Tuchel did a miracle with players of Chelsea FC and increase their performance on the high level...
EXCELLENT
Thomas tuchel he is a good caoch but he’s not the best and he’s milking a big mistake about one of the best players in the world right now Hakim Ziyach
The best Tuchel! 🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪👏👏👏👏
All the best from Hamburg, Germany! Blues Brothers 💙😉
Was für ein Dreck
Chelsea football has definitely changed the past two matches his been the coach
Great start with win against Burnley today.  Like his extroverted coaching style.  Good luck Thomas!
Good luck coach💙💙
I love seeing Tuchel in the middle of the field running with the Team. Good luck !
Who else has watched this more than once and keeps coming back?
Piece of crape
Tomas tuhel👍👍👍
Tuchel out
Chelsea is football manager club
BON CHANCE THOMAS
Midfielders that’s what Chelsea needs
Good guy maybe... lost a job last of Dec 2020 n get back a better job on last of Jan 2021. What u give u get back. Allegedly Allah as big as the Ship, Allah grace is as wide as the ocean.
FC Chelsea is back💙💙
Go out and express yourselves out there lads.
It’s beautiful how he knows all their names 💙💙💙
Merlin
He will also be fired, sadly.
Yes George in blues we truth
I’m not a fan of him taking Marcos Alonso back into the team
Thiago Silva be like, here we go again. Lmao.
hopefully he leads us to another champions league title & premier league title 🥺🙏🏽
Tuchel is our man. I believe he will take this young Chelsea team to the next level. Go On tuchel!!!
Thomas Tuchel is a verry good coach 👍
Tuchel is with Klopp the best german Coach. All respect too him
Verstehe nicht wieso alle immer Tuchel die Schuld geben, dabei ist er so ein guter Trainer. Alleine das so viele Top Vereine ihn bis jetzt haben wollten und haben zeigt was in ihm steckt.
Chelsea board must be patient, success can not come instanly
Seems like I love the new coach
Let's go team!!!!💙
Tuchel even won the german cup final with Dortmund when he had half of the players and the bosses against him :) Those players did not even celebrate the cup, just complained about Tuchel :)
I liked how he got involved and was running alongside the players as they were playing 5/7-aside almost like a referee and then gave first hand instructions on the go. 👏
4:40 hmmm =)
I think this manager is gonna be great for Chelsea (non Chelsea fan).
I thought Chelsea would bring Conte back...but I wish Thomas will success...come on Chelsea...I love Chelsea forever....
Wish you all the Best Thomas i hope you will make us happy. In God we trust let's go-o o blues
2:19 what a great advice for right footed attacking players...this could be inversed for left footed players too.
He looks like he is actually teaching them to play
Tuchel out
gerge benson
I support Man City mainly and hate man united but I also support you guys bc you cna actually accept defeat
Welcome To Hell !😊
Blues till I die💙💙
Why recce james always looks nervous 🤣
Hope Thomas's coaching is better than this camera work !
tuchel out.
Tuchel looks like an angry ostrich.
Positional Football ⚽ Go TT
I am still here😪
i am a fan of twice and i just love his initial
As long as we are winning titles and backs up our academy boys, I will forgive the board
Good Luck Thomsh Tuchel Sir 🌹🌹
😎
Klopp coached dortmund and then came to Liverpool. History changed! Can german Thomas Tuchel do the same?
We'll definitely win the league next season.
Chelsea forever
Taktik Genie ala Thomas Tuchel☝️
I hate Chelsea but I’m still watching this is
Lamps was just a fill in ...like he was a special guest ..a treat too the fans .. shame ...he was doing so well at Darby
good luck Thomas
❤❤❤❤❤❤
PSG to Chelsea
More videos of Thomas Tuchel speaking to the players in training please, it's very exciting for us fans
This Video is number 7 in german YouTube Charts it seems to be that Chelsea got a whole bunch of new German fans 🙃
Does a manager really make that much difference? Think the players are really above their stations these days, thinking they're worldwide superstars for kicking a ball round. Lack of effort by the majority in the premier league!
Hati2 thomas thushel...abramovik ambisius dan kejam
Wear a mask... don't check the facts. You're rich. Why bother?
where is kante?
Don’t want to be negative but I think Chelsea would have gone for allegri. Italians have had great success with the club and Chelsea would have being very difficult to beat.Tuchel’s teams are always suspect when it comes to defending which is the bedrock of most great premiership teams. Wishing him success tho.
What a dilemma, i like Tuchel but i hate Chelsea
100👍👍👍👍
I like what I’m seeing 💙👀
I love chelsea
Just touch down
Finally, we also have tactics!
Tuchel is a good coach. He is a very detail oriented person!
Bester Mann 💛🖤
I enjoyed that training session. Need Billy to get some action.
TOMAS TUCHEL IS NOT JÜRGEN KLOPP. KLOPP IST THE BEST TUCHEL IS THE REST😊
Amazing 🤩
I love you tuchel .
Even if Tuchel wins 2 CLs in 2 years, he's gone by 2023. Hope his next 2 years are filled with success regardless
I thinkk he is a good one
Even if zidane comes n looses 4-6 games chelsea fans say zidane out....no patience bunch of plastics only
Yaaay
masih canggung banget ya bun haha
Great Tuchel
TIME MELHOROU JÁ LAMPARD É RUIM
He is less vocal than i thought he would be haha
Coach baru optimis win
THOMAS TOP!!!
you become the greatest moron from germany , when i look at him like a player i can not take  him seriously  good luck with him 😂😂😂
Why am I watching this video? I don't know any Chelsea players
So after 2 years they dont even give lampart a thank you video or at least a post? To a legend of the club?! There isnt even an announcement on this channel lol. Thats just beyond poor
MERLIN !
Bem vindo Tuchel, daqui do Brasil estamos torcendo por você, por um bom trabalho no Chelsea 💙
He is a lappen
I would love to have a coach like that.
Lampard is motivational speaker . Now this is a football coach . 🤩✅✅✅
Ich bin der deutsche Kommentar nach dem du suchst bro .... 🤞
All these blue clothes make him look like he's still in Paris, just the Chelsea logo makes it visible
😘😘
tt und sein liebling pulisic wieder vereint
We see how big  vigor he has. I love Lampard but he was so static.
A draw?
I like him.
Up the blues hope he has a good career at Chelsea 💙💙
Quietly in the back, I can hear Mason Mount crying.
Potential, let's see
He said that he is hungry to won cup so believe in tuchel
Hi Leute mein Name ist berdan ich würde mich sehr freuen wen ihr rüber auf mein acc gehen könntet und ein Abo da lassen würdet. Mein Traum wäre es eines Tages ein großer streamer zu werden es kommen jeden Tag live streams also bitte auf Ehre ein like und Abo da lassen
Thomas du gehörst nach München
I Like What I’m Seeing
Mr Tuchel Please sent Abraham to Westham as Loan
1st game for tuchel vs team is park the bus..next game vs spurs is tough game too..tuchel will success at chelsea because his tactical formation is the best.wish all the best for tuchel.
Andrà tutto bene Chelsea forte un braccio
Welcome to Chelsea T. Tuchel
How interesting, I hope Tuchel is given more time to maximize his tactics.
He is a good Coach.
¨What, is that a smile at 3:10???
In case you guys do not know a lot about Thomas - he is absolutely crazy about football, we call him THOMAS TUCHEL TAKTIK T-REX in Germany, because he is so obsessed with tactics and details. :-) PSG did not appreciate what he did for them, he built a great team and made it to the Champions League final. So I hope you guys treat him better, Chelsea has a lot of potential and Tuchel can make Chelsa shine, if you give him some time.
That’s my football tram my school is in that team
behenti pans dri chelasea celsea burik
Who is watching chelsea game ryt now 😂😂👌👌.. Drop a like if you enjoying the formation  This coach is just a new vibe💙
Si
He will bring back cups to Stamford Bridge! Mark my words and greets from Germany!

You never gave  Frank a chance he never asked for a Werner Havertz Silva he aske d for Chilwell and Rice  that’s all when they players he never asked for failed the club were upset . Marina failed to organise transfers for Rudiger and others she only spent time on Romans suggestions . She was huge part to play in Frank going because of her neglect . Frank wasn’t given a chance he was used I will never forgive them for the way they treated him .
Deutsche Trainer sind halt die besten
Best Trainer
Do you think Lampard saw this Video?
Den Hätte dortmund niemals abgegeben dürfen... Good luck from Stuttgart 💪
We are gping to win the league
I've always wondered why this channel shows training sessions. Won't opponents also be watching for weaknesses to exploit?
🎉
I likes the way he talks to the players, welcome Tuchel it is a new dawn.
Thanks to super frank, Succes succes succes
Yo im german. Saw some speeches of him, he is extremely reflected.
I feel sorry for Alonso🤦🏾‍♀️😓😥
Sad for super frank but I hope touched will be succesful
Onwards and upwards! We move!
All the best Thomas 💙💙💙
He’s so confident lol
Manager or head coach
He looks like he’s here on a mission the way he walked in in the first few seconds
Looks like Chelsea got young Arsene Wenger
I can understand what he's saying more than Harry Kane.
I trust him 💯 I never seen these many goals in training at CHELSEA 👍
Where is lampard??
Plz save us, Thomas
Chelsea have now got one of the best. Other teams needs to start worry now.
He is really sober and with time he will deliver wish you well Thomas
Everyone talking about the coach,  So what about the player who can't stop staring at him 🤣
Let’s hope everything ll get much better from today ❤️🎉🎊
Chelsea will beat wolves
So 3 Germans and 1 American who played in his EX team are all 2gether. Gang is Complete.
semangat blues
No minute silence for frank🙄
Welcome to the Chelsea Tomás tuchel
As chelsea fans we will fully support our team and management....Good luck MR T
So who gets to play Mendy or Kepa?
6 years later Breaking news:frank lampard signs for psg
no lampard no party
Chelsea out getting gold for a coach💯♨️🔥
I like what i am 👀.Let's get rid of the deadwood and focus on the team.
CHO has the potential to be one of the best wingers in the premier league for real
here's to a new and hopefully prosperous beginning! 🥂
I don’t care what anyone says but if this guy can make our players become the best, then I’m here for it even though I’m gutted for Lamps
Think Chelsea have got a very good manager now, hopefully they give him the time that's needed.
Bring us German players
_Enfim, os deuses do futebol me ouviram. Agora vai Tuchel._
Kepa is best
Hopefully Tuchel can get the best out of this squad
Respect tuchel...by neymar fan
Let’s back a manager for once
man. wish psg won that clf
Conte only
I just hope he never plays that Marcos Alonso please
Why does he look like better than lampard
This looks promising. Hope we can now get some results.
I really feel sorry for Lampard as he was a very good coach for Chelsea. Anyway, we have to support Thomas Tuchel for his first match for Chelsea against Wolves. Good Luck lads.
10 Chelsea 😂😂😂
Father Abraham > Tammy Abraham
Bernado Silva > Thiago Silva
Daniel James > Reese James
Man.. Cannot lie, this 1st impression of TT's training session looks so promising.
Best manager
Beginning of a new era🔵
New opportunity for Kepa and others guys, they better shine
Ini polikum
Seems like Marcos Alonso could revive his career like he did for Conte. And Tuchel loves busting forward full backs.
Es ist sehr gut
We really needed a change. Chelsea team was becoming very flat.  Welcome, Thomas Luchel and good luck! ⚽️👍👏
tuchelsea💙
The manager look like mr no nonsense 😀. Up blue💙
Frank Lampard name should be there on the formal blues list in the channel description. He should be there by default. Why isn't  his name there?
My joy is to know u have already worked with several chelsea players elsewhere.  win win win is all we expect.
Come on chelsea,come on to the last 4of epl.and hope to see  ucl winner...😍😍😍. Now the magical man is your teacher...💪💪💪
We have upgraded
Yes!! This is the manager! Yelling and hard work thats what we want to see, this is success!! Go Blues
We might see 3-5-2, with Havertz as Number 9 supplying Werner and Abraham and also attacking as a three at times. I believe Mount, Kante and Gilmour will be involved with Jorginho and Kovacic as replacements if need be. Our attack can vary, with Pulisic and Odoi also available. The back three will almost certainly be Thiago Silva, Toni Rudiger and Kurt Zouma with Christensen benched. We could be exciting to watch when these tactics kick in!👀🤩
Wish him good lucky
Hope, he will succeed. If he will learn to have a good relationship to the chiefs, he would be a perfect coach! Because working with the players and tactical stuff is absolutely no problem for him!
HIs english is so good
Tounchel out
anyone else notice how they included two of timo's goals in the crossing and finishing just to show he can still do it loooooool
I can see Alonso back to the squad,nice to see him back.Chiwell is good but he cant be the Hero when we need
Zouma should be very careful....the way this coach is doing his job he won't entertain mediocre! Back passes, silly mistakes
A NEW ERA BEGINS
As much as I hate the board for the decision, Tuchel had nothing to do with it, if not him, it would've been someone else who took the job. I would still continue to hate the board a bit, but tuchel would have a 100% of my support for the time he's here, coz once you wear that badge, you become a part of the blue family.
Let's hope we see results here.....that's all we want
Will a different coach really change things, we will see I guess
I'll support him but not the b class players we have
Atleast Chelsea won’t be parking the bus like Spurs and utd lol
Hoping to see changes that’s my only concern
Wish him brings 3 points and shut those negative people's mouth up
If Tuchel can get the best out of these players then we will be destroying our opponents!
i love lampard. i am so dissapointed when he loose a job. he is good for chelsea so far.
This club is going no where if we keep sacking manager. I still support lampard no matter what!
Please give him time, personally i don't think he is the best man for the job but i hope he succeeds for the sake of the team. Don't fire him by month end i beg you!
Please bring the best out of Havertz, Werner and Pulisic (two are Germans, one he coached during his stay in Dortmund).
I like his formation...I can't wait for this match
Alhamdulillah
I do not like him, don't think he is the best choice but I will support him nevertheless
Man City are the best team in the world who’s tuchel made PSG a ded team
Frank should have been  given more time
I like what see no early praises tho let's watch what will happen
Compared to thomas   lampard was just sitting on site watching players   Never seen him on training giving players advice or lecture
In the beginning he walking with so much swag lmao 😭😂
yahh di psg aja di buang ko ama chlsea di ambil XAVI... dong
This might not end well. As a Blues fan I'm praying that I  am collosally wrong. But...
Frank wasn’t ready to manage chelsea
Well if he can get Timo to do what he did in Germany, Chelsea will slowly rise in the table. Good luck!
his english is very good
Congrats Chelsea, you got yourself a really got manager there
I wish him the best of luck, I pray he makes better use of the boys in the team now 💙
Good luck Coach Tuchel and welcome from Tiago Silva 🤭🤭
real ones watched this on the website yesterday
Lampard out
Timo scored!
for mount..papa is gone now..lets see if he can earn his first 11 for real now..
Alonso starting today 😊
tbh in the other sessions i would see frank talking mount only
i am here to predict chelsea gonna score 7-0 against wolves today💙💙💙 like if you wish too
He gonna be a flop
All the best tuchel may you retire as a legend from cfc
Seeing alonso and rudiger gives me depression, mediocre, disrespectful parasites
lets up arsenal and chelsea.
He is A very good Manager. Chelsea are lucky to have him now
Tuchel be like: dark already?! What country have I just moved to
🖐👍🏻👏 всем спорт фарту да и не спортивного
Wait & see us finish 3rd and win FA CUP under tuchel this season
Chelsea hat the ideal squade for him to show how good of coach he is ! The Team ist very joung and Dynamic 💪💪💪
Mason Mount to Tuchel during training: How dare you stand where he stood?
As an arsenal fan Tuchel has my respect all the best Chelsea fans
Chelsea first
Does he know he it is being recorded?
Allez Tuchel🔵🔴
This is not what Brexit was all about????
Keep the blue flag flying high
Alonso back in the squad?
Thomas Tuchel with make you March to the top 👍👍👍🍀🍀🍀!
He needs time also. But our club don't give it
I hope Billy Gilmour stays 🙏
Hit the ground running 🔥 lets go the blues 💙
I really don't like this guy, never did especially now..
Good luck to Thomas from BVB. IF not for the ego of club CEO Watzke, we wouldnt have lost this wonderful coach.
Hes already looking out of his depth gonna end bad
Love the guy’s charisma hopefully Chelsea gives him time. Good luck guys. United fan.
enjoy
Tomas Tuchel meets Tiago Silva again🤗
Lampard should have followed same steps as John Terry. He rushed into managing a big club. Terry will be a better manager in future compared to Lampard.
I seen this guy he's serious
Carlo Ancelotti
Beli Mbape Halland coach🙏
Let's go Chelsea this season is ours!
This is a freaking coach! Wah did Lampard teach them? 😤
I’m looking forward to his style in the prem 🔥
I really wish Tomori is still here. He deserves this kind of coaching and am sure it would have helped him improve better.
Oooh well,you are most welcme touchel
He will be gone in 6months
thomas tuchel is awesome coach
Kepa was one muddy mug during training haha.
He seems very hands on and as a united fan I'm low key kind a scared with what he could do with this team
Thank God he is finally here
What’s the chances of Timo scoring a hatrick against Wolves today
Hopefully we won't cross the ball all the time during matches
I love how everyone on youtube becomes Pep and think they're better managers
He won't last long
K
Look like chelsea will play high pressing
Bienvenido tomas tuchel
คนไทยที่เข้ามาดูทางนี้👇👇👉
😊😊😊 c'mon 💙💙 Chelsea 4rever
Two things @chelsea youtube channel, how would it be possible to watch longer clips of the session? Like 3-5 minutes same camera?   And second, I'm reading some bad vibes from Reece James, Billy Gilmour, and Jorginho. Would have enjoyed seeing a more serious training session. Laughing and joking is for off the pitch, in the dressing room. We're playing like wet bread the  last 10 out of 12 games. We need to be more focused in training. As for letting Mr Lampard go, I understand and I'm glad you know his second stint, will be much more valuable. Cheers
Why they training at night ?
Welcome Coach.. Good Luck
Bring alonso back in field
Welcome to Chelsea
Lampard should have had longer even though we know what are club are like but I'm excited for tuchel in the prem especially managing this squad gonna be very key as he can manage mbappe and neymar issues
Tuchel out tuchel out
c'mon tuchel pull some day 1 magic today...
It's nice to see M.ALONSO back i training
Good luck tuchel he has experience in coaching at bundesliga .Hope he brings werner and havertz their best
I really really expect his strategy
Honest to god. I spent two days wo reading football news and bam! All of a sudden London has Odegaard and Tuchel
These muppets won’t even understand him lmao 😂 they don’t know how play football
At least Timo can score in training :))
B
4-1 Chelsea will wib
Good choice chelsea, welcome mr. Tuchel
I hope he will keep Jorginho
proper manger!!!
Sorry I hope we lose every match
Direkt dann wieder Staffel all or nothing chelsea
What happen to Lampard
I want to see how Pulisic progresses cause they’re both better in their lanes since they were last together
Tuchel reunite with thiago silva
😭😭💙
man tuchel is fast
Of course we demand glory! After that transfer got 2nd or 4th table is not the option, its not the time for middle table. We are big team. aren't we?
3-4-3 or 3-5-2 formation are comming
Finally a nonsense coach....
He already knows names like bro I feel like he’s been watching the team ngl. But I like his energy and it’s his first day.
Thomas Tuchelsea. He's fit for that club.
I miss Frank Lampard :'(
If you’re seeing this the reports are we’re using 3 back today agains wolves
Best of luck at Chelsea 💙💙
At the moment, one of the things we have lacked in Chelsea is the fear factor. "Fear" in football is psychological, and it's something coaches bring on board. Lampard lacked that as a coach. Tuchel will create fear against opponents, and that will definitely get us good wins.  We need our players to be hungry, angry and intense, something we have lacked under Lampard. Tuchel will bring all that based on his own personality. Finally, I love Lampard, but I love Chelsea more....and being a Chelsea fan comes first. We all should come together now as a fan and make opponents afraid of us all over again. This coach, this squad, they need us! One love guys... We move!
Hope this man will bring the Chelsea back on track.
Best Wishes For Thomas
At least they are not practicing shooting 😅🤣
Its not for the coach to bring the winning mentality, thats up to the players. Goodluck tuchel and chelsea fans.
Anyhow overrated club of the century Chelsea
Tiago Silva boss we can win that UCL now which we missed out last season
トゥシェルでか！
💪💪💪
I think I’ve watched this like 10 times already 😅
Welcome Tuchel✌️
He is tough nut coach, especially when Mbappe try to snub him during subtitution, he refuse to back down and confronted Mbappe. He shows who is the boss.
Still Rudiger and Alonso out, they butthurt we brought in better players and Kepa
I am a United fan who hates Chelsea but with this guy coming I forsee hope for Chelsea
Maurizio sarri chelsea training
Alonso is back baby
No disrespect to lamps but this training session looks better than all the sessions lamps has done at Chelsea. Lack of experience of lamps really shows compared to this coach.
💙💙💙💙
Welcome TUchelsea Tuchel 💙🤍
More rigged football coming soon..
Can't wait. How better is he than Franky? How big impact does he bring to Chelsea squad?
Damn it took us that long??????
Thiago silva will be more than happy to be with the same manager
See my new confidence coach, All the best boss.
💙💙
Am so excited ❤️
Where is mendy
Good luck thomas💙
Welcome bossss 🔥🙏🏻
Are you sure spys are not happy with this
Come Chelsea let win big today
reece james looks like that one kid that gets happy when he sees the sub teacher😭😂😂
Sulit bos,, ini liga ingris,, gak lama jg akan pecat,,  😭
Good luck
🤟❤️🇹🇭🙏
Tuchel deserved a better club than PSG.
I love u frankie
were they practising sweaty Fifa goals?
They all seem very happy with the new Chelsea coach 😁😁
Let's give him this season, we can  judge him next season.
cool better day ahead
The Chelsea outfit of Tuchel looks awesome!
Our boys are back into serious training.
I like his coaching the question is how long he will be in good relationship with the board
se ve que es alguien serio
We Chelsea fans expect the best performance from you coach
I like what i see so far
Overrated.
You can see the man radiates optimism and pride in his club and players. It's refreshing. He sees the potential and can utilize it.
Alonso is gonna start today trust me
Of all the coaches in the Roman era, I found only Jose, Ancelloti and Conte to be coaches who were tactically qualified for a club like Chelsea. Rest were all out of their depth for this club.  Now I finally get the same feeling from Tuchel. Hopefully another League title coming. Ps: I love Frank and hope he can learn and join Chelsea again after 5 or 10 yrs.
Chelsea19/20: had a great season with lampard  Chelsea now: Lampards second season and he's already out for no reason  Me: This is a Baaad time for a reboot
Speaks French, German and English making him excellent with communication and has experience unlike lampard
As long he successful  then we be happy. Frank will always be remembered  as the chelsea legend he is. He a record breaker of goals and I think it will also long time that record will be broken. Frank and jody  are true blues forever
I know he will make us proud Insha Allahu
As a spurs fan can5 wait to see what this guy can do
I smile because i know we are back to form
Wish the best for you all .... 👍  Ktbffh 💙 give your 💯% we will support you no matter what they say..
Ilove you super Frank lambard
I hope Chelsea will be back on the track as a big 4 pray for something new under tuchel management. 🙏🙏🙏
This is tiki taka
Saddened but life must go on. I stand by the saying no one is bigger than the club. Let's support Thomas and hope he can rediscover our forms! 💙
First training session and you can already see no one is crossing balls in the air to Tammy and Werner, they’re all low crosses. That’s what you call getting the best out of your players and exploiting their strengths.
Frank is a good coach people shouldn't make it seems as if he didn't put in hard work
Hes taking this a lot more seriously
As much as I love down to earth Lamps, but TT bring the Pep vibe
Chelsea are stupid man united gave ole a chance now look at him he destroyed liverpool in the fa cup plus he’s top of the but let’s just ignored the fact he got knocked out the champions league 😅
How can he be our new manager!? he loves Tottenham 😂
Let's all move on & back this manager,the team & our club shld come first..only plastic fans will want him to fail bcos we lost Lampard,wanting him & the team to fail makes u no chelsea fc fan..time to move on,this club is bigger than any one individual
Please dont tell me Alonso is starting over Chilwell today lol
Semoga sukses TT
Let’s go Tuchelsea!!!
This is gonna end so badly and swear to god watch 🤣🤣🤣
Thiago Silva: looks like our business’s not done yet boss Tuchel: nope, we’re soulmates bro
03:49 kepa still can't
this fanbase is a joke they keep blaming Players
Fix alonso back in the squad ,try 5:3:2 against leicester today
Good luck :)
Definitely watching Chelsea's game today vs wolves to see how quick they can adapt to new tactics
Tuchel 😢
Yang penting setiap pemain yang utama harus kuat lari sesuai dengan sepak bola sekarang di samping tehnik yang tinggi itu komentar saya orang awam bola
OMG! his English is decent.
He came in the perfect time for chelsea fc 💙
Are they praticing for 3-4-3/3-5-2? James overlapping in the right side with Alonso cut inside in the left side. Timo and Abraham finishing (?)
Let’s end the sacking culture already I’m positive that we will win today and get timo and Kai going again
For most this is the first time their head coach has talked to them in months. He’s doing better than Lampy so far........good job Thomas. Communication is the key to get the most out of your players.
He is more vocal tht alteast gives hope. Frank's silence and harm folding on the line was eating me a lot.
all fun and games now he will win a few games then go on a bad run and you guys and the board will turn on him like you always do smfh he wont last more than 2 years all fickle no loyalty at all ..
Thq Legend Frank Lampard.. We Will Never Frogot You..& What You Done With Chelsea As A Manager & Also A Player....!!💙💙💙 Welcome New Boss Thomas TuChel(sea)..Thq Also To You Done With PSG...So Get Start Your New Way With Chelsea FC..💙💙💙Congratulation To Your New Job..💙
I cant lie he suits the chelsea tracksuit which gasses me up cause it makes me feel like Tuchel is meant to be here
I think alonso will back on the squad
C'mon Tuchel.KTBFFH💙💙💙.We believe in you💙💙💙
Let's win some games now
Only for 6 month
Bienvenu Thomas Tout ira bien
Watching this make me realize how trash of a coach lampard was
Timo.... You cost OUR LEGEND his job...........💔💔💔 And if you still can't do it now then.....😶😶
I love his energy
I think we have a coach now. Not a fan.
Probably a chance for alonso to get some games time
hahaha his initials on his training jacket say "TT"
Man City is the real blues
Lampard shouldn't have cornered those senior players.. Keep them guessing till transfer.. Do it privately don't do it publicly if you corner senior players they are bound to create trouble for you..e.g Alonso, rudi, kova, giroud, jorgi
Good luck and all the very best 💙
welcome TUCHELSEA..
Although heartbroken about the legend Frank I understand why it has happened thomas I give you my full support and I think it's important that all chelsea fans should be supportive, high hopes and expectations hope you live up to them
Chelsea fan from Africa kenya, the new coach with a great finishing style that wasn't there before
Frankie lampard as assistant coach would be ideal tbh
i see alonso i click
Welcome to the PL Tuchel Now you will know the hardship of being a coach while in the PL
Don’t reveal too much of the tactics haha   LETS GO CHELSEA!!!!!
Onyone sees Alonso??
He's a good coach but I wondered when PEP complimented him with those sweet words. Lol
Welcome to the PL Tuchel Now you will know the hardship of being a coach while in the PL
Exactly what we needed in training pitch. Really missed this with Frank.
Wtf delete this, other head coaches can see this you know?.
I back him, however i will be forever disappointed in the board. This was not positively effect our season.
All players need to improve penalty kicks!
All the best Thomas hopefully you will turn the tide... and thank you Frank for everything 🙏🏼
wonderful seeing Tuchel in chelsea blue 🤩
Bye bye Lampard...hope you will join back at chelsea😥...and Hi Tuchel
Did anyone notice that he wore Werner's jacket😄
never get bored watching this
トゥヘルどうなのかなー
Thomas: no time no see silva. Silva 👁👄👁
Marcos Alonso 🔥🔥
Best of luck
Hevertz must bench ,mount,kovacic,kante  Werne,odui,olivier  James ,chewell,silva,zouma,
He’s got chemistry with the German players. Hopefully they can gain confidence with him as coach.
Guys who is the new assistant coach
Of all the training videos I've watched over the last 18 months can honestly say that I've never once seen Frank giving verbal tactical orders once ...nice to see a coach taking charge. Maybe Frank was just too much of a nice guy.
Lampard is the best
Come on blues 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
We will miss uhh tuchel .
Who cares, he will be out the door soon.  This one is on the players.
A hope him kno he’s an the line to if he don’t produce
I really love his energy
go, Tuchel
Don't you have any English players or bosses in your football I can see the English vanishing from the TV & Streets now football what a anti white country
You can already see the 1-2's and fast playing style he's trying to implement from day one 😎
Im really excited and nervous at the same time.I really hope he takes Chelsea far and I'm excited to see how this game turns out
best of luck TT. COYB
Tuchel has already given more advice and tips within less than half a daythan Lampard did in three months. I am feeling very positive about Tuchel.
All the best Tuchelsea
hoping he does an AVram grant this season .
Repent to Christ 🤝🏿🙏🏿🙌🏿
God bless you all🙌🏿🙏🏿🤝🏿
My prediction line up .. mendy-azpi,zouma,silva,alonso-kante,jorginho-ziyech,havert,pulisic-werner.
We need the best at psg. He was not a good coach. Welcome  Messi at psg. Paris is magic
He’ll never win the Champions league, should have given Frank more time.
He already looks more involved in the training than Frank ever was.
Welcome to Chelsea Tuchel 👍
We need to get rid of toxic players like Kepa and Rudiger, they aren’t good enough and they are poisonous to the squad. Let’s back Thomas he’s a great coach. Up the Chels, KTBFFH
Feeling really good about this Go blues!❤
I think Tuchel is a good coach
how dare you stand where he stood !
hot seat
4:47 🤫
Tuchel: “Keep the camera on me”
I can not wait for thomas first game with chelsea let go chelsea
If alonso starts today I will go into hibernation until he gets booted out of the club
Welcome boss💪🏻💪🏻
I'm from germany and can say that tuchel is a tactical beast. Every team he trained succeded more than people expected. I feel very sorry for lamps but I'm sure that abramovic did the right decision
Beyond ecstatic
Chelsea payah
😆👏👍💪👀💙
Now I see real tactics of a manager. All the best Chelsea
Look at this strict work. That's real management. Up the chels. We will win today
This year I am with Chelsea as they have young squad and new transfers it will be heroic if they win PL
Timo Werner always scoring in training
Tuchel out
hope tuchel effect ,rudiger's perform is back
Alonso
First time I've seen serious training unlike the shooting practice I used to see
I like his energy
Let's support Tuchel till the very last as man u did with sir Fergie
Asna Hal Sano ka din Wuu baxaa Ar Chelsea🤣🤣🤣
There's nowhere he's gonna take them..its doomed!!🤣🤣👹
As a Barca fan, I wish him a lot of luck
werner finally scored !!!
Man got lampards squad
So hope that Fc Chelsea can knock on glourias Times.
Tuchel starting lineup 4-4-2 Mendy Reece Zouma Rudiger Alonso Kai Mason Jorginho Odoi Abraham Werner
best of luck for him
Finnally a real manager
Marcos Alonso will probably see the light of the day at Chelsea now
Plizz.. Show me attacking game
Yes Alonso is back
Lampard 2021
Get striker coaches and gk coaches and good sport psychologists to build the players back up. The potential is there but they need to be molded. The manager and his tactics can only do so much
Look more serous now
Never heard Frank's voice in the training!
Face wont tell a lie....Tuchel confidence is under minimum rates hahahaha......
jugin.K.O..kepa..ris jamis.musun mun.tammy beram..hotDog kudui..bin ciwil..shall not in in squad....no minutes for them
The 246 dislikes are from lampard and his family
Welcome  and all the Best at the Stamford Bridge Mr. Tuchl.  🙏🍀
ขอให้ดีกว่าเดิมนะครับ
Good tucel...ni baru pelatih..gerak cerewet...mantap
Like I'm a supporter of Lampard, but you can see there's a whole new energy in the training session. I'm excited to see what he does with this chelsea!
Miss you Lamps...... No matter what your role in this club will always remain irreplaceable.
Is that new Tuchel's partner? i hear he brings 3 new staff for support him? RD, ZL, next?
the Blues🔥
💙💙
Welcome to Chelsea Tomas !!! First match must be won !!! Its very important thing for Chelsea supporters !!!
Welcome Tuhcel!
Cara dia kasih intruksi tegas, jelas dan terarah. Good luck the new chelsea tuchel
COYB
램파드 ㅆㅂ 종신했어야되는데
Welcome Thomas tuchel
PSG fan passing by, miss him so much haha
Frankiii was like there mates that’s why all the players was kinda safe but he’s got deferent mind
Viel erfolg Thomas.... Good luck Thomas
3 3 3... tonight's definitely 3 5 2
Finally a boss with Tactics
Alonsos starting ahead of chilly 🤮🤮🤮
I’m a PSG fan and I can’t wait to see him in action in Premier League bc I trully think that he can surprise a lot of people. Wish him a good luck in his new home and good luck to Chelsea !
Rudiger, Marcus alonso, and kovacic look happy
WELCOME TU-CHELSEA 🙌
See the total change we ain’t playing football into the bin we are doing the fundamentals
Sangat membagongkan
I think tuchel is looking to work with the wingers most... Looks like time for odoi and pulisic to shine again
Arsenal
Glad Chilwell went there! The grass ain’t always greener is it? He wouldn’t get in the Leicester team now!
All the best to him and us... Top 4 and probably FA cup our goal now 🙏💙
Go on blues
Welcome Tuchelsea!
Seems really encouraging seeing him take training session
German team Ziyech Abraham and Mount Will will be on the bench for sure...
Go hakim go yess
Finally, a man that looks like he know what he's doing, already gaining the players confidence in him. Lampard on the other hand would do pointless running drills in training and shooting drills for no reason
He looks as though he’s been there for years great to see
Lampard needs to come back
Bonne chance coach vous nous manquez
❤️❤️❤️❤️
If anything goes wrong always blame manger players having nothing to do with it 🙂
I don't know much about him but he looks so motivated and intense, straight to the business. Wish you be Successful at Chelsea Thomas.
Nang hi chuan inkhelh laiin i inkuangkuah mai mai tawhlo turah ngai ang... Min han chakpui char char teh
Looks promising. Good luck Tuchel.
I don’t like that Marcos Alonso is getting so much action in training. Have a feeling Tuchel will like him.
Welcome Coach Thomas Tuchel 💙💙💙💙💙💙
He looks well drilled with the tactics yes its training but to me looks like these players are stepping up.  Welcome TUCHELSEA Thomas. I’m Chelsea till I die I’m Chelsea till I die,I know I am I’m sure I am I’m Chelsea till I die.  Coyb.
Let's go blues from🇧🇪
I assume he brings his own No.2 and background staff with him?
Good-luck. Though sad that Lampard’s leaving, as new manager comes in, i wish them all the best 💙 come on Chelsea
Dont agree with the decision but will still support Tuchel . Lets go blues ❤️
di thumpnails videonya ada pocong nya min
I could watch these raw training videos for hours.
Good luck Chelsea..
marcos alonso is back
Cmon yes Billy.!! 💪🏽💪🏽
pls let play Mason 💙 good luck TT
wait why they training at night?!?!?! i thought training sessions for all clubs are early in the morning
Where is Kante?
From Kenya 254 die hard fan like plzz🙏🙏
Tetap merendah blues💙
So glad he gives instruction what to do...not to english players but to all
I'm loving him already. I can literally feel his energy. He is giving flashes if Pep Guardiola! The players and the fans need to back him and not let him down. Come on you BLUES! 💙
I wish him all the best of luck and I hope he can improve Timo to get back his scoring boots.. Lampard is still Legend and will come back better than before.💙💙💙💙
Finally I see Werner score against good team
Thank fuk Jodi Morris is gone!
Looks good to me.
It's really nice to see him already engaging very very well with the players... i have a feeling something special will come from this decision to make him manager. Got so much respect for him after PSG went on their run in the UCL.
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵
Tuchel likes to use a deep ball playing midfielder hope he gives this chance to Billy Gilmour whom could benefit greatly with the tactical expertise that the new coach has.  Its a new beginning hope our toxic fanbase can keep the toxicity down this time and for once show some support for the whole team for more than 2 weeks.
4:37 seems like Jorginho will share the same position with Gilmour , btw Mount and kovacic also will sub each other in their position.
Pls management give him time.....
As a die hard CFC fan im really excited about our Manager and the energy he has brought already in this team.. good luck guys  I love you💙🥰🔥🔥
Chelsea fans happy with their new toy! just for a little while
I'm a PSG fan but this coach took us to the Champions League final for the first time in our history. He has all my respect and I hope he will succeed at Chelsea. Good luck coach.
Alonso will start
Kepa is back 😂
Jorginho,Rudiger,kepa 🐍
He should make use of Werner
You know already that havertz werner and rudiger will be happy 😊
Instead of tha Managers going out, it should be Mr.Abrahimovic. He doesn't have the patience. Liverpool had the patience to let Klopp build the team and they won CL and PL. See Ole, he's doing a great job now. Patience is the Key!
2ខែក្រោយមក😪
lampard disliked this video on all his relatives phones😂😂
Hopefully tuchel can use havertz and Werner to their full potential
Let's see who is the starting 11 today .. if Werner is not on the wings then maybe he will use him as a sub..
Imagine buying a whole team for someone  else .. yes sir , job done ✅
Hopefully Chelsea will achieve success under new coach.
Semoga Chelsea bisa lebih baik di tangan Sir Thomas Tuchel 🤲
Another trash.
I hope the news regarding those 'snakes' would be a hoax.. And I hope tuchel can bring something this season..
But I miss lampard
Congrats on signing a btech Emery to an 18 month contract, guess you won’t have to pay off this manager a handsome sum to leave like all the others 😂
Tuchelsea💙
Yes know we can champion
U goo u gooo thats the only part i liked ...counter attack we gooooooooo
Good Luck Chelshea Im From Indonesian
Good luck at chealsea biggest club in London (no I’m not a chelsea fan)
cant wait to see what tuchel can bring to our club
Reunion tuchel with ex captain psg thiago silva🤩🤩
So basically he's going to play 4-3-3 with Werner ,Tammy and Ziyech up front. Mount, Jorginho and Kova in the middle and back 4 of Alonso, Silva, Zouma and Reece.
Bonne chance tuchel
Is that how Timo walks😲😲😲!?? Did I just saw that!!!??
Hopefully the German striker can score now
He's so good he made timo score
That man looks good on the Chelsea  shirt.
I like how Tuchel’s more vocal than Lampard
Finally
Welcome to Chelsea
I hope, that now - with Thomas Tuchel, the success starts, for years!!!! All the Best from Germany! A fan of Tuchel.
Mount your  Father isn't there anymore. 😂
Welcome Tuchel
Good training tactics hopefully works out 💪🏼
i hope he plays ZIYECH nr 10
I believe in him, l know he will do good for Chelsea and us the fans.
Werner and Havertz be like : 😍😍
I aware it’s a chess game with Liverpool I’m a blue
Its like he gonna play 343.
We hope winner and winner
Tactics !!
welcome home the blue house💙💯🔥👍🏿
Sitting here waiting for w i d e Tuchel
One thing Chelsea is definitely not gonna be under Tuchel is being predictable. He plays multiple systems in different games and the football is an absolute treat for the eyes. Enjoy the Entertainment Chelsea👍
Good luck
Save lampard
i like him more and mire
I still see a lot of crossing...
SHEVCHENKO : НОООООООООО. 😭😭😭😭😭😭. РИМАН, Я ДО ВІДИ ДО ВАС. ОДИН Я ОТРИМАЮ РОСІЮ В МАТЧІ, ЯК МИ, УКРАЇНЦЕМ, ВСЕ ЗНИЩИМО, А ТАКОЖ ВОДКУ
Why do I have this felling..... Tactics are being revealed.
Respect, he speaks French, English and German fluently
Kinda hard to see MY Chelsea's training without Lamps 💙. Hopefully Tuchel will provide the required push for this team to rediscover their confidence and savageness against ruthless players.
The other teams spying on chelsea be like
تهلا فزيااااااش 😒😒😒😒😒
Goodluck Tuchel Lead this club to glory!!! Coyb!
I wish he can help kai and timo to perform like on the Bundesliga and can show US beautiful football with beautiful results
Where can I get that Chelsea hat like tuchel??is anyone know??
1:04 who is he?
Looks like all players have some chance to get first team. Include alonso
Hakim ziyech❤
COME ON CHELSEA ! 💙💙💙
Let's start with a win today!
Training won’t be as fun no more😢
Welcome to Chelsea sir
Good luck like Roborto Di Matteo, hope magically another champions league comes home💙 Then imagine Tottenham finish fourth and us outside. Lol😆

Semoga sama lucu nya ke lampard wkwkwk
Good luck new man.
Finally Werner scored

Yes, he seems promising. Good luck TT 😉  Salam dari Indonesia 🇮🇩
Hope he does bits for us and I am a bit more confident for the game vs atleti
He will do well.

By looking at Tuchel, one thing is sure he is not here to waste time, he is giving his 200% , come on Chels.

CHELSEA NEVER GIVE UP ❤️
impresiv
Look how different the 2 coaches are in training...  Frank was silent, Tuchel is teaching them like Professor in a class....
Welcome Thomas Tuchel's🔵💙
Ae vn đk kênh Chelsea đi chứ. Có mình tao ấy
Goood
Much much much better than fraud lampard
M,alonso bru keliatan lgi klo lmpard kgak pernah alonso keliat
Some of the Chelsea players are greedy and selfishness...
He must make havertz and Werner to fire to get into champions league football next year
Has he done is 14 day quarantine cause if not it's not safe
Welcome to   Chealsea Fc
บรรยากาศ​ช่างเงียบเหงา​ผิดปกติ
เชลซีสู้ๆ
Timo and Hartevz say now you can see our father is here. You will see our best game and reasons to justify the transfer fee
i wish he would finish atleast a season Chelsea
tuchel will play 343 or 424 but i would bet on 343 . reinstalling alonso , playing two classic wings .
Semoga bisa lebih baik lagi dari sebelumnya.💙💙💙
tuchel seems to be a really fun coach to play for
Watching this is giving me goosebumps
Lets see tonight
Alonso👀❤
oh my
Welcome new manager good luck
Wish you success and good luck Thomas ...
silva seems not impressed
where’s kante?
Thomas lol funny guy
Good luck tuchel from malaysia fans 🇲🇾
I see optimism
good luck
It looks like Kepa will be his no 1
I wish all the best for my team Chelsea 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏💪💪💪🔥🔥🔥
Looks like Kante wont be available did see him.
Welcome Thomas🐱🐱🐱
I don't see Ngolo Kante. Where?
I hope Tuchel can help Chelsea have a Premier Luegue cup
Rudiger and alonso sucks
Now I think we might see Werner as an striker rather than in  LW RW or CAM position
Come on Thomas your job is not easy 💪
Seems like we are going to play Back 3 with Alonso and James wing backs Jorginho and Kova middle Puli Ziyech Werner upfront
bye² super franky
Gue demen pelatih yang energik
I hope a good result in a moment🔥
Happy to see Tuchel and Silva together again
The lads look like they have woken up from a deep sleep.. COYB💙💙  anytime
how did Alonso last longer than Lamps this season. I live in the wrong timeline.
I DONT BELIEVE HE CAN MADE CHELSEA BETTET😂🤣😂😤🖕👊👊👊👊
Goodluck tomas tuchel...💪👍✋👌⚽⚽⚽⚽
We all sad about lampard but now lets put the faith on tuchel to bring out the best of chelsea
Be the best tuchel .
Finally a coach that's more vocal.
Rip tomori, mount, Abraham 😆 banter fc looming
All i think that werner will lose his place
Frank Lampard out Thomas inn
New hope with Thomas, come on blues!!
Good appointment from a spurs fan
Best of luck 🤞
I think he will be good like if you agree
Glad to see the Squad smiling
From managing one plastic club to another. He isnt exactly aiming high
Welcome back Marcos Alonso 🤗
SAVE LAMPARD 😭
Good luck for frank lampard 8☺☺you the best👍👍respect for you as legend and coach🙏🙏🙏
my manager!!!!!!!!!
This is our New Manager, you can see he takes the job serious.Lampard was just a naughty boy.
Give it back to Kai😁
Let's spread positivity for this club and fans 🙌
สู้ๆครับ💙
all the best to tuchel
Welcome to the club - Thomas Tuchel - 🔵✍🏻
This is not the same.
Wishing him all the best at Stamford bridge.
I hope he gives Gilmour the time he deserves. Better than Jorginho and Kova.
Thiago silva end tuchel reunion. 👏👏👍👍
he sounds like Christoph Waltz. the way he speaks. So slowly and clearly and then this german or austrian accent. it is not only about he is from germany.....
Exciting times at Chelsea
As an Atletico fan... I’m scared 😟 now  I hope we win but if Chelsea win  I will agree Tuchel is a beast  Good luck the blues 💙💙
Get Rudiger , Kepa and Alonso out of the club
It will be better if Lampard join Tuchel as an assistant manager.. Lampard need experience..
Lets get behind our manager and hopefully he can get us a top 6 place 💙
fvck chelsea
Good luck tuchel💙
Has the same spark I only see pep and jurgen have.
I must say this is so impressive, we are getting a win today 🙌
Energy like Conte, ball possession like Guardiola, gegenpress like Klopp, and a good tactical mind.... damn. Chelsea have found a good manager
With his experience, Chelsea will go forward...
Wait,Alonso is alive?
I see he's so friendly
Chelsea💙💙💙💙💙fc  laos 🇱🇦🇱🇦
Hopefully Tuchel can boost chelsea players
Hiring and firing of football managers has made me to realise that , good or bad life still goes on like nothing happened.
Hopefully he helps the team get back in a better form...we need to keep winning
Super Frank Lampart super Frank Lampart super Frank Lampart super Frank Lampart 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙 legend
Tuchel looks good in blue. As long as he supports the club, we as fans will support him too.
Latihan mulu menang kagak
Looks like he could do with a full english breakfast. C'mon the blues.
POV: Lampard has disliked this Video lol
he play possesing or counterattack football?
Good luck Her Tuchel
He is a Good Coach but he has bad record being bad person with previous clubs.
Good Luck Tuchel
Mason maunt just lost father:(
This man will make the difference. I’m telling you 💙💙💙
Pulisic knows him well , Silva know him , Werner Kai Germans so is tuchel . Hopefully this can be the turning point 🔥
Tuchel is a details oriented coach and he will instruct players even on with which foot they should receive the ball and with which one they need to pass it. His trainings’ sessions are more exhausting than the games themselves and this will force the players to work hard if they need to secure a place at the starting 11. I hope Hakim will prove himself again to Tuchel and become a fundamental part of his tactics. All the best Blues !
Prediksi coach dustin memang OP
Great couch be the 👍
Very impressed with just the first training session.. U could clearly see from first day he is imparting his ideas on how the passing should go and the runs of the attackers.. Hope it develops fast enough for us to breach the gap at the top. Good luck Tuchel.. Blues4life
Man United fan but loves Tuchel 😊
Welcome to chelsea 💙
Mom ini tngok mcm mana strategi manager bru ini
Goood
Forget Chelsea bad decision. One less to worry about more than one team in prem
Why night training?
Finally practicing tactics....not the pass,cross....inshaAllah 😭
Tough game tonight, considering all that's been going on and Wolves have a lot in their locker, best of luck to Tuchel and the lads. Be patient.
Thiago silva benched even in training😂
welcome tuchel 💙
come on blues!
MARINA OUT
I couldn't find Mason Mount in this Vedio
OK  we will see if he is the best more than Lampard
Tuchel was a beast at 2019 I'm not a chelsea fan I like Tuchel
Come on tuchel give us fans what we want we’re all behind ya pal you have our support 👍🏼 welcome to Chelsea , we’ll see a fast pace game with tuchel playing in the available spaces not just side to side and back like frank , we’ll be more attacking and deadly under tuchel and I expect a big start tonight under him with a convincing win over wolves
I hope Rory is watching this
I can see alonsow making his way back in the team somehow ffs
welcome Tuchel. i feel he will bring trophies back to chelsea
Welcome Thomas tuchel 💙💙💙
Good job Thomas. Chelsea best team
One thing about older managers, is they have more presence, the senior players respect them more and are more willing to run through brick walls for them. Not the same for Lampard or arteta unfortunately
I wish you all the best Tuchel
We have good squad but we need good manager like jose mourinho
😎😎😎😎😎😎😉😎😉😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
Marcos who oh no please dont tell me he is about to start marcos and kepa against wolves
Best of Luck lads for todays match🔵🔵
I see more tactical training in one session with tuchel than in 18 months with Lampard
I hope he gels well with anjoran and uses him
Congrats! This guy is a football scholar
Come on blues🔥
what is Tuchels bakroom staff?
💙💙
In Tuchel we trust💙
Welcome tuchelsea!!!
Mantap tuchel semangat buat kink chelsea

The guy is always too serious
Its guna be so toxic at the bridge when we can go back.
i hope TuCHEL-SEA can give squad more powerful than liverpool
Glad to see Timo can score in training at least
good luck my brother 💙
Better manager style then klopp
The last man who can cheer up angry rantman
Pq não contratou Jorge JESUS? É melhor que Tuchel
Welcome "Tuchel"sea!
Nice first training section within the players and TT. Goodluck TT
I hope chelsea can show who they are.   Chelsea!!💪
Al respect to Lampard but Tuchel feels moore like a maneger. I think this is the turning point för Chelsea
All the best Tuchy
This what was needed they were all comfortable under lampard now they all have to fight for their position
Wheres ngolo kante?
ALONSOOOOOO.....
Thomas and Thiago are back at it again
This guy will turn out to be Chelsea greatest coach and longer lasting.
3:40 Already working with a fast pace team play. Can’t wait
War ciyaalka naga dhes
is it going to be Welcome tu c 'hell' or welcome tu 'chel'sea
finally a coach that can speak :D
My expectation will not by too high for today’s game, he only been with team for 2 days. A draw would be suffice, but can’t wait what he can bring in the future.
Lampard is gone. Wow! This day couldn't come early enough. Mr. no tactics is goneeeeee
Look like he's been a coach for so long in there🙌🔥
they really don't waste time. hitting the ground running. Well, hopefully, will get Chelsea to the top four again. Need that consistent performance.
Do not drop mount he's the most enthusiastic player we have.
Please win all your matches
I can already see Jorginho starting smh. Billy deserves to start
I believe there have been changes for this team after your arrival    Gg gaming coach
Thomas talked more to the players actually coaching them in this one session  than i saw in any of the other chelsea training session videos with Frank.
1000
Embarrassing of a club

I prefer Julian Negailsmann
I can see Alonso will back in his position. A left wing back (not you) Striker.
Let's get our defense tight bro
Bgsd thumbnail nya ada pocongnya
I’m so done with this club.
Nyari koment bahasa Indonesia...  Ada yang sama kah...
Dear tuche... please make good chemic btwn defense... currently v hv enf power n mid& frwd ( frank did).. always with Chelsea 💪💪✋
Hopefully and I wish our new coach success
Already better than Lampard
Wellcome coach&sucses
In Ordnung we trust!
Another day another doug
New interim coach!
I personally think the club had this manager lined up the last two months and were a bit shady getting rid of lamps but we need to get behind this new manager I’m back to team KTBFFH
Kaya nya Chelsea bakal banget bangkit
Good coach
welcome Tuchel but not bench mount and odoi and the others  boys
TUCHELSEA
เกมคืนนี้ฮาแวต แวนเนอร์ กับมาละเบิกฟอร์มเทพเหมือนเดิมที่💙💙💙
I’ve been watching Tuchel for a while now, he’s extremely tactically flexible when it comes to game management I recommend everyone to go rewatch the PSG vs Liverpool game back in 2018 in Paris.  A 4-2-3-1 masterclass against Klopp he had Di Maria and Mbappe to track back (making it almost a 4-4-2) while having Marquinhos and Verratti to help out Bernat and Keher on the flanks whenever Salah and Mane received the ball. Quick transitions with Neymar dropping into midfield to find Di Maria or Mbappe who had space to run into.
I don’t know why but am happy 😃 😃😃
welcome to Chelsea 🔵🔵
I bet he’s going to be a great coach
Can't wait for jorginho to slow games down, mount not to be used, rudiger to start. Mid table it is
Goodluck Coach Tete🔥
TuChelsea is real💙
Good luck tonight 👊
zouma is gonna be playing as a midfielder very soon !! if you know you know
I'm curious what will happen to Mount and the other academy boys now that Lampard is gone.
smell ucl trophy comin to bridge
Win guys win
Full spirit and energy for Tuchel. That the key for success
TuCHELSEA
Welcome coach
i have mix feeling watching these scenes like a weird and also positive seeing tuchel on the pitch working with the squad
Kai and Timo are on fore
Here's hoping he brings the touché effect...
Never seen Lampard doing all of these, or in any training montage
I just hope we as a fan base get behind him for the long haul. All the best Thomas and COYB!
I miss frank but the tactics just weren’t right for so long
All good luck Chelsea from Barcelona fan
Great energy
He looks like someone who know exactly what he’s doing and what he’s talking about🔵🔵💪🏾
Still crossing tactics?
jadikan Frank Lampard salah satu staf Chelsea saja
Alonso is back, he must be so happy. I’m happy for him, all the best Tuchel
let's see new coach in action, wish we can win this match
I hope timo will be better with thomas tuchel in charge
If you are fan and you against this team and manager u really don't love chelsea ..all they need is our support ..even Lampard is still going to watch chelsea matches and support them so 🤷🏾‍♂️
I don't know why,I personally just prefer max allegri
World class coach and Manager... Excited to see him in PL n Chelsea. Cheers to Chelsea fan
tuchel very well known of havertz and werner
Thomas tuchel 👏👏🇩🇪
I have this feeling that Thomas Tuchel will succeed at Chelsea FC. I wish him the best.
Hopefully Tuchel’s a flop
Like Gilmour ⚽💪
All the best Tuchel, he needs our support ❤️ Lampard in our heart always❤️🙏
Looks like Chilwell getting benched and Alonso getting an arc of redemption
Good Luck Tuchel💙
where is nogolo
COYB!
Good Luck Sir
Tuchelites let's gooooo 💙
Good luck chelsea.
Lamps is my all time fav player, and the reason i support Chelsea. His sacking is very bittersweet because we all wanted to see him succeed very badly , but i think he still has needs to learn a lot and improve tactically , which will happen with more experience. Tuchel is a tactical genius and a master at exploiting opposition weaknesses and getting the best out of his players. He is the ideal man to coach Havertz and Werner , the reason Lampard got dismissed
Lets go boys, wolves tonight!
Yess yesss
We wish him a good luck and hope he utilizes Chelsea's squad effectively 🔥
LAMPARD WAS BETTER 😬
Xin chúc mừng huấn luyện viên mới của chelsea hay giành lại vị trí xứng đáng nhé
I have a feeling that chelsea will start with a back five today. Its Zouma, Silva and alonso in the cb positions , ben chilwell on the left and reece james on the right. In midfield, he will go with 4 midfielders , pulisic and hudson-odoi on the wing and kante and mount in the middle and Timo Werner up front.
Feels like finally we might not look like headless chickens
Kepa goalkepper chelsea good
Welcome Tuchel💙🇩🇪
He fit perfect their
Boss 💙🔥
Is that Giofranco Zola??
Love Tuchel and the Blues
Hope Kai And Werner get back to what they were in the Bundesliga
Why😭😭😭 I love Frank lampard
Won't change anything
Come on the blues
Mantap
Hope Lampard is watching.
Marcos Alonso is back
TECHELSEA
4:30 he finally did it! :-)
Good luck TT let’s hope you make a successful start with the boys. (Good luck Super Frank too)
This is good to see. We need to back TUCHEL! Hopefully he will get the potential that we have not seen yet out of Havertz and Werner...
Come on Chelsea 💙💙💙
Never thought I’d see him with the logo. Coyb
Tuchel out
Tetap merendah yah blues 💙
4:05 TOMORI?
finally they reunite again with Thiago Silva
I think Alonso will get started against wolves ...
Prediction chelsea 1-2 wolves This match will be difficult bcs their first game with tuchel tactical.
Welcome tuchel welcome to home
Frank Lampard is Chelsea Legend💙
All the best 💙💙💙
welcome thomas tuchel
Boys all the best for today's match 👍
I have a feeling Marco Alonso is coming back into this squad 🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️
Tuchel’s main focus should be getting werner scoring goals
I am watching this again after watching it on the app. Just too excited!
Tu Happy 💙
Lampard come to create legacy. Tuchel come to make Chelsea become champion 🏆.
pls put ziyech as a 10 ,  don't make the same mistake.
Menurut gua, jorginho bakal dipake ama tuchel, toh yg mau jorginho ke psg waktu itu dia
Welcome to Chelsea. Great to have you. We the fans are all behind you.
Mantep ngabb⚪🔵
Finally, a man qualified for the position.
Like seriously I hope he eradicates that sluggish type of play we've been having of sideways passing from 1-90mins.  I like the energy and he is spot on with the languages .ie. Germany, English and French.
Circus Continus
as an arsenal fan i wish him good luck
I dont want to see blues lose again..
Nice to see kepa and Marcos back in the mix 💪💪💪
Lampard plang plongo doang, ini baru taktik
Did I see Alonso in training ?
he is good manager
A new day!
Good job
Tuchell these are the following players you should never play  1. Kepa 2. Rudiger 3. Alonso  4. Never play Werner on the wing he is a bloody striker
it seems like players didn't want to play for lampard. i hope everything will be good under tuchel, he is a real tactician and knows how to communicate with young lads. only problem is, he sometimes becomes a stubborn person when it comes to communicate with the board. new coach, new period.
One positive thing i have for tuchel is only experience career nothing else
Defo a game to watch tonight now
I respect Lampard alot and I hope he'll return someday but Tuchel looks like what we need right now
Marcos alonse could play again this time
Welcome to Blues
welcome our new coach  keep going my team blues  I'm feeling sad  don't forget lengend lampar😢
tiago silva will be pleased to get bk with tuchel
Welcome TT
Wayhay
We will miss you frankie boy
TT = 😭
Thomas Tuchel said to the players everyone starts from a clean slate , so any player can start vs wolves. They have to fight for their place. 💯
I already witness a more tactical approach. Good for our team always
it's amazing to see how little time for him to take the offer, fly to London, train the team, and (later) face an opponent.. all in less than 48 hours. I guess that's how top level footballing works.
Goodluck tuchel and come on chelsea
Good luck
Good luck at CHEALSEA 💙 BLEUS
good luck 💙
Chelsea indonesia🇲🇨🙂🇲🇨
Amped can't wait to see his first line up.
We will see witch new manager will be available 1 year from now😅
Will Kepa play?
havertz, werner and tuchel were germans and i hopefully these both players will back even better and better
To the Chelsea fans don't judge him based on the Wolves games today give him time.
Chelsea hãy cố lên
So excited!!
as a united fan , i wish him all the best
As a psg fan I would not like PSG to vs Chelsea as Thomas thucel was a great manager for us and I think he would make Chelsea sooo strong as  they've got 4 good signings Thiago silva , ziyech, Werner,havertz
I'm a man utd fan, all I'm saying is that if this guy gets you lot top 4 in the pl, give credit when is due, feel sorry for Frank
Cheeky . I see alonso trying to slide back into he’s position 😂 . Have a good feeling about Thomas tho . He’s tuchel 😎😏
I am here sitting praying for his success and the success of this great club, 🙏Chelsea
Something about Tuchel coaching Timo makes me very excited for the rest of the season. I have a feeling that he'll start scoring a lot.
HE HAS WERNER TROUSERS. NUMBER 11.
Thomas tuChelsea🔵🔵🔵
The back line and the midfield should be confident and creative at the same time. The team should mix it up; short passes, long ones, early ball, snap shots, long range shots... Be unpredictable.
Welcome TuChelSea !  I’m so excited and i have always hope that it works ! 🇩🇪💙💙
I am city fan but wish him all the best
Thomas tuchel is ferry godd
Lets  gooooooooo!!!!!!!!🟦🔵💙🔵🟦🧥🧥🧥🧥🧥🧥🧥
Cmon blues💙
OMG TIMO ACTUALLY SCORED
The reason we aren't successful is because we never give managers time. But goodluck to him I suppose for the 2 years he'll be around
Good luck tomas tuchel
I hope we continue the league well with our new coach and I sincerely wish success to our  coach  Tuchel 🇩🇪. 💙Chelsea 💙
mfking Rudiger
This is fantastic to watch. Frank became too stale.
Welcome Chelsea coach
I think lampard way of coaching is just let the player go train themself like normal training.. no tactical applied.. so now the players have to deal with the real experienced manager.. no more fooling around.. 100% discipline and tactical training..
thiago silva and thomas tuchel reunited 👬
We wish u good luck our new coach!!!!  We hope our Boss won't fire u soon!
Things we cannot see in lampard
Ffs atleast don't show whats he is speaking You r letting out the secrets Cross the ball, Tammy will play the dummy and leave it, and werner will score 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
0:50 outstanding through ball
Mbois latihan ingeb,,, adem e nusuk balung enom😃😬
Welcome to small club 😛
He is very serious, looks like he is a real coach not just a manager 🧐
homas tuchel left because he wanted to be with thiago silva
Good luck 👍 Thomas Tuchel Wish you all the Best The Blues we dey Your Back🔥🔥🔥More Winning
Welcome to Chelsea
TUCHEL OUT
Chelsea 1-3 wolves
Bielsa is studying this video very carefully
welcome tomas kucel.
3:30 Did I hear Marcos 😐
Glad we got Tuchel in before Man City got him tbh, really hope and pray he gets better performances out the team, and that the board don't just make it top 4 make or break.
Thankyou Frank
You can apply frank,as technical mnager and other choice
Did he load a gun at 0.24
Tuchel is the man let us all support him he surely deliver
Welcome *TUCHELsea*
Let see what he should and will do for his first match today
I heard Tuchel prefers Tottenham
We need Werner and havertz at their best I hope he makes them at their best
Cheers up
Good luck TT!
HOPE chelsea is BETTER under tuchel. because if we see on the list of players we have, we are SO GOOD. Full of INternational level players & excellent youth too.
That Kepa’s save sounds like a gun
Not a chelsea fan but boy am I praying this guy can fix werner 🙏🙏
If he starts Emerson or Alonso then tuchel out😡
BOARD OUT
Jemand deutsches hier
I want to see that new line up
4:21 Is what we need 3 man press , or combined press to reduce space for opponents to pass , every team thuchel coached has done this , and it's very effective
We are so rutheless. We only support our club,players and management when they only win. What kind of plastic fans we are?  If we are supporting them in their good days then we should support chelsea at their darkest days too. Believe in the club hating on them on social media aint gonna solve our problem it will make things more worse. It will destroy the confidence of players. Spread love and support our club. Liverpool fans did it for 10-15 years and finally they won their league title last year.
Wolves Analysts maybe watching this training session 😅
COYB 💙💙
its soo good to have such a vocal coach
welcome thomas
I miss Chelsea Vs Arsenal battles , both teams deserves to get back their former glory.
Hopefully he can get us winning games again. Starting today against wolves.
That blue color training gear suits him.
Be gone in 12 months
Keep in mind if Mbappe didn't have a terrible game that night Tuchel would've been a UCL winner
Gives your best tuchel
Good Luck Boss
Can't wait to finally see the front we were given and meant to play While the other twats will be have a seat on the bench, Tammy and Mount.
Good luck tuchel.  Cant wait to watch the game tonight
One thing for sure Frank gonna be comeback stronger  and  I am happy that T.T is more experience than Lampard  We might even have the chance to win the Champions League
He said that "players are lacking movement"
training atmosphere is dead- wtf.. like someone has just died
Why does Chelsea Football Club need to put advertising on their YouTube videos?
I think he Will probably get the best out of jorghino cuz he likes midfielders who sit deep, analyze the game and also that has a good pass e.g Veratti
Yeah finally this is the real coach.. 🎉🔥
Abramovic lacks patience , he should change his policy...and this time Tuchel , back him up for the sake of Chelsea.
Good to see...all I could remember watching these videos when Frank was here and seeing him sitting on the ball and jody walking around head down hands in pocket. You can also see zsolt running with players...and jody is 10 year his junior.
Good luck Tuchel 👋
Pelatih baru go puncak klasemen🏃🏃
Mr Tuchel,you have to produce results at Chelsea.Its not an option
Lets beat up wolves
All people spreading negative comments are not Chelsea fans , they just want us to be destroyed
He supports spurs
i see Alonso featuring on so many frames hahaaa
4-3-1-2
Lets see the german bond between tuchel and werner, rudi and havertz
Welcome TuChelsea, and Good Luck 💙
Lampard was to busy with Mount I guess...Look back to hakim 's face when his free kicks where disturbed by Mount or Reece. Frank didn't protect Hakim and give him more responsibility
I am a Tottenham fan but I am really interested to see this team in action
Well com and good luck thomas
I hope he smack jorginho out of the squad
Bonne chance, M. Tuchel!!!
will timo start today?
i feel bad for lampard watching his developing team at home peak
💙chelseaaaaa
Pulisic semoga kembali ke performa terbaiknya karena dulu dia juga di andalkan Tuchel sewaktu di Dortmund
The first time i've just shrugged off a new manager joining, it doesn't feel the same. There's no excitement, hopefully I can be proved wrong
Seeing this gives me joy, let's support him, chelsea fans are very impatient , we want the best
I wonder how Lampard feels watching this video and seeing how Tuchel is instructing the players. I wish Frank all the best!
COME ON WOLVES!!!!
Welcome TUCHELSEA
lets'go chelsea hallo thomas tuchel💙💙💙💙
Wish Chelsea fc all the best .
48k views In 48 mins that’s 1k views per minute
As an Arsenal fan... I'm genuinely scared of what this manager can do to  improve Werner and Havertz
Good luck
Thanks lampard
Plz do this lineup vs wolves  Mendy James Zouma Silva Chilwell Kova Mount Ziyech Puli Havertz  Werner
Good Luck Tuchel
Tuchel has good players so it's up to him to play
Am totally confirm that chelsea has strong players 💪 and Good players..all I ask Coach..is to give our senior players the time, and the junior also..and to find his first eleven who can compete seriously..we need our first eleven players who can bring higher the chelsea flag above again...cz we miss the real chelsea we used to have..so many years ago..best wishes to u coach.. welcome home 👍👍👍
i wonda da outcome if chelsea face United with Tuchel🤔🤔
💙💙
Prediksi, Chelsea tahun ini gak ada gelar sama sekali, kecuali frank lampard balik lagi yang melatih. Wkwkwkwk
tuchel looking foward on alonso here and yes i haven’t saw him since last season
We love
T.silva looks not happy???
As  a Chelsea fan I'm kinda hoping he does well cause very bad results!
I missed Super Frank ❤️
All the best Thomas
Va a tener otravez a thiago silva como jugador
For those who are new to his tactics-  He likes possession like Guardiola He likes pressing like Klopp Most importantly he plays not a fixed formation rather a fluid one based on the opposition so u can see a CDM playing one match, 2 CMs in some other matches.   The variety that Chelsea has can only be utilised by coaches like him who can utilise every single player in different ways
I can't waut this great coach's chelsea
3:48 cant believe it
Wish you all the best TT💙💜
3P  Today😁🥰
I hear Timo Timo Alonso. We are back to business
Timo hit the net wtf is happening
Its matchday boys hope yall play well
Lampard in training: Well done Mason.........that's it.
hopefully the Team can find its spark...can't wait to see Timo and Kai  kick on from here
what i just saw .. wow hope chelsea's performance will improve
where lampard
Goes from managing Neymar to this hahah
4:56 looks like chillwell but fat
Players must reflect on positive for this change cause lampard was not bad but he paid the failure of signings tuchel must know tha point
Welcome Tuchel
welcome boss
The best club in England Manchester City
Hopefully we finish top 6
Thomas that looks awesome training session with the boys
i wonder who will he pick for starting 11 againts wolves, can't wait, i'm so exited
Paling bagus and very Good di Tulis name Negara atau name Benua atau bisa juga tulis name people so ok Sudah sore jam menunjukan 17: 45 waktunya mendengarkan suara suara from Toa
I hope tuchel can bring Chelsea to the right way,salam dari Malaysia
3 month out. hahaha
Chelsea isn't winning a single trophy this season. Mark my words. 😊
I honestly don't like what I see. If he was so special and good, he would have done great in France. I see dark days ahead.
Everyone felt the same, Lampard was little too composed and soft spoken to the players and less vocal at them during training and games. I have never seen him go mad at players during a match, it may not be necessary to shout, but look at the great coaches Pep, Mourinho, SAF etc, they bark instructions and alert the players of the tactical alterations from the opponent. What all i have seen from frank is close close stay close win the ball and clapping for an ordinary passing move. Have to sometimes go hard on them during games, Game management is an imp aspect of any coach,
Wish him all the best
Best luck coach🔥🔥
He is very good coach ❤️❤️
Great manager, disgusting club.
Chelsea made a big big MISTAKE
what is louis beneventi doing there at the end
Have you ever heard lamps command or speak to the team like that???
Clean slate, fresh start! Fully behind Tuchel and wish him the best of luck! 🔵✌🏻
Amor al azul
dont be surprise alonso will play as left midfield now
Come on Thomas tuchel we will be better with I hope 🤞
Chelsea are going to get relegated
Miss Lampard !  But we move  All the best tuchel!!!!
💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Lampards training videos was just shooting drills😭😭the difference
where is giroud and kante
0:50 did Gilmour try to nutmeg the gaffer ? 😏🤣
I loved Super Franky...Tuchel I see some good acceleration in striking
Come on you Blues 🤜🤛💙
Wow hope chelsea get back to top.
I'm so delighted to see Marcos Alonso training 😁
2020/2021 Season just started
Welcome TuChel..... God bless
Snakes. Threw our Super Frankie. I wish TT the very best against these snakes. Watch your back TT; we have no issues with you, we want you to win. These snakes are a different story.
He’s a great tactical coach and very offensive minded. Wasting no time. Werner to score and Havertz to be at his best tonight. Pulisic to a new level
Haloo coach..we wish you a very welcome to chelsea...home of victory!!! and all I want to you ... please give hope those players.. please make them together and give them. Opportunity to show what they have... especially bring back Ngolo kante on his proper position..
Next: Reece James, Tammy Abraham and Havertz out!
Lets go tuchel sea
*_WELCOME BRO 🖤⚽️🤝🧢_*
Nice to see him with Anjorin.
Tuchel is bad lampard is best for chelsea
If Chelsea lets  Mason go as stop back Chelsea because he's the closest thing we have to Frank at this club like if you're with me 💙💙💙💙💙
How long will he last? 1 year? What's wrong with Chelsea? Changing manager once in a year became a tradition for them.
hopefully the German chemistry with werner and haverts gets them back on form
he will rock it!
We’ll miss you frank ❤️ i hope no one forgets everything you accomplished as a manger with the squad u been given.. thank u for bringing us mount odoi tomori abraham james its all you ❤️😢
Let's go blues!
Welcome 🙏 T. Thuchel......and best of luck
We hope he will bring spark in chelsea
From what you have shown I think he is a strict Manager.
finally actual training, instead of just shooting every training session with no shooting in matches, Come on Tuchel'
I hope Giroud will be a starter, he’s so underrated
At around 4:00 as you can see him coaching a scrimmage, if I’m not mistaken... he screams “TALK” and you hear the boys all communicating on the pitch immediately 😂 TUCHEL OWNS THE DRESSING ROOM ALREADY
Finally a proper manager! I cant wait to see this Chelsea team develop under Tuchel with a proper philosophy and identity and proper structured press and counter press, clinical transitions, dominating in possession and structured defending as a team! i cant wait!!!
I wish him the best and hope he delivers beyond expectation
Good luck coach!!!🙏
I only see same thing:crosses after crosses!!
A manager who repeatedly falls out with his bosses coming to work for Roman and Marina 😂 this is going to end in tears
Looks ready to go
As he is German, i really hope he will let Werner take the pens now.
chelshiy
chelshiy
Well finally timo’s scoring lol
Tuchel is way better than overrated english coach
Thiago Silva finally able to be with Tuchel again
Semangat terus the blues trofi liga Inggris menunggu mu the blues 👏👏👍👍😎😎🎉🎉💪💪
Tuchel I believe you!!! 💙💙💙
EXCITED!!! Good luck, Thom!
💙💙💙💙💙
Feeling all warm and giddy already
wishing him a goodluck in chelsea
Missing Lampard arms crossed and gaze to the abyss pose
Oh I have been dying to see this team perform well. Good luck Tuchel !!
Looks intense
Alonso is so fresh
We need that spark
I really hope this works out. We've been a lost team since Conte's departure.
Sukses dan juara 🏆🏆🏆
Wishing him good luck at Chelsea FC
Good luck Mr Tuchel
Ini baru coach namanya bosssss
I believe
Welcome new boss
This club is going down the pooper
Now its a dream team
WELCOME TUCHELSEA
Mount is sub?😭
Good luck
Very vocal and tactical, good luck Tuchel
Ris jame ris jem mukamu
Hopefully he will make a change in the team.
Let's support TuChelsea...!!!😍🙏
💙💙💙💙
Good Luck Thomas Tuchel!!! Change Chelsea like you did at PSG
Suerte al nuevo dt esperemos pronto se vea su trabajo en la cancha
Good luck bro
he failed at arsenal, then chelsea bring him to replaced lampard? what a stupid choice
Damn the pace of the training
Hopefully he will take the best out of timo and kai. And, mount and james will not suffer under him.
Looks like kepa will play🔥🔥🔥
Best Of Luck Thomas Tuchel for the rest of the season 💙🙏🤞
Hope Werner starts scoring now!!!
Good luck coach
Let’s not forget Chelsea always come up on top when they got a replacement manager / interim mid season. Think of CL, Europa, FA etc. Matteo, Benitez, Hiddink et al
Welcome tuCHELSEA
3:31 I like what I see Already
Welcom to chelsea TUCHEL Good luck 💙💙💙
My opinion: good for Chelsea that he is available! Chelsea & TT = 💪
Kebanyakan iklan taii
hopefully we start the Tuchel with 3 points COYB
I thought he would bring Mbappe.  He should go for Mbappe. Chelsea needs him now that we have his former coach here
good luck 💙💙💙
Come on Chelsea
I'm excited for our new beginning💙
People mentioning that he will bring havertz and werner back since they re german, meanwhile I’m excited to see what would he bring out of thaigo silva since he coached him at psg, even tho I’m not a chelsea fan
You can see already the difference, engagement with the players is there.
This year chelsea go to champion leage  final.
hoping for the day we get a coach/manager that isn't fired after 18 months and we stick to them instead of the players and go thru the rough patches. We'll run out of coaches one way or another. Ancelotti fired for no good reason, Conte good manager but didn't get what he wanted, Lampard didn't get time but clearly we didn't know the serious problems behind the scenes, Mourinho didn't get the chance to fix his problems, our greatest ever manager, I mean we can't keep doing this.
tetap merendah blues ❤
I think Man u, Man city , Spurs and Chelsea will make top 4 this season
Great Thomas Tuchel
Hopefully chelsea can achieve something this year with Thomas
We now know it's the end for lampard's son Mount
Welcome to chelsea fc TT..
Tiago silva coach in psg
Vamos.
Do you guy's see him Talking?? I'm not trying to say anything but uh ... Lamps never talked like this in training.. That's why player's never knew what to do
If Man Utd got to 2nd place after where they have been, we can also Surely get to the top. 19 matches to go. Come on Chelsea 💙🙌
Good luck to our new manager
Man's is very vocal already , which was very much needed . He seems promising.
A gesture of someone who knows what he's doing. Let's win some games with him.
Is it a bad thing that I am hyped for this?
alonso come back🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lampard need times bro 😭🤔 Everything need process nothing instant in this world
While I am sad Frankie is gone, boy am I glad we have a tactician as a replacement
Semoga berhasil di CHELSEA
How many players do we have This looks like an army
I see impostor there🙄
นัดแรกขอ3แต้มนะ
Tuchel seems very vocal. On the other hand, Lampard would be paying much attention to Mount only
Good luck
THE GERMANS WILL BE INSANE
Gassseeedddddd
Hopefully he could win champion league for us  just like Roberto Di Matteo 👍👍👍💚💚💚
Julian nagelsmann chelsea manager 2021/2022
Ah yes germans
Hmmmm
Good Luck💙🐐
Please coach no FAVOURITISM or you will follow Lampard..my piece of advice
Good luck Tuchel . . Good luck Chelsea . .
No more "yes Timo, good Timo" we hear on one of Frank Lampard staff
Good luck
I hope Billy and Anjorin get the recognition they deserve.
Good job👍
wow finally i can see tactics
Good luck Tuchel 💙. Please get the best out of Werner and Havertz.
So excited
Two Touch Tuchel
though i may not be a fan yet watching this i see the dusaplin in his viice that been missing
Timo at least scores in training
Exciting times ahead 💙
Welcome To Chelsea.
At least make it to 3rd please 💙
Good vibe

LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Man is vocal!
มาช้ากว่าเพจที่ไม่ใช่เพจหลักอีก555

A tactical genius at work
Not my first choice manager good luck anyway!!!

Already more vocal.
Night training... that's what we need
Background music would have been nice
Good luck Tuchel
All the best Tuchel
Guys we gotta support whoever comes No hates pls, he didnt do anything bad He just accepted the new CHALLENGE!🔥💪 Welcome Thomas!
Fans ori menangis melihat ini haha, tangan azpi sang kapten pasti akan capek karena ngangkat tsunami tropi
I like him
I'm so excited for today's match cant wait to see Chelsea play against wolves with a new manager
We have an actual coach now with actual tactics not just vibes and sentiment
Can't wait to see his 1st formation against wolves
Looks like instead of franks slow build up to a cross in the box and repeat, we might see it but fast and at different angles.
Bismillah
WELCOME TO THE BLUES!!! Good luck Mr. Tuchel 💙
Come on tuchel💙💙
Welcome TUCHELSEA
Welcome to Chelsea Thomas tuchel

Timo and Kai will definitely profit from him
Good luck Thomas💙

Pulicis and silva beack coach tuchel
New era has begun
Please no Jovacic or Alonso, they are trash, dont bother trying them
Trimakasi lampard 🙏 dan selamat datang tuchel 😊
Good luck Tuchel
His training looks very different from lampards
He coached Mainz 05 and Dortmund just like a certain other coach.
Dear Mr Tuchel... You got all my support, please help our team to greatness
I'm gonna pop some bottles down.
All the best Thomas Tuchel! Come on you Blues 💙
He looks Chelsea. Welcome
"New day" "New coach" "New spirit"
Can’t wait for today’s game!! How it’s gonna go
Timo looks like he actually knows how to pass now
One thing is for sure.............   No one knows the starting XI
Love tuchel spirit. Come on blues. We should better
첼시 화이팅
I want two things from Tuchel.   1: Sell Mount 2: Leave my club
Good to see Tuchel being assertive on day one.   This young team needs guidance and looks like he may after all be the right person for the job.
Wasting no time,good luck boss
All the best Tuchel 💙💙🔵💙💙
I believe he can get us to top 4, strongly depending how the clubs around us play
Well, Good Luck Mr. Tuchel.
I wish him a very successful career. Even more successful than he had at PSG
かっこいい
I'm afraid for ZIYECH
Say Wolverhampton to welcome tuchel
It is impossible to predict. But i sense, he will use two forwards together — tammy and werner. May be we will see 3-5-2.
I hope he has solution to the Team problem. I wish him good luck 👍. Chelsea for life.
Good luck coach
Liquid football🔥🔥🔥
give alonso a chance to play
good luck
👍
Thank you for all these comments, I hope we win the league like I did for PSG!
Tuchel is a mad man. And only mad man can control this chaotic club
Good luck boss 💪
Once 💙 Always 💙 Forever 💙
This may sound controversial to some people but watching this makes me even more excited than watching Lampard's first training session cause unlike him, I already know how capable Tuchel is.
Who else saw this in the chelsea app
Good luck for thomas tuchel,and special thanks for frank lampard (Legend) number 8 in chelsea..
👎👎👎
Welcome TuChelsea!!!
Welcome thomas tuchel 💙
Rudigerout
Wajah pemain Chelsea menunjukkan kebahagiaan setelah ditinggal Lampard
Good luck boss👍
Whoever the coach is, I am still a Chelsea fan from childhood
Because of him, I am going to watch Chelsea too everyweek from now.
Lampard in
does @Chelsea Football Club reply?
Good luck Frank,Thomas
Atleast give him some more time and stop this hire and fire nonsense we need stability to be a top club 🙏
No idea how lampard used to coach, but Tuchel speaking more than lampards all training video combined
As much as I’ll miss Frank. This is time for a fresh start, come on Chelsea. KTBFFH 🙌🏼
Easy to spot the fans who have supported Chelsea since 2003 on here
Hajrá Zsolt! Hajrá Chelsea! COYB
Last time when i was this early mourinho was coaching Chelsea
I hope Calum Hudson Odoi get a chance to prove himself ❤💯
Arsenal will finish above Chelsea 👍
tuchel seems very vocal which we’ve been lacking for the past few months
Where is chillwell
Tuchel-If the ball is on the inside or outside that changes nothing, You go   Werner listen
yok bisa yookkk...💪💪
Exciting times 😍
Great to see team reacting positively, also to hear coach relating to the players and even most players with smile and enjoying session, no disrespect to Frank Lampard but its awhile since seen that at training ground
No doubt Thomas Tuchel will change his thing. Thanks Mr Abramovich & Marina for signing a real coach & sacking Lampard.  Chelsea 3 - 0 Wolves
Have a good luck
Welcome TUCHELSEA💜💜💜
Semoga membawa Chelsea kearah yg lebih baik..
TuChelsea Time
We need results. We deserve to win the title race with the quality that we have. Good luck to him.
Wow🤤
He is a World Class Manager. Chelsea are lucky to have him.
I have never seen Lampard talking to the  players at training like dt
We need kepa
Let’s get it guys 💙
A manager with a vision and a distinct style of play, one that has identity and structure. Bring fourth the Tuchel era.
yes tuchel welcome to chelsea
ເຊວຊີສຸ້ໆ

Now sacking coaches has become a frequent thing for all clubs 😂😂
Mount should be Captain. Hardest working player day in day out

TUCHEL, please get the best out of Werner, havertz, pulisic, ziyech, mount. Thanks. Good luck.
