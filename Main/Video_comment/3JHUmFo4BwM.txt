Great job deji, we love you
Deji documentary XDD
It’s really clear to see how Deji has grown as a person. A few years ago, he would’ve been so stubborn and never would’ve apologized for anything he would’ve said during the beef, now he’s so open and honest and that’s beautiful. We love you Deji. Keep growing and striving for success bro❤❤❤❤
this'll go down as the best youtuber apology of all time
I already know that the whole drama is over and has been over for four years, but I’m just happy to see Deji own up to his mistakes ❤
I’m just happy that you realized what you did and you owned up to it which makes you a better person
i'm sobbing
i feel like some of the people in this comment section need to open there minds more and need to realise that its hard for guys to open up the fact that deji cried proves he was really sorry for the actions he did and everyone is hating on the poor guy for saying he's sorry and admitting to his wrong doings he was speaking from the heart and yall are shitting on him and calling other people brick walls for feeling bad for this man when your the real NPC who talks to a brick wall deji doesn't deserve hate he did what he did and the past is the past we cant go back so we need to accept that fact that it happend you would do the same thing if you were in dejis situation so put some respect on this mans name
also you are and will always be in jj shadow lol
so your admiting you lied and were full of shit like everyone knew. and or you wanted your brothers influence to make you more money
We all lay on the beds we make.
I'm so sorry too, Deji and Merry Christmas, Deji's brother with KSI and Parents. ❤‍🩹❤💝💖😢
Thank you Deji. I just want to let you know that you’re not alone. Yes you have family and close friends but you do have God. He will never leave you not forsake you. If you are searching for joy, happiness or peace you can find that through Jesus. You don’t have to go through your feelings alone. Some of us may not understand due to us not knowing you personally but God knows your heart. The Bible says, “Seek the Kingdom of God above all else, and live righteously, and he will give you everything you need.” ‭‭Matthew‬ ‭6‬:‭33‬ ‭NLT‬‬ Understand that your identity is in Christ. You will find what is missing with God. I am telling you he is real. Take your pain to God and he will replace it with his character. Im praying for you and you will be stronger! Better is yet to come!
Deji just went through the 3 Rs: Regret, Remorse and Resolution. He said he was sorry and rather lost his power he actually gained it back because he showed he wasn’t afraid to be vulnerable P.S. I learned that from P!nk
I'm here in 2025, like 5yrs later and this video is still making me cry 😭😭...so happy their relationship is back.
Greatest apology in history in of YouTube
With how Ksi acted over DanTDM’s tweet made me lose a bit of respect for him, so much so that I’ve actually preferred Deji over him, now I’m finding this video from 4-5 years ago and now I absolutely respect Deji, he really is top 5 black people
I wonder what JJ’s reaction to this was
It was Jake Paul's fault, he is reason why deji did all the beef with Randolph and KSI
Aww Deji you are a real inspiration truly I’ve always watched you and you all are amazing family. ❤
I know this is late but thank you deji coming up to open up like this and show us what the real you is inside you deserve better and you deserve to have good moments with you and your family im so proud of you man being mature and keep up the good work man we are here for you
Yes deji,   OPEN UP!
as a little bro i get it to be under his shadow in away , getiing compared and stuff just know u hav ur own talent
12:36
3 years into this and no memes I found. That’s good
Homie thinks he's in a triple a productionwirb his 3 different camera angles 😂😂
"Comparison is the thief of joy"
This is so cringe
Cant lie this the best movie that I ever watched
this shit made me cry all over again, why did i watch it again, i dont knoww. uhhh deji i love you. am happy that you are in a great place today
Fuck anyone who makes a meme about this fr.
He had turned *24* years old by the time of this video's release
This actually made me emotional lol. I respect you a lot Deji. Your a king.
I don't know why YouTube recommend me this 2 years later but I needed this I struggle opening up because I let people vent and then I just bottle it up I just don't think my struggles are worth saying at times but this video Helped a little
Actually cried
This is not vid for meme this is emotional 😢
I cried a little bit when Deji started crying
After watching this video ,i can final open up and say...I am Batman!!
He has some guts to do that I can't even talk to anyone even tho I don't have anyone to talk to but still
It's okay
When deji started becoming likeable
Bless his little heart ❤️
Whats wrong with this youtubets crying out loud and not man it up in face to face
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 me watching this video🗿🗿🗿🗿
We've all cried on this, its okay.

Big respect for opening up about you and your brothers situation takes a big man to open up about something so personal on camera
Anybody else catch the sad music playing in the background 😅

You need to respect deji for this
Why am I only seeing this now 😭

Alright this made me gain so much more respect for you this honestly made me gain most of the respect I’ve lost for you that’s honestly amazing deji I can’t believe you had the courage to do that.

This made me cry
Respect to youself❤❤
We got u deji love u
🤣🤣
Aww I’ve only just saw this but you can really tell you are sorry. 😢❤️❤️ I’m glad he forgave you☺️
Proverbs 3:5–6   Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not learn on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make straight your paths.
why so many camera angles though
That was ocd probably or I don't know
Deji you are a minimo MOO
Don't worry Deji, I've been in your position. It's ok to cry, I cried to.
Massive respect ✊ my guy!! Proud of you for opening up
Tbh I actually shed a tear... Respect to Dej
Damn this is deep
AAAAHHH DEJI
i should learn to treat my sister the way you both treat each other
Bruh just randomly switching the camera angles the whole video
Why do you have music in the background? To me that makes it feel so fake.
Ah yes… **AD**

Mad respect deji , try to lessen these types of videos , not because it makes you seem soft, but rather because of the people that’d mock you for it
First time i cried in 6 years
Deji has matured so much
They are back together!!
theyre back  together now 😭
Deji really done this for the bag if u think about it ukno 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ngl this made me cry
Op
"Many people are afraid to open up about their feelings"  Well you should've admitted that you didn't feel like fighting Vinnie Deji.
watching this makes it hard not to cry. i couldnt even finished the video around 12 minutes in. i came back after a week to watch again and you explaining how holding everything in explained how i am and i started to cry. im glad you’ve matured as a person and made this video. thank you deji nothing but blessings

You live long enough to see yourself become the villain💔
If you hate don’t watch
Deji them haters are just jealous of you, you are very talented and a good human being💯❤

7.5k dislikes. Smh
Damn 🙏
What happen???
🍆
am i the only one that didnt cry, i laughed instead😂
I remember when this video came out I was going through the worst break up I’ve ever felt. I was very depressed and tired all the time. But when this video came out it made me want to change myself. Since then I’ve been focusing on myself and been hanging out with my friends again. I’ve also been starting to goto the gym recently and hopefully by the end of summer I’ll be built well. Thank you Deji
fuck this breaks me knowing i made the same mistakes as deji, felt the same way as him and finally come to realise how fucked up i was. my sister and my relationship will never be the same  and i know its all my fault.
Hahahaha bozo
After everything you’ve been through the universe still decides to fuck you over for your fight, that sucks
Only YouTuber apology to make me cry😪
I tried watching this vid again without crying
I love deji man
I just have to tear whenever i see this man 😔

Damn bruh I really cried.
Your word cut deeper that a katana

So much respect to deji✊🏽✊🏽✊🏽
Respect for Deji!
People who cried 👉🏽
We love you Deji ❤️
I haven’t cried on a YouTube video or any video for a while, this definitely made me tear up.
Think the crying part was cap 🧢 but that’s my opinion
Imagine Tunde editing this
This is the only good apology video 😂
8:19 man I feel bad for Deji, he’s a great guy. Mans the Opposite of Jake Paul
The Dislikes was the tear drops dropping down
saw this on a reddit post and came to watch. glad this story has a happy ending
SO strong man. You're a BEAST!
8:22 'I'm really sorry daddy'
Lockdown has got us all thinking more,  being more compassionate human beings. Although this pandemic is 99 percent a whole shithole, 1 percent still does give us a chance to think about your life so far.
i always found deji really difficult and immature about this situation and past situations but I think he’s a better man now
This really mad me cry :/
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Fvck nan love you deji
You say this is the first time opening up. If having a mental breakdown on video and posting it isn’t opening up then idk what is
The way hes crying is so real that its heartbreaking man, what a bloke. It takes a real man to stand up for whats right.
I wondering if maybe they do video again toghether
Wow this made me tear up
Deji I am proud of you Deji I am proud of you
Almost made me cry
7:45 my heart
This is the strongest thing I have ever seen anyone do on YouTube
Im glad that he sees his mistakes and try to make it better. But they both made mistakes so it's better for them to move on. Tho the internet never forgets it will always be on his neck forever.
Y am I only seeing this now
I have so much respect for this man
This is all you needed to do Deji, I am re subscribing - We all make mistakes - on to a better future learning from the past <3
I cried myself
This is the deji that i love and want to watch making it in life and achieving true happiness. :)
Man this is the only youtuber to make me cry
Take a shot every time he says sorry

Not trying to be rude
I hope not :(
🙌
Why am I seeing this just now..
Respect Deji it takes a real man to be honest when they mess up and taking responsibility and asking for forgiveness  Props to you man and also showing that it is okay to have emotions and showing that it is okay to cry especially with the stigma surrounding men's mental health
Idk why people are disliking this video, it’s really deep, sad and extremely emotional. We live you deji 😍🥰
this hurt my heart.
okay i’m crying, love you deji
🤟🏼🤟🏼
God is good 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Seek God! Read Kane &  Able
People are still trying to make him look bad by saying he put an ad on an apology video this is not an apology video you melons
Who the Fuck would dislike this
How are you afraid to open up? You are whining all the time about everything.
Build good relations and keep them intact part of it has to do with Trust that's the way of succeeding in life
Waaaaaaaaaaa waaaaaaaaaaaaa 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Dej the Lej
Matthew 3:2........
Repent Jesus Christ is coming soon......
Key to happiness is forgiveness.  ❤
I actually cried through out this whole video, I'm still wiping tears from my eyes 😢😢😢
Thats luv ❤️
Keem star thinks he can turn this video into something disgusting
Damn....I took a break from this YT drama (and kinda YT in general). It's now 2021...nice to come back and see this ))
No matter what happens, no matter what video they release, these two have shaped my childhood and my life and I will forever be thankful, idols
Comedyshortsgamer but you don’t game
🥲
Better apology than Mini Ladd’s.
R u just saying this because the fans have your brothers back so you’re following what the fans want?
Hit that sub❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
why are people still tryna spread hate and make him look bad? the dude already went through alot of hate and he apologized for it multiple times. why not just leave that in the past and be happy that he has changed for the better and he wants to continue to grow as a person.
😂🤣so cute
My respect for deji 📈
I cried like actually
i feel like in this is a presentation
Respect
1:28 oh I guess 2020 ain’t that bad
Omfg is your channel that dead
U should still take every distract down theyre still up
i respect him so much for this video
big up deji for finally admiting
Deji is right, you don't always have to be a man and be strong in life, sometimes you have to express your feelings and emotions, after all were all humans.
Am sobbing back and deji respect you man that nearly made my cry
Deji has really taught most of us a lesson escpially about mentality and wellbeing some of the stuff that he says actually made me start all over again   Thank you Deji
This made me smile and cry
put some respect everyone by liking
This is enough to make a grown man cry and that’s okay 🥲
Shit did he read all these facebook motivational posts? This dude destroyed his own brother’s life This video is a sincere apology But actions speak more than words And you’ve made a living hell out of your brother’s life Let’s hope Deji changed for the better
Respect for deji to make this video personally I'm not a big fan of him but takes alot to do this x
I’d say that’s a happy ending. Enough to make a grown man cry.
ITS TIME TO GO
I cried...fuck...
Fam I cried 😭 went see this video
It's enough to make a grown man cry. But not this one. Edit - when he cries I cried. Definitely this man
mad respect
From personal experience, opening up only gave people ammo to shoot me down, people would love to slow down the healing process of others. Too many people hate seeing others evolve, because they're still hurting from past experiences.  I'd say its better to channel all that energy into a hobby or gym. Legit you gotta occupy yourself man. Eventually, after seeing improvements you'll begin to understand how to prioritise certain things in life, you'd end up realising how far dealing with your emotions will take you, this would help in the long term, where as venting is more of a short term fix. Vent to people if it's absolutely necessary, if not, you might as well choose the long term path. You'd become untouchable. You'd be level headed in tough situations, and you would think twice before making a rash decision. You'd also be able to put your emotions at the back while you take control over whatever hardship you might go through in the future.  I'm proud of Deji man fr
This made me cry so much
fuck you
Or snake
i actually teared up, damn
Poor guy fam
interesting
Ngl this video touched a niggas heart💔 been watching this nigga since my child hood Nd now I’m a grown ass man listening to this shit made a nigga feel like I was already venting to the video even tho while feeling like you have no one to vent to💔 any mf going through this could understand this type of pain Nd can make any grown nigga cry💯 preciate the positive video it does a lot💯❤️

I don't even know if I should believe him anymore. He made so many crappy crying fake videos and carried on being a little shit after. Let's see.

But inside I’m crying , big up that man,,  I wish I had a family or even a good friend I’m alone in this shit world and it’s getting harder week by week my mental and physical health is deteriorating in a big way I’m crumbling from the person I was once was, don’t think I’ve got long left on this planet but I bet u can count on one hand no thumbs allowed, how sad have I become , 5years ago I thought I had achieved all my goals then started to think I was the dogs bollocks ,then one by one they all left,mrs cheated ,lost a house that I had paid half off of but couldn’t claim anything co we borrowed from her dad not a bank and I never thought she would have done this to me, then car went, started the drugs 🌡 now my 13yr old isn’t bothered about seeing me, I’ve got literally fuck all to live for now I’m being diagnosed with epilepsy after nearly dyeing with double pneumonia and sepsis.emphasema, bronchitis and the list goes on , not much fight left in me , and am not joking when I say no one will give 2fucks but who can blame em what goes around comes back around, karma is a bitch, but one day at a time is all I can take if a wake up tomorrow it’s a blessing 🙏
Even though I don’t always enjoy his content. But this video is actually so touching. Big up deji
Thank you Deji for this
I have mad respect for him to come out like this it's not easy for many people
I saw the word deji on an ad and I had to click on it
Anyone got this video again or first time as an ad?
POV: you’re here from a YouTube ad
Why is this an ad
Advert?
This isn’t a therapy session man up. Lockstep program rockafella 2010. This moaning is like a woman going through a fucking break up
Nice man thanks
congrats deji on making this a youtube ad
📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈
One word: Respect 👍♥️
Who saw this from a add
respect
Anyone waiting for the feminists to come in and say “man up “ or “be a man” or “men don’t have feeling”.  If you are like this comment
Why is this an ad?
Is that a ps5 right next to him?
He said he is transparent but i can see him (just a joke calm down)
Can you imagine being scared of COVID what a loser
RESPECT
Down bad
Who else got this as an ad
Is deji sorry though
You know he’s serious when there is no ads😔
Did anyone else see the ad
This would be a good a video idea if you weren't so fake
Well done deji
Asma lol
so proud of you come a long way
❤️❤️
King
Why is this an add 😂
Wow
So much respect for Deji❤️
I swear im crying
I never seen someone feel so bad that they break down. Deji is a good guy.
Deji "I'm so sorry" Olatunji
I have grown up watching you guys,Respect Dej.
It’s sad to think that he probably made this video for view traction considering his channel is on the ropes :/
This was an amazing ad deji 🤔
Not gonna lie. I never really liked this guy. But after seeing this I respect him
Honestly I was going through a really bad time before this video. My metal health was really really bad, like I was having thoughts about ending it all. I was constantly upset for no reason and I found it really difficult to have friends cause I thought they were all against me. But this video inspired me to open up to my family and friends and it has really helped. I've turned my life around. I have a girlfriend lots of friends that love me and I'm am happier than I have been for years. I wanna so thank you soo much deji. U have really helped and have saved me from myself, and death. I love u and I hope u continue to make people's life's worth living
This is a great message, im proud of you family ❤️💐💐👍
First dejii’s video that break my heart
Crap. Didn't expect this
Respect
Respect for deji this hurts me man
RESPECT
It’s cool if you cried u shouldn’t feel bad because if this was me I’d be crying as well but I don’t give a fuck what anyone thinks about it
Damn ur heart is big
You need to vent
We love you Deji everyone makes mistakes snd even tho your one was quite big its never too late to fix everything
Cry deji it makes you a man it makes you an honest, humble man. You’ve helped me a lot and I’m sure you’ve helped millions more. Thanks for being with us through these years
This is enlightenment, he understands his place and Its beautiful that Deji has found that and is okay with what he has. It’s strength. He has achieved something that most people struggle to. Props to Deji. The respect is high for you.
4:55 nearly made me cry
even though im late for this,in a past few months i have been so deppresed and i dont know who to talk to until my online friend from the philipines,i was crying trying to explain whats wrong with me.and we play some online games together and i felt better,Deji,you made a lot of mistakes but we still appreciate who you are and appreciate your content.
Deji you’ve made me realize that opening up to someone if your having a tough time is really important to do I did it today since I have been in a tough place in the past year or so and I feel a lot better so pls if someone here is is having a tough time just go talk to someone it will help you. Lol didn’t realize I had quite a bit more likes than I thought I would have thanks 🙏 I’m doing a bit better now.
Your my hero, Deji.
There's nothing more important then family. I know my family will always be there. We all have regrets... Positive people are the best to be around. Fuck the haters... Being true to who you are and know that there are people who will respect and stand by you! Big love and respect ❤️🙌🏽 I know it must of been hard to do this.
this was probably the most tear jerking video ive seen, mind you i hardly tear up or cry to ANYTHING like a sad movie, show or song but man this video really makes you feel the pain that has been growing inside em.  props to you man, i dont even have the guts to do what you did
moments determine when you should open up and when you should keep things for yourself
Deji you have been through a lot don’t let these ugly fucks change your mindset your a real g not many people can do what you do your a legend in the making you will only develop and learn from your past mistake you have teach me a lot 🙏🏾
Would you like some tee? 1:15
I had to go get tissues half way thought this video
I'm not crying you are
i wunna fucking give him a hug big ups dej ur a good man for doing this
nice dislikes
One of the beste Videos ive ever seen
Dont worry about the disslikers. Theyre my neighbours.. fuck'em ✌
i thought this was an unpacking video...
I rarely like videos. But this got me deep. I am really proud of you Deji
Big ups 🙌🏽🙌🏽

Respect for you deji
I am born in November 19 2,007
I love this guy
This made me cry
Ive never cried so much.
No deji. Don't say stuff like i lost myself. U stood up for yourself and although you did it in the wrong way but it was the right thing to do for you. You could've handled it better i agree but dont be sorry for standing up for yourself.
This made me cry so bad
Why am I crying?
14:08 sooo much masculinity in that “tank junya”
You’re such an inspiration. Love you man ❤️
Respect             Note: The time I'm watching, this video has 6.9K dislikes, I would say nice, but that's just disrespectful...
Omg im crying </3
that shit hit deep
Or at least remake it with new lyrics.  Also, you're the best Deji
BIG BIG RESPECT
Imagine having the guts to dislike this video when he’s letting us know how he feels 🤬
Who could dislike this
Deji: being emotional  Memes: ✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️ ✈️
Deji we are there for u we'll keep supporting u❤️❤️
Really I cried first time in deji's vids never wondered how heartful person deji is ❤️❤️
This apology was HUGE man just wow
I’ve been subscribed to you for years on multiple accounts
I respect this
This hit me deep and deji is such an inspiration, he is just speaking facts after facts ,it's like he knows all of our struggles and he is giving advice to solve all of them
who else skipped past the crying prt
Even i cried a little
This is how many times deji said sorry  👇
Big respect 👏
Raaah😥😥😥
Pure respect❤️
dude this shit gonna make me cry wtf
Delhi the king 🤫
0:00 - 0:03 I thought he was flexing his PS5
I know i shouldn’t but.... MANS GOT THE PS5 IN THE BACKGROUND YKNOW
Im late to this but   Deji really made me open up to my parents and family because i’ve been keeping my anger in and just watching this for the 10th time really made me think, i shiuld open up and i did. I was stressed because im stuck in the house and i felt like i eas trapped but at the same time i felt not me and i felt down and I opened up to my parents and they listened so now they’re going easy on me because im stuck in the house
I can't open up cause I don't really have someone to open up to.
i‘m late to this video but big up deji respect it takes a lot of personality and courage to do this
Hey god bless you, Deji. I respect you man✊🏼 your a good guy and your real funny as well. I hate to see you like this🥺 your always happy and that’s what I like about you. You make me happy when I feel down and when you cry I feel like crying with you you know what I mean. When you feel like this call someone immediately okay I love you Deji your a really good guy. God bless you take care✊🏼💙
Props deji your a good man
Why are you doing the side camera it’s not a real show
This is the first youtuber to make me cry
This is a sponsored video.... he's getting paid for the amount of views he gains from this video thats why he made this specific video lol
I feel bad for both brothers
This made me cry
Love you Deji
Nah mate he may have forgiven but I'm sure others havent. Respect for the apology but nah mate one Chance and you blew it just my opinion
Respect to Deji
Yo this video broke my 💔 heart no cap I never seen this side of dej in my life Props dis manz Deji thank u for the inspiration u gave me for all these years man 💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭👌
learn to take a joke man great video tho
At least he acknowledged everything in the end. We all eventually need to do that
Respect
Respect
😞😞😞😞😞😞😭😭😭😭😭
❤️❤️❤️
My Guy
In case you didn’t hear he’s really sorry
I can’t help but laugh at how pathetic this is
I’ve opened up about something and when I did it really did help at first. At first I was scared to open up but eventually I did. It felt like my life was at a dead end and there was no way out of this. But when I opened up they finally understood what I was going though and I had help. Now that’s just a thing in the past I can put behind me easily without worries now that I’ve opened up. The feeling before I opened up was a terrible feel. I never want to feel like that again. It felt like it was the end and that I couldn’t do anything to get through and continue life. Then after opening up they understood and I got major help. They’re still human. They shouldn’t do the worst of the worst. Opening up was good for me and them.
How many apologys did this guy make
I almost cried, stay true to yourself man your videos are amazing 👏.
😀😀😀😀❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Respect I know it is hard but you can go frue vis
8:50 nice laugh
Bless
You made me cry man
We’ve went from 2 guys in a room screaming at each other to this. Mad respect ✊
💪☺️
Why’s this guy always fucking crying lol
Deji are you sorry
Just cause if this apology just go box jake again and beat the living shit out of him
Why tf are ppl disliking this vid
A man said if you be yourself then that’s cool, shows where coolness got him. crying in front of a cam to make money... AGAIN
I haven't seen deji without his glasses in years
Did anyone see the ad on the top of the vid
Deji apology: Quality  Mini ladd apology: Shit
This made me cry man
This made me cry, honestly can see the regret in Deji’s eye. Bless you all, you have such a great family.
❤️
Deji you earned my respect.🙏🙏
Mad respect Deji
Damn this didn't felt like 15 min, very good vid man!
9.05 i was balling
Made me cry. much love deji ❤️👊🏼
Respect to you for at least owning your shit
Respect to deji

Next Christmas we are gonna see "Christmas With The Olatunjis (Including Dunjahh)" that would be great
I shed tears to this...glad you were able to open up. 🥺
Yes mate have a lot xmas
8:16 😂😂😂😂😂
respect man ✊💪🏻
I’m jealous that you’re British, only because you aren’t American.
Man this makes me cry respect to deji I honestly hope they can get along now
opening up really does just reduce the severity of problems. its worth doing at least occasionally. It's very good for mental health
Why am I crying?????????????
You know keemstar says he's not sorry and he's only making this video for the bag I would say yes did he make money off of this video from the ads and the sponsor absolutely but that doesn't mean he doesn't mean it at first I was pretty neutral on the matter then I decided to watch the video myself and now I feel like deji truly means what he says of course none of us are inside of his head but based off what I can see I think he's being genuine
Deji 1st time speaking fully truth.
Wait we’ve been here before?? Yeah we been here before lmfao Next vid he’ll be attacking him. Rinse & repeat. Shit was soooooooooo fucking CRINGE
Respect
Why did this video feel like it was kind of fake
Deji had no social impact before COVID because he has no friends 😂😂😂😂
Why no one talks about this video 🤣
Why are people dislike this like what
This video has  made me realize / want to go and resolve my own long-standing conflict / misunderstanding with my own  auntie. Deji, I wish I was your sibling, Olutunji family has such strong  sons.  Ok, I'm off to watch the video of your mum and dad rapping. I've got mad respect for you ajll, maann   By the way Deji, Deji I think you should go into this business, helping  people who are in that situation to feel better. Something tells me you would change many lives doing it  Love ... Trice.🌹
Ad
DEJI YOUR DA GOAT HAVE AN AMAZING DAY 😃😃🙂
Respect and love only
YOOOOO I'M CRYING
That’s hit hard, got into my heart and realise what I did in the past it’s not good. I don’t really open up to my friends and family, mostly I keep it to myself and saying to myself no one understands me, when someone ask me if I am ok, I just lied to them or act I’m ok. People sees me a happy, cheerful, helpful and funny guy. There’s one thing truly I don’t like about myself is I got A.S.D which is Autism, its got to me like I am the only who got it. But I’m a used to it now. (Sorry for the bad Grammar, hope this make sense)
damn I really cried
Damn this hit me hard
The editing was 👌
Bruh this Lowkie made me have tears in my eyes
great video
Never cries 😂 na but for real respect mate👊🏾
Eating this spaghetti while watching this, man, does it hit different. This is some sad spaghetti.
I swear normally I’m nice but... Deji is manipulating his fans. This is probably one of the good Deji videos, except for the fact that there is an ad smh
mad respect for deji
RESPECT Deji
Yes deji, massive respect to u and your family for this video , my man
Deji we all love you you are the main reason i’m not depressed anymore I’m because of you no very happy because of you i didnt commit sucicide

Wow, AD

No need to be hard on yourself, i think the same way too, wish i can open up to my feelings.

❤❤❤❤❤❤
Respect for Deji ✊
Respect man you are awesome you are helping me face my own sins and things thankyou
U can make a vid with him :)
Respect for beeing honest and open up
Anybody making fun of deji for making this video is just very sad man cause deji means it with his heart making this into a meme has no heart man it’s sad how even youtubers them selves can get hurt by others depending on who they are and how famous they are.
Big Up Deji 👏💯💯
Mannn, I felt this one - respect for putting this out🙌🏾
all respect for you ❤️❤️❤️
good video deji
I think this video was after he listened to millions
Deji it is ok. We been through alot in life and we make mistakes. I made alot of mistakes past few months. I find it hard to forgive myself and leave past it. You owned up and apologised👍🏼
Imagine doing a brand deal in an Apology video. Pathetic.
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Respect Deji for doing this video
Deji has matured a lot. That alone is praiseworthy. I dont see apologies like this often, and this one hit me.
Pussio crying
Respect for Deji!
It takes big balls to step up and do this mad respect for Deji
Why did I cry through this 😢
I feel so bad for him
Thank you for addressing this situations in a mature way, proud of you Deji.

Respect legend!
Cant believe this scum bag did a brand deal in his apology video I used to fucking love this channel now it sucks
Nice ps5 deji
The like to dislike ratio says it all
Respect just went like 📈
Deji thank you for this 🙏
Not watched one of your videos for quite some time because quite honestly you got on my tits with your childlike behaviour.  Great step in the right direction this video and I hope you give me a reason to resubscribe.. End of the day your a talented guy so own it.  Chins up for 2021 👍
Big ups for you man now just think of the times you wil have whit him i got your back man i know this feeling
Lowkey thought u was gonna come out as Bi or something 😂
Anyone else crying?... just me?
Wtf is wrong with people in these comments on some psycho level shit
we all love u deji
Him getting paid for this rubs me the wrong way but its for a good cause and he seems genuine like actually genuine not like the rest of his quote on quote apologies and i heard people saying this is an apology video but at its core its an infomercial about how opening up can help and i personally respect it even if he is getting paid i dont think he did it just for money he saw this as a good opportunity to help people and get stuff of his chest and open up and at the same time make some money basically killing 3 birds with one stone its more smart than militias or harmful people need to be less cynical and try to see the good side
funny still hahahh
DEJI MADE A MEEM OF HIMSELF
Nerd
*head pattu*
Why don't you just tell him these things in private? That's what I don't get...
You are the 🐐
This is enough to make a grown man cry 🥺
I'm sorry 😂😂😂
Holy shit               I got the 1million view
Honestly I dont care if he monetized this video or has a sponsor on it hes done something he needed to do for a long time...
Fuck keemstar and keep your head up deji!!!!
Sorry
"You need to vent"  Wait am I an imposter
I have watched this 3 times
Respect man! Respect!
Love from Pakistan Deji
Why did I cry so much
Why is there an ad?
Hey guys, just so you know, Viddal did the exact same this in his latest video, and I haven’t heard anything from Keemstar, (no hate to Viddal) Keem, leave Deji alone. He’s been through enough in his life from all this hate and stress. 🥺🙏❤️
Anything for views I guess.
وايه عليج انتي
wait... he deleted the crying Deji video. Noooooooo please someone tell me if they download it so we can use it as a meme.
Imma give u COVID
12:35 that's sus 😂 Ok sorry ill be quiet now😐
Wow, Deji, this makes me see you in a very different light. Mele Kalikimaka! 🎄🎁  Lotsa love and aloha from Hawai’i! 😁🤙🏽❤️🌈☀️ (just symbols of Hawai’i)
g
Love u man 💙💙🤙🏼🤙🏼
Deji, just wanted to say, u made me, a 42yr old man cry, proud of you!
Yea cry for your sponsor
Forget 2020, have the most amazing Christmas you can possibly have 🎄
very inspiring wow. I really wanna let you know that this makes me truly inspiring. there will always be haters on everyone literally everyone. there will ALWAYS be people that want to take you down just because they aren't happy themselves. even myself. I don't wanna talk about me or anyone else. I just want to let everyone know that being yourself makes you shine as a person. I have been in a dark place myself. thanks for sharing this!
it takes a strong man to out his feelings like this on the internet wow! thanks for being there for your family
i don't know if you are gonna read this but I know for a fact that this video has a huge impact on other people I am happy for you you finally realized this. everyone makes mistakes. sometimes we don't realize what we are doing wrong. until we wake up. I am very happy you made this video. even tho I don't watch your video. I can't describe how I feel now all I can say is that this is very VERY inspiring. thanks this helps me very much!!!!
Guys don’t be dickheads by saying “Oh HeS PaId To SaY ThIs ItS aN aDd” the add is promoting the mental health bit, it’s obviously true emotion/ tears. He’s owning up to his mistakes and honestly, sincerely correcting them. Frick people piss me off 🤦‍♂️
Deji matured and I’m so proud
nah
Fuck I couldn’t stop crying
Respect! This video made my eyes teary.
I literally cried wiyh him when i watched this vid. Deji is a good man, the way he considered his mistake made me sad man. Making a vid like this takes a great man courage to do same...man deji i now kinda support you
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ we love you deji
So this is for a sponsorship... damn wtf.
Sad😭
Respect deji. Its ok to cry man
This made me tear up 😭
That's a real man speaking from heart put some respect on him
I’m going to hell for laughing 😂
Merry Christmas
WHAT A SELFISH PRICK THO HAHA
c r i n g e warning
Respect 👋👋👋not alot of famous people could do this well done
big up deji, 💕
Respect ❤️❤️
It’s ok Deji that sponsorship money will make you happy. Really good acting BTW  must of used pewdiepie technique what eye drops did you use? To fake cry like that
I tried to open up one time and my family just laughed at me
Deji congrat Big Respect this video touched my ❤ keep going
I love deji
respect 👌
I hope you guys will reunite
Just beautiful. 😭😭
sooner or later, things will get better for each one of you. have faith in that. thank you deji for opening up, it surely is an eye-opening thing that we should start doing.
Awe this is so touching.  Maybe this ad was what he needed to fully open up about his feelings. Let’s please respect this video instead of bully him (again) for opening up
How deji saved christmas
Ayo this video hit different... This video truly just shows how much of a changed and good person Deji is.    Yet hateful people blind themselves and dislike the video...
Mad respect for Deji mannn he had a great year ❤️🙏🏽💯
Brandd deall ????
Have a nice Christmas deji
I’m glad the brothers are back together
Clown
This must’ve taken a ton of courage. I’m proud of you man. I’m regretting a lot of shit from my past and this video came at a great time- much love and respect Deji 🙏
Respect, his Sentences and Words hit different..
Man this hit hard
Deji don't be stupid in the year of 536 it was the worst
Respect
Big respect king 💙
Am I the only one who thinks he should have apologized to the neighbors
This is cringe.
I just hope you are really serious about this and not just for a video
What’s the point of this? Views?
Luvvvvvv man 😭🙏🏾
One thing I rate about deji ngl is that he's always himself.💯💯
What we can learn from this is that when we overreact about something things can spiral out of control and family will be affected by it
Respec for this video
I think that he is sorry
Let's just see no drama happen next year
❤
Man how are people applauding this , he literally used an apology video as a platform to promote a sponsor .... wet brains , everyone that liked this vid
so much respect for you Deji and i wish you all the best. i am so proud of you for speaking up and opening up. especially as a man. i hate the way society has made it such a bad thing for a man to talk about his feelings. BIG LOVE MAN!!! take care and all the best
I rate deji now
Why are you advertising this video with sponsor etc? If James Charles or Logan Paul did this with their apology video then they would get slaughtered!
Legend❤️
Man’s crying for clout
I thought he was coming out
:(
How tf are people gonna dislike the video when he's opening up about his mistakes and apologizing, like wtf?
I woulda had to been on drugs to do dis shit on camera
Naww
Happy new year champ❤️🌟 God bless you man🌟☺️🤲🏼 - always Good to be honest❤️😇 dont let things get to you man it’s not Worth it❤️🤲🏼

THAT'S HUGE FROM YOU DEJI WHAT A KING 👑 ❤️

I respect Deji for this video. It is already hard to apoligize bit it is harder to actually see your mistakes and change.
4 ads
tbh, haters gonna hate; big ups deji
Deji won my respect
We did it. It's over.
This is a true apology . Not some pokimane shyt
This is not STAGED like Deji doesnt cry on camera  Like I've rarely ever seen him so I fell as if it's not staged
This video really made me think and gave me a diffrent perspective on life 🙏🏼💔

This made me tear up too
8:32 this shit made me cry
To all the lads out there who are reading this comment: You are not any less "manly" for talking to someone or admitting you have issues or flaws, or if you cry or show any emotion or anything like that, by keeping everything in you're only making it worse for yourself. As a man who's really struggled with mental health there's no problem, be it big or small, that won't get better for talking to someone about. I've really, really struggled with telling people stuff in the past and I continue to struggle but you will feel all the better for it. It doesn't have to be friends or family if you don't want but there is always someone you can talk to, there are so many things online that can help that are just one button away. Keep your head up king 👑, you'll get... no... WE'LL get through it <3
Big up deji
The fact I cried with him🥺🥺
Respect deji
I am happy that he has matured man
Mann Deji goes through so much
Respect Deji ❤️
Big respect Deji, hope you have a wonderful Christmas ❤️
Everybody: 2020 was the worst year ever  2021: Best year ever!
Who tf is disliking this
He’s defo sorry 😅

Big up Dej. Stay strong, he'll come around. ❤
RESPECC
Man stfu
That ad tho
I would love deji and callux to collab on this topic.
Why is there so many fuckin dislikes
2:07 deji had asthma and still fought jake paul
Mad respect for deji but him crying is going to be made a meme
a fucking ad on an apology video?
Deji has found his soul and it’s beautiful, this vid makes me happy to see some humanity in this crazy year
so emotional smh
i opened up and now my dad left what u i do
Fuck im in tears man
My respect for this man has just gone through the roof. Have a good Christmas Deji
His apology felt really genuine and I felt every second of it. You’ve grown my guy!!! A lot!!!
Well done deji we love you so much
RESPECT WOW! Takes a big man to reflect on his mistakes and start a new chapter. Not many people can do that. You’ve done a really brave thing and you should be proud and keep doing what you’re doing!
Bad look man. Gotta stop crying and putting sad music on
He says this but he's still getting paid for it. It's not very convincing
almost cried
One word describes this video: inspirational
Respect ✊ my man ❤️❤️
I thought he was faking this just by watching keemstars video, but fr this guy did the AD for the better cause
Dis nigga cryin and shit 😭😭😭
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hahahahhahaha hahahahhaha
❤️❤️❤️ have a good Christmas with your family!
wow! that was amazing deji
Wow respect
My respect for Deji 📈📈📈📈
Highly respect him for this man! 👊🏾
I’m proud
Now you cant meet up on Christmas for a different reason
Man, what's with the sad music during your crying scene? It makes it seem so god damn disingenuous, like you're milking it a little bit for sympathy. You wouldn't try to overcompensate this much by adding the music unless you knew full well that you were putting up a bit of a show for the camera and that the scene wasn't entirely genuine. I really didn't want to be the one to ruin everyone's mood with this comment but this shit is true and it needs to be said - this isn't a god damned soap opera. Stop ruining your videos with these cheap appeals to emotion. I do believe those tears were real and I do believe that you feel sorry, but the way you used those clips and manipulated them for the sake of making it more 'emotional' makes me question just how genuine this entire video was, and this is true regardless of who you are or what you're doing. If those emotions meant as much to you as you said they did you would not have done this. You're constantly shooting yourself in the foot, you don't seem to realize that all this fame and those cameras are turning you into a worse person because no one can tell what's real and what isn't. Regardless of your intent, however, the video is nice and if anything I do believe it brings good out of a lot of people who watch it as well as the fact that it has a nice message, so I am not criticizing the video itself, but rather the fact that you continue to taint your own content with these crystal clear attempts to make people feel sorry for you. For the life of me I do not understand for a second why you would do this to yourself, why you would contantly sell yourself out just to try and make a few dumb kids who say mean things to you feel sorry for you.
One emoji for you fam ❤
Big big respect man I'm hoping they make a video together
Some 1 put dis on his reddit

Imagine being so ignorant that you think this is genuine
Jessica  Kanneh
Keen star made it seem like he used the ad in a bad way like he was saying he’s getting all this money but it’s for an awareness and keem Star didn’t mention that
I thought he was going to come out as gay
LETSGOOO DEJIII
How many god damn appologie videos is his dumbass gonna make
You probably won’t see this but Well done DEJI! Your such a inspiration and will never forget the day we met at Yiannimize! Thanks for being a person I can go for joy thanks for being there!
I felt bad for Deji in this video😪
So much respect gained for Demi after this video. Fan for life🙏🏻❤️
I just gained a lot of respect for Deji...great work man
All these videos he has made, and all the lying and bs, that part about "you felt like you couldnt even talk to your own parents" felt so genuine. Respect to deji, I dont know if something monetarily prompted this, or he just felt like making the video, but either way, it was truly a great. Hope the videos stay down and they get back to being and acting like family.
😞😖🖤
Mad respect
Trust Deji most 🌬💙 *BYE BYE KEEMSTAR* 👋
Finna sub bot some dislikes on this video
Damn...I almost cried...I want to but I can’t
Keemstar fans can see there way out the comment section im suprised keemstar has the audacity to sit there and attack this man for no reason
Proud
Why are people so made for a mental health charity like he only said his sponser once not even plugging it that much

‘I should be someone u can come to’ deji 2020 🦧
He changed the title
Respect deji✌️
Wuss
you probably won't read this but if you do i just want to say this. I came across your channel in 2013, for me this was a very challenging time as I was bullied in school, i had no friends, I hated myself and i think I was overall depressed...I considered taking my life when i was 15/16 but when i came across one of your videos from back then, you changed my life. I saw how great life is and how great it can be. Even though we were in different countries i felt like we were friends across the screen; to be honest this was enough for me back then. I just want to say thank you because I wouldn't be here today commenting this if it wasn't for you. You saved my life, Thank you Deji :)  Edit: thank you all for the support. Not sure if he will ever read this but I'm glad he's a friend
8:04 that pic killed me 😓
we love you deji
<3
damn
Get it all out man.
Nice christmas decor deji. Keep up the good shit.
RESPECT to Deji for this!!! It takes a real man to admit that he was wrong. Walk into 2021 with a clean slate!!

Smh
We need to see Deji rise again.
Fact: depression and loneliness (wich contributes to depression, obviously) can cause psychosis and possibly schizophrenia. Loneliness is horrible and if it last long enough with barley or no human interaction can actually drive you insane and develop schizophrenic symptoms
What A GRET GUY DEJI!!!
Merry Christmas Deji
This should have more dislikes. You're an absolute clown...
Cry baby
Everyone has a terrible past
Man the emotion was so raw actually started to tear up myself abit this hit different   Big Up Deji
HOW IS ASTHMA AFFECTED BY A LOCKDOWN AND STAYING AT HOME LOOOOOL
this is sooo funny he did an advertisement before an apology video LOOOOOOL
This video feels like a whole sponsor video
I see he has the ps5 0:19 lol.
Soo much love and respect for this video❤️❤️
so insincere..
Hard Watch. Big Respect!
Lol
Wow cheers fur the video Callux🙏 Wait it's just deji stealing vids again
Put an ad in an apology video ...
Just come out as gay already.
RESPECT to you Deji!!!
This made me cry multiple times for someone who deals with depression. and i have done similar things all because i was incredibly angry i feel ur pain deji 👊
Respect
IDK what happened to his channel
Good video, but what’s with these side shots🤔😂
H- Having A- Anger  T- Towards E- Everyone R- Reaching S- Success
Nice one man 👍
Its ok don’t cry we love you
He’s only crying for the sponsor...come on Deji.
I love how nobody sees how fake this is and how super edited this is. besides the ad, he adds the emotional music and adds photos of them as kids just to gain sympathy. also the comments are flooded with support because deji sets his comments so he only gets people who like him... ALSO the like dislike ratio is also BS. hes been proven to have access to botting so he most likely botted a shit ton of likes
I do not hate anymore
Guys... I think he's sorry
Why are the most likes only verified channels
Big ups to deji
IF THIS NIGGA REALLY CRY LIKE THAT ITS SO WEIRD AND NO DISRESPECT IT LOOK FAKE
❤️❤️❤️
this made me cry when he cried ive been watching him for 4 yrs and ive never seen him cry like this.respect to deji love big man
Really good video from deji
lol
i respect u ur very honest
We may know you like "Deji the Sorry"
we love u deji
damn deji has really chanced respect
most of yall were laughing at this
Respect Deji! Merry Christmas!
need views?
Deji should take the name of knowledge strength and integrity as this video shows you have all of those traits. Props
Why hasn’t he uploaded since
Deji I am a big fan but unfortunately due to the fact that this is a sponsored vid (an add basically) it seems to me as if your to abusing your brothers name stating it’s as if your are genuinely upset due to you and your brothers relationship but to me it’s like you are continually saying you’re sorry which now I’m no longer starting to believe to make matter worse you are doing it on the form of an ad which seems your mentioning your brothers name to get more views so you can profit from it
Mad respect to deji
love you deji, keep it up
Respect deji
Deleting the vids now is a bit late lol
I want to cry now
This is how many times deji said sorry 👇
Fair play . Anyone know what ‘ scumbags ‘ Deji is referring to ?
Do a Video where you teach TJ some tricks.
❤️
Legend
Nice Brand Deal!
the combination of you was gonna takeoff the internet but you thought you got the world. life humbles
😭
U need money to open up about ur feelings??😂
This made cry so much who else 😭
Ngl i think hes really sorry
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😭🤣🤣😭😂😂🤣🤣
Big love. Chin up big man. Nothing a lil time can’t fix
Omg do u ever stop
"UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"  - Deji 2020
This guy has a sponsor on an apology video LOLLLLLLL
I hope this ain’t deji tryna manipulate into giving himself a spot on YouTube like some of this stuff should be said to his brothers face and not a YouTube video
Damn .... this made me want to hug my sister , I won’t though. But it got me there... if anyone understands what I mean😔
This whole video is fake (like this shit up)
All fake
Sponsored bye ps5
This just proves that there's so many bad people on the internet who the fuck dislikes??
Fun fact: You can tell he serious when he not laughing
Next week crying memes uploaded to his reddit 😭
❤️❤️
I don't understand the 5.5k dislikes. I believe there are videos that can get through everyone and deji's video is one of them.....but still 5500 people didn't like this video..... whyyyy?????
never did i think that Deji would make me tear up man
BEING OPEN DIDNT HELP ME I GOT KICKED OUT
so much respect dej❤️
Respect ✊
Respect deji but there will be memes 😂
why are people being rude to the verified comments?   (I know there are nice people I’m just talking to the rude ones)
4th times the charm!
That hat?
This will make ppl see you in a better light Deji. This is why being honest is so important :)
RESPECT, YOU THE BEST DEJI GOD BLESS YOU
*NICE*
this is fucking hilarious lmaooooo
jesus christ did this dude really just edit these clips later and said to himself lets put a sad soundtrack behind me crying so people can have more sympathy
Deji: *partners up with a sponsorship* Keemstar: Wait, that's illegal
This don is always uploading different ways of crying.
"he was always there for me through thick and thin"   last year you didn't have that same energy!🤦‍♂️
❤️
The fact that this is a sponsored video tho 😂😂
Respect, LEGEND- deji
Keemstar: It a ad, it was staged!   Deji: Cry’s real tears   At the end of the day Keemstar always hating on people who make more then him
Its okay guys I counted he said sorry 16 times he must be sorry
Love for you deji❤
Seeing this on my my ps4, but decided to come on through my Phone.  Opening up and get it out there is the start for a better life.  Big up for self-reflection and the start of aa healing process for you and your family.  Bless from Norway.  Ps: All great men cry and show feeling and love, especially in these times, and even i have to be better at this.
Respect man, make me tear up
Ayyyyyyyyyy
Big respect for this deji

Respect for Deji 📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈

Respect!!
This is huge...
Bruh 🤣🤣🤣🤣 manipulator
You’ve done well Dej.
Have a nice Christmas 👍love your family❤️
No one cares
Damn, im crying withu man
Keemstar is wrong for criticising this video, this is a very well thought good apology and it also helps a charity. He doesn’t see that and he is a selfish twat trying to get views from this apology. It may be a brand deal bit it helps many people
Instead of crying over a YouTube video, why don’t you just speak to him in person 😂 this is embarrassing 😂
3:44 it was family fortunes not jeopardy
Respect Deji for this video ❤
Why u crying man
You fell off
6:50 im not crying u are
Someone take a shot for every time he says “I’m really sorry”
Play lollipops
This is the real deji we need
Mad Respect Deji 💕
why am i cryin
Hope you will spend your holidays whit your family
Just accept ur channel is dying you recongised that apology videos gets you the most views chu idiotz.
If you come at deji for having a sponsor on this video your dumb I think the sponsor matched the reason for the video so don’t come at him and he is proving a point and he is openin up so why try make him feel dumb for opening up leave him alone and keemstar can fuck off why make videos hating about this sort of video he is only doing right ❤️❤️
Here come the Keemstar warriors!
Good man deji. Respect 💙
This was definitely for the views 😂
This video made me emotional
song name at 1:51?
PS5 in the background, sublte flex Deji
Respect for you,  but I think if you would tell him this in person it would help allot
Respect its brave to show your emotions have a great Christmas with your family
Get these fking ONIONS AWAY!!
@8:20 epic funny moment 2020 lol
Respect too Deji for opening up mate you hope out another there person who’s going through a touch times but helping get through this. Blessing to you

This is such a relatable video it has in it what I’ve been trying to do for sooo long this is my new favourite video because of it’s importantce thank you for this deji it’s truly amazing merry Christmas   And a happy new year   Harvey.
Fans at the start: are no he we go again   Fans at yeh end oh shit respect my guy 😂👊
Don't listen to trashstar
Shut up
Is it me or when he talks it sounds like his joking?
I can see memes already 💀🤦🏾‍♂️
if you said that you wanted to keep you and your brother's relationship private but why post the video on youtube first of all your getting money for the view, likes, and more from the sponsoring.
Deji you could have just done the apologies video without sponsoring! there's no reason to do an apology while getting money from that when you did four of them
Everyone has problems and we should overcome them and learn from our mistakes.
Omg too many verified mfs out here who invited y’all?🙄
respect
good job man
Deji STFU
Dejis back at it again 🤣
AD
Great video man! Still love you!
❤❤
This warmed my heart, been watching you guys since you guys played scary games together and were living at home and simon would just be in the background. It’s amazing watching you guys grow into the people you are. People make mistakes, but you clearing your guilty conscience shows us you really do care about your mistakes and all we can expect and ask is that you try to do better. Rooting for you guys ❤️
Only a matter of time till that idiot keemstar use this for views on drama alert
Takes a big man to do this.   Mad respect 🙏❤️🙏
What a crying baby lmao
Honestly what a guy 💙
Takes a man, proud of u Dej
"There's nothing I can do, really, that will... , that will, prove that I'm sorry" - I'm pretty sure your words will suffice mate c:. It's ok. Cheer up! Merry Christmas man!
This made me cry 😑😔😔🙏
Lol
Yo it kinda sounds like hes reading a script lol
you’re amazing and takes big balls to admit your wrong, and to apologise publicly all the best mate!
down bad. rlly put an ad to his 4th apology video
Deji =Schools had to shut down Me=yeah, I wish
😱
Deji you are the man
looks like hes reading a script and is way to dramtic to be seen seriously
Lmao 4th apology
first minute i think deji is gay
this shit enough to make me cry
I don’t understand why people are hating for no reason grow up some of these comments are actually childish
Respect to this legend, Hope you have an amazing christmas with your family you all deserve it
Is this a joke 🤣
This guy always crying for views 🤓
How much did you get paid
Why the fuck he making a brand deal😂😂🤣🤣🤣 he just wants the ps
This year is aids
Why did you sent him the video directly, stop involving us. We just want content here on YouTube, check definition of it.
Wow, that is s lot. You are a good person Deji, fr!
Look at you deji, you can beat jake Paul in boxing look at your achievements we need you your our saviour to putting jake in his kennel
Dont let The Hate get to you
❤️
Me when I kill in eletrical 12:36
I’m really sorry
So proud of you degi
Don’t worry about all the hate dej stay strong 💪🦾💪🏻💪🏼💪🏽💪🏾💪🏿 we all don’t care about the add this was a super hart warming video ur the best the best thing you can do is talk to a friend or family member and admit your wrong doings
I  used to love this guy CSG, playing fifa video's I watched him all the time. Its okay to make a video like this. But can someone explain me why is it necessary to put ads into the video? if he's real serious about this then ads don't matter. I'm just wondering.. not attacking lol.
This is so sad it makes me want put my kids up for adoption
Why this shit sound like it’s scripted 🤣🤣🤦‍♂️
Why is keem such an asshole towards deji?
Deji man im so proud of you man!
The FBI when They see This Title:
Stupid ass ad
LMAO FAKE CRY
Deji breathes  Keemstar:this nigga is taking up all the air
Fake ass Cry, PUTS A BRAND DEAL IN HIS APOLOGY
lol
I'm so proud of you
4 of them
Cheers for this one Deji don’t listen to keem star he’s a moron this is actually a great video
Nice sponsored video, seems very genuine
People in the comments saying this his 1st 2nd 3rd apology video but y’all don’t realize he’s growing every year. He dosent want drama with anybody and all he wants is a positive impact on his fans. Just listen deeply on what he is saying and learn from it
Delete this video
Nice ad
Y’all really letting this happen again? Omg
Hey deji I'd forgive and believe you if you pay kavos his legal fees after you dragged him through the courts for revenge. It would show a lot
None should cry during Christmas time we all support you Deji Merry Christmas
Damn this made me cried thanks for the awareness Deji
When you want to get that PS5 for Christmas by all any means...😂😂
That’s hella 🧢
😂😂😂
Is that a fan or the ps5?? 😂😂   Edit: in the background
This really made me tear up and Im just a viewer..
Wtf
Bruh - Who else cried cause they been down this whole journey between the two for years.
Lets get views yaaaaaayyy
Love how all the keemstar fans are complaining, like if u were really that mad about the brand deal , surely u wouldn’t watch this cuz he’s just getting more money
Soo scripted can almost read the piece of paper he’s reading off
Why does this make me cry😭
Major love to the Olatunji family🧡
ITS TIME U STOPPED DOING THIS DEJI
You are making me cry here, STOP it
Cock and balls-jschlat
8:19 when you've been a bad boy and santa doesn't give you any presents
He is legit just making drama so he can get over 500k views on a vid XD  This guy has legit sub botted, used his brothers fame for views, and has been a complete liar to everyone, and people still like him.
Eh what!! I don’t feel this genuine with camera angle changes and how you snapped out of crying so quickly 🤷🏼‍♀️🥺 sorry oh and it’s a paid video a AD
This is so funny 😭😭😭
XDDDDDDDDDD does a brand deal in an apology
Can't take you seriously with that hat

*DEJI - YEARS FINAL LEGEND*
Why would you monetize or get a sponsorship in an apology video
hashtag add
I swear I thought that was a ps5 in the back there
hey guys, it’s comedy shorts gamer here
Respect and thank u for the advice this was a really inspirational video I really mean it
I meannnnn, a sorry does mean something if you take the steps to change
4.7k people down voted this video at the time I see it? The hell is wrong with you people?  Man pours out his heart opening up about his struggles and yall down vote it? What trash lives yall must live.  I'm proud of Deji. Showed so much growth in a short span. 2020 made and broke people. And it's an amazing and inspiring thing to see Deji come so far. Keep going Deji! Respect 🙏🏾
When did movember mean that?
He just realized it?💀💀💀
Deep.
RESPECT DEJI  KEEP MOVING❤❤
U rarely see youtubers break down on camera, and when they do its not genuine. This is the most genuine apology I've ever seen
The way I cried too when he was crying..😭😭
I'm From Georgia USA and I've been  struggling from Depression and Mental Health Issues myself, I've been trying to Fine People that I'm Comfortable of being around and I live in a Ghetto Type Neighborhood and I don't feel Comfortable making Friends there because they are Violent and most of Other People from Other Races are like them as Well and I don't have No One to Hang Around with (and due to the Quarantine) and I'm not Good at Talking because of anxiety, I have been suffering from Addiction which lead to Me not Having a Girlfriend, and I want to try to Change everything on myself (my Personality and the Way I Look) but I'm just Struggling on what's been going on with Me Lately
i thought he was gonna come out to say that he gay
Love this man
Add
He did a brand deal in this video I’m triggered😡😡😡😡
damn mate
You see this ad shit
If he release the uncut footage of where he cries, i will believe he’s sorry
Stop the camera angles out I'm dying of ajds
RESPECT!!!!!!
I dont do well with emotions
I wish i knew more quotes but many people will learn from the video so rewatch the video 😭😀

Low key when I saw Deji cry I almost cried too 😔
Appreciate it deji ❤️🙌
Finally we got our OLATUNJI family back. 2021 is gunna be lit with the OLATUNJI BROS 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥🔥

This reminds me of Logan Paul apology video
It's OK deji, I forgive you
"family always has your back" came true after long time
Ayo mom stop cutting onions
This dude is posh
Deji let’s collab and make a channel called “modern gamer” and just play battle royal games. Forget all the drama
I want to know who has the gun to his head and is making him say all this nonsense.
Keemstar is an idiot for thinking deji is thinking about the money!!
I cried watching this video because I don’t live in a good household but by watching this video you have made me stronger
Had me crying deadass🤧
Ad
Straight foward. i like it.
Oh man, this was a really nice video. Proud of you Deji. 🙂👏🏻👏🏻
Boy really did a brand deal for an apology video
RESPECT Deji!
If they get back together imma get sooooo happy
Imagine hating this man after this video. RESPECT keep the work and dont let the haters fuck your mind up
This is a terrible apology
Deji u the 🐐 man fr
Respect to you deji. You're doing good work
All I'm saying is monetized
To keemstar fans and keemstar himself just because it says ad doesnt make it bad this ad helps mentally hes showing hes experience with the company how it helped him open emotionally. Stop saying it says ad how did it hurt anybody?tell me
😢😭😢😭😢😭🥺😭😢
Deji's tears shattered my heart love you deji we all are humains wemake mistakes we learn from them ❤
:)
Put this on reddit
This is how much people respect Deji  👇
seeing Deji cry I just want to hug him
You can tell hes not faking it
Have you got a sign on you're gate yet? "NO ENTRY IF DOGS IN GARDEN"
Good man
Respect deji 💖💗💓💞
holy sheet this is so strong of you. merry christmas deji
Why is there so many dislikes?
Deji... don't make me cry mannnn
Respect to you Deji
this fcking guy
Deji did the best apology I've ever seen, its sincere, honest, regretful, and had alot of self accountability. Great job👍, ur forgiven😌
Who's here after disliking keemstar's video where he tried to shit on Deji for no goddamn reason
Everyone that dislikes should watch the video then think big love deji big fan since 2012❤
Another meme is coming 😂
Best video you’ve ever done Deji. Build on THIS ♥️
I thought he was comming out being gay.. But respect Deji
An ad in an apology...amazing
Have a good Christmas hope you are safe
Appreciate the ad in the corner, pretty smart
resubbed. thats all we needed to hear. gj being true to yourself.
stay strong deji we are all here for you don't let any negative or hate comments get to you stay positive keep believing in yourself because we believe in you and keep your head up we all know that you are strong we got your back we all ❤️ you Deji  Stay strong man
Deji is so down to earth man
Deji: Serious time. But TIME TO MAKE MONEY 🤑
That was beautiful Deji
I try asian kfc chicken
At least he didn't start the video with "I've made a severe and continuous lapse of my judgement"
Imo The Crying Sound fake as Fuck Lmao 🤣😬💀
Trying to make an emotional video riddled with ads and sad music. He a fake liar. Bs.
Keemstar really made me mad at deji but after watching this video, I realize keemstar was just trying to people riled up and angry at deji.
You should accept your mistakes
you have all my respect man!
I'm glad you have opened up Deji,  it is very hard as you have said to open up and I feel it's even more so for a man to open up because of this thing where people think men are weak for doing so, it's not true, men have feelings too, they are more than entitled to open up, this may help others to open up, thanks for helping to raise awareness.  I have both mental and physical health problems, I'm quite open about my problems but I'm an "older" person and have learned to open up as I've gotten older, I have friends who have mental health problems and I try and be there for them when they need me. The way I get them to open up is I take interest in what they're doing, I ask questions etc and make sure they are getting the help and support that they need.
Man had a script of cam 🤦‍♂️
wake up to reality
Big respect to you it’s hard to open up for everyone but especially men. Guys keep your heads up and remember that you are loved and people do care. ❤️❤️
💛
As much as I don’t like Deji sometimes but this is clearly a step in a new direction
True 2020 is the worst year it’s so boring and sad
You a big man 💪
respect 😔 u really got me😪.
Deji is the best actor
nice ad
mann keem is really fucking up the relation of the olatunji brothers
He put on his customer service voice 😂
Crying for a brand deal I see boss
I haven’t even seen Keems video but I already know he’s just gonna be prick
Bit late to delete the videos now but sure you still mean well
so much respect <3
❤️
Sup dej
RESPECT DEJI 🔝🔝🔝 BIG UP!
Keemstar talking shit yet again... Why doesn't he first watch the video and at least try to understand it
Big respect deji😢😢😭😫♥️
stop cying my guy
Deji is speaking facts
Damn...
Glad you owning up
👏
❤ This video helped me a lot thank you
ngl you tried opening up once and you just got completely fucked up by deji crying memes
Everything you do is fake dude,  cry all you want, nobody with 2 braincells can see through your acting
Comedy shorts gamer 🤣🤣
After this video, i actually love you deji ❤
It's sad to see that these videos get dislikes too
Don’t cry man please
Well done 🥰💪🏾
I came becuase of keemstar but deji you know what we as a community got your back everything will be okay 2021 is your year❤️💪🏽
u'll always have your family
4 ads  and sponsored on an apology. Very very genuine
Lol
I don’t think this a full apology but it’s to open up that’s what’s the ads are about not the actual apology the apology was good tho
This is the best video you have put out 💯
cash grab
I hope deji dreamcrusher be back in the ring soon
Nice
did anyone fucking ask for this video
You love to see it. Respect man
Deji I have mad respect for you and seeing you cry is sad❤
Is this the video he's getting hate for? I don't understand why
Deji has grown. No more clowning him now.
Wow! What a guy! Taking full responsibility! Keep strong my man! Your doing great!
Wish I can give you a hug dej
“If your hangin around people and you feel like your doing the wrong thing you probably are” -wise words from deji
Is this video scripted and i think it is
At the start it sounds like he's reading from a script
Delete it from Spotify
this shit made me cry
I'm really really glad Deji genuinely apologized and took responsibility. Everything he said in his apology is what I was saying since day one. I'm so happy things are better now.
Imagine he just takes all this back
Woah ad😳😳😳😳
Tank dog name stupid
Deji don’t cry
Ad
❤️
How do you feel that Keemstar exposed you about this video😂
This guy always crying
I was a huge deji fan around 2014 but over the years I grew to dislike him due to his actions and seemingly disingenuous nature. However, this video has really changed my perspective and Deji deserves respect for opening up like this in what I believe to be a genuine video
With full ads on the vid
AD lmfao don't act like you give a flying fuck because you really and truly don't.
Tapped
Keem tells half the truth when it comes to deji
This was such a good watch. I found a new level of respect for you, Deji.  All love to the Olatunji Family!
I hate seeing Deji cry 😔🥺
Next few days will be interesting
shame on deji for doing a brand deal on this type of videos
Deji: *takes responsibility for his action*  Keemstar: *Rubbing his hands* Now what do we have here...
Can you give me 10k every time you say sorry
Anyone find his comment?
Thank you so much for this. something everyone needs right now is some positive vibes
Nobody: Keemstar: LET'S GET RIIIIIGHT INTO THE NEWS
Why ad
Big respect for Deji and his family 🥺🥺🥺 we all need to open up about our feelings even tho we don't feel like it plz don't be afraid yall
Ad
wow.
Shout out deij man i don't like seeing people cry.
*Aye Deji I see that PS5 in the back*
Aww youtube tears
Cos it's nearly Christmas and you're skint 😂 😂 😂
Ah shit here we go again. 🤣🤣🤣😁😂
If it was such a big issue, why didn't he say this privately instead of profiting on another apology video?
notice how Scarce Hardly mentions Deji because Keemstar just makes a video  about this to make Deji look bad and he was just making views fooling people.
❤️
Can we cancel Keemstar? He has taken down so many innocent channels.. and we won’t forget etika
You are a g for this
It litterly said ad
hE's miLkInG fOr vIeWs
Who else is crying with him
RESPECT DEJI
This was hard to watch
Big respect.. people like keemstar will always hate but that just shows how immature they are and how mature youu are for even posting this for the whole internet to see
So much respect for this guy for doing this watched him for years and glad he did this. Fair play Deji fair play ❤️.
I want to say this is genuine and I feel it is, but the ad part just really rubs me the wrong way, idk it just didn't seem like the right thing to do, if there was no ad then I'd be respecting deji a lot
Imagine disliking
Isn’t keem supposed to be a friend to you but he made you out to be a bad guy when you clearly not you are just going through rough times but I know you shouldn’t react to his vids and comments but mate you really should just say what the fuck is your problem because he’s a arse hole like can we all remember idubbbz made a video on him literally exposing him for who he really is
Big Up Deji man
This man is down bad
Deji noooooo
Scripted with ads lmaoooooo deji money thirsty as always
Shut up and grow up
Respect for Deji just went up so high , btw keemstar needs to stop the hate
Man all of these comments saying respect to deji, I wonder how many are actually paid, btw he still makes money from this “charity” that he’s promoting, smh
Big respect
I love you deji, you have an golden soul, i have always knew that, from the day one!
Love him or hate him keemstar is usually on the money and right about the ins and outs of YouTube... he missed the mark on this one though. This is one of the few times I can remember a brand deal and video making sense together and being symbiotic
big respect g luv💙💙💙💙
There’s nothing more to say then... big respect ❤️
❤❤❤❤❤
Love or hate Deji he has a heart of gold 💛
Man got an ad on an apology video, I know it's for something positive, but still, he put an add on an apology video.
did you tell him privately first
He could of cut out the crying coz everyone is gonna make memes but love you dej
It’s ok, but why he using 3 cameras ?
Nah no one can disrespect deji now
Why the fuck do I keep looking at the side of your head
ad
dammm im tearing a bit, he said sorry so many timess bruhh
Good video champ.
Respect for this man and fuck kemstar
You better be legit this time Deji. Ik you have the potential to fix yourself.
,💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓
Love you deji❤️
Big up Deji
Cant wait to see him go right back to doing dumb shit lmao
God damn man, you’re a legend. Love you to bits and hope everything will be alright, and it will he trust me
Honestly keemstar is one of those guy that's always hungry for drama
I have learnt alot from this video
This shits too funny.
Deji flexing his PS5 on the right
I don't like to see people sad or crying! Stay Strong Deji! and goes for Everyone else still here  and *Believe in Jesus!*
victimising yourself again... dear god
U just love the clout
Respect ❤️
Not again ...
next few week not looking too bright for you g
AD
Another view grab
second time watching this and i only just picked up on this but...quick question...did you really need to play some generic sad piano music while you were crying? just wondering
Oh damn didn't expect this
"I'm so sorry" counter?
Hey I just want to say I've always been a big fan I've wanted to be a youtuber as long as I can remember hes one of the best in the entire world never a dull moment
THIS IS FUCKING MONOTIZED AND NOT ONLY THAT IT HAS A FUCKING AD WTAF
I respect you and  I Express myself so much and I would love help people who going too deep and sometimes I wish to fixed the community and deji your expression was truly inspirational and  you got to be strong and find happiness but it great your telling stories.
Awwwwwwwwww
2021 will be the best Deji
I hope you did this personally first...
Here’s a tip Deji Real men cry👍🏻
Is he sorry?
Another fake apology video...
Would this video be here if it wasn't for John Swan. No, the answer is no.
My guy
𓂺
I’m glad he finally apologised. Better late than never. I wish you both happiness in the future!💜
Then there is keemstar spinning a. Fucking apology video
S
❤️
I find it funny how nobody sees how manipulative Deji is. Keem doesn’t make the news, he just reports it. He can’t just not ignore something that is a first for YouTube history.
Keep your head up Deji🖤
love u deji
Gonna be honest, I don’t like you to your content to how you have acted but I feel this is a great video and a great apology. Ik u might want to take some time off first but I believe a video responding your criticism is a good idea. Have a good Christmas!
My respect for Deji now 📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈
Huge amount of respect Deji, takes so much guts to come out like this especially publicly and to millions of people, never feel alone Deji you always have your family your mates and us your fans! We love you Dej❤
MARRY A BLACK WOMAN
I have so much respect for u now
BIG RESPECT DEJI KEEP PUSHING ON BRUDDA ❤️
cry baby lmao
The bigger man ♥️
I thought that was a ps5 next to him lol
Dont listen to keemstar. He has just run out of content so he goes back to finding a way to bring deji down.
Thank you for opening up we appreciate ❤️!!!
My respect Said⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️
Deji mad respect for you man keep it up
is good to bo open be yourself
I don’t have a problem with him promoting movember, I just don’t like the fact he’s making money out of it in an apology video
I came here bot liking him now i like him again
AN AD REALLY
This apology was perfect 2020 closure
This broke me
Alll love from they crew ✅❤️
He only doing this for attention you got family stuff keep it private
Admitting mistakes isn’t easy! I respect you for this and wish you and the rest of the Olatunjis a nice Christmas!
Deji i love you!
Crazy how deji was 21 and is already 23 to turn 24 and fought jake paul
Nah I’m mad proud of you deji ❤️
Respect deji we are here for you❤️
You have already apologised. This is clearly just to milk views from the previous drama. The vidioes from what happend before should have already been deleted. So why did it take you this long?  Any way just move on man.If you want people to start talking about you again then donate to charity or some thing, or fight some one. Dont just exploit previous shit that's happend so people talk about you again.Its just fucked up man.  And why the fuck have you put 2 camra angles on an apology video ,as well as the family pictures ,and the crying.Does your editor know how to edit Deji.
This helped me a lot...
Deji you've matured a lot 👍🏾🌈
My respect for keemstar went down no cap shoulda watched the vid instead of judging so fast
I guess you could say keemstar is like CNN news...  the dislikes are the “liberals”
Here we go again with this guy
I don’t like Keemstar
You were being those things, not now :)
This made me cry
i think keem star has gone a bit far i think the ad is a good way to swea way into the apoligy and to spread awareness props to demi for opening up ❤️❤️
Man this is so hard to do all Respects for deji
Another deji classic 😂😂😂😂
Dont listen to the haters like keemstar. This was great from you
Respect📈📈📈📈📈📈📈
respect deji pure respect
Ffs why deji
You are great  don't the that get to you
Love
We dont care         Its a joke
I mean if you’re sad Deji and you really mean it, why did you make this is as an *”AD”?*  🤦🏾‍♂️
Tbh deji it's just part of growing up
Love u man
BROTHERS FIGHTS DEJ, YOU'RE THE MAN♥️☹️
BET...  🧖🏻‍♀️
Dejis first time on shrooms
I’ll comment more ray mark      *believe it*
Keemstar is such a clown 🙄
GG man you've done well have a great rest of the year 👍
Im not crying u r
wow wondering what the response is..
Oof
i felt this Deji
Damn 😢
Wholesome video...
Well said, it takes a big man and a stand up guy to admit his wrongs and open up.💪👊
I respect Deji for doing this
Na you arent
You ar gay
i never imagined deji crying
First guy i ever saw doing an ad in an apology video
I am so proud of Deji for owning up about his mistakes I relatively young but I’ve been through a lot and I know when people are honest.I’ve been bullied in the past until recently and I like to think that opening up helps.Deji knows what he’s talking about and anyone going through a tough time it’s bloody hard but it helps tell someone no matter how big the problem is.I’m so happy now I’ve shared my experience with my friends and family and I hope that I at least had an influence on 1 person.
You dropped this 👑 KING
DAMN 😶
😐😭😪
FUCK, im over here holding tears back
Literally putting an ad on an apology video, get a grip mate
First time ive ever cried over a YouTube video.... mad respect to you!
I respect you now as a man 💯
Cancelled
So.. keemstar mislead me once again. Why are we still watching that fool? Props to Deji. It’s hard to open up like that. Feels real and genuine to me.🤷‍♀️
“AD” 💀💀
8:20 xD
8:05 obama
can you cry already you stupid deji
racist
not enough chicken given
Deji this is it. The conversation of mental health is so important and thank you for spreading awareness. Keep going with this type of content man it's amazing to see you being so real, raw and honest. You're gonna inspire alot of fans to open up about their mental health. Thank you Deji!
im asking you
do you have a big bump on your nose?
yeah youre lying
comedy SHORTS malware
gameware
comedy SHORTS gamer
What if you don’t have friends to open up?
U have changed 👑👑👑👑
Hopefully u two can get together and meet up soon 💪
We all love you Deji I’ve always been a fan till the end. I know you been through a lot but your one of the strongest people I know. You’ve been a good influence to me and give me positivity to do more everyday to reach my goal. Mistakes is what we do everyday but we can use those mistakes to become better and overcome it and that’s what I learned today from this video that everyone can be better from there mistakes and change in a positively way. Love you Deji and your family. Merry Christmas.
Got my full respect
Just congrats dej, u got really more mature and just props to u❤️
Why is everybody saying he did this for clout. People are so dumb these days Smh...
This bell end still on YouTube. Wow If any of this shit was true it would be done in person and not for views you dirt bag
I forgot to Say happy bithday sorry i'm 6 days late
Keemstar STFU
You are truly awful
8:20 That really hurt me to see him cry. Stay strong Deji even In the toughest times you still come out strong and better than ever, Respect to you and your family Deji love y’all. Merry Christmas
Love seeing people grow. Acknowledging emotions and admitting when he's wrong. That's as mature as it gets. 💖
Respect
Proud of you
I thought you were gay.
I actually cried when deji started crying
This is very big and very touching. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
AD really lol your a joke
"ComedyShortsGamer" lmaao
another one
I actually respect this very hard. This is so amazing to watch. I am sorry these past events has happened. Dear Jide and Yinka, you have raised up 2 boys taht I love I respect all 4 of you. All 4 of you have an amazing family. Take care and I will always respect with you all.
Deji!!!! Respect!!!!!!!!!!
TALENTS HAHAHAHAHA like wut¿
Hate deji
He literally admitted that he was wrong to mislead people. 🤦🏽‍♀️
Some more typical Deji bs. He just did this for the money and attention like he always does. He would have deleted those videos a long time ago if thats how he felt and if it was genuine. Ofcourse there is still going to be those of you that choose to believe in Deji and believe that this is genuine. Ya’ll believe him every time time and time again even though he does it for the wrong reasons every time. And no im no just being a hater, sorry for you kids out there but this is just reality.
Mad respect deji have nice Christmas g
Respect love u deji
I teared up too
Love to see that he opened up...love u deji
Everyone loves you Deji Your an amazing guy always remember that.❤️👊
Its sad that keem thinks he is doing it for money
I know this is not related but when are you going to release sparring footage and when are you going to fight deji ?
Big Up Deji
Huge respect man, we all knew this is your true side and fuck negativity
Don’t worry Deji we all love you
I don't like deji all sad and gloomy.
What da hell is this production?
I have high respect for him.  Thanks for this
This video is do beautiful! ❤
You’re amazing for this man. Merry Christmas Deji
The vibe of this video HITS DIFFERENT, Big Up whoever edited this
I need to do this. I'm a piece of shit. However, I'm horrible with words. Everytime I apologize I end up making it worse because of my choice of words so it's hard to believe me... I really do mean my apologies and I cant explain how horrible of a person I feel like I am. At this point I feel like apologizing over and over is just going to make things worse even tho I still try my best to use the right words
❤️
Sponsored.......really? Ffs
thx deji
dont worry love, its okay. MAN LIKE FAMALAM DEJI. keep your head up aswell, me and neil ntsiomo are cheering you on!!! GO DEJI!!!!!
1.25 should be better tho
Yeah Keem is a yes man to drama I stg big up DEJI 🙂
Did anyone ask?
Guys, rather than shittalking Keemstar, y’all should just sub to Deji. The more love and support you give him, the less obnoxious he’ll be for clout.
Big up!
respect for deji❤️
nice you must have gotten well paid for your brand deal
Nah could saves me from going school im loving it
Haven't even finished the video and it hit hard
Cumstar fans hit the dislike

AMAZING CONGRATS to you on this one!!
PROPS I wish you a nice christmas with the FAM !!
F*ck Keemstar this guy is hating mental health for so long now, he's just trying to bring Deji down
Finally Deji. I stayed subbed for THIS.❤
What's up with these weird side camera angles?
Big respect man
This video changed my whole perspective about Deji this video made me cry
This is a sponsored video....
Why is there a BRAND DEAL in an APOLOGY VIDEO...
Its ok deji we love you i cried with you man.
Big respect
Nice job man, it took courage, we know, u did tha right thing. 👍
Dude glad to see this, finally omg some sincere apologies.
‘Til all my sleaves are stained red... From all the truth that I’ve said...
Wow man deji when u cry it makes me feel so bad
This video makes me wanna cry fuck
Wow...not one negative comment...interesting
Good shit Deji 🙏 Respect
Damn
this was a payed ad    hahaha
8:19 when you misbehave with your parents and they kick u outta the house 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"just a joke"
How tf can keemstar even try to attack deji for this video
You got my subscription
8:19 new meme 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I hope you have the best Christmas ever Deji
Damn respect deji. Head up champ
NOT GOING TO LIE THIS GOT ME IN TEARS. Respect
Unforgivable is still on Spotify though
It is really sad seeing a man crying about something about family and something important
COVID came out of nowhere Do you want to try that again mate.
Deep respect for you Deji❤️,always had been a fan and god bless you and your family
oh shit.
We are all here for you deji. We love you ❤️❤️❤️
Love
how much did you get paid to do the brand deal
Respect
This guy is moist, some feminine guy. Crying like a woman every 2 months
😫😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺Deji stay strong
Does ads for this vidoe sorry my ass
Yed lad!!!
Ad?
😥😭😭😭😭😢😢😢😢😢🖤
Time to give up and quit thanks
Idk I gotta agree with keem on this. If deji said the money he got to promote movember was given to a charity or that he donated to the charity, it would be fine. The fact is that he got paid to make this video by a mental health charity and that's kinda fucked up. Its a alright video other than the fact he has it sponsored and ads on it. It probably wasn't intended to be like this but it comes across like he is just trying to prophet of a mental health vid.
Did Covid effect you or did it only effect you when you fucking lied about having it?
Damn it deji!!!!! Y the hell this shit have to be touching man damn!!😢😢😢
I love you deji
who knows  deji's birthday by heart  9th december
OMG you are so strong man i love you man i cried aswel
It takes some courage to open up to millions of people big up deji
Lol. "First time ever"
Lol
Big up deji
Mad respect to deji, genuinely got me thinking about my personal life and the people I'm around. We need more people like this
I supported Deji when keem star was bashing him cause I don’t live off daddy keemstars shit
Yo why this like a college project
Again. He blames "scumbags" that made him make disstracks against him.  Who are these invisible scumbags????  No one.  Lying....
Too many ads in an apology video! Probably the only that exists lol
Why would he upload this when he probably has his number!
He blames other ppl for him uploading videos and he.keeps saying other ppl made him do it. He won't stop lying.
hes got a set off balls for uplading this
Great did this apology vid to get views wew🖕🖕
Not cryin just cutting onions
what the hell is up with those weird second camera shots
You made good money :)
Respect isn’t a right it’s something you earn. And deji you earned everyone’s respect. Merry Christmas and f*ck this year.
I got no value🙁🙁
Respect 💪💪💪💪
This is dumb... Everything from the bullshit sad music and the fake crying. What grown man apologies via a YouTube video... A monetized one at that. You're not sorry you're just an attention seeker.
this is the difference between the pauls and the ulatunji
Brand deal!!!! He is getting BIG £££ for this!!! SMH
Oh shit here we go again..
At least he kept the clickbaity crying until the middle. I feel like I can actually trust this one now.
BRAND DEALLLLLLLLLLL
I mean, prove me wrong cause i dont believe a single word you are saying, im confident you did this video for views and relevancy. Again, prove me wrong.
My respect for deji 📈📈📈📈👍🏻
Lmao he has AD so the more views he gets the more money.
Long overdue, you wronged a lot of people
When u are young you do stupid things but to open up 🆙 and to the strength and courage to acknowledge your wrongs to right them is strength respect ✊🏿 deji have a great 👍 Christmas 🎄 and a bright future I h8 seeing ppl cry 😭 😿 it gets me every time
It takes a lot to cry on cam man RESPECT MAN💪🏽❤️❤️❤️
Stuff like this trending shows me how far Humanity has been dumbed  down
GG
Fair play deji
BIG respect deji
Like the ad  Like the script you wrote and you are reading  Like the ps5 in the background
Big man deji thank you
🙌🙌🙌🙌RESPECT
You have my respect mate 👍 It really hurts me to see people cry, I wish you and your family a happy Christmas  I am proud of you for doing this mate  👍
Authenticity deserves appreciation.
why is there an ad
Not the brand deal attached to this “personal” video
Duude... I cried
I respect Deji for this vid. and for ending this drama and disstracks... but i think this video didnt need the ads.
1 question why is there AD above left ??
I wish I was there to hug u I was crying
This is by far your best video imo. I like the editing as well. It takes a lot of maturity and bravery to come out complety transperent to the internet .
big ups for this deji, this takes a lot! brothers for life
What’s the sorry count?
Let’s just deep the fact that in the bottom right that picture of deji been there for years
This hitssss harrrd  and i know that this could be manupulative but i don't  think  he is bieng that  all resspect to you deji big up for overcoming  this anxiety  of bieng open up Ps:i can see how people  will say monetizing  a video with an apology  energy  but this is a verry convenient  collab like thing for mental  health  or opening up  in general  so this is okey  please  don't  harass  him!
I am not afraid of expressing, showing, telling my feelings...... is just I grew up alone and all I need is my self.....       (bae if u see this it is what it is? 🤷‍♂️ I am jp 😂)
Nh
Why does this come up when i search up wocky slush ear rape
Respect dude!!!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I’ve never hated you, but this just made me like and respect  you more

Very good from you Deji! The growth will be televised!
Maybe just GO and talk to him f2f and tell him în person all of these
Deji gon knockout jake
Apologize to him privately I’m sure that’s what he would like
I like how when it all goes to shit he puts up his camera and says sorry what is it with deji and Christmas time lmao 8
Respect
Why tf we keep canceling small youtubers why tf wont we cancel keemstar
💜💜💜
You think, wow maybe Deji's an okay guy. And then you realize this was a brand deal and his 4th time apologizing where its not gonna last.
I love keem I love deji but damn past few months listening to his podcasts and watching dramaalert, keem claims he's deji friend but he's going way too far with deji. Deji is trying to do something good and keem is trying to twist it thats not cool
Big ups deji, you did what a real, respectful and changed man would do. This made me regain so much respect for you man. Keep doing your thing cuz this path seems like it will have what you need and want at its end.
When he says “friends “ who he talking about
RESPECT, FAHM....MAAD RESPECT!!!💫✨💯
Love u Dej, as a 5 year sub, im proud, you are maturing and im so proud to be a subscriber
YO MY GUY
Ad
Good man deji
Respect deji. Bond between brothers can never be broken.
RESPECT
23? Ah mate you’re still a bambino and learning. Bright future ahead. Life doesn’t get any easier, so keep your head up, friends and family close, keep grinding, and stay strong. Much love 🙏🏻
I think Keem dosent realize this brand deal thing is for a good cause
Well done deji this video was needed 👑
Keem star do be chatting his shit about deji. Keep the work up lad👑
Fake af
I can’t believe keemstar called Deji out for this. Mad respect being honest in this video and owning up to where you messed up.  Keemstar is basically the embodiment of those anonymous bots you get on Twitter criticising people just to get some enjoyment out of their sad depressing lives
God what a big step for Deji and Don’t listen to Keem star he’s being a jerk
Crying is good, let it all out. Respect to you and your family dude, prayers.
Hallo
Big up deji respect
All for a brand deal smh
You can really tell this is from his heart if it made you cry aswell
Why tf Deji always gotta make so many sad videos 💀
You could get him something crazy meaningful for him for Christmas 🤙
Damn man i almost shed a tear, im glad to see you this matured Deji much love
Man put an ad in a video he started crying on LOOOOOOOOOOL
gotta save face after John Swan's expose of you
I hated to see Keemstar trying to twist the whole meaning of his intensions... It was genuine. Not for the money...
Who's cutting onions? 😭😭😭
this is an ad-
This is meant to cover for the thousand lies lol?
does this mean ya videos are ab to be better and less click baitey my g or are you still ass on the content part
I think opening up is not the most difficult, finding someone right to open up to is the most difficult
you stupid smart 189 iq should know not to put a add on apology
Not gonna lie... saw the title... thought he was coming out.🙃
This video shouldn't have been monetized just saying
That’s so fake it’s hurts my eyes
Well done deji, we are all proud of you
He really had to get it off his chest
Awwwww 💔💔💔💔
It’s sad, but I’m sure I’ve seen Deji apologise and then repeat his mistakes again...
So I shouldn’t hide my emotions an let it fester in to psychological decay?
Big respect to Deji. Giving us new crying meme content
Respect I made mistakes with my friends in the past
Big up Deji Man. Lotta Respect man.
RESPECT 🙌
I teard :(
Ad                  Bruh
RESPECT DEJI❤❤
dont listen to keemstar he a prick respect to you deji
Family should always stick together no matter what
Channel is dying that's why he's being "mature"
Big up urself on this one u jus gained an old supporter back 👍🏾
He sounds like a corrupt politician
Its december thou
this video kinda make me cry, shiiiii
U know what this guy everytime he tries to fix these problems hes put himself in he somehow still maneges to mess it up by putting on adverts on a apology video
"Everything will be okay in the end. If it's not okay , it's not the end" - John Lennon   Big ups to you Deji
I don’t care, imma forgive Deji and re-sub. Big move and big respect
😂     I just want to see how many people will respond to this negatively even after just watching this vid
Don´t listen to what Keem said, u have grown up and take responsibility for your past actions. U may not have his respect, but u have mine.
this was hard to watch.
I love this new deji
You just regained an old fan, quality video deji good on you for spreading the message
2020 wanted this You guys be together for Christmas ❤️
OMEGALUL
Keems a bit of a prick like yh it’s a brand deal but it links nicely to the video and he actually wants to apologise he’s just making it way bigger and worse than it seems
why is he talking like a news reporter
The tinkly piano music was a master touch
Does a big sponsorship on an apology video that would get heaps of views for more money.
add lol
Feel like he's just taken this from callux
Next thing we want to see is a collab for the sake of old days
you took serious guts being this vulnreable an admitting your faults i admire you so much Deji big respect this is an example of how men can open up an prevent these suicide rates an to seek help when help is needed truly amazing!
Who else came from drama alert and disagree with keem because it’s the right video for this brand
Who else cryed🤧
9:16 why do I feel like that Deji would kill his promise again??
🖤 we love you 🖤
Good for owning up and give u alout of respect hope u and ur family have a great Christmas and a  new year
It’s a good video if it’s honest but idk he just talks like he’s reading a script it might just be something that he does when he’s speaking from the heart not sure tho.
It takes a big man to admit the things you just admitted, respect ↗️↗️↗️
Y’all are getting played so hard. Dude only cares about money
"Surround yourself only with positive Vibes"    OK ,Well i have to turn off the Video then?🤷
Thanks Dej for this video.
Keemstar is trying to make this sitaution bigger again. Hes being a prick. Dont listen to him deji. Keemstar is trying everything to make this bigger then it was. Great supportive video and you just changed so much. The past is the past.
Ayooo fuck keeeemm
for knowing deji for years this hurt me i got emotional i dont get emotional that easily Respect for him tho
And then there's keemstar the guy who always making stupid A$$ news about deji 🙄🤦‍♂️
Deji the drama queen
Wow he should Cut the crying Bits out! From an honest Well prepared talk Video, to a crying Rambling Video again!!!! Why!!!
I love u deji!! I mean Comedy shorts gamer!!
lmfaooooooooooooooo
Deji... This is so fucking amazing It takes the strongest men to open up to how they feel, and talking with millions of people about it is even better... Deji, showing your emotions, like the crying you did, shows that your heart is pure!
damn this made me cry
We love u guys and we will always support you
That made me respect u much more.
All the 3.6k dislikes at this moment you guys have no heart
ARE YOU GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE BOTTING IN THE NEXT VIDEO 🤖
Big up deji for opening up 💯
legend
Man got caught out and is backtracking further than a presidential debate 😂🤣
Who else kinda teared up watching this 😞
Ad

When he was he crying he made me cry
This video hit me in so many different ways man and reminded abt my life😔

❤️❤️❤️
Hope you apologise privately
Wait so is he really sorry?

👏👏👏👏 this made me cry man. We are humans we make mistakes we are not perfect and if you think your perfect and you think that nothing is gonna happen to you you are a bloody idiot mate. 👏👏👏👏👏
This shit almost made me cry
Keemstar 😑😐🤨
Deji: starts crying  The wall: oh shit here we go agian...
We all love youu Deji 💕💕
Respect man
RESPECT Deji. You have grown sooo much
This is beautiful! Cheers!
Big up deji for this 🙏🏾
This is where the maturity has kicked in for Deji
After the identity authentication application, it takes time to wait for the official confirmation to pass. Don’t worry, it usually takes half an hour. If it’s not passed for a long time, you can consult customer service.
bruh this has a had the more views the more money plus deji sub botting i did like you deji now i am unsubbing and blocking you off my YT
This video reminded me of when i had to do a PowerPoint at school bruh
Keemstar fans are coming here hating on the video cause it has ad on it
Respect Deji
3/10
love you
Weldone mate, super proud
It took him sometime to realise all of this but ay least he got there.
Fyi the ads on this video are going towards charity
I could feel a crack in my heart when started crying😪
I saw the title and thought Deji was coming out
I really genuinely thought you were a terrible person. I almost respect you now
Big respect for Deji.... even though they fight all the time they will always remain true brothers 🙏❤️
I don't get it how people can hate on this video
I didn’t think I’d ever not liked somebody or a youtuber for that matter, as you. You truly are an awful human being.
Play at 1.25x so he talks normal
"I never seen a man cry, till I seen a man die."
This is enough to make a grown man cry
It’s probably not but why does it sound like he’s reading this from a script?
They should just stop making videos about each other.....a month from now we'll just see a new title "he fucked up” 😑
best video you have ever made by far.
my respect for deji 📈📈📈
You know it's serous when he has 2 camera.
It was the baby pictures for me😭
RESPECT DEJI, RESPECT
Don’t let keemstar get to you deji he always finds something to be negative about, but the morally right thing to do is to give the sponsor money and ad revenue back to charity
Swear he does like 2 of these videos  a year
Slapping an ad in an apology. Niceeeeeeee 👌
i have watched you for many years. but the past 2-3 years i havent even watched one video on ur channel. but today u earned my respect again. and im glad to see that «our deji» is coming back
Deji it takes a lot of guys to do what you did, we love you man
when deji cried i lost it
but why is this an ad???
Didn’t know UK had their own version of Donald Trump 😂 1:17
Blah blah blah stfu
Who puts ads and a sponsor on an apology video
After watching this video it makes me hate keemstart as he was hating on him spreading awareness
Ur an interesting dude u know running ads on these typa vids
Why are people calling him brave for crying and posting when he threw a tantrum 2 years ago
Respect.
A D
Idk why hes crying on camera if he really was up for it he could've done it in person not on this YouTube sbit saying im sorry im sorry
Respect
Ok
people don't understand that this is an ad and when he makes videos like this he makes more views
The worst part is keemstar will try to make him look bad with this video.
Respect
Nice paid ads
Kinda weird to see a grown ass man cry
I acctually hatteee keemstar with a passion
why does keem have a problem with this?
❤️
This is a madness props to Deji but why would you do a brand deal on this video?
Big ups to Deji ‼️‼️‼️
Don't use your bros name as an ad that's fucked up y'all had your relationship good then you do this omggg
I lost respect for him over the past few years but all respect was restored
It takes a big man to admit his faults. Respect!!!
Years Deji, years we waited to see you speak in this way and it’s refreshing, it’s honestly amazing. To see my thoughts of you change over the years like a roller coaster just to see them to return to that of thinking of you as a man whom I respect and look up to like it’s 2011 all over again, we love you Deji. Whether we’ve been here since the beginning or not, we will always be able to tell who’s authentic because it takes real authentic human beings to see other authentic people who radiate positive intentions on this world which you showed more in this video then possibly over the however many years you’ve been a Youtuber. I truly think after a decade of knowing your whole family, we as a community can finally say factually that you and the rest of your family all have good intentions as people and positive influences on the communities you all provide for and surround yourselves in. So from the absolute bottom of our hearts Deji, thank you, and this time we can mean it without sarcasm or bs memes, so honestly thank you Olatunji’s, we will always love you and you all will forever be in our hearts. So for all the laughs and content you’ve all provided over the years I feel it is only right for us all to say thank you and appreciate the gift that has been given to us which is your family, so for all of that over all the years Deji, thank you and we love you.❤️ Don’t ever forget that.
Imagine if the problem gets solved by Christmas and they give us that collab 🔥🔥🤞🤞🤞🤞
He has the ps5 in background
This is human growth
Crying and barely stuttering in his voice especially with the asthma Lmao
God bless Deji!
How many times is this guy gonna make sad videos and that’s the only way he’s barely gonna hit 1 million views
Scripted
Deji..... BRUH a brand deal in an apology video
hate deji just wants money
9:00 (Jay from the inbetweeners)... ooow sorry oow sorry 🤣
Hey Deji you should donate the money you got from the sponser and video to show your new maturity to Keemstar
damn even i cried
❤
Keemstar fans:ohhhhhh sponsor thousands of pounds  People: oh charity
I feel bad for deji  i feel you
Por deji
Keem needs to stop his agenda against Deji. He is genuinely feeling bad about his past actions. Big up Deji. 👍👍👍
Brand deal
Respect!!!! ❤🔥
RESPECT ! deji
Wtf is there a sponsor on an add smh.
this guy puts a brand deal in his apology video🧐
I don't understand why the hell would you dislike this, wth, this is the reason suicides happen. A person is literally opening up and u are sending hate wtf
:)
Good video but would’ve been even better without the ad
I dont even care if you put a branddeal in the video thats not the main point of this video congrats on the branddeal and have a happy holiday Dej💜❤
For people are talking about how the ad is in the video, and it's for him to profit.. you clearly didn't even watch 2 seconds of the video, cause that's the first thing he talks about...
respect my g🤍
how’s tank? ;)
THANKYOU 💙
Keemstar is right in this situation
Is that a PS5 next to him lmao
Sending love your way Deji, proud of your progress
We love you deji
“Spread awareness” more like spread your pockets and flush them with cash.. god Damn your thirsty
14:15 your welcome
WHY AM I CRYING, AHHHHHHH
I feel bad keemstar just shits on this guy and gives hate just leave him alone
2 cam angles wtf
This is making me cry 😭
Much love Deji 🖤 keep your head up! It’s huge to open up on one of the biggest social platforms in the world where anyone can see and judge you. This is down to earth man. Keep doing you! Love will attract all positives.
you better be donating all the money from the paid partner ship to charity  other wise this video holds no merrit
Did he do a brand deal for this video?
Hahahahaha hahahahaha what a wet wipe
meanwhile, keemstar KEKW
MAD respect my G
People, it gonna be hard to start drama again. Deji: Actually its gonna be super easy barely an   inconvenience
Wholesome💗brudda to brudda
Me: can we go meet Deji Mom: me have Deji at home 3:44
For the love of god don’t fuc it from here
15:14 nothing, the world is fake and its all a lie
Lmao deji actually made this an ad 😂😂
“Only one person who likes this will one day be a billionaire” “Good Luck” 🍀..
If you haven’t watched the videos exposing deji then don’t comment, he does this every time and gets away with it because people have too much sympathy. This guy is such a scumbag even in an apology he try’s to shift the blame to his “ bad influencing “ mates. Don’t sympathise with him just cause he’s talking about mental health and apologising. Honestly your a sad excuse of a human if you defend this guy
7:45
I bet Keemstar is going to have something hateful to say after this.
look forward and push through, people can laugh now but actions speak louder than words, trust me.
He's done this because his views are going down and he has nothing else lol.. this has already been squashed and he's already said sorry lol. He's not said anything here that's not already obvious 😂
keemstar is such a hater..
i’m not crying u are
wow... this is just a big giant brand deal
AD AD AD AD
Oh I was thinking no but November:)
WE LOVE YOU DEJI! 🖤🤍
Bruh I know damn well theres gonna be memes of him crying, I just know it.
Don't respond to keemstar at this point it's whatever.
of course keemstar is trying to twist this into something bad
Damn
Good video...but a bucket hat inside is not acceptable
didnt this dude sub bot lmao
This is how many people hate Keemstar    ⤵️
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ah shit here we go again
Respect to deji for this one✊
This is an ad
Dude Keem tried to make this out as a bad thing. Fuck Keem.
ANYONE NOTICE THE ADD-
Respect!
i cried watchin this shit we here 4 u dej
Y'all gotta respect Deji
Can someone tell me who is TJ?
And he’s still getting hate for this... people always come after this guy like it’s their job or something (lookin at u keemstar)
If the dislikes get to 5k imma kms cause yall dont appreciate the AD
Juan
want to get more views? just cry like a little bitch and say “i dont wanna cry”
Another crying meme onw🤦‍♂️
Deji does seem mature here. I mean I'm not for the crying part lol but otherwise he seems wiser. That's good
He put all of u under a ✨Genjutsu✨
Love you my guy!   (:
3:44 what a glow up!
Good on you deji, takes a man to do this!
And you are getting paid to do this while you have monetization on... 🤦‍♂️
Surround yourself with people who make you happy. People who make you laugh, who help you when you're in need. People who genuinely care. They are the ones worth keeping in your life. Everyone else is just passing through.  Karl Marx  P.s take care Deji I hope you have a great rest of your week, and you have a wonderful Christmas surrounded by your family.
It’s gonna be ok
*Deji speaking about his problem,and promoting a good cause.* Keemstar: We don't do that here bud.
GET THAT BAG ..................if you know you know
I started getting sad when he was crying  Almost made me cry 😢
Bruh just stop fucking up everyday lmao
love you dej
This nigga does a brand deal in his apology 🤣🤣
At the end of the day, the honesty weighs more than the past. All love from here
This man did a brand deal in this type of video  Yikes
I’m so sorry guys...SO LETS TALK ABOUT MOVEMBER
Y’all still watch this money sucking crybaby?
😎
Fuuuucking hell I REALLY cried on this one, love you dej❤
I'm starting to see a pattern...
Starts crying adds piano music, people go watch John swans video, I don't believe shit Deji says he's full of shit.
Imagine being a Deji fan... dude dresses like a grandma
9:03 that forehead tho
Respect
I love how you have the courage to open up
Bruh relly using ads in a apology video
Christmas
Respect
This is awesome Deji!! Well done man, you have lots of courage.
Watching those videos last year it was clear for me to see that you were suffering from an inferiority complex. I’m glad you’ve come to realise this and have admitted it to yourself, and now can pave the way for self growth, respect
This is so emotional 😭😭
For all the people saying "Oh hes doing it for the money he put a ad in a apology video" Think about it hes spreading awareness and it's about opening up to someone hes using himself as an example to open up to actually understand what the video is about and dont get corrupted from keemstar
How many times this guy is gonna do this smh 🤦🏻‍♂️😂😂😂😂
AD video
Don’t listen to keemstar he just loves drama...I mean look at his name😹👎
Respect Deji man stay strong
Is Randy the scumbag?
Pog
an AD on an apology video?
LOOOL wtf
ad?
Why does deji sound smart
This is some deep shit
AD. Somethin tells me you made this video for one purpose..
Ok it’s good that he’s maturing
You know I didn't like deji for how he was acting but this hit me hard this man matured... Big up Deji thank you for this.
Who tf's cutting onions in here?
shit sounds like a powerpoint presentation
Damn that was heartbreaking, you can see how awful he actually feels about it all. It’s good that you’ve had this realisation and you can only grow. Respect to you Deji, I can see you’ve grown up a lot and it’s honestly so good to see, I wish you all the best. Merry Christmas ❤️❤️
But there was no need to do it online could have been better if he did it  in person + it was a sponsored video so REAL!!!
The bond between brothers is a powerful thing. Huge respect to you Deji ❤️
Keemstar just assumes never watches.
Nice words and tears. Now prove you've changed with your actions.
Deji should not have a channel
Hahahaha “AD”
We Are glad you are Okay.
With is sad
I don’t like deji bc of what he did but i respect this apology in my opinion.

Well said Deji, well said
Reddit after it:    😛

11:03 I felt that way too I don’t use a mistake you’re not alone I spent my Oh money to make others happy but really I wasn’t happy I just want to be respected but really I shouldn’t be around those people I understand
Stop cutting those fucking onions
made me cry lowekey
Ad lol
Don’t lie who came from dramaalert
I feel compared to against my friends all the time in people words get to me disrespectful feeling like I wasn’t good enough I know how you feel then look down on and that’s why I don’t have any friends now because at that time they were looking down on me but you have a family deji that love you Family is priceless friends you can place but to be honest you don’t need friends only family
I WILL ALWAYS LOVE DEJI
Hate towards Deji 📉 📉      Respect for Deji 📈📈
Mad Respect to the Boy Deji
This is so fake. Give him a call why you put this shit on the internet
AD

YOUTUBE IS MAKING MONEY 💰  HE MADE MONEY 💰  DO I CARE ❤  I DON'T CARE HE MADE MONEY BECAUSE 😐 ITS NOT LIKE IT WAS A BAD ADD 😐

Balance has been restored
DEJI THANK YOU BEING A MAN IS TAKING RESPONSIBILITY
Thank you Deji you’re brave man, have a nice Christmas Day.
This is the Deji we like to see🔥 man like Deji🔥😁
everyone likes that
How many fake apologies have you made?
This is an example of a changed man.
CROCODILE TEARS...DO NOT TRUST THIS SCAMMING PIECE OF TRASH
Deji already has a ps5 pro!?
Mans flexing his ps5 in the background smh
You dislike your life is goona be hell.
So many ads
Fake AF
the way keemstar treats deji is just sad man, you can clearly see that he is actually sorry and he regrets what he's done, and all keemstar saw in the vid was the collaboration, just sad.
Best apology Video ever
Lmao what do y’all mean he literally got a sponsor in the video
This is really a powerful video. I hope this can be seen as far and wide as possible. The message really resonates Deji. Thank you :)
Fair fucks
You gonna take this video down too? And then monetize it...
Great Story Deji
It's funny how nobody noticed that the only reason he made this video was to get tons of clicks on his new sponsorship. Like, how greedy can someone be to apologize with a brand deal in the SAME VIDEO.
Santa is putting you in the nice list...
MAD respect broski. Have a great Christmas !
🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼❤️❤️❤️
💜
The 2.6 thousand of ppl who dislike this vid I bet didn’t even watch it
666k views seems sus
Here come the memes again
gg bruh gg
Cheers for Deji on this one? He made the apology video a brand deal. What a good guy. Stfu idiot fan base
Are we gonna talk about that fan that looks like a PS5?!
The background music lol
It's so sad so see all of what happened because you wanted views so sad , hope you think before you upload, you kept uploading negative videos just for views the whole of last year and the year before
I've had goosebumps for 15 mins straight deji please keep pushing the email thing like you did at the end every now and again to get people to open up, this is amazing thank you! And merry Christmas dude, first person I've said it to this year because I've been feeling down myself and just not very 'in the mood' for christmas
Are you just making this vid so you get more money
Wow, this gets deep, maybe the dislikes are youngsters who won't understand this kind of personal growth, the realising and the acknowledgement and holding the responsibility makes you so grown up, tbh I can't get over how good this video is!!!!!
We love u deji
Respect ✊🏼❤️
"ad" this mans made a brand deal in his ad? I see more views more money, makes sense why he made this type of video for it. Sigh.
Honestly i respect deji a lot more for this
It's so refreshing to see/hear this because some of us (ie: me lol) can see straight through it anyway because we've been through similar, finding yourself and acting out based on how you feel about your self, I feel very happy now that I've watched this and that you've made it, I honestly almost cried watching this! Love love love love no other words
Damn, you really thought switching camera angles would make you a professional cinematographer
Deji has been a joke ever since jake beat him up :/
Remember when he faked covid smh
Goodjob deji seriously goodjob
I'm 30 seconds in and wondering why the HELL there are dislikes!!! WELL DONE DEJI THE WORLD NEEDS THIS!!!!! SENDING MUCH LOVE YOURS AND YOUR FAMILIES WAY!
Damn crying in front of the camera takes something
so you did this for the ad huh 😂😂😂😂😂 get yo bread up ig
Brand deal lol
I’m not crying it’s raining
7:43 DEJI START CRYING
Why is there a ad in this video
Damn that takes some balls to stand up and say that. I love you💚
Big respect ❤️
He be like oh time to make money
Wow nice sponsored video

Came here after today’s Drama Alert and the brand deal makes sense. Movember is an appropriate partner with what Deji is doing here. Props to you Deji. Manned up and cleared the air.
I love you deji, you're a legend 🙌
Yeah I was not expecting this
You’re the definition of a clown.
Is he still going on about this ffs
Really an Ad in your apology video
Everyone: This is maturity! Deji: Places "AD" in top corner and gets paid 50k to "apologize"
You are a fuckin man deji don't let them get in the way of your life.
Im a proud Jake Pauler and I’m happy you opened up Deji! It takes a real man to apologize and own up to there mistakes!
I cried with him, this video just gained back the respect I uad for him a year ago, keep it up we love u
Deji lives in a funeral home
Nice ice cubes
Deji you’re doing this again. You just have to do this in private man!!!
Mans really made this into a ad so he can get money because of the views. He never learns.
Imagine having ad in apology video smh.
This made me cry 😭 with him❤️
Go on !!
Pog
I thought I was emotionless 😫😢
It nice to see this
Deji despite what everyone else thinks we love you!!
my respect for deji keeps sky rocketing
this takes a lot of maturity to do and i’m so proud of deji for being able to post this out to us fans and being comfortable enough to open up about how he feels about these situations. it takes bravery to take responsibility for your actions and you can tell how genuine he is about this. mad respect for deji❤️
Keem weird for tweeting about deji
MAD FCKN RESPECT FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER DEJI!
REDDIT : *yes share the gosspel Boy* your joy will bring laughter to many

Attention. Attention. Attention
❤❤
That was a really emotional 15 minutes ): the brand deal made me in tears
Ok like I can’t stand watch him crying, not because Im a bad person but because I cant stand seeing people cry. But why didn’t he take this more privately? It would’ve been a better outcome lmao
It takes a big man to cry. Respect.
Y is it always on Christmas 🤦🏻‍♂️
i love that even not together we connect to do such things and even for everyone to just be friends is amazing
Yo deji can I get some among us imposter tips?  Deji: 12:32

Big respect for you Deji

We all love you deji and me and your fans have so much respect for you it’s unreal. Keep doing what you are doing and always keep your head up and always keep a smile on that beautiful face of yours. Have an awesome christmas and a happy new year.
If you don’t know he is doing this for money
I nearly cried
I respect your way of maturity Deji and always will. You’re an inspiration and motivation for people to open up and follow their intuitions
Honestly I mess with this video
Deji don’t listen to this shit. We all love and are supportive of you.
Respect To Deji❤👊
Idk why keep made it seem bad
brand deal lol
Deji do omegle plss
And of course keemstar has to find a way that deji actually is lying and he thinks it's an apology video when it's not it's a brand deal and it's about opening up and talking about personal issues and that's what deji is doing I dont know why keemstar always finds away to bully deji in every video
My respect 📈📈📈
You probably got an a* in English
take a shot everytime he says “i’m really sorry”
3:05 is what u came for
Who here from drama alert?
Respect!
damn.. when he cried i cried
AD lol
❤❤
I’m still trying to open up but I find it rlly hard and I just don’t know how to
Respect to deji man he's been going through it.
sponsorship
What the hell are these random camera angles
it’s comedy shourts gama hea
How the fuck does Keem find something bad about this vid he just ducking doesn’t like you for nothing
Maybe he should do more behind the scenes before going on YouTube apparently trying to fix the relationship when in reality its for views, as dumb as he is IF he’s being genuine here I feel pity we all make mistakes but saying I shouldn’t have let those people get to me, it’s your fault not then
Stfu
Total respect man. I feel you and you are not alone in your struggles
Biggest idiot on YouTube !!! This guy done sponsors vid to get money from a fake apology video 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This has shown a different side of him 👏
somethings definitely happened again!
People only care that theirs an ad in the video because of keemstar, you guys really need to ask yourself "Do I care?"
Deji I love so fucking much u are humble calm loving and also smart for provided u with a good life and good family and friends around you and I hope u have a wonderful Christmas
Its so fucking annoying how keem is trying to destroy Deji with info nobody gives a shit about
One word: Inspiration
whos here after the video keem did on deji..?
RESPECT!!!  ✊
Alright I don't wanna hear any meems or jokes or any of that nature there is a time and a place for everything. Big respect for Deji getting this message out.
Ad..,
CROCODILE TEARS
Shiiit I thought you were gonna come out the closet meaning you becoming gay
Well done Deji, ignore the likes of that fat American YouTubers who discusses YouTube news and is apparently “reliable”
Ad
Mannnnnn,Deji judged changed my life I was surrounding my self wit negative people thx Deji Much respect
Lol everyone in the comment section is blind to why he's actually doing this, go watch Keemstar's video.
Deji: Cries and talks about mental health and regret Keemstar: AND IN THE NEWSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS, DEJI SOCIOPATH??????????
Respect to this man, All love Dej
Damn was this a tear-jerker
Respect❤️
We all love you dej 👑
Respect 🙌🏾 I even had tears Ngl ❤️
How can anyone hate on this man and his hairline
LMAO MAN DID A BRAND DEAL IN THIS AHAHHAHA
Jesus this brought tears to my eyes
I don't understand why Keem keeps attacking Deji on his vids.....🤷‍♂️
Don’t mind me just looking at the comments and seeing all the people getting manipulated by deji
This is actually such an amazing thing to do. The genuine opening up encourages others to. It's an inspiration to those of us who are struggling. Massive respect!
I hope this is legit n not just for the ad
The poop
He sounds like his parents are pointing a gun at him
Deji can you please give Keemstar hell I just watched his vid and it pissed me off and he took this whole video out of context
Beautiful video Deji. Ignore what people like Keemstar say about it. This inspires a lot of people and we really need that, thank you <3.
Hope you have a nice Christmas
He should of just did this privately.
ok
Deji  I’m proud of you for opening up to us we love this inspired me to open up to my family and not locking myself in my room and not talking to my family  and respect brah💖
Happy Holidays Deji, you now have my respect
I've obviously been out of touch about Movember....heres me thinking Deji was going to talk about his experience with testicular cancer. Guess Movember is more inclusive now so its all about feelings?!
Big respect 🙌🙌
Ey yo. I got pissed with you during all the drama but in all honesty this takes courage to open up. Respect and power to you Honestly . So much respect for this . Stay strong king have a good Christmas
💜
I don't know why I'm crying
15:13
Ok the music on this video when you were crying is such a bad choice. and the different camera angels. I almost cryed when it was normal but then it started doing all of the camera angels and the music and I just started laughing.
This is so nice watch. Big up Deji ❤ respect you alot
U again?
Good vid but there is an ad
Well if you are depressed consider why that is.  Are you surrounded by assholes if so distancing yourself might be a good solution.
This an amazing video. The fact that you were able to open up and be honest with your family, friends, and fans, and to talk about something that’s super important, mental health. It shows a lot about you as a person Deji. Mad Respect✊🏻
It takes so much bravery for a man to do this! You’re a shining example to all of us. Forget the past. Be better than yesterday. Be the best that you are, because you are enough!
You put a ad on this video 🤔🤔🤔💀
Just big respect for you my man! Have a nice Christmas with your family.
who else thought he was gonna say he was gay
Another day another deji upload of him crying  I think maybe this is the one deji fully accepts what he has caused and I click on the video and it’s a BRANDEAL a BRANDEAL   Wow
Lol fake
Clown I would belive it but this is not the first time
This is an AD?
Ok deji I’m sorry but this feels really scripted if you were to open up I think it should feel more natural
RESPECT!
Too bad Keem has to find anyway to turn any vid deji does into him being a shitty person and doing it for his personal agenda.
People need to grow up a bit and stop disliking this video, regardless of what you think of him previously, this video is very important and perfect
Deji you are a strong human being to be able to make this video!!! much love
hey man all respect, brand deal is a bit dodgy.
I’m from the future, and keemstar found a way to dislike ur video. Just saying
“AD”
why you doing this for views and money
.
This must’ve take some serious strength, respect to Deji ❤️
Guys no memes please
Literally a brand deal with a charity and people are getting mad are you guys serious
nice ad
No offense but he flipped the switch to crying mode it almost feels it's fake that was a full 180°
This video should he shown in schools as a lesson in life that family should be the number 1 priority
Tbh other than the ad this was a great vid
I saw the title and was like ahh shit here we go again but no good content ❤️
Respect
We love you deji
Don't even send hate to deji for this it's obviously not about the brand deal he's just spreading awareness with them for this reason, keep it real deji 🙌
Fair play man the bollocks as a man in this day and age to open up like this is mad
big up deji still, we all love you <3 and so does JJ, he loves you 3000 times more than we do...
holy shit, i cried when he started saying sorry :L
have a good christmas deji u good
ANDD IN THE NEWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWSs
I don’t even see the ad a big deal. he’s literally opening up about mental health .... you can’t fake that shit.
Mad respect deji
I feel for you man
Big love ❤️
Keem is a douche
lmao
Damn I never cry and man's crying
Wow. I’m speechless. Respect Deji ❤️
I never thought that I actually needed this video
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Mad respect Deji, love you man
Deji you can’t do one thing right, nice ads... go back to botting kid
And keem takes this out of context
Happy for everyone involved here. Including myself
Much respect, merry Christmas
Do whatever you need to do for the views I guess
This man put an AD in an apology video lmaoooo
Omg keemstar is still hating just cuz deji put a brand deal in this😂 honestly screw keemstar
Much respect to my boy Deji, hope you have a great X-mas‼️💪🏾
I’m not crying I swear 😭
if some asshole memes this they get EXTREME hate. which in an odd way thats good.
I'm still supriesed you can't manage to talk about your and others personal life in private
Regardless he had a ad or whatever he did the right thing to apologize good guy deji love ya man ♥️♥️
Fake crying

Here comes the keem fan boys
So, This shit's an AD?
AD
Deji got the ps5 in the back stop flexing  Also respect
Lux started a movement. Big man. Thanks deji. Your cadence of talking is a bit peak though
I want to give you a hug man😔!
Respect
Ad
Fair play, I can now watch deji vids again after this
Respect apology , pisses me off that you put a ad in a apology video
Crazy how keem star is still trying to bring deji down and make a different perspective on what he’s actually talking about
Respect
Nice ad
Goddamn Deji 😓😦 You're a real man..and we..the fans...love you
Deji Very inspirational👏🏾👏🏾
AD
Why did you put a brand deal in this video where you are apologising that’s fucked up
Dam deji i cried with you 😭
Respect ✊🏽
Why were you paid to do this...?
Respect ✊🏽
Respect ✊🏽Deji is the real man
"Opening up myself" 😏
you’ve earned my sub, have a good christmas legend
Where is the apology to Randy and the side men. If this video is about making everything right this would have been the best opportunity for it.
why is this a AD
Keem star needs to back of sometimes tbh
Well done deji
it pains me how long it took him to do this shit, and why does it have ads and a brand deal.
Respect for deji 📈📈📈
You're a joke. Doing this video for money.
Daamn i feel like dejis been 23 for a good 9 years
Holy shit. This put the fattest smile on my face. Good stuff man
mate keem spreding shit about u probs wanna check it out
Most my life when I hang around a large group of friends but I still feel like I’m all alone
Respect man, take care!
I guess Keemstar misleaded me. You have my respect 👊
whats with this editing thought it’s a apology man
This shit made me cry
AD
Big respect ✊🏿
You have our respect deji
Keemstar made it seem bad . This isn't bad, he's promoting the Brand by opening up.
why is say ad ?
Respect to deji for apologizing, but I can see why people are mad at the idea of putting ads in apology video, personally I think people are over reacting tho.
I dont like seeing deji sad
keemstar is such an idiot its mad
The fact that theres a ad in this
12:36 The impostor after killing me
Legit came here after keemstar
Don’t listen to keemstar he is just a big gnome boi
2021 better be good.
Bruh
BRAND DEAL OH OH!?
When he said “ I’m really sorry” I could make a song outta that shii
"Ad"
Lowkey made me cry init but deji we all make mistakes even big ones
👊🏽👊🏽✊🏾
Bruh there is ads on this apology  lol
Thats what she said
Ad...
People are so fooled by emotions, but here's some points - 1) This is not even a live video, scripted, edited probably multiple times and with ads. 2) Took him 2 years. 3) These things are family problems, there's zero need to talk about this in a *scripted* video, saying I am deleting this and that when all that was needed is a private talk and just delete the videos. Yeah call me pessimistic, but these points makes it look pretty fake and also what he has done in the past. One positive thing out of all the negatives are that there are some good takeways.
Dis shit made my cry man 😂
AD lol
Why did you put the Ad deji,why!?
Beautiful ❤️
AD in an apology video GREAT according to other YouTubers who got sponsored by this company the more views you get the more money you get.  An apology video usually racks up views. Wich is more money for him
Well done fam
Here after keem exposed him
Did he put ads on a apology video 🙄
I’ve had the maddest respect for this man, Deji I have a next level of respect for you man keep your head high❤️
His lips are HUGE
Imagine putting a brand deal in your apology video LMAO
fucking ads and brand deal in an apology video and no one notices lmao, that's gangsta
I hate seeing people cry man. It gets me every time.. It takes a lot of courage and self awareness to acknowledge your wrongs. I wish you and your family the best and brightest future
Respect deji man
I love the idea of the video and the message you are giving but deji, you look like you are reading off a teleprompter, I would had love to see it come from the heart and make it look like you really mean it
dont worry deji I watched you both grow up and I'm really proud of u man
Damn deji really do be doing sponsored apologies🤣
I hate how many cuts there are from front to side camera just to make it look professional
Scripted but understandable ?
Crocodile Tears.
Good shit deji
Anyone else come here from keems video
AD
This was what was needed the whole time. It took time but he got there and he did it himself. Big love Deji wish you all the best man
I know keemstar dumb sub are finna come here and dislike because of the nasty thing keem said in ur video deji don’t listen to keem your a good man
i shet a tear man omg..
You are a king Deji 👑
I almost cried man. Much love!
Shit video
Keemstar is such a prick
This ain’t nothing to do with anything , but deji I want u to box slim and beat his ass - u done great with this vid , want even better for u to get a win on ur chest
This is the first time watching deji where i feel like im listening to an adult
Drama alert is a Karen you apologize end of story
Clout is a disease.
Deji slaps a brand deal on the apology vid  The brand: Stonks
Keemstar is a fkn disgusting man tbh
MEME TIME
Why has he made this video with a brand deal?
Like the PS5 in the background
Bruh how many apologies is this man gonna make?
Where’s the script
I swear if anyone makes a meme out of him crying ur all going to hell                     Respect to deji
I dead ass fucking cried FUCK!!!!! AND HAVN'T CRIED OVER 3 YEARS FUCK!!!!!!! good video man
Siblings fight at the end of the day but it is a  a bond that can never be broken
Pls don't make it a meme
Man puts a brand deal in his apology with 3 mid roll ads. Talk about milking a situation
Deji we're so proud of you, God bless your kind soul! It's ok we're all humans, we make mistakes BUT the only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing. You, Deji, did learn and look at how things turned up! Well done man!!! You're doing amazing, I'm so happy for you, I'm crying😂💙Love youu!!!!!
12:37 when you kill someone in among us
POSH
Anyone just wanted to give him a hug
BRAND  DEAL LMAO
Yeah do a brand deal on an apology video
Deji makes an apology vid for the 5th time Also Deji: making money off these apology videos by sponsors
I respect this
Love never dies between brothers ✊😭
Keem is already attacking deji
Respect

Well keemstar is attacking deji again not surprised 🙄
Keem star shitting on this vid 😂
YouTube made me miss this notification that's so sad I
❤️
I unsubbed to him a few days before he posted this. He got a lifetime sub now.
Yes
Love you Deji, mad respect 🙏🏻🙏🏻❤️🖤
Man this is so f-ing sad. :'(
Imagine being alive
I feel for Deji
Felt the camera angle from the side was kind of unnecessary
I have been raised my life and taught that "men shouldn't cry" things like that even to this day i am 16 and i hold in way too many emotions I feel like its the wrong thing to do and I think it's time I open up too someone too now. I really hope everyone can aswell.
You came to my dog, you stroked him, and you do this?
Deji Is A Real Man ❤️
RESPECT it takes a lot for a man to open up and know when they are wrong congrats man you are the good definition of a human☺️👏🏽
Respekt deji bros4life
Respect
Respect man. Happy Christmas 🎄 💓
Thank u for taking full responsibility deji I'm going to follow u back on YouTube, Instagram and Twitter
Overdue apology but respect
Massive respect deji it takes a lot of bottle to do this video ❤️
Lets go Deji
RESPECT ✊🏼
respect. 👊
bruh I cried     no cap
I admit I’m not a perfect person I hang around with some people who aren’t nice.But recently I’ve been thinking that I shouldn’t be like this I’m a good human inside and I’m opening up and trying to follow the gods paths of gods footsteps.Thet vid must be hard gl to u and ur family hope  for the best ❤️
I know he’s talking about clout gang
😥💙
this seems bare scripted snd low key fake
My respect for deji 📈
Men don't cry because they are weak. Men cry because they've been strong for far too long.
very good
God bless you for letting this out .... this is a big example to us
Huge respect ❤️❤️
Anyone who put a hate comment is stupid because this video is amazing mad love to u deji 🙌🏻❤️
We all respect you Deji <3 <3
deji should go surprise him for christmas and appear on his front door
I really needed this right now thanks for the advise aswell
I- im not crying my room is just full of onions
We’re here for you dej been there since day one
LMFAO
This is the Deji Ik and love ❤️
Wait y ur vids have like 30 comments
The worst thing you could do to yourself is hold in the pain I already had respect for Deji. I have a question for you, will you learn from this video and realise that even a man who is considered famous, can feel pain and can open up? Also being a man or a boy is even harder to cope with depression, as you are trapped with this idea that you must be strong and bold. I want you to know that this is rubbish and stupid. The strong man can lift weights but the strongest man seek help.
That takes guts to so what you said. Huge respect for you man and hope you have a great Christmas
💪🏾🥺
You did this for the money
About time he matured. Only took him exploiting family drama and then it blowing up in his face to realise it. 🤐
Damn respect
You have done a lot of good here and this is a great first step to redemption. There are still steps you need to take like paying Kavos back for his legal fees and apologizing to your neighbor and making amends for the dog biting incident.
Me: dam im about to cry  Ad: fuck u pussy
Dam im about to cry
We need to cancel Keemstar ASAP
BIG RESPECT!!!
<3
Wow as you can see we all are humans and we have feelings. Deji I had the same situation and is good again. RESPECT ✊🏾
I lost so much respect for him doing the things he did because I have have been in a similar situation but the fact that he has recognized it and is changing gives me a lot of hope and respect, mad props.
Much respect Deji. I hope this helps other people open up.
I was a little bit afraid, seeing the title, but i was wrong. Great vid, great message
Deji this was an amazing video but please don't fuck up again, there have been many times where we all think you have changed but you went back to your old ways. I think we are all putting trust in you that you have changed into a better person
This is a great first step and a beginning of a new chapter. Keep it up and enjoy ur holidays.
Hold your crown up king, we all appreciate you opening up and we all forgive you
Aight i cant complain, big ups dej
BIG UP MY GUY DEJI
Big up man very heartfelt and true and so glad you two have sorted it out. Good on you Deji ❤️❤️❤️❤️
BIG RESPECT TO DEJI FOR OPENING UP !! IT TAKES REAL GUTS TO DO THIS!!
Respect man 🙏🏿🙏🏿
WE LOVE YOU DEJU
Good job Deji, mad respect fam.
Cue True Geordie and Lawrence to make a passive aggressive reaction video mocking Deji for this... Big love Deji good video mate!
Maaaaaan this hit real deep
This is the deji we all love. Respect ❤️🙌🏽
You can tell he's not faking
Big up deji 🙌
I can't really do it on camera. But the only thing that's upsetting me and the reason why I have depression is because of my financial situation. It's very hard to keep it up. I want it to go away. But can't. I tried doing it on camera but it's difficult. I know I'm supposed to. But I have nobody to talk to besides my family. I told my family about it but they keep saying it'll get better but it's not. And I have no hope for what's to come. But you deji. Help me go through it. I've played piano all my life and now I have no access to one, my old one it's gone, and I went homeless. And now we have a place I can barely pay for. I just want all of my problems to go away.      And please don't hate. I hate hate :(
Thx to you Deji I have courage to open up
I’m so fucking happy that no one is horrible in these comments :)
Man this got me tearing up
How did this video get dislikes it’s literally a video to help with mental health
Big respect ✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾
my volume button throughout the whole vid: ⬆️⬇️⬆️⬇️⬆️⬇️⬆️⬇️⬆️⬇️
Damn. I am feeling this😭
Respect for putting this on the internet most YouTubers would cut as soon as a tear trickles down, and then immediately pop up with small tear marks, you are gonna get memed, but this will help some
U are a real man Deji ! Takes a real man to say what you did, RESPECT.
One of the worse youtubers
The opening up segment is really important a lot of people I hope eventually learn through experience, but with this platform there’s many people lurking around who don’t. Very important sharing these things, so they can learn through your experience
Big respect Deji❤️ real men show their feelings 💪❤️
2020 has been the best year ever! Seriously it's been fire! How boring was life until all this? It's been a great year, I'll miss it like crazy

I watched your videos back in the day then i was not happy with what happened. I'm a believer of that people can change so I think this was a good start. Respect for these words!
One doesn't own emotion, and when one is owned by emotion, it's a reflection of one's belief that one owns them♥️
gay guy
We love u deji ❤️💙

Through collective memories, through evolution the past to the present, we have arrived at this present stage of human evolution. Do we go along the same path, accumulating memories not only in the technological world but also in the psychological area?

My neighbour cut onions throughout the entire video, god dammit, fuck that guy
Deji, this video is cool but what will you do about the kavos situation
It takes a sponsor to open up? Interesting
Fair shout
Well.. Deji crying meme is back I guess, at least that's a positive thing.. Respect for Deji for making this vid but still I think this should have been a personal conversation between their family..
good job deji❤️ we love you

Dam straight
whenever deji opens up about his feelings people turn it into a meme.. and people wonder why men never talk about their feelings...
i feel bad now
Yooo if people make fun of this then they are a scuffed human being
Stop reading of auto cue cards you mong 🤣🤣
For this you get my subscription back.RESPECT👍
I have a feeling this man is bullshiting
What a wanker
The last time I saw you you got your butt kicked by jake paul
To everyone watching this video: Please, please, PLEASE don't make any memes about Deji crying again.
I haven’t watch this video yet but let’s see what this guy has to open up about I’m very very curious now especially with the title the video And the caption picture of him crying well ladies and gentlemen let’s see
Haters in the comments just stfu and appreciate the growth he went through. Sometimes he's been an idiot and done dumb stuff but he's acknowledged it. Let's see how well he does now instead of patronizing him.
Remember when jake Paul beat u up? 😂
what a great guy
wow amazing vid
Your struggle is getting 1 million likes.
Nothing but respect Deji ❤️💪🏼
This was really boring. He’s only doing this for clout
Deji you are a legend you need to call him and talk about it
Have A Very Merry Christmas Deji!!! You Are So Strong And Inspirational, I'm Proud. 🙏🏼❤.
It takes hugamous testicles to do this, respect to deji
It takes massive balls to this
Time to meme this😂
Nice ps5 in the back
And of course Keemstar is twisting the meaning of this video, just sad
Deji huge respect for u for admitting about ur actions , enjoy Christmas my guy
When you're young you do stupid things but when you're mature you look back and take accountability. Glad Deji is maturing.
i saw "its time to come out" and I immediately tapped
There better not be any memes.
Deji killed Tank
If you have changed don't fookin brag about it, just show it
Mad Respect
making the whole nation cry.. hope you're good
When he started crying I can’t explain how I felt. This actually shows that both brothers love each other to bits
Here we go again, make all the worst mistakes then apologize and cry about it then become the "good guy"
We Love You Deji
Deji is so sorry man, let’s give him some respect
This is the Deji we've all known and loved. Never seen this type of video before man, props.

aye yo i totally didn't start tearing up...
Very difficult to own up like this, but wouldn’t it make more sense to just day this privately. I don’t see the reason to make this a youtube video, but maybe that’s just me. Anyway respect for you man
Its always one video like this with you every month, shut the hell up already
Anyone who doesn’t give Deji a sub after this is a dumb idiot. Deji deserves a lot of praise for having the courage to put this video on the internet. This is so motivational. This is how many people are proud of you for finding the courage 👇
❤️Love and respect man ❤️
Why is the fan in the background look like the ps5 lol
Nearly 2k people disliking this video. Do these people have a heart
When he said he was opening up I thought he was gonna say he was gay 🤣😂

This is a real man no 🧢 much respect
Respect man it’s hard to show your emotions well done 👑
Big respect
takes a man to admit his mistakes. respect for deji. ✊🏾
thank you for this deji i really needed it
Deji is truley sorry it was bringing tears to his eyes from his remorse
Dayyym mans just finished school. And I getting emotional while eating my chicken
Damn this is making me cry
This is alot like the Ragnar and Rollo situation from Vikings. Rollo is my favorite character

It’s weird seeing deji acting serious   It’s a great thing he’s spreading awareness 🙏🏻🙏🏻

Respect +1,000,00
This video doesn’t deserve dislikes at all.
Legend, this video is such an eye opener,message to everyone talk to your family , they the ones who there for you the most, this video is raw, love you dej
Respect man. Heads up! what happened in the past is in the past 👍🏽
Good on Deji for this, however I would have liked him to take more personal responsibility for his actions rather than emphasizing the people who were around. At the end of the day they were his choices
Respect and praise for this guy - putting this out for everyone to see how he feels and owning his mistakes, he’s come so far and deserves his success
Well done deji I can tell you have matured so much and your dealing with your past the right way. All’s you can do is move forward now and have a great life. I’ve realised soo much in the lockdown about the mistakes I was making in the past three years too. I feel guilt and pain but I’ve matured just as you have and I’m moving forward now
Bet keemstar is sad he can't make no more deji videos👊👊
My respect for this man has rocketed up... amazing deji...keep up the good work
Like what. Why are there always people disliking videos like these like it actually has meaning
Respect levels just grew after this!
deji pls continue your life i wish the best for you
Shush u crybaby
Made me tear up a little, remember we will always love you and respect you no matter what. I hope that you and your family have a nice Christmas. 🥺❤️👍
“Venting is something that you need to do”   Impostors: 😏

Respect man
Damn. Respect to Deji man
It takes bravery to open up about this. Have a happy Christmas Deji
It takes bravery to open up about this. Have a happy Christmas Deji
LET'S GO DEJI!
Respect 2 u deji
ITS ALRIGHTQ
Respect man
Deji, treasure every single thing you value and love in your life. It can be taken away in an instant and some people are blessed with a good family. I don't talk to mine due to an abusive childhood, being badly bullied through high-school  and regardless of telling my parents they did nothing about it. So now I've a few mental illnesses, social phobia, agoraphobia and severe anxiety disorder. I haven't been able to leave home for years. I hide away and everyday is a struggle. I lost all my friends and have no family to support me. So this is why when you have something worth holding on to like you have don't let it go
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Deji I'm no fan of yours and I'm not going to pretend to be. But credit where its due for actually owning up to your mistakes. Takes a real man to stand up and admit their own mistakes 👏🏻
Much respect deji. Hope you have an amazing chrismas with your family much love my dude!!😄😄
I love this guy
Massive respect Deji thank you for opening to everyone you the 🐐🐐
WHAT A WHOLESOME VIDEO 😻😻
Big up Deji. Respect. At the end of the day brothers fight. Glad u opened up. ❤️❤️❤️❤️

Dont blame yourself already deji. You’re all fine, everythings going to be fine. There is always a reason behind the issue. We are here for you man cheer up!✊
You made me cry, this is so SAD to see but at least you still young and have your lives ahead of you. I hope both of you will be even stronger from this as I’m sure he will understand you and can truly forgive you. All the best to your family 😢
Well Done Deji! Uhave definitlely have matured and have owned up to your mistake. RESPECT!!!!
We forgive you man
Shit, when Deji broke down. I literally have tears in my eyes. I read the comments. Tried to prepare myself not to cry while cleaning kitchen tables and chairs that have dusts, but damn. That got me.
Ngl I kinda teared up a bit
"Being yourself is what being cool is" So many people needed to hear this...
Awww

AD.... says it all
Nothing says heartfelt apology like a sponsored video riddled with midrolls.
Deji talking about november  the rest: so its finally time
Anything for views hey Deji your channel dying again
Big respect deji love ur content mate absolute legend for talking about this stuff that takes guts mad respect merry Christmas and a happy new year and I hope 2021 will bring u guys great things
If yall meme this then I've lost faith in humanity
transparent? did you cheat on your wife?
Good on ya Deji, you made the right choice.
Idk why people dislike this video
Very well spoken, nice one dej💯
As wholesome as this is, this should've been given personally, not posted on youtube
Neek.
❤️
Huge respect to you Deji, happy holidays!
RESPECT.
Mad respect
damn he literally made me cry
Only if i had known that id burst into tears in this video
i aint goona lie i cried with him. RESPECT to my guy
Deji in doing this you are just becoming more of a man
*memes incoming*
Should you take money for promoting mental health charities.
Man it's December 😔
15:04 probably what he meant with him losing weight
Deji's vocabulary📈📈📈📈
I don’t see what was the point of this
RESPECT to you for this man...Best video ever🙌
Dang. Respect man 👍❤ Merry Christmas 🎄🎁
You suck deji
HUGE RESPECT DEJI! this couldn't have been easy. But I’m still making a meme of you crying
Look at those views
I have a lot of respect for Deji
Respect Deji !
SEND SHOTS TO THE CLOUT HOUSE AND FAZE CLAN.ITS LIT.
realest apology video ive ever seen, respect
my respect for you is so much higher now. well done mate.
Respect 👏🏻
Who ever likes this comment lives deji
RESPECT
If anyone does call out Deji for faking this video for views, you must be an utter fool to say those tears are fake..
I swear if I see this become a meme, imma be pissed
Why does Deji sounds like a news reporter?
Thank you Deji, thank you for opening up to us, thank you for growing up with us, thank you for the wise words. Look forward to seeing you grow even more these upcoming years
who is cutting onions
This is why you dont judge a book by its cover you never know whats happening in the inside. RESPECT!!!!!!
Yo big up man, Deji! Respect, mate. It's great to see this, bruv.
It’s difficult to watch Deji genuinely crying. All love here Dej❤️
Isnt this the 3rd apology?
Respect.
Y’all better not make a meme about this
I generally cringe at apology videos but this one felt different...
Anyone who makes a meme about this shouldn’t deserve the internet.
We love u deji✊🏽
L
Why did you initially title the video “it’s time to come out”? Clickbaiting you coming out of the closet isn’t exactly tasteful if this video actually means something to you. A lot of people struggle to come out so please don’t play on it for views
Respect 🙌 my boddy
RESPECT!
I love this guy.
U and callux made some nice vids
Respect to you <3
cap
People are gonna make memes about this again and that is shitty as hell
BIG RESPECT!
GUYs respect to Deji
Anyone reading comments while he was crying? So you won't cry with him? Same
To clarify, transparency is not the same thing as honesty. Respect to Deji for making this video (despite probably being paid to).
This guy is a man child always crying on his vids
Mad respect, this takes balls man. Keep growing and maturing as a human being. We all love you and are proud of you❤️❤️❤️❤️
Big man right here!! <3
PLEASE.....Do not make this a meme.
I thought he was gonna say he gay
You changed now and forget about it
ngl I got emotional watching this, also please check out my beats on my youtube channel I have a big dream to become a music producer.
Respect!!!!! ✊🏾
1500 dislikes...smh
Deji I’m happy you owned up to all the mistakes and no one is perfect so good on you man
I have a lot of anxiety and panic attacks aswell as severe ocd. I wanna get help but i feel like if i explain my thoughts to someone i will scare them and thats why i dont open up.
Damn

Respect.
It feels like he’s reading off a script not gonna lie, it’s throwing me off.
Your best video yet Deji. I hope you guys are bless.
I’ve liked this video but I have an idea on why people dislike the video. There are probably some people who just genuinely dislike the video. I think there’s a portion of people who dislike, not because of the video but because they don’t like seeing Deji cry. That’s just an idea. Nevertheless, Deji we support you always ❤️
Deji is one of the strongest people i know
😂😂😂😂
Y’all switched up real quick. This kid is fake af
It's gonna be fine

Legend
The fact that he is apologizing on camera and not in person makes me feel that these 2 still don’t have a good relationship.
I want to take the piss but I just can’t...
Gay bru 69

RESPECT FOR DEJI💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟😊😊😊
Deji’s motivational lines hit me hard. I felt that!!
@ksiolagidebthdv2
first I thought he's coming out as gay
Feels like I’m part of the family ... I’m getting emotional
Respect to the Deji olatun
If someone puts the crying moment in a reddit or somewhere else as a meme, I will be really dissapointed and angry. Deji, you have grown up! Love you, respect! Sorry, if I spelled somethingwrong, I dont speak English.
Deji man that hit me so hard but I have immense respect for you mate. Doing a video by yourself, explaining all the horrible situations you have been through and seeing how much it affected you and your family. You have such strong character and are a top bloke who I respect and look forward to your content all the time. Massive respect to all the olatunjis !!!!
Just opened up my present And deji is the gift 🖤
Let's be honest, we all cried 🥺 Have an amazing christmas Deji
We all are human we do we did we will do mistakes
Cry’s about how sorry he is instead of yet again working this out in private. Jesus you really are a horrible person.
Big up,  Seeing him cry made me cry a little bit.  Mad Respect
YES YES FINALY
Just enough to make a man cry
thank god my parents didn't lose there jobs and i'm so so proud my dad works home but my mom works outside so she put a paper saying wear a mask and she sits away from ppl and i don't go to school i study from home my mom and dad study me and teach me thing and i'm happy and i hope 2021 will be better

Damn the ps5 really is big
I’ll never understand the mentality of the people who decide to dislike a video like this.
Most people don't have the courage to do this. Nothing but RESPECT.
Fakiest person on youtube!!! (Probably my comment will get deleted)
<3
Love you Deji....supporting you all the way

Honesty is beautiful in itself, your words were pure and I pray to God no one takes advantage of you allowing yourself to be vulnerable. Takes a true man to make a video like this. Nothing but respect for you dej.
WE LOVE YOU DEJI💙 it takes a tough man to open up like that and we appreciate you doing that🙂
Everybody makes mistakes fam, I even dumped bitch ass comments on your videos, we can just move on from what we said, the only person we can compare to is the person that we were yesterday, get better fam! And the fact that u opened up bout this shit can make a better future for the community. See u in the next vid comedyshortsgamer💪🏽🔥😎
Respect to deji for doing this  It would be amazing if they can make a vid together
Cancel kemmstar if he bully’s deji
But why monetize this
Big respect. It’s hard to admit that you made a mistake. Good stuff Deji
This shouldn't have any dislikes
John Swan editing style is a banger

Good🔥👍
🥺🥺🥺🥺
First time saw him cry...but he is a great guy
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I like how the comments are all positive and the Twitter comments are all toxic. It's a quite a stark contrast lol.
RESPECT. Big up Deji for this
Oh yeah yeah
It takes real guts to do this, it sucks that keem is talking shit. He doesn’t know what you’ve been through to own up like this. Keep your head up deji, we all love you.
Ain’t tryna hate but why he putting this all on the internet
love you Deji, so much respect ❤️
how can 1.2K people DISLIKE this video
Yoh him saying sorry multiple time and actually mean it actually hit my heart and made me cry😔 DEJI U THE BEST
itd be fucked up theres memes on this
i never thought i would cry for a youtube video
lol
Respect my g 💯
PLEASE do not make this a meme. I understood deji so heard i also started crying because it's so understandable and I have been through this kind of pain where you want to show someone you love them and they don't know how much you love them. So please don't make this a meme.
Deji is a REAL man,respect
Why you have to make me cry but respect 🙌
I always respect deji and i will still respect him i was crying
The title should be it’s time to get a quick million views
awwww🖤
Respect Deji I hope you and the family have the best Christmas 🌲
imagine disliking this video
it’s hard to form such a strong brotherhood like theirs
Big respect.
Deji man We are so proud of u
Just saying I know it's hard but you said you wouldn't cry again because a specific  image.
You are a hero, don’t ever let anyone tell you otherwise. ❤️
Deji flexing his PS5 in the back
I am not upset that I cried when he broke down
Big up Deji
deji you’re not only a great youtuber, but you’re a great person at heart, and honestly this video is very inspiring knowing im someone who doesn’t express my emotions very much. we’ll always be there for you thru thick and thin, keep being great, keep being inspirational, keep being you 🖤
My man had to change the title
I really hope no one memes this 😔
If someone gonna make any memes of this you should be disappointed of ur self
This is such an important video.
Any one else think the fan was a ps5
what a legend
Imagine the younger sibling being the bigger person 💯
Good man ❤️
Respect. ❤️
❤️
the tone of his voice is one of the most scripted things I've heard
I am sad that this will be a meme
my man can't even set up a proper side camera angle
What’s with these camera angles
‼️
It was nice deji
I’m depressed and feel lonely, I feel like my friends snaked me and now I don’t have any. Can’t be arsed to lay down time on people who ain’t trying to give it to me back. All the psychiatrists in the world can’t fix this since I can’t even open up and tell them that I think about suicide on the regular because then they’ll contact my parents which I don’t want.
This video does not deserve any dislikes
NGL...Almost cried. Love you man, I will support you the best that i can.
This is a tears of sadness not a tears for views, I'm happy his decision now I'm really proud with deji, he's a grown man anyways wish you have a happy Christmas with your family🎄❤️
It isn't easy to show emotions on camera especially for men. Respect
Why does anyone disslike this video?
Ayo anyone makes fun of deji for crying im gonna knock your fucking head in
Now the only thing left is to make some good quality content
Respect
Open up to Jesus! Tell Jesus your feelings he is the one who died for you!
I love Deji and I love what he has done in this video but a bit of me feels like he is doing this for clout or just to make us feel sorry for him almost idk but happy for him thou ❤️❤️
RESPECT
Oh no the feels 😢
Gg
we're proud of you Deji
Deji ur a good human❤️
Why did people dislike? Not judging them, just want them to explain
This entire video i kept trying to reach out and give deji a hug
This touched me , I love this mature Deji👑
Respect Deji you are so nice 😢😢😢
Respect for deji
i think he said  IM SORRY over 50x .. lol
Massive respect for opening up and taking full responsibility for your actions. Self growth is important, and everyone makes mistakes. I'm glad you're trying to improve upon your mistakes and make things right. This video was important to watch. Thank you for making it.
💗💗💗💗
If anyone makes crying memes out of this you deserve a special place in hell
This feel like callux video lol

Meanwhile girls: bUy mY oNlYfANs
Love this from you !! Good job Deji

Guyz lets not make this into a meme
Big respect to Deji takes a lot to admit faults
12:36 me telling the other imposter how to play among us
Where man cried
You know whhat fair enough respect
The pictures of their childhood made me very emotional....
This was an amazing video so emotional well done Deji takes balls to make this video❤️
I feel like Deji needs to talk to a professional and I mean this in a good way. Its good for everyone to see someone to talk to.  It could give Deji new perspectives and to deal with certain emotions and unresolved feelings.
Hey Deji, just wanted that not many people on the internet would genuinely accept their mistakes and I wanna let you know that opening up is not easy and so for this I commend you so much.   Much love Dej and continue like this💪❤️
This nigga Keemstar already bashing Deji for this video
Views low huh?
I'm crying mann we got your back
Dude how do dislike this
Asta's Voice: "NEVER GIVE UP DEJI!!!"
king
this is nice respect
Wtf is this
I don’t get emotional... but this man holy shit😢
Is it just me, that can't take this kid seriously 😂😂😂🤣😂🤣😂😅
Fake and cringe
Hey man fair play dej
We need more edits like this!👍
THIS IS WHEN A KID WHO HAS MATURED CRIED... RESPECT MY G
Respect to deji when I saw him cry I started crying too god bless you deji 🙏🏽
Why am I crying?
Who else came from the Reddit to go out of their way to like the video?
its not easy to get me to tear up deji, god damn
This made me cry
Respect
I'm not Crying, you are😳
♥️
Enjoy your Xmas Olajide family! Once again.
It's geting old you need new ideas for videos
this is a big video from deji, respect for real
y r niggas disliking, he saying his feelings out loud and some ppl cant do that like tf
RESPECT DEJ❤ takes a lot to open up about what you feel give my man the love he deserves
I was feeling this video until the damn piano came in...
Man Started Crying and Showing Old Pictures 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Glad this happened well needed🙌🏻🙌🏻
If people actually have the decency to meme this I’m done with humanity
hello
Y'all love drama
dont troll him reddit community...
Anyone who makes fun of him for this is a loser
My respect for this brothers🥺"📈📈📈📈📈"
This is emotional terrorism
Again only doing this for attention. Always has always will
Bruh this guy needs to stop crying on camera
Love you dej
I'm being honest. This is one of my top 5 best motivational speeches.
YO I SWEAR TO GOD THIS BITCH BETTER GET 1MILLION LIKES. I was crying as soon as he started talking about covid. Its like ever since deji lost tank the whole world went into a shithole. This symbolises a new begining. The start of a new decade is at hands. Let yourself be free, get rid of all of your bagadge and be reborn. Opening up is hard but unlike burrying your feelings deep down, it gives you no regrets. Mad respect to you deji. And the people who still laugh and make memes. Its ok, let them laugh, they don't matter. What matters is that you conquered your fears, you became strong. Don't forget that. Merry christmas, and a Happy new decade.
This s*** made me cry
This brought me to tears 😭
Love your content best person❤️❤️
Whoevers chopping onions stop
i stared at my dog he ran away pepesad :( i stared at my dog he ran away pepesad :(
ayo fam deji has changed. wish they make a video together soon.
Deji, you are a legend 🙏
and now keemstar is being a bitch about this ;-;
If anyone memes this that will be so messed up
He deleted his bye and he’s gone to far videos big up deji 🙌
Deji I am thankful that you have understood your past mistakes and learnt from them
Kai holding deji at gun point be like... joking, big up my man
Deji is a real man it takes alot for someone to let go of their pride and open up and show his emotions
I've always have watched deji and definitely one of my favorite YouTubers
Everyone makes mistakes, but it takes real strength to own up to them. The only way to prove that you are truly sorry is to not make the same mistakes again. If you’re willing to own up to your mistakes, myself and many others will be willing to set them aside. I believe in you.
my guy its December  ( im joking, good vid)
Respect❤️🙌🏽
takes a real man to cry on camera and admit he was wrong respect and love always deji
Not gonna lie I never used to be a big fan of him but seen him grow the past few years literally sat and cried when he started crying 💕 Massive respect to you Deli 💕
I committed to quickly I actually teared uo love you deji❤️
Keep your head up
We all love u u have made us feel better thank u for all u have done for us
I don't want an argument, all that i want to know is why this has so many dislikes
The title changeee......
This was a really emotional, respect for what you said and this time it’s you and it was legit and I know that I hope that you both get back together and your whole family gets back and celebrate this Christmas, time of love
Big up
Appreciate this video Brodie. A lot of guys get trapped in the mindset of "toxic masculinity" that they don't find the need to want to open up. However, open communication is what our species thrives upon, so I'm grateful that you're spreading awareness to not only your fans but to those who may need it. Keep your head up king!
Why don't you two make a Christmas video together with your girlfriend and parents. That would be an awesome video mate
Seeing Deji not only mature, but realising that he could be better? god damn this is what we all need now is positive reinforcement from someone we look up to.   Keep it up Dej.
My worst year has completed  🙃  all i wanted was them to be together
Never seen deji not laugh or make jokes in a while lol. But this is a real subject that we should focus on 🙏
Deji honestly deserves way more. This is proof people can change and deji has showed he can show great responsibility. This did make me tear a bit but man. Deji your a legend forever. Big up dej 🙌🏻🙏🏻
Deji, to make up for everything, make this Christmas with your family the best one ever. Don’t forget to bring us along. Much love and respect❤️
I think this message should go to other YouTuber as well they change too much
This video completely changed my views on deji, I really wish the best for him.
I swear if I see crying memes this time...
respect
It has ads
Mans really teamed up with a month
I'll wait for your guys' Christmas video together
made my day
God bless you ❤️
Massive Respect to this young legend I've been watching since 2015

This can't possibly get haters. Whether you love him or hate him, Deji has really spoken his heart out and all I see is more respect coming his way. Big ups fam

Deji Please read: OLADEJI OLATUNJI!!!!!

Fucking hell. Seeing Deji throughout the years and finally talking about the situation, and crying, had me crying. Have a great Christmas! 🎄 👍
ur a great man and my inspiration and my age is 13
Name a dead youtube channel ..Deji..
This once dont make it a meme
mad respect deji
Who else is here from Keemstar's Twitter
if everyone wondering why hes recording himself crying is because he said this video is all about showing his emotions
I don’t why I cried 😔
much respect to Deji he has truly matured over this time and he should be proud of where he’s gotten
Omg Deji is gay
everything happens for a reason broski. big love
This video hit me fucking hard, like Jheez  I struggled myself not to let the water works go 😂 I rarely even cry aha that shit hit different. Fair play to you deji good on yah bud
I felt that inside my heart. Heavy and oddly warm.
I thought u were coming out of the closet
Daym this was tough to watch !
thank u deji i don’t know how u do it but u manage to help out and make people happy
The fucker made me cry 😂
TRUE RESPECT MAN😭😭😭😭
Thanks a lot for the advice Deji, BIG RESPECT to you dude!!!
❤️
I love how Deji treasures his family so much. Its not something you see a lot with popular people.
Bruh this comes off super disingenuous, maybe you just filmed it after the emotions were legit maybe not. This seriously feels like bad acting though, stop cutting to dramatic angles and pictures of you as a child.
This is truly heartwarming. I always knew Deji was a truly great whole hearted person, I could tell through his smile, and just the way he laughs.   We need more people like him. People who truly care, people who truly want to see their mistakes and change for the better. I respect you Deji, you’re strong, and we all love you.
Happy holidays
we don't want the memes but theirs gonna be memes
Takes a strong person to admit the mistakes they've made and man up and sincerely apologise for them. Respect to you deji and stay strong 🙏❤
Your gay?
This is what a real man is big props to you deji
i really felt this video thanks deji
If you aren't crying you are lying
alright, ksimon is already cringe. DONT MAKE THIS A MEME.
Not the music video I love the beat it is a banger
i know this is a serious video, but i’m wondering does this mean we are getting horror vids back
lets go DEJ mad RESPECT
You know who else teamed up with movember? GARDNER MINSHEW!!! Go jags! Props to you Deji!
My guy man so much respect
That’s why we subscribed Deji ❤️
It takes a big man to do this deji. 👏
I can see that Deji has matured a lot since the middle of this year
Your a sociopath a very cleaver individual everything  you do is a act . You got exposed before when the dog video came out and it attacked your neighbour . When you denied it ever happened all before .
This like actually warmed my heart to watch, i love both of them and watch both of their content almost daily, I would love to see them get together
I thought it was him about coming out gay at first
damn it got real real quick
Deji, man... My respect for you has finally returned. It's really not easy to properly open up like that. I, along with many others who have watched this, truly understand how hard it can be.
I felt that
This videos gonna get demonetized because of that impaulsive clip 💀
Who needs a hug?🥺
Ayy why are my eyes sweating fr???
I thought he was gonna say he was gAy
Unforgivable was one of the hardest disstracks we have ever seen
I literally next to never tell anyone anything about me, not because I don’t have anyone to tell, because I don’t, but I wouldn’t tell anyone anyways
What a great video he has matured so much
Don’t have anyone to open to
respect deji, wow ! I'm so proud of you
Big respect deji
Big respect for this!
Your laughing about the dis about Jake  BUT You want to forgiveness then stop laughing at dis Jake you watched it n laughed it’s rude n cruel Degi Really I hope you forgive n be cool with everyone
Yo that cry got me so bad 😔
respect you man keep doing your good, train up
What a wimp
I'm just a stranger to you, but you finally admitted you were wrong and because of that you earned my respect back.
Deji don’t cry, when you cry you make us all cry
It feels weird to see such a heartfelt message in an sponsored video. It takes away the sincerity to be honest. But hey, If is honest, good for Deji.
deji makes a video  Keemstar on twitter : Deji killed someone
I’m glad he is talking about this and not holding it in. I hope he gets much better ❤️
Why did I start laughing at this
I literally cried before Deji cried, this is an emotional and very important video
I love deji but “I’m really sorry x377373”
I don’t hate Deji but he sub-bottled 🤷‍♂️
🥰
Im a fan since along time i see him as a funny person without problems but after i see this i cried alot i cant stand this side of deji to be honest i cried when he cried. Respect to deji for opening up👍. Fan since comedyshortsgamer

Forgiving is the best way to go as you can move on and choose what to do in a situation. Thank you so much for doing this video Deji, talking about this as many people can relate to this, and spreading awareness! This is really big deal to do as it takes a lot of courage and confidence to do this.   All I wish for you Deji is that you have all positivity around your surroundings and that you accomplish all your dreams what to get. And that you have a beautiful future. This also goes for anyone who is also seeing this too- all I wish for is the best for you all!  Thank you again for doing this Deji and I wish you to have a great day and future.💖 *Sending all love, positivity, and hugs to you all*💖❤️💖❤️💖

We love you deji, it takes so much courage to make a video like this one.
Much respect deji ✊🏽

Respect to deji for this.
All I see is money. Naughty brand deal 💰  Although respect to deji top video
Oh shit. Here we go again.
I respect you 100x more as a human and as a YouTuber. Not much people have the balls to open up to one person let alone a whole youtube community. YOU ARE BRAVE DEJI and we love you for that ❤️
This is the Mature , Open Man we want ... keep it going
Imagine disliking this video.....
Is that the new ps5 I see in the back👀
How much u get paid for this shit bru😂😂😂😂
We can’t make this into a meme
This takes balls.. you're a real good man Deji. This was one of the bravest things I've ever seen on this platform. I've done things I'm not proud of, you're not alone on that. We all make mistakes, we have to learn from this.
I’m assuming he watch all the videos people made about him being a terrible person to his family in the past but Deji this is the stepping stone of growth. Your growing up man.
Nice script 🤣🤣
RESPECT ✊✊✊✊✊✊🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻
May not like deji but i now  respect for him
Thank you for being there for me deji. Ur vids are incredible
All the respect and love for you Deji!!! ❤️🥺
do you lot reckon he’s sorry?
I hope you will start being your own person, stop causing trouble and fabricating stories. Cause you have been doing a lot of wrong things. Let 2021 be your new year to be great.
I can’t help but think he’s doing this just to gain money and he really isn’t sincere in what he’s saying. I hope I’m wrong
Respect man!
Don't meme this
Thts wht I like
Damn
I think it's very clear in the last year that he's matured a ridiculous amount. Respect to him for making this video and I just hope his actions off-camera speak as loudly.
gg u earned a sub
If anyone makes memes and takes the piss out of him for this video they need to sort themselves out
enough to make a grown man cry
Big up dej

Finally the brothas will be back together
Respect to you deji ❤
love you deji
❤❤
I shit you not, I fucking cried. You could hear his voice breaking and I was like ‘what the fuck?’ then I saw his eyes were red and I was like ‘holllyyyyy shit’ and you could hear such genuineness and shit when he was crying and pleading sorry, that just- broke me. Honestly, I’ve always been such a fan of both of them and this hit hardddddd. The way his voice was trembling and he was pleading for forgiveness and shit was just- heartbreaking.
Your amazing don’t let yourself down everyone makes mistakes your both one off the best on YouTube
Amazing vid
8:54 thats not true Deji. This shows how sorry you  are. Not many people can cry on camera and then post it for the whole world
damn
how come Deji did not  win the streamy award
To Deji. Ik you've done this stuff in the past, but use the anger and regret as motivation to avenge and enlighten the Olatunji family name! Make sure to box and conquer and out some respect on your brothers name and the family's
This is to much, heartbreaking
A man who cries isn’t weak it’s because he’s been strong for too long
You should tell this to him face to face, lots of love man!
Don't  make it a meme
Tbh COVID is kinda stressing but not that much
on a side note you need to give this talk to Trisha Paytas on the H3 channel lately lol shes off the cuff needs help
man up
“Venting is something you need to do” it’s true being imposters is the best way to go guys
8:22  am rlly sorry dunjah,  1 video before his mom caught him play the game, he said I didn't cheat on dunjah his mom held bible on him  guys anything going on between deji and dunjah????
This is something that must’ve been very difficult to talk about. And to be so mature about it... respect.
Moral of the story get a cute German shepherd puppy 😂
Why you change the title?
This video is why we love you Deji! Keep up the positive attitude king 👑
How can people dislike this video hes doing something good ffs
My respect for Deji  📈📈📈📈📈 This shows a lot of strength I love you Dej
*Respect*
❤️
Mad respect for this but why not pick up the phone or go his house an say it instead of over a video
Respect Deji
I fully respect Deji for this video but I think he gets the point that he’s really sorry 😂😭😂
1v1 me brawlhalla come on fucking 1v1 me im not going to stop until u 1v1 me @ky.izic
My Respect For Deji 📈
the likes are at 69K lol
Hope he is spitting the truth. And I want it.💚💚💚
Why is he’s ps5 in the background lmao.
Deji - u might know me as comedyshortsgamer                                               me - shead a tear
Great video Dej!
the dislikes on the video should be disabled
please don’t meme this, or else ill make you get  cha cha’d real smooth.
While watching this I kept on thinking, “that fan (to the right of him) looks a PS2 in a PS5’s white case.”
Teamed up to get that paycheck!
Don’t cry over films or nothing, but this has made realise so much
💖💖💖
omg this vid
He nearly had me tearing up. Deli respect
Everyone makes mistakes and does dumb and immature things but its where you end up that matters
Honestly this hit hard because I’m 15 and I’ve had a drug addiction I was spending and getting myself in dept over 300 or 400 pound a week and that’s just on cocaine I had a massive weed problem and I’m 4 months today I’ve been drug free and trying to find out who I wanna be in life and I’m trying to open up but idk when it’s the right time I lost everyone on the road to being drug free but that doesn’t matter because they ain’t my friends they wanted me for drugs but I’ve found friends who want me for who I am and honest this has got me to my knees takes a bigger man to show his emotions and open up than people denying on my they own mistakes congrats on opening up it’s honestly so hard but life is like a rollercoaster there’s always be the up n then be the downs no matter how perfect you are actually nothing and nobody is perfect god bless you and a happy Christmas🙏
Aww, you are a good person Deji!
:D
Mans a king 👑
LOL
Respect Dej 💯
Respect 💯 deji ! ❤️

Respect to deji man👏👏
You copying Callux looking for some good PR?
Tapped guy
Deji:crying  Me:😀🙂😐😢😭
We love you deji
Keem really involved tank i still don't agree with what deji did but its a family matter I don't see why this old man is trying to get involved with these family matters the sub botting sure call him out but still there's no need to go on ranting on twitter about someone and bring things up that shouldn't be
Dear Deji:     When I first heard of ur name, it was the announcement of u and jake paul fighting. I was a fan of Jake Paul and I thought that u were a bad influencer and hated u because of the terrible things that people said about u. When I started watching ur videos 2 months ago I became happy and u helped me be myself to other people. I was so shy and scared to socialized with other people. U make me happy and be myself. I just wanna let u know that we are very thankful for what u have done to us especially to me. Even though u did some terrible things, I started to realise that u were a good person. I hope that u would have a great life and a good relationship with dounja, and one day I hope that u would kneel down to her and be her husband. I hope that u could read this and one last time, I am Very Thankful and God Bless ur Family and urself.                                                                                                                                             Thankyou, Earl
👑 respect
Ayo... I’ve been watching Deji for now 4-7 years and I’ve always had his back, but this shit got me real emotional🙁
is it bad I thought of among us when he said you need to vent? But holy shit really inspiring Deji, I'm glad you made this!
I mean this in the nicest way possible, I think Deji is MORON but not a bad guy
Your a good man dej
[Everyone Liked That]

I’ll drive the 15 minutes or so to you and pass on an air hug my dude. I’m 25 and talking openly is a big reason I got through many struggles in my past. Nothing major compared to many, but talking helps more than some people understand.  Stay strong (y)
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤respct big word from a big man
Massive props Deji. Love you man

U have to rate this guy so highly for this 💙 Big up Deji

We love you deli
Hard to watch bruh
I agree, this year has been perhaps the hardest year in my life. I accepted a promotion that allowed me to live closer to family, but meant I would say goodbye to all my friends. As soon as I moved here, the covid 19 crisis came about. I was not able to meet up with family, and I was unable to make new friends outside of work. I honestly feel as if I've become such a recluse and that I have few people in my life that fully understand the suffering I have gone through.   This job has made me feel so worthless and insignificant. I used to have a job with a team who trusted me and enjoyed me being there. Now I can feel the negative auras of those at my job. I've felt completely worthless and at times suicidal.   Next year, my main goals are to get out of this job that has stripped me of my happiness and self worth. I'm honestly at the point of just putting in my 2 weeks and looking for a new job later.
Deji thanks for opening up. Made me cry.
Respect.
Lol
We love you deji
For those wondering, yes he did come out as gay
Only notification squad will have remembered this being called “Its time to come out” lmao
It takes a big man to forgive but an even bigger man to admit when he's wrong. Respect Dej
Who tf cutting onions
I feel like the materialistic things comment was a shot at Jallow
Amazing deji well done 👏 also I have what you got and I still wear a mask 😷

King shit man 🙏🙌🏼❤️ Respect 💯
Respect for deji 📈📈📈
🙏🙏🙏 aye everyone here is proud of you and will support you for the ups and downs
I couldn’t help but laugh at the reflection when recording those family photos
SINCERITY is KEY in this type of video and this is what he showed.
This video is so cringe. Talk to him in private and don't be like "I'm sorry" on youtube, to just  have more attention. All the olatunji dick riders will dislike this comment, but it's just faxx.
That tower fan looks like a ps5
We are here for you
Why the fuck am I here?!
Deji got BALLS of steel✔
I want them to solve things without the camera bullshit and just come in with one Video as if Nothing happened
0:04 Still look like shit
When he started crying, I started crying as well 💔
The most beautiful thing I’ve seen all year :)
I’ve been going through breakup and so much depression for years and watching this means a lot even though I can’t ever see myself opening up ❤️
RESPECT WHAT A FUCKING RESPECT, Deji makes 2020 more better
Nice Deji. Have a good Christmas this year. :)
Who else watched the whole video
Love it
Cmon let's show how  much we appreciate him 👇
For a sec, thought he was about to say he was gonna give TJ away in a giveaway lol
❤️❤️❤️
My respect for deji📈📈📈📈📈📈
I’m glad Deji opened up because when you open up you feel more free and overcome a lot of things in life 🥰
I know how u feel deji i myself have three older brothers ive cried to this...
Man, I'm about to start crying right now🥺
❤❤❤
I’ll be completely honest. Deji isn’t really someone I watch and I literally never comment on any YouTube videos but I honestly just have to comment to say how much I respect what he’s done. I’m going through a really tough time so I know how hard and how low you can get. This video really touched me. Chances are he won’t see this but I just want to say how much I respect him for everything he said, and being brave enough to open himself up like this. Real respect Dej👌🏻
❤️
RESPECT!! 🙏💪
Camera during the video : front -> side -> front -> side
Deji you should remove the ads tbh
Mad respect for this guy, keep it upp my ggg🔥🔥🔥

By making this video you have helped others to open up and to show  that u are strong for doing the same and for that you have my full respect this video showed how much you really care and to open up is very hard to do. And because of that I wish you the best and I will continue to watch your content and support you until the end. Thank you for making this video and making my child hood and life what it is today. Deji you have my full respect.❤️

Deji Last Year < Deji This Year
why are people disliking this video
This video almost made me cry it hits hard
most men feel like they can’t express there feelings or even cry infront of people etc it takes real bravery to do this
Keemstar: He’s crying for views
Cap
but i have no one to open up to
if u didnt cry watching this then u have no soul
wow good video deji
I can relate and this is great no one ever listens to me when I open up they more say shut up
Big up deji
I believe it’s really important to open up about our feelings somethimes. Specially for the boys, who [as Deji said] often like to see ourselfs as strong. Somethimes we just have to accept that stuff is difficult in life. Too difficult to fix it all by yourself..
respect
They need to colab again if they can ( COVID
Whos cutting onions 🥺🥺😭😭
I rate deji
This man crying on camera again xddd
Why's this shit monetized
❤️
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💲💲💲💲💲🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑

For a way of respect can we please just make 1 promise not to turn this Into a meme of him crying because you can genuinely tell he means what he is saying and it breaks my heart knowing someone out there is gonna take the piss. Dont be pricks man and just dont make this into memes
So so so proud, i admire you for doing this.
I wish I could be there and hug you
this year is the worst year in my entire life!! I get soo bored not seeing people especially the people who I really love to see and enjoy my time with , I lost of my favorite people in my life, I lost my grandmother, which it’s was sooo hard and bad to get over it!! I hope 2021 be getting better, but I learned a lot in my life, to appreciate what to have , because we lost very important stuff especially this year , we lost freedom, wish everyone happiness and best times in their lives!! ❤️❤️❤️
YOU’Ve mad me Cry and I’ve haven’t cried at anything very inspiring and what a legend 🤝👏👍🤜👊

8:20 made me cry..like I felt his guilt and how sorry he truely was. Mad respect Deji. Family above all always and Forever damn straight❤️
Opening up is such a helpful thing . I opened up to my parents and friends about my mental health a couple of weeks ago when it hit me how bad it had actually gotten and I cant tell you enough how much it has helped me to even get it off my chest and am now with councillors who are helping me every step of the way. For anyone reading this and struggling opening up I know how hard it is but you have to brush past the fear and anxiety because just opening up lifts so much off you and dont be afraid to cry in front of them when you open up just pour your heart out it helps so much. Your all loved ❤
MASSIVE RESPECT!!!!
We love u deji
My best bit is where he does not edit the crying even though the fans make fun of him a few months later. RESPECT Deji
I am actually hella happy to see this ngl

comedy shorts gay mer
Petition for Deji to do these style of videos.
Didnt expect to cry clicking on this video...
Good on you Delji. Takes a big man to admit his mistakes.
I'm so confused on what happened to make deji this down. If anyone can let me know that would be dope
admitting your wrong is really big and it takes a big true men to do that
Deji, are you okay? -it seems like you’re mental health may not be at its best, we’re always here for, if you need to talk, talk -we’re here for you ❤️
Hope no one makes a meme off of this video
Don’t click read more         .                                        .

I've been fan of you since I was about 11 years old. Deji, you've always made me laugh and your videos have made me happy. You're hilarious and a good person despite your flaws. I've always hated myself and I started feeling very depressed and suicidal at the beginning of this year. I really appreciate this video and it's made me like and respect you even more. I'm starting to feel more willing to open up about my feelings more thanks to you. Maybe I will one day. I will always be a big fan of you!
I thoght that was a PS5 on his right side
respect for Deji. really wat he has done is really beautiful  love you  deji be safe and you family

Yo I can't say how proud I am of Deji, lots of people said he would just get worse and worse after he fell down, but instead he got back up and took it like a champ and became stronger, seeing you happy makes me happy man, and no matter what I'm always going to not only be a fan but a supporter as well, Merry Christmas to Deji and everyone else.

why do people dislike this
Deji is a good soul
Lots of respect for you deji
Respect
Let’s be honest Deji. You lied, manipulated and contradicted yourself and this is the reason why JohnSwan, Nicholas DeOreo and Pinkamous made expose videos on you. I know you’re talking about Covid in this but... you legit used Covid for content by having ads ok that video and plugging merchandise. Let’s be honest you used it for views and money considering it had ads and not to mention that you didn’t get checked up on nor did you yourself believe you had it since you literally contradict yourself in that video. I appreciate that you’re trying to redeem yourself but what happened to you? You overreacted to a joke made by someone you thought was family, you made multiple videos on your other and kept retracting them but continued to carry on talking badly. Not to mention you took so many things out of context in that bye video where you legit edit clips to fit your narrative, you took the Yasmin situation out of context by making it seem that he purposely had intercourse with her even though you weren’t in a relationship and yes he lied to not have known her but this was back when you called every girl your girlfriend so let’s be honest, he didn’t know you liked her we can go more into this but we know you used this as a way to just make him look bad. We can keep criticising you on this but i will say that welldone for genuinely apologising but you need to say sorry to Keem because he also tried to help you as well. Also big fan, always am but you disappointed me, but mate I’m so happy you made this video and I hopes things get better and we get the old 2016 ComedyShortsGamer who actually made great content, was hilarious and let’s fuck off this new Deji who became terrible and lashed out at anyone, but all I can say is that now you’ve just gotta show change and that’ll help people to trust you again and put your back where you were because CSG was one of the fastest growing channels on this platform we want that guy back and I hope you read this but hey gotta wait and see what happens. Also this shouldn’t really have any ads on it, so it’s more genuine.
Maybe 2020 ain’t so bad
You need to forgive yourself, that’s the next step. Great video deji
He lied his age he 24 not 23
i have to say that this is one of the most best and inspirational video that i have ever seen. thanks deji❤️
Wasn’t November last month
Big men dont cry 🙄
Why am I laughing 😂😂😂
I really respect people who have the guts to come out. I was forced into coming out when I didn’t want to, because I was lucky enough to caught while attempting to take my own life, which both saved my life and got me the help I need.
most of the time when i watch sad really sad movies i never cry but this is sum deffrent i started crying which i never mostly do. it really hurts to see one of ur fav youtuber cry and talk about their feelings
You have got a new subscriber my friend
Why do I feel like it's fake
💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💪💪💪💪💪💪💪
whoever memes this video and his emotional and meaningful cry aren't good people deji is truly a gift

The Deji I suscribed to years ago is back
Time to let the past die.   2020 was a milestone year. It was a sign that it’s time for change. Time for growth. Time for new beginnings. So let’s all leave our garbage in 2020 okay?
Don't make fun of Deji crying here, I have seen tears like that, don't do it because it would just make you look like you had no heart.
We love you deji ur we all are family ❤️

But you are not all to blame many people made mistakes at the time. So proud of you for making this, I had respect for you before but now it has just increased so much. We love you Deji❤️

There a difference between genuine anxiety and depression compared to YouTube anxiety you’re a c:ut
4:50 and up, I started tearing up😭💀
It's just sad that the fact that the younger sibling always has to apologise first , even if the older sibling did Something wrong too.
Keemstar fans love to dislike
Realistically, this is one of the most wholesome videos of 2020. Deji, you are a good man
yo mann u a legend. i just wanted to say that. u a legend

I think we've come to a point where Deji has noticed that uploading family-drama related vids is a good way to generate views.
Ngl I almost cried when he cried I feel bad for him :(
Deji, let me train you man i can help you out ✌️
Who else cried😢 I did😢
I hope this isn’t for views again
This comment is for everyone, whether you are hated, loved, suffering from diseases, problems, or anything else. No matter what happens, I love you no matter what you do or how you think of yourself; I love you. If anyone needs help, just know that I am here, you are human, and it is ok to feel the way you do, so never feel scared or ashamed to reach out and seek help. Mental Health is becoming a rapidly discussed issue; schools hardly address this and show people what this feeling is. Never EVER think you're not loved, cared for, accepted, or appreciated for who you are. Stop comparing yourself to others; when you do, all you bring yourself is hate, selfishness, and feelings that affect your lifestyle. Don't forget to be you and REMEMBER THIS you aren't living this life for anyone; you're here today for yourself. That's why you keep pushing; this is why you keep moving forward, hoping for a better future, stay safe everyone, especially as the years' progress and mental health is serious. Again, I love you, and don't forget self-acceptance, self-improvement, and self-love is the best solution.
ma man, proud of you
Respect ✊ I love ❤️ you for ths
Big respect
Don’t think like that every healthy brotherhood have to fight respect to man 💫💫
Imagine disliking this video
Gotta give respect to Deji here. Many people struggle to open up in today’s society. Credit to you Deji!
If u make jokes about him crying then shame on u
We cried and lived this with u deji  Dont worry we're with u

Comparison is the thief of joy. No matter who you are you have individual value as a unique person! There's only one you learn from the mistakes you make turn your MESS into a MESSage for someone else so they don't make the same ones. Merry Christmas and happy New year 💯💙
Respects for deji for not just being mature and clean but also deleted the videos totaling 51 million views about. I think this is a new beginning

12:36 when you play with an awful 2nd impostor
I can relate to this too Deji it’s okay just let it all out 💪🏽
It does take two to have an argument, and both sides did things they regret I'm sure. But it takes allot to admit your faults. Big up to you deji, I really hope you and your family have an amazing holiday and bring positivity and happiness to you.

I cried watching this deji I love you so much you deserve everything 🥺❤️
This is so heart warming. <3
If anyone decides to put hate on this video, then they clearly have deeply rooted problems themselves and need to take it out on someone. If you're one of those people, I hope you figure it out soon.
Merry Christmas deji ❤️

I always had respect for Deji but this video has made me not just respect him that much more but made me learn more about a content creator I have loved for 6 years now. Much love to you Deji, keep up the great content!!!<3

I will be highly disappointed if a random kid tries to make a meme out of this serious situation. If anything we should be thankful that he even apologized when he really didn’t have to. Deji you are a good person trust me.
Damn Deji, you had me crying with you man
Damn
respect deji
Yooo the only youtuber who is not afraid to show how he's truly feeling and BIG RESPECT to you true and loyal fans will always have your back. So glad you admitted your mistakes and took responsibility. Proud of you
Respect my G ✊ For letting it all out.

Lots of respect Deji. Real talk.
So much respect. You can tell things have been on his mind for a while

Love you deji , stay strong !!!!!!!!! <3 <3 <3
HEY DO YOU KNOW WHAT " A MAN WHO REGRETS WILL ALWAYS  NEVER REGRET THINGS IN FUTURE COZ HE WOULDNT MAKE MISTAKES SO COME ON DEJI BE HAPPY BRUV
This was hard to watch, which means it is something of great importance to share. Well done Deji for opening up and doing what most men never will, although a lot more men are opening up now which is amazing as most suicides are committed by men and men are more likely to experience depression. So it's great that men are opening up and seeking help when and where they need it.
RESPECT TO YOU🙏🏼
Honestly after this whole image of deji i have gotten a certian picture of him. No offense and this is good too but everytime i see him do a serious video like this i feel like he scripted everything and is forced to do this. Just sayin
Let’s make a promise that we are not going to use this video to make memes. Cheers Deji !!!
Who else thought he was gonna say he’s gay
RESPECT×10💯
King
this made me tear up
He found his brain
This was so hard to watch i have so much respect for you deji god bless you and your family
🙏🏼👏🏼
its enough to make a grown man cry..
this honestly made me tear up. Big ups on deji for making this video
Deji you are a.  Amazing role model to me I’m 15 and yes u are I love u (no homo)
Great now he can fight gib!
He teamed up with November    December:Who am i to u huh?
manipulation lol
Respect to you for this 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
I also hide my feelings from Friends and family so thanks for this video
Men like Deji have guts of steel, there are no men like Deji
apology accepted
Watch people actually make this a meme coz they're low lives
❤️❤️❤️
Mans just pulling everything bad out and being honest to us. Fam big up my guy deji we fucking love you we gonna get thru this ting innit
Big Up Deji
❤️❤️❤️
Big man dej❤🔥
Not trying to like ruin the vibe or mood but why is it every time he cries it seems fake, again I’m not saying it is fake I’m saying it seems like it.
I will always have respect for Deji this man has been going through a lot of tough times and also I don't like seeing one of my idols cry
I was choking up, this one almost got me and I’m listening to this while driving and trying to stay firm. I have brothers and had many fall outs so it hit hard for me as I’m still not good with two of my brothers and it’s a tough one. Big respect to you Deji ✊🏾
When deji starts crying and saying he is sorry it reminded me of that fresh Prince episode where will gave carlton drugs and started crying at the end saying he was sorry then uncle Phil gave him a hug they both really were sorry
Lots of people/celebrities do things like this and I can see why. Love things like this. Very different and understanding. Have a good Christmas deji ❤️
Deji, u made me cry then the mood just changed outta nowhere
I commend Deji for this. Despite his apology, there was too much damage done - their relationship won’t be the same.
Respect 👍
I’m not crying you are🥺
Respect Deji Nigerians for life
So much respect, hope you have a lovely Christmas x
Rip
Big respect to you
I watched this video, and rewatched it and rewatched this again.  Thanks Dej, we really needed this.
Love this
😔
At 11:00, is he talking about the time he was in America with rice and some other people?
This shows a ton of maturity. Keep it up Dej you seem to be taking strides forward as a person.
Strong and Honest Video.
This video will help a lot of people going through dark times, even prevent someone from committing suicide
Why does this video have dislikes
I like deji but when he was saying sorry it sounded like that inbertweener scene 😂
Mad respect for you Deji 🙏🙏🙏
Don't let the internet get in between the olatunji's 💪🏻
Respect
❤️❤️❤️
the dislikes are from people who had to much tears in their eyes so the could not tell where the like button was.
AMAZING VIDEO!!! This video deserves billions of views and likes and those who dislike either haven’t found themselves yet or are the ones inflicting pain mentally or physically on others   Plz like this video so it gets the attention it deserves and also well done deji for what you have done it has truly changed lives 👍🏻👍🏼👍🏽👍🏾👍🏿❤️
❤❤

Huge respect to you man for releasing this video and opening up stay strong with your family.
Yo this made me cry
We respect u
i'm sorry guys but i could not watch deji cry, that part hurt me, i respect that man
If I find ANYONE, even ONE PERSON make a crying meme again then I will find you and I will slap you up because this isn't a laughing matter, this isn't a time to make jokes and laugh..... What Deji has just done is HARD, it takes A LOT especially when you're doing it to post it onto the internet so if ANYONE creates even ONE crying meme then you are an absolutely vile person so please don't, please please please don't.... He doesn't need it and its really not funny 🤢
We are with you ♥️♥️♥️💪💪💪
Here comes a meme
The fact that there's people disliking this video actually disgusts me
Respect ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Huge respect for this video man. Fair play
Damn this got me a bit teary eyed.
There are so many bulletin board pinning quotes here. My favorite is "being yourself is what cool is!".
mad respect❤️
Takes alot of guts to do this deji i love u man
Have a good Christmas Deji, and continue to move forward.
I have got to the point of the video where there's no water left in my body left to cry ,idk goodnight

I really respect Deji for coming out with his feelings. This kind of stuff takes balls to do. I really hope that you keep on doing these types of videos, could really benefit your mental wellness.   Keep doing what you’re doing my G.
If someone ever makes a meme of this he has NO heart. He deserves massive respect for apologizing in tearing in front of everyone
I love you Deji :)
Jeez whos cutting onions
Big respect Deji!
I hate to say this and it’s sad to say this but there’s gonna be a meme about him crying
I knew He was gay!!!!!
Respect and remember people do make mistakes but the important is to learn from them. Don’t let the devil come between brothers and family. 👊🏽🙏🏽
If Lil bored makes a meme vid out of this am unsubing his channel
I felt that 😭
You dropped this: 👑
So are yall gonna make a video together or what?
This just opens new level of respect tbh people don’t know how hard it is to open up and he posted it for millions of people to see just respect man and I hope ur life just gets better Nd better
12:21 *Feminists anger intensifies
I hope this one doesn't become a meme.        But I already know that dickhead keemstar is gonna use this and laugh at him.
Full respect
💖👍
he made tear up 😭
Leave the past, i know you feel bad and sorry. But your not a bad person, you where a person who made millions feel motivated and happy when down. I know you dont like to be a bad person, but learning from mistakes is the most important thing. Respect my guy. Hope deji sees this.
damn...
Ok that hurt....

Love this from you!!❤️❤️❤️❤️

Proud of you for opening up Deji, talking about things and opening up about problems needs to be more normalised❤️

You and your brothers relationship is very similar to me and my brothers but you guys fighting has shown me that I can’t let our relationship get like that so in a way your guys fight sets a good example

I cried myself
bruv who tf could dislike such video
Deji's heart grew three sizes that day. And then – the true meaning of Christmas came through, and the Deji found the strength of ten Dejis, plus two!
Why didn’t u call him instead of making a video ?
Love This 💪🏾! May Allah Bless You Both ❤️💯
1:26 he said school had to shutdown like it was a bad thing
Ayo I hate this guy but, respect to what he doing. Anyone can respect this.
You're Amazing Deji. I also have Asthma I know how you feel on that.
I’m so happy you and your family have come back together, these things happen and it’s also okay that you haven’t been okay , it’s about learning and coming over things. It’s a really brave thing to do to show your feelings on YouTube in front of thousands of others. You have done so well. It’s okay for family to fight and feel things but the fact that your family have  come back stronger is so good. I hope you have a good Christmas 🤍
I almost cried RESPECT ✊ DEJI✊
Tried so hard not to cry
it's sad for me how the community and everyone keeps getting better and leaving me behind imma grow up to be poor in the streets 💩
HOW IS THIS NOT ON TRENDING
It’s crazy how he come out about things and people still dislike his video still, people are weird
REPSPECT MY G 💕

Love you Deji.  Thanx for opening up and giving me the inspiration to do the same!  Wish you all the best for 2021 and hope you will be able to achieve your goals and dreams!  Stay strong and keep up the amazing content!
❤️
Cancel keemstar he was one of the people behind all this. Send hate to him
Pussboi deji

This man is crying on youtube to say sorry hope he comes out and forgive u after all your brothers and brothers stand together no matter what so say sorry 🙏 😟
Respect!
Mad respect to you Deji, this is honestly something that changed my perspective of you. Keep up!!
Deji at least u showed ur emotion and we all understand 👊💯 (respect)
😂🤣great now here goes the Reddit memes ...Respect though ✊🏽 you grew from your mistakes and took accountability of it unlike most girls who play the victim or the innocent person when something goes there way
Sometimes a man got to cry to be a Man 💯
Man I actually cried man! takes guts to be honest with yourself
Join Beta Squad, they are good people
RESPECT DEJI WE LOVE YOU
Understandable have a great Christmas dej!
We always love you deji ❤️❤️❤️
This takes a significant level of maturity. Salute to you Deji
Damn momma cutting onions again
10000+ Respect for Deji.
Who else laughed
easy for a rich guy to say
deji: apologizing and expressing his feelings   idiot: *HmMmMmM iM gOnNa DiSliKe tHis ViDeO!!!111*
I always had respect for this man, god bless u sir. merry christmas
We love u
FairPlay Deji, a good video with a good message, and it’s the first time I have truly seen you hold yourself accountable for past actions. And when the time comes for boxing again, you can rectify your past mistakes.
Dejis Come along way that's incredible!
Big respect to deji for this
Most generic inspiration type video
I was the one who turned the notifications on but you were the one who turned my bell on
Who else started tearing up
How could u dislike this video
Sorry but u can't hate him for this. He faced his problems and took the blame and I know not many people can do this
Deji nobody hates you. Most people like to pander to negative things. Logan Paul did something bad and he reacted extremely bad for it and it actually made things worse for him. Just be cool and collective and remember youtube is just for the money fuck everything and everyone else haha
😘
Nothing but respect deji Very good quality editing as well Keep moving foward Deji
Respect
Respect man this takes a lot of courage
Great job playing the victim, Deji. I'm disliking this video.
The real MVP
Ur such a good soul mate, love u brotha❤️💪🏼
Big up Deji!!!🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🐐🐐🐐👑👑👑♥️♥️♥️
Let's appreciate the massive editing upgrade and everything that he said in this video
Respect...ik how it feels even if anything In the future happens I'll be there and your family will be there
Fair enough
Hi
We got another Deji crying meme guys, you know what to do!          Nah but on a real note big ups to Deji for making this video, it takes a lot of courage to do this.
This video really deserves a like!!!

Props Deji man. Don’t feel embarrassed for crying man. Makes you human. I hope you and your family get back on track. Keep strong man we all here for you 🖤

I'm sorry 1 month later     I'm the bad guy
mad respect for deji he got me tearing
mad respect to dej 🙌🏿
We love both you guys❤️👑
i think that with this video you've showed who u really are and that's a great way to cancel all your mistakes. I'm so happy that people can finally see that you are not a bad person, u just had some bad vibes around you conditioning your feeling and your behavior. These things can happen and this was just the past, the thing more important is who you are now! So glad for u bringin courage and took this off your chest😄❤
Press ‘F’ to pay respects 🙏🏽😌😌😌😌
Omg I was so close of crying
Bruh whys this so dramatic with the double camera angles😭🤣

So cute love of brothers😎😎
Deji has my respect on so many levels
takes a big man to admit his wrongs and to apologize. Mad respect, this gave a tear in my eyes, made me realize the importance of family and the people around us, lots of love Deji,  mad respect ❤️ showing a great example to people to change and learn from their mistakes.❤️🙏🏻
Watch how that stupid idiot keemstar is gonna make fun of Deji in some way for this. Respect to Deji he’s a real one
Don’t remember the last time i cried....Thank you for doing this Dej,Finally people will realise who you are and how beautiful of a heart you have🥺❤️
kis and djei
Dunjahh has definitely played a good role in changing his life.
HAHA
hated Deji to death after what he did but I can respect him now. ✊🏼
Keemstar is gonna have a field day with this
This is so truthful... Thanks Deji for being a great example for opening up. Im sure you will feel much better! I hope I can have the courage to do that aswell.
someone give this man a hug LOL!!
We love you Deji. Just have faith man. Keep your head up king
I saw the title and thought this man is gay😂
RESPECT my guy✋🏻
Respect has gone up even more
RESPECT man🙏
Big respects to you deji👏🏻👏🏻
I like the video Deji 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
Mad respect.
Sat watching this video fucking balling my eyes out at how hurt this man is. Struggling severely with mental health issues myself, seeing Deji in this position really pains me - nobody deserves this, no matter their status or what they may have done in their past, nobody deserves to feel like they aren’t good enough.  I have the utmost respect for you for posting this video and letting audiences see how vulnerable the real person is behind the screen. People forget sometimes that everybody is human, and something you may think isn’t important might be crushing another person.  Look after yourself Deji, you deserve as much happiness as you provide for your fans 🖤
Respect to deji man he let it all out and it payed off 🙏🏽🙏🏽❤️
all respect to Deji man, you deserve all the love my g ❤️
Legend
I cried man this is really hard
I love you Deji u might have made mistakes but you have corrected them and will continue to it takes a big man to fix his mistakes and a bigger man to admit them which u did 💜 💜 💜
This man is real G Hes doing something lot of us have no balls to do it
😭❤️❤️❤️❤️👑
i feel your pain
Im glad deji took full responsibility for the bad things he has done fair play deji  Much love ❤️🙌🏿
Aw much respect Deji
It takes a a big man to say sorry...and to know when you're wrong..  Wishing you all the best in the future..  Respect...
“The past can hurt, but as I see it you can either run from it, or learn from it.”
This need balls
Love you Deji, so much respect for you man
Can’t wait for the crying memes....🤦🏾‍♂️
GOD IS GOOD / AMEN TO ALL🙏😇

This is really cool of deji its well said and all but this feels like Logans apology its a lot of words and formatting completely different to what we know as deji it can sorta make sense cause he's "opening up" but he's made plenty of other serious videos before, I definitely think he's reading a script but anyway its good to talk about things that bother you so nice job deji
Big Up DEJI!!
RESPECT
If anyone makes a meme about this then they are the biggest bastard
This is enough to make a grown man tear up
He’s reading of a script
At your best you are entertaining AF Deji, keep growing. Screw clout, family is for real.
Please don't make this a crying meme
Deji: opens up  Keemstar: guys, deji made millions cry!
When he started crying you can literally tell that it's not fake🥺😟
Good man Deji.
IT TAKES A MAN TO OPEN UP  TO THINGS LIKE THIS,  WE LOVE YOU DEJI! 💯💯
Everyone liked that
We love Dej keep ur head up king
Damn Deji you down horrendous
This is the only apologies video on youtube that it was with real emotion and saying something and actually meaning it . Deji heads up king👑
Why am I laughing right now
Family back cheers bruhh
Most genuine apology I’ve ever seen on YouTube coming from the bottom of his heart
Deji you have earned my fullest respect that I already had from you. You are absolutely right about opening up and how it is still something that in particular young lads like myself aren't really tought to open up about your problems and to show your feelings. We had to "man up" and toughen up because "crying is for girls" at least that's what I was told in my childhood. I'm 17 now and I don't think like that anymore to be honest. Open up lads about your issues and ask your friends or parents about it because YOU MATTER TOO 💪🏼❤️❤️
made me upset seeing deji cry..
big respect!! You're a real one deji!
I don't know why but when he said he is opening up,  I thought he was going to say Dunjah is a boy and he is gay.
Yor making cray
"Venting is something that you need to do"  EMERGENCY MEETING 🚨🚨🚨
this got me into tears damn
This crying part just shows that he knew that song millions was partly about him
We love you Deji💙💙
deji watching you cry made me tear up. you are truly amazing and this world needs you! you don’t know how much it could mean to someone for apologising! x
But I love u dej 💞
🙌🙌🙌🥲
Damn, had to put this on 2x speed😢. This is a good video.
tearing up, big respect
If you meant what you said, you got a step closer to being a real sage
Idk if he’s sorry or not
Hope your okay mate respect x
Emotional vid 😢
Thought it was a ps5 in the background 😂
Big up deji❤️❤️
Hey yo Deji you are amazing. Few have the guts to seat down and talk and apologize. but you did it, not only that, you did it to the whole interment. big respect
What about the ''baby'' you and your girlfriend is having or was that just another stunt for views. This isn't hate, im just curious.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
My respect for deji 📈

This is not relevant but deji low-key got the DIY ps5 in the back tho 👀👀👀🤣🤣🤣🤣

I have lost respect for Deji after what he had done....but this video seems so sincere.....so Deji i hope you genuinely mean this and i and all of your fans respect and love and the change you are making continue on this path of redemption and only success awaits you..✅😌🇯🇲
I had and will always have respect for you🙏🏼🙏🏼

Deji, thank you for making this video. I truly have a newfound respect for you. You have to be strong to truly cry on camera.
Respect for manning up and admiting the things you did wrong, family is very important if you guys have anymore issues just hash it out offline.
nobody should dislike this video.

Love you Deji❤️❤️
This is the first video I watch of you in a very long time. You sort of spiralled into something and your content wasn't relatable anymore (for me anyway). This was a great video, good on you for opening up. Definitely keeping up with your future content moving forward.
Respect I hope deji can help people with this video
❤️❤️
I feel like he should’ve did this off the internet considering everything this man does nobody takes serious and or is a meme.
Big respect to deji
Let it out Deji

I respect this a lot! You definitely are right it’s not easy opening up to your fans, fam, or close friends! Thank you for inspiring me to do the same!
Mad props for this video. Definitely will change how people view you. This will definitely make things easier on you. Keep your head up and keep up the good work/videos
BIG RESPECT my g
keemstar should stfu now not making useless video
My respect for deji was high but now has gone higher
Things got real when Deji started crying 😢
Omg I really want to cry this is so sad
I hope people don’t make it into a meme. You can genuinely see that he is regretting about the past.
This video really shows how much Deji has matured. He has really changed a lot this year. He tried his best to avoid drama and not cause harm to others. He tried to not care about other people's comments about him. Much respect to you Deji.
Made me cry😢
Respect
Big respect to you 🙏
I got tears when he started crying
Big Up man
Deji❤❤💯
CELEBRATE CHRISMAS WITH THE SDMN AND UR FAMILY

Man I’m sorry for what your going through. I hope you can also forgive yourself. Don’t be hard on yourself when your going through times like this. Just know that if you are going through hard times, you have your family and you also have us. You will always have us and your family and no matter how bad your problem is you will always be able to control your life wether you would want to take a break of social medias. Do what is right for you and not for us. Love you Deji ❤️ We will always have your back the same way you have your brothers
Love you man,  we all do❤️

while we all make mistakes, what happened in the past is over, take the good things and learn from the bad things. no one knows each other than more than themselves.
I am one of these people 😂
I know a person that discovered the cure for asthma in Brasil

The inner soul is the real you take some time to see what your soul thinks, not saytan. Don’t care what people think cos at the end of the day they are the fools waisting their time on what you do wrong no human is perfect. Im not perfect I’m trying my best to love my self family. You soul your life go follow the thing that your soul thinks is right not the devil. I hope you guys are doing your best, Ameen.
❤️❤️❤️ always with you buddy no matter what 🙏🏻
Massive respect for this Deji! I'm a guy my self who also finds it hard to open up, but I've also done a video before expressing my depression and my mental state. So honestly thanks for this man❤
Tbh I started crying at 7:50
Something tells me that dej is sorry idk what tho
I have found a new level of respect for Deji after this. We all love you fam and its good to see you relieved again.

It would be so cool if you did videos w/ TJ, like dog challenges or stuff like that. Think we would all love that man

Keem in next video will probably be like Deji in recent video is lying and full of BS
let's get him to 11milion sub

🙏❣️🙏

Opening up and crying about your emotions towards someone doesn’t make you weaker  It brings us together
First time I have really seen Deji being honest much ❤️❤️❤️
I’m so sorry... 😭
YOU JUST MADE ME CRY
What a bell end... sad music as well. Ring him
I hope everyone really listened to the part where he mentioned surrounding yourself with positive people. As soon as I moved from a circle of friends that would always criticize me and say "you suck" to a more mature and positive circle, my confidence shot up through the roof!
respect
Glad that this will be the first Olatunji Christmas that's going to have a happy ending.
Setting a good example, much respect 🙌🏾
Big up Deji
Deji crying makes me cry
RESPECT MY G
Deji, no matter what, your people who appreciate you, are always going to appreciate you if your the leader you always were, youve gained so much in life, and its amazing how in the end you chose Family over friends, which many ppl struggle with. I just want you to know that your fans, the people who appreciate you, will always find a way to respect you. And to follow you, I know this since Ive watched you for a long time, Merry Christmas I wish you the best and same for everyone else.
I thought he was gonna say he’s adopted idk why😂
"Bad influence around me"... who? Your parents lol?
Wtf is this
Enough to make a grown man cry
we all make mistake, everybody changing
Big respect in fact I’m subscribing this and I normally don’t do this but you deserve it thx man
Love you Deji
How can people upload them selfs crying coz u know they watched it back. So fake
Big respect to you man 😊
This made me sad to be fare made me tear up I love my brothers and Ik it must have been hard for you two and love this and I love u both hope all the best and have a very happy Christmas
8:49 bruh i paused it on accident and then i saw this
I do NOT wanna see any deji crying memes
Big RESPECT DEJI 💪💪💪👍❤️❤️
My respect for Deji ⬆️
Look i hope your doing this for the right thing, not to gain respect back but just being honest, its been hard to know if you’re being truthful or just tryna make everything bad go away, i hope your doing this genuinely is all im trying to say, i do have faith that you are, but you make it hard to believe it, just keep being honest i guess, dont try to leverage yourself back to gain respect, make it come with time, try do more things behind closed doors and dont mention it and soon people will take notice
I think he’s really sorry
When he started crying I started to cry too 😭
Tf is this smoke coming from 😢
Claim you “Before 200K Views” Here
This gave me tears
Deji. I am proud of you. Thank you for opening up and i will always stick by you. Well done and respect to you ❤️
❤️❤️
Keep your head up king 👑
Love you deji❤️
Didn’t it say “it’s time to come out” or am I trippin
I really respect you Deji, your apology was from the bottom of your heart.. I felt it , it was real. May god bless all of you
I literally did this charity for my school, raised like £235 for the charity and I walked 100km more than required.
Who else started laughing then crying 😂😖
Tbh I couldn't even finish the whole video after he started crying...... Really felt it
♥️
respect deji, you can tell he meant it when he said sorry
I ain’t even gonna mock him this time I respect this guy for this
Ive never seen him breakdown like that man its heartbreaking
❤️
I'm reporting all the crying memes that come out of this
lowkey expecting he was gon admit he was gay, respect to deji tho
that hit me hard
Damn dude this is the first time I have cry to a YouTube video
Respect ✊🏽
Not gonna lie, some guy hiding somewhere next to me starting cutting onions when Deji was crying.
This made be cry , big respect to you deji🙏
I give you my thanks matey. Very much appreciated.
Man I can't stop liking every comment I see and big respect to deji
Don’t understand how this video can possibly have a single dislike..nothing wrong for a man to get emotional on a topic he clearly cares deeply about. Not much else to say rather than we love you Deji❤️
This is the guy we wanted back i am soo glad you made this video, hopefully everything comes back to normal, i think this is the best thing that has ever happened in 2020
Why do i smell a scary game collab comin
my childhood is slowly being restored
That was amazing message and have a good Christmas deji
Deji is legit the most wholesome guy on YouTube 🥺so much respect to him❤️
Legend 🙌🏻🙌🏻
Respect man
Nice hat ಠᴥಠ
The ps5 chilling in the corner be like 🤖
Nevet giwe up on your family
My friend recently opened up to me and my friends because we decided to give him a taste of his own medicine. He would purposely try to make us upset, but then say he was joking after we were already angry. Me and my friends decided to show him what it would do to him if it continued. We told him we weren't going to hang out with him anymore, and as much as it hurt, he was a burden to our future. He laughed it off at first, since we always make cruel jokes, but later, he came back to us and told us that he realized what consequences his actions caused. He started to cry and tell us what recent events had happened, and how he had lost his friends and his family stopped listening to him because of what he was doing. We told him it was a joke, but he already knew. He told us that he didn't want to lose us too, since we were all he had. We were the only people he could open up to and talk to personally. I never thought I'd cry for someone, unless they died, but knowing about what he's been going through brought tears of joy and sadness to my face
I love you so much Deji you great man !!!
The camera coming in crisp📸🤭👌
tha did help me
Wow that was really really genuine...so genuine that actually hurt... 😏
❤️
i wanna give u a hug
Aww ❤
He changed the title from "Coming Out" to "Opening Up" 😂
All my respect Deji.. That's how a real man act. You learn from your mistakes. Good luck with the rest of your journey. 👍🏽💪🏽
“I’ve always been hiding my feelings” Also Deji: IM, I’M TIRED OF ALWAYS BEING SEEN AS THE BADDD GUYYY
I swear the first title was "It's Time to Come out". I thought he was gonna come out as gay when I saw that, I think he changed the title though from all the gay comments 🤣🤣
I gotta say, I was in a bad mood, but this video made me better. Thanx Deji. Much support man.
This dude is a LEGENDARY GOAT. 🐐 Dude made me cry watching this.

I think the bible actually help him from the previos video(deji 2nd) respect💯
Deji next time you see him just give him a gift pick something that comes from the heart then tell him your sorry
You gotta do more of these man!  It'll help you when you make videos about these types of things, like talking about something that had been bothering you!  That's why therapy works so much, because you  get to show you're true emotions and show how you really feel!  Keep it up, Deji!  Been watching you for years and I love seeing you grow!  ✌✌✌
Actually....👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
This video was very touching and deji deserves the most respect after this!!❤️ Big respect Deji

Big respect to deji
The biggest lesson in life, is appreciate what you have, instead of being sad about what you don't have. Every human makes mistakes, it's our nature. It's not the end of the world. People go through rough patches all the time. Keep your head up. Enjoy every breath, enjoy every blink, enjoy the little things, some people can't even experience that, but you reading this, you can. Keep your head up. If life was easy, what would be the point of living. You got this.
Mad respect for Deji for doing this. I honestly didn't expect him to start crying
Man, this one was hard to watch. Don't think anyone can question whether or not he means it this time. Keemstar and everyone stay tf out of it and let them hug this out. Big respect Deji, you bout to grow the proper way from this 💯💯
not deji changing the title from “finally coming out” because ‘dont make it gay’
“Those who forgive themselves, and are able to accept their true nature... They are the strong ones!"
This is so wholesome mad respect for deji merry christmas to you and your family
anyone else teared up watching this??
I hope that you guys do a collab
Big respect to deji! Love the olatunji brothers!!
I'm not crying you are
respect
Love you man keep your chin up
Cheers ,Respect  Enjoy your Christmas
Big ups Deji, it takes a big person to express your true feelings. We love you, Deji!!! Can't wait to see the family all together.

I have severe anxiety and depression. I struggle to live my life and many times I just wanted to end it. I’ve been isolated from people almost 2 and a half years due to my depression and OCD. I couldn’t succeed any education and started to lose hope for my life and future. I didn’t have any energy. I feel all alone and have lost many friends through out the years
i love how he changed it from: ''time to come out'' to ''time to open up''😂😂
cant wait for keemstar to shit on this

Takes fucking BALLS to do this. You’ve inspired many to do the same no doubt. You are a LEGEND
we love you Deji
This was out of nowhere he just wants views
my respect for deji 📈📈📈
DEJI :))))))) really appreciate the video and the reason im saying this is because it hurts to see so many people terrified of covid when in fact the fear of it is worse than the disease itself. as is the "cure" to isolate ourselves and cause serious mental health problems. In the uk theres normally under 30-40 deaths a day from covid, compared to 450 for cancer, and driving accidents, ashma attacks, heart attacks, etc all and most of which are way higher than covid. like 0.0001% of young people die from covid and the cases are blown out of proportion as they are not weighed against the increased in testing. if you do your own research and see the real statistics on government websites like for instance total deaths this year vs the average of the last 5 years you will see that there is basically no difference. this whole thing is blown out of proportion even for the older generation. all the media companies/news channels in america are owned by 5 major corporations and they choose which statistics to show you google it.  WHY you may say? in just the uk we have collected 400 BILLION debt this year NEED I SAY ANYMORE? that banks collect interest from, that people pay the price for through taxes and inflation taking away from our own savings. in just the last 5 years everyone you know has lost 15-20% of their savings from inflation. keep people down and its easier to control them? same thing as how countries profit from wars, its not a conspiracy its a reality that we are ignorant too based on people taking advantage of our natural good faith. control information control the population control the money control the world.
Only respect deji it takes a man to cry on camera
big respect to u deji forgive yourself man
Respect have a good Christmas dej and don’t worry we all make mistakes
We love you deji
Fhaghot biych
KEEMSTAR:- this is free real estate

Glad it took a brand deal for deji to open up about being wrong
I’m not hating on Deji or anything,In fact I’m a huge fan of him,and I always was over the years but I can’t tell is he actually genuine in this video or he is just desperate for views.

Aye yo geez respect fam
Deji  We are all a work in progress. No one in their right minds can ever say that their perfect. Not even the people we look up to. I’m happy that you are opening up to how you feel, bringing up all the negative in the past and moving forward positively, and knowing that we will all make mistakes but as long as we look at them like lessons than everything will be ok eventually.  I hope that you feel better after this video.  Because after all of this   We will still call you “ComedyShortsGamer”  And just for a laugh  Bring back the challenges man we miss those.  Love from Maryland, USA
Maturity comes with experience big up deji!🤙🏼
God bless you and your family  Deji♥️
Man this is hurts my heart
if someone will make memes about this video than you should know that you are mistake of nature, god shouldn't have created you           YOU'RE A MISTAKE.

This vid is enough for a grown man cry 🙂
This is a real youtuber he is a good content creator and he loves his family
❤️❤️❤️❤️
I'm a high school kid on my senior year. I went to a school that's very far away from my hometown and family for a better education. Every 6 months I used to go back on holidays to visit my family and friends back at home. However, since covid hit I've been stuck at home alone with no friends or even family for almost 9 months now, and it's most likely still going to be that way for another 5 months. The sheer boredom from loneliness and unable to do anything with anyone has taken a major toll on my physical and mental health. I feel alone and sad all the time. I used to have fun playing video games or playing guitars or whatever but now I can't seem to even get out of bed. I've gained a lot of weight since the lockdown started and i still might gain more. I've tried talking to friends and family, but a lot of them are also going through tough times, and it made me uncomfortable to try to vent to them when they themselves are probably not okay. I feel alone yet I also seem to be closing myself up from other people. But after this maybe I'll give some friends and family a call. Thanks deji
Huge respect man 🙌🙌🙌
Are u MAD!! Why did u make me cry bruv
my respect for deji 📈📈
Better not be memes on this, ur the reason people have to speak out about hate

Thanks for the venting tips for among us
Respect Deji❤️

I love you Deji <3
A real man owns up to his mistakes and expresses his feelings
As Deji has shown, opening up is the best way to prevent stress and misery building up inside yourself. Don't be afraid to talk to your family about your situation.
Anyone else here before the title changed? 👇
Man I was in tears 😭
We fucking love you 🤘🏽
I don’t know how people can hate on this man he makes gaming and funny bites for us as fans we should protect him and hold him dear when he’s here

12:36 my mind when I'm imposter
Imposter teammates be like: 12:36
Just to make sure, the money made in this video is for the purpose of charity right?
I'm not a fan of Deji, but fair play to him for making this video and taking responsibility for his actions. I hope this is it now for all the Deji controversy now.
This video is jokes😂😂😂🍾
Good job deji
Respect to Deji👏🏼💯takes a man to make this video and say the things you said ‼️

"I didnt want to cry in this video"...  Lol yes you did. Yet, respect deji
@Deji i am also kind lonely, i dont like opening up bcoz i dont trust ppl.Most of the ppl i meet they wanna hear some1 story and use that agains u they dont try to understand how you feel. It takes for me very long time too meet good some1 so i could tell them anything about me.
he changhed it cuz his first title sounded gay its time to come out
I saw the caption and thought he was gay
Damn bless your soul man❤️🙏🏿
KSl need to watch it  Like it if you agreed
Big respect! No more crying memes

I've got family problems and I'm soooooo glad deji exists. Cause if it weren't for his videos, I would've blew up.

Damn
Damn this video hit different 💔 Big up to deji for clearing his feelings 🙏
Big respect Deji💯
This doesn’t make up for everything don’t forget he got many opportunities yet it took his channel dying for this to happen not when he was on top
Us men grow up very emotional when we grow up too close to our mothers and we adopt a lot of their behaviours that are bad for us men. Deji has the means to move out. He should.
It nice to see how much Deji has matured, Big respect to Deji
Wtf why am i crying when deji started to shit
Respect man ❤
Deji is all grown up now
The original title of this video was “It’s time to come out”
Shout out to deji too much respect for him but at the end of the day not everything was his fault
Respect man ❤
Big respect Deji, that hit right into my chest...
Guys Don't make Meme about this

I love your maturity and your personality in general

respect ✊🏾
Man !!! you're strong deji !!!!
Such a little whinge bag! Your a top bloke but stop playing a victim, use your enthusiasm to make you happy. Take some time and find your flow again. Ask the people that you blatantly miss to help!! No disrespect hope this finds you somehow x
keemstar: he is manipulating his fans and he wants attention and views
i started tearing when deji started crying i feel you deji i feel you
Is this a jab towards Jonswan??
I’m not crying, you’re crying..
Honestly you done the right thing , you put a lump in my throat honestly my heart broke x
I respect that!!!!!!
I recently watched a trilogy of videos by John Swan and Nicholas De Orio about Deji's bad behavior a few weeks back, and then I saw this, really shows that Deji is slowly becoming matured now. Feels good man.
All of your fans or always there for you deji even if we have never met
Where i’m the only one who shared a tear?
Finally the apology we all needed to hear, you have officially earned my sub back, respect for doing this man
😥
I don't usually comment on videos but whether you see this or not bud, we're all really proud of you just wantet to let you know
Absolute Respect to Deji
......... o my gosh 😭😭🥺🥺

They even made movember for Mo the editor
Am I the only one who started to drop tears while deji was crying?
Very strong video
People cry not because they are weak but because they have stayed strong for so long.....
This video was a positive surprise, very mature of you and goes to show how strong you are for making it

Brave man
I thought he was gonna say that he's gay
You can tell that deji has really grown over the past few months.
I thought it was a joke but sike
Apology felt really genuine, and was directed towards him. (Obviously youtube apologies are also directed towards us but I’m glad we saw it.) I’m sure he’ll accept the apology, and I hope you guys have wonderful and not so awkward Christmas. Only if that’s possible for you guys with Covid of course.
Signs that 2020 is about to end!!
Respect 👏👏
Ogs know he dropps a vid like this every year
thus guy is life changing and helped me come out to my family  thanks deji
Who did Deji used to hang out with? I actually don't know

I hope to god he means this, and not just for clout...
Goddamn even I’m crying and I don’t give a fuck
much respect for this
Take care deji, we're here for you!
Let’s go Dejiii❤️💪🏽
Shout out to Deji for opening up, takes a real adult to do that.  That being said, this may not be the time or place but ... I deadass couldnt tell if that was a fan or a PS5 in the corner
This seems scripted
I dropped some tears...  you are amazing
Hey just wanted to share this quote with you, I think it'll help you for the better, hopefully. Keep up the good work.  Choose your battles wisely. After all, life isn't measured by how many times you stood up to fight. It's not winning battles that makes you happy, but it's how many times you turned away and chose to look into a better direction. Life is too short to spend it on warring. Fight only the most, most, most important ones, let the rest go.
Respect man
I needed this thanks
Ok guys cmon no more slander on Deji
Big Respect 🙌💯
Aww man he’s gonna make me cry
You have already proved it 9:21

Honestly, mad respect for you man ♥️
Dam man big respect

And if you can’t see his pure heart in this,  then there’s something wrong with you 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
People are really disliking...
He got sponsored by Movember in December
I have 3 words: i love Deji
Did anyone else think his fan was a ps5?
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Big inspiration to everyone!
I felt like a proud father watching this, respect Deji
Honestly I like to see this it’s not  often men talk about their issues and it’s so sad but thxs deji for opening up 🖤
Only the real ones saw the title as "it's time to come out" before he changed it
This video looks like It got taken in 2067
Here's the thing, friends and the internet are different. These people will meme this. I would have rather for you to talk to him directly. That's that.
Respect deji👏🏼👏🏼✊🏽
I was gonna make a joke but I can’t
Omg. I lately DMed Deji to accept the things where he was wrong and learn from them. In one week he did. I am proud of you Deji whether you have seen my message or not. Stay Safe. Stay Blessed. Stay as a Family.
I don't understand why is Deji giving people the power to make fun of him? Certain things should be kept private, man! You crying is all good Deji, just don't put it online
This is really sad
DEJI WE LOVE YOU AND RESPECT YOU
in life self awareness and reflection is one of the most important aspects to personal growth. Props to Deji for making this video.
Hold up, it took you this long to apologize to him?? (No hate)
This is a great fucking video
Wish you and your family the best ❤️🙏
Mad respect man
Great video my guy👍🏻🔥
Respect DEJI RESPECT 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dam son
Big up Deji <3
This is interesting
King 👑
Deji s mom AA Are you mad
🙌🏽🙌🏽
This is not allowed to be on memes.
So proud of you Deji! No matter what negativity you're faced with stay strong and God bless! 🙏🏾
Man Deji is such a good person❤️
deji you made me cry
Can anyone tell me whats happening 😐
We with you Deji 💪
i dont know why i hear asgore mercy music in the background
he has a ps5 wow thats cool
You aint sorry for what you did you're sorry because you got caught, lied and tried to manipulate other people
fair play 👍
<3
It was hard watching Deji cry
W
Guys like kavos or keem or whoever will most likely keep bashing Deji even after being honest and opening up. I wish guys like them would just stop trying to bully or harass others on youtube they are just not worth listening to.
Deji, your fans will always love you, no matter what happens, never change, I love you❤️
I've always been supporting you and I will continue to support you for whatever you choose to do. I cried with you.
Big up to Deji for this video.  As someone who has survived suicide attempts multiple times, this video hits my nerves deeper than anything.  Family is everything in life, some people are unfortunate enough not to have many but any family you have is important to stick beside as they will always have your back no matter what.  Movember is a movement that helps soo many people, I’m so glad people are using this service much more now.  It’s okay not to be okay.
Respect to comedyshortsgamer
If you make memes about him crying this time, shame on you
Love
I've been fan of Deji for quite a while and I must say everytime deji involves himself in drama or made a bad call in the decision it's always hurts and made be felt bothered that he loves to made such thing and made those mistakes that would only hurts others and especially himself. But I'm glad that he definitely proves from these past few months about his change and I'm also glad that he's in proper control of his emotion now. And most importantly, he took credibility in all the mistake he did and didn't blame or try to start fire with anyone.
👏👏👏
Everyone liked this
Huge respect, I really felt it. Deji really did a great video.
man, this has me emotional.
I thought he had a ps5 in the background

This was needed 🙏 bless
We love u deji

Man went from "You're so stupid" to "I'm so stupid", I can tell he is becoming more mature
Am I the only person that feels like this video seemed a bit disingenuous. Don’t wanna come off as heartless but the editing during the crying bits was a bit much. I sincerely hope this was well intentioned and not for attention.
Only love for Deji man

Dont make mems on this video,pls guys comon we need to be serious about this and there problems.
I think I know which group of people is he referring to but I'm not mentioning any names
❤️🙏🏻
The start sounded like a school presentation or oral 😂😭
There's also that one kid who makes hate videos on deji.....not knowing what deji has gone through,and yes he has made some questionable choices but that's what makes him human,so to that kid...if  he even sees this, STOP,you are playing around with emotions and hurting deji who has already gone through enough already,we all have,so can we pls not end this year on hate
Ayy Deji is gay
🙌🏼🙌🏼
this guy needs to stop crying
*Everyone liked that.*
It’s good that you’ve let it all out because building it up is worse well done for showing your audience that it is ok to be wrong and being a good role model
Isn’t this supposed to be for November??? 🤔
Everyone in the comments at the start : haha coming out as gay haha   Everyone at 8:20 : damn 😬
No memes pls
Deji, ur a real one.❤
all love and support to deji for this one but I don't think reddit is gonna think the same lmao
Was I the only one who started crying
Well!! I didn't expect this to happen🤔
I love this guy so much man 😊
Honestly Deji, the progress you've made since that incident is amazing. I mean I was very critical of you in the beginning but now you've turned it around. Well done Deji, hope you and your family have a good Christmas and keep making everyone proud.  Edit: You've turned your life around and it takes some guys to come out publicly that you messed up.
Wholesome
Damn i thought he was coming out as being gay lol

Deji should go on a podcast.  Would be good for him imo
Respect
Big love to deji been watching him scinc the beginning he grown so much as a person
Big up and respect for letting it out
love u man
Watching this is making me rethink my life, I've let so much get in the way of me, like my depression, my ex, this covid pendemic, ect. I've lost so much because of it including my job and it's my fault I let it happen to me. I'll probably have a rubbish Christmas because I haven't been able to afford Christmas presents for my mum, dad my sisters and nieces and nephews. But I put that down to me for letting things get in the way and I shouldn't have. So deji man, I appreciate this video and it's going to inspire me to do things better and in the right way. Much love man ❤️ merry Christmas to you are your family ❤️
W vid🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯

Deji you have a strong heart. Strong soul. Don't my humble friend
Becoming a dad seems to make him more sensible          Or it could just be a sponsor.

❤️💪
Real man right here!

Powerful man, glad you've done this, a lot of people needed this 🙌
I should copy everything here and make a video for a school project. A+ forever video..
We love you Deji 💙
*I Thought He Was Gay.*
0:43   Ahh shit here we go again    No offense just a joke

He has ascended into the prime mindset. I love this guy. We love this guy. We love you Deji ❤️
Wow cheers deji this really brings tears to my eyes
Daym initially I thought its a joke, but its serious
I honestly have so much respect for you Deji not many people could do this
Class act Deji, all jokes aside this is a really powerful statement you’re making! Don’t let anyone take that away from you
i thought the title meant "time to come out of the closet" lmao
Respect, to open up like that is very manly and tough and especially through the internet, LOVE
A lot of respect ✊
deji dont cry fam you apologised its all good fam
No no. Please don’t cry Deji!
Deji: It's time to come out. Everyone: Wait, he's gay?!
I thought he was gonna come out as gay
Im positive evrybody who commemted hasnt watched the video yet.
Oh nooo
Can someone count how many time he said sorry
curre tly watching the video and when deji started to cry i felt his pain
💪🏻💪🏻
I’m not crying, you’re crying 😅
Man Dej Didn't Expect This...
At the end of the day, we're all human. We move forward and we forgive. Props for making this video. Here's to a fresh start
i understand your pain i have two brothers and when i hurt them i feel like this but your brothers always stick together no matter how bumpy the road
mad he started to cry
Almost made me cry only one ?
It made me emotional
Why has this video got dislikes? some “hater haterS”
Holy shit...well that was deep. When he started crying😳😳😢
Your brave to do this deji
Proud of you
Why does it sound so scripted
Takes some balls as a man to show your emotions to the world man. Massive respect man.
Men..I am really sorry to that there are still people considering this as a joke..all everyone saying "Oh I thought he is going to be gay, Oh I thought that, Oh I thought this" are just arrogant jealous peice of shit..keep up deji, stay positive
7:47 I understand we make fun of deji on Reddit about the crying memes but him crying here, we should not make fun of him this time
Deji: cry’s Keem: HE USED WATER
Deji has matured so much im actually very proud
I'm so sorry but the part where he start crying I was LAUGHING like ALOT But really this was emotional and I was so sorry for him
Wowww is this deji omg. Nice one!!
Omg 😭😭😭😭 Deji we are here for you!
Fuck man I broke down watching Deji cry. Everyone makes mistakes man. Youre a big man to own up to your mistakes
When Deji was crying I got and poop game add😳
Love❤️❤️❤️❤️
respect
Damn...
You are so brave for doing this..
y he crying😭😭im sorry
Respect.
For a second i thought u were Lgbt whoops i was wrong 😂
The fact that there are people still making these videos on Deji pisses me off, like the dude’s already acknowledged his mistakes and all that and ppl still wanna bring them back up to hate and it’s just childish man. People that own up to mistakes they’ve done deserve more respect than people that don’t.
Deji breaking down at 8:25 is really emotional
I honestly cried seeing this... i dont wanna see you cry man
Props to Deji is a real man
All of us want u to know that we have your back as well as your family CSG AKA DEJI.
When a real man cried 😞
Am I the only who knew deji wasn't coming out gay
The sad truth is that a lot of memes will come out of this 😔

BIG Up Deji...

🔥💯👌
Ahhhhh shit here we go again

Speaking up about mens depression. I respect it highly man, so many of us are holding it all in to "be a man"but that's what's killing us from the inside. Please I implore you to speak up!
Did anyone else’s think deji was gay when they saw the title
I thought he meant he was going to admit that he is gay, and we would all happily embrace him 😂, but this was better
All I can find is bots in the comment section
“Don’t make it gay “ - Deji
Not time for jks but when I saw the title but I thought he was gonna say he was gay ngl   Pls sub to me as well
deji its ok if your a little afaid to come out were here for you
