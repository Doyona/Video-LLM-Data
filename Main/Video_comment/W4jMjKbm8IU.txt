7:07 Foreshadowing is a narrative device in which a storyteller gives an advance hint of what is to come later in the story. Foreshadowing often appears at the beginning of a story, and it helps develop or subvert the audience's expectations about upcoming events.
7:07 this explains alot now doesnt it
1:48 fine = to shit rp to Tommy huh?
I prefer moaning tubbo
6:21 his voice is so beautiful and soothing to me. Why dosent he sing more?
Tommy with wet hair is something I never want to see again
Day 29-30: I have reached one month! Cool right! GERMANY
7:07 Wilbur...........
Did anyone notice he put sh!t instead of great
seeing ranboo still wear that mask even when hes alone makes me sad bro, looks like to me he just hates how he looks unless tommy told him he was coming but ranboo still looked shocked that he came.
seeing Tommy just going around the city, shooting the shit with his friends, it makes me miss it. I just got out of a very demanding relationship (it wasn't anything too too bad) and i never got the chance to do shit like what we see in these vlogs. I met up with my best friend who i lost touch with over the course of the relationship and we jsut went around the city shooting the shit like we used to and i loved it. It really made me realize how much i love living in the city.  this day was honestly a godsend, it made me rediscover who i am and what i love doing. just going on little adventures with my friends with no real destination
Wow, Tommy has grown so much hasn't he? He's an old man now 😂❤
As a Dutch person it is so weird to see adults wearing bike helmets, because in the netherlands you only wear bike helmets  when your 5 years old and just learned how to ride a bike
Finally I understand football
Does anyone remember the ksi video where Tom couldn't bike It was funny to see that he's actually learnt something new over his years as a streamer
Why does Wilbur not post on the Wilbur soot channel just asking
Tommy. my friends are fine subtitles. i have other plans
6:59 dudududududu easy come easy go will you let me BISMILLA nooo we will not let you go
Tommy: my friends are fine  Subtitle: my friends are shit
His hair looks so majestic in water and not in water
6:23 I am enjoying this bit please make a song with this beat it's soo soothing for me especially
First Tommy and now James, the jschlatt goat look continues
Jump in the Cadillac

i followed aimsey since they had a whopping 400 followers on tiktok and 120 twitch followers. i love to see how they've grown as a youtuber and twitch streamer, as i was in their lives with 1-2 other people watching.
Tommy with straight hair scares me.
The background sound is another thing that tommyinnit borrowed from Ludwig
Your such a good singer!
Tommy just crashed Ranboo’s PC 5:07
This is cringey and crazy to admit, but seeing tommy go on with his and make as many memories as he can has been one of the things that inspire me to just  push myself even further, continue to work on myself, and live life. This year has been crazy for me and I went back to see the photo of from last year to now and man…I can just say I’ve grown a lot. Keep making awesome content. 👍 thanks
1:48 "My friends are fine," *me reading the subtitles and laughing for five minutes straight*
O-O

Could you visit Germany with Ranboo, Wilbur and the others, that would be fun
Don't use the Lord's name in vain
Jesus loves you dont swear though
I love how Wilbur is just so unamused every time Tommy is near him
1:48 idk why this was so funny
im convinced tommy is good at singing
Tommy is the kind of person to see freddie and say:"is anyone gonna slam into that?" And not wait for an answer
I love this part He said “My friends are fine” But in the subtitles as he said that it said “My friend’s are shit”
Why did he sound American when he was singing-
angry tubbo
Jesus is on your side -Tubbo work harder-tommy

9:11 if wilbur says there's infinite sides then there's infinite sides.

Tommy: "My friends are fine" Subtitles: "my friends are shit"

2:15 GUYS NO WAY INNIT FOREHEAD REVEAL *LEGIT*
‘Now my friends are fine’ The subtitles  ‘Now my friends are shit’  1:48
"Please don't trow my pHONE OUT THE WINDOWWW 🎶🎶"  LOVED IT
Me and my friends were having a sleepover we all live in Brighton, and we randomly heard people singing outside all I head was “a muppet of a man” I look outside and I see someone running around while yelling, I never knew who that was until I watched the video 😂
Tommy “ My friends are fine “ The caption “ My friends are shit “
2:08  omg HIS HAIR
Tommy you should make your own song, you have an amazing voice

Tommy you never fail to entertain us. Luv all ur channels!
YOU MADE MY SAY IT! BALDY TOMMY
1:48 tommy: look my friends are fine  the captions: oh I have a whole different idea also captions: my friends are sh*t
Nothing says more brothers then Tommy only singing Wilbur soot songs
yooo he leearned how to ride a bike :) <3
This is why I know your spiritually related to Wilbur- because you both have the shittiest luck with fucking doors
Its so wild that i saw tom in channelnutpig and nutpig to him streaming in his childhood bedroom after school with his mom yelling him to do the dishes and then to living in brighton with his friends and making beautiful and amazing content. Its amazing how his channel grew and im so incredibly proud of him.
no bc when tommy was singing it actually sounded so good like he sounded like a british shawn mended😂
Global Mug
did anyone else notice that at 1:48 he edited in shit when he said "my freinds are fine"

‘It’s not funny 😒’ *CONSUME*
Look at 1:48, anyone notice anything 🧐
Argentina campeón del mundo papá
This hits different with the story that Tommy told
‘My friends are shit’    -subtitles

PEKABOO  tommy:AHHHHHHHHH
you should change your channel name to Xx_pogboy18_xX
how do all your vlogs contain at least one second of wilbur singing
3:35 yes the crabs will hit you
I think that James just has thirty  identical brothers who prowl around Brighton to appear in front of Tommy
1:49 when he said my friends are fine the words said shit instead
4:31 HAHAH IM CRYING
1:45 Tommy: now my friends are fine Subtitle: now my friends are shit
HIS LAUGH IS THE BEST 5:40 5:53 🤍🤍
Bro tommys music is fire
Tommy has two modes crazy homeless man or annoying child no middle ground
the bomb football thing got me, like damnnnn
I didn’t actually notice how much of a good singer tommy is
No cuz he sings so great.
James just exists. He's like an NPC.
okay, all wholesomeness aside….  TOMMYS  SINGING VOICE IS ✨ POGCHAMP✨
When I tell you I gasped because of the one second snippet of the song at the end
Боже, прошу тебя, подари мне таких же хороших друзей как у Томми, подари мне такие же хорошие летние каникулы... Пожалуйста
Im convinced that if you live in brighton you just see random streamers
tom simons i got these diamonds inside this whip you know that i be flyin ooh

I would spend my entire teenage paycheck if tommy would come out with a song

Ranboo looks like he hasn't left his room in decades
The fact that James just bombs this video like 3 times is so funny
After Tommy explained how people mistake him and Em as siblings, I made me think. Did Tommy get so desperate did he clone a female version of himself?
It made me laugh bc in the text he didn’t put fine he put shit instead😂
Bro, I keep coming back to this video and I never regret it
I love you
i just realized tht ranboo using our king merch Technoblade🥺
Nice…

Tommy is the type of person to see a shovel and ask "is anybody gonna swing that?"and not wait for an answer.
Omg why does tommyinnit has beautiful voice❤️I am in love.. When He was singing I was so socked
1:47 “My friends are FINE.”
WHY ARE YOU SO GOOD AT SINGING

Is it weird that I had the melodie from Tommy's song stuck in my head for three days after this vlog came out?
1:47 'Look my friends are fine,' The subtitles 'Look my friends are sh*t'
“I DID IT! 😄..I DID I-“ - James marriot
1:48 what tom says: my friends are fine text: my friends are shit
alright, I gotta say tommy needs to release some covers of Wilbur, Lovejoy and other artists songs (and his own???)
Im not an idiot cause i checked twice 😉
1:45 What he says: My friends are fine What the video says: My friends are shit
This is so funny to watch the same youtuber from 2019 and still enjoying all of his content. Ilysm tommy, thank you for all these wonderful years and experiences. I really want to meet you, but its too late now. I’ll be long gone. Thank you so much, for making my childhood. Just remember, up there me and techno will be watching you.  Love? tom ❤️
my friends are fine ( the cub titles said different )
This is such a nice video, it's really cool to just see y'all out having fun
4:33 This is the man I aspire to be.
Why does Tommy's dad sound like Mumbo?
yo, respectfully I don't think you have the best singing voice i see your very good at playing instruments so I hope your singing gets better lol btw you should go bald
Wait why does Tommy’s voice actually sound really good
they fr just watched miss rachel 😭

8:12 this bit floored me for no reason
6:26 YES WE NEEDD MORE
No but Tom is actually very talented at singing and playing piano n guitar
wilbur and james moments are so silly i love them
"Jesus is on your side" -tubbo  Wise words
NAH CUZ HE HAS THE HAIR OF PENNYWISE
James with his sexy face and boyish good looks/charms spawning in was the highlight of this entire video
Tbh I like the fact that he blurs his gfs face, the amount of hate content creators get. I can’t imagine the hate their partners get. Im sure she’s beautiful and it’s not a diss to her, but I like that they both get to keep some privacy in their lives!
2:13 it is now confirmed the thomas is the nevermind baby
Who remembers when Tommy went to the sea with tubbo and fell of the raft that they where on
A wild James has spawn
0:54 the head going up and down still gets me 😂
Tommy hairline reveal.
2:07 0_0
Tommy is the type of guy to see a door and ask “Is anyone gonna kick that?” and not wait fo- WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOU-
the part where you talk about your life is amazing. it was lifechanging so i subscirbed
I did not know his dad cheated :(
Yo tommy good job at gettin a girlfriend I’m real proud of you
"Peek a Boo, AAAAHHHHHHH" funniest part in my opinion
It's 2023
o
I heard bohemian Rhapsody
How is your phone waterproof?
1:48 the captions 💀💀
Wilbur was so happy he was being filmed that’s why the phone was almost murdered
ur actually cracked at singing
i loved our mini concert we got <3
How the heck did his voice do that
i was here before 1m B)
how come when tommy sings he sings it in a sort-of american accent...
1:45 HE SAYS MY FRIENDS ARE FINE, BUT THE SUBTITLES.... I CAN'T
Naked Tom Simons
Plz do a vid about technoblaed plz
Tommy is really the type of person to say to a door bye or whatever to it before w kicking it down but anyway Tommy your really good at music like ommm my gawd

my favorite part "they could win this if they just had a really big bomb" tom simons 2022
tommy i just wanted to say your singing is absolutely incredible and i also wanted to say that i love your content. keep going dude! your doing great!
Tommy is the type of person to see tubbo and say “is anyone going to marry that” and not wait for an answer
Damn Tommy's actually good at singing
its amazing how i was here before you were 18
Noone probably noticed but when toms said "my friends are fine" but in the cc it says "my friends are shit"?
3:19 you gotta trust Freddie sometimes, i jumped down 6 steps on stairs and completely dislocated my ankle
Bro at the first 10 seconds I thought he lived in Ohio or something lmao
Look At You  One Girlfriend
you need to try joining will's band or try making your own
I 18 too me and you Tommy 😎👍🍯
Tom: "Look, my friends are fine"   The subtitles: "Look, my friends are shit-"
in that one scene where he asked if he was balding he kind of looked like Erling Haaland just without his face only his forehead
We need tommy music
eighteen? E I G H T E E N? E.  I. G. H. T. E. E. N.? E. See more…

Im so jealous of his life in a good way tho. Cuz I get to watch them have fun and it makes me happy. Sometimes I just wish I was around their age and be able to be friends with them. But sadly I can only dream
Actually he sings so well it's cool
Tommy is the type of person to look at a window and say: is anyone gonna eat that

Yoo Tommy!! Nice vlog, anyways when I was in like 7th grade we had to write an essay on the topic of social media influencers like vlogers, youtubers and what not and I chose to write about vlogers so I got the idea to write about you and this channel and oh deam did it turn out well. I got an A+ and read it infront of the class and everyone clapped! (Of course I told everyone to subscribe.) Love your vlogs and videos keep it up!! :DD

ohmygod ranboos reaction to tommy's pick-up-line 😭😭😭
Tommy: My friends are *fine!*  Subtitles: My friends are *shit!*
I'm sorry when the door handle fell off I burst out laughing
I find it really weird how I've watched Tommy since I was really young with him in his childhood bedroom with his mum shouting at him to do things around the house, to him growing up, beginning music, living with all of his friends and all of the constant jokes of not having a girlfriend coming true. It brings a tear to my eye to think how far he's come.
the various legend of zelda music is slapping me in the face with nostalgia, man
Dying Channel
Well I talk to my dad silently XD 2:19
Me in the beginning: WHERE THE FAWK ARE UR FRIENDS!?  Me at the end: welp, I missed this 9 days ago so yeah, ur friends are so Kool I want to be friends with u and ur other friends(which would probably never happen so yeah :D ) :]

0:09 Relatable
I'm sorry to be a downer, but I know exactly which hotel that is. My sister got married there and lived in lanzarote, she had a son (nephew) who's the same age as you, he used to watch you. He would have completely lost it if he knew you were in lanzarote. Unfortunately he died swimming in the ocean in lanzarote 3 months ago from shallow water black out.  Seeing you under the water triggered me, then I saw you were in Lanzarote. Be careful holding your breath underwater because the body can't actually register when oxygen is low, we only feel like breathing in when carbon dioxide is high. So if carbon dioxide is too low, you can hold your breath until you pass out from low oxygen, which is what happened to him. You pass out under water.
i do not care thomas
3:34 i swear i saw a bum
This is a meme for sure lmao 🤣🤣 7:58

It is crazy how envy i am Just cause of their happy living life that they show us And what about me? Im just a regular child in Eastern Europe which wishing a better life then now. I really wish I was like them, living like them... With all human rights and dont blaming because of our g*verment(talking about Belar*s)  Sometimes i lay down on the floor while listening wilbur's music  and wondering "why am i even was born in this place? What am i made terrible in past life?" My floor is covered by linolium with Cuts on it, which glued with adhesive tape. What am i even writing.... Everyone who reading this i wish a great Day (and a happy life)
1:48 he said my friends are fine but THE SUBTITLES SAID THEYRE SHIT
Tommy: 'Right, look. My friends are fine.'  The captions: 'Right, look. My friends are shit.'
1:46 I saw that "my friends are shit " hrhehehheh
think the psychic reading in america worked
I'll be honest, if he would train his voice a bit he could actually sing a good sounding song
8:59 I died bro
Anyone else wanna a full album of Tommy signing Love Joy/Wilbur songs??? Especially Concrete, cause he nailed that shit
I love that James just occasionally pops up throughout the vlog, just like real life
i've read it
some bit's gotta go into the qoute book
Did anyone else notice the coomber radio??🤣
why is you're voice dead in the beginning
So nothing about this man’s chest hair?👀🥴
Tommy: "My friends are fine" Subtitles: "My friends are shit"

I love it when he says that his friends are fine but in the subtitles it says my friends are shit
tommy: LOOK MY FRIENDS ARE FINE...  captions on the video: LOOK MY FRIENDS SHI-
TOMMY! I just have to say one thing— CONGRATS ON GETTING A GIRL!!!! ❤
Las Malvinas son argentinas
he should make a song he was a pretty voice
Why did ranboo turned from ranboo to eret to alan walker for me-
He's so happy with his gf! Good for you tommy!!
I love how he just knows lovejoy songs
The fact that he said "my friends are fine" but the captions said "my friends are sh*t" 🤣
Tommy and Mr Simons humor is the EXACT SAME istg
“There were some naked people at the resort, but I didn’t film it.” Tommy has changed a lot.
Ranboo casually wearing Technoblade merch 😊
Its so funny, he "Look my friends are Fine" but the captions Said "Look my friends are shit" its the funniest thing ive seen today
Tommy to all his friends: I have a girl friend now! Hey you guys remember how I have a girl friend? Uhhh did I tell you how I have a girlfriend *flex flex*

1:48 tom: look my friends are fine Subtitles: look my friends are shit
Rottingdean Lets gooo
1:09 this gives such young Tommy vibes for some reason and idk why lol It might be because of the tone/cadence of his speech? like it kinda reminds me of the way he speaks in the "omg, a dead body?!😧" video of young tommy
The best part of being a young adult is not being an adult
I am very sorry for the inconvenience but who are you?
Imagine not having hurty eyes when in water because of the chlorine in the water 🙄
6:09 I thought he was joking, but not gonna lie I kinda want him to do a cover or some kind of song now like damn :0
My favourite part was probably at 7:57 HIIII Peek-a-boo☺️ AAAAAAAAAAAAHH
I dislike you British Boy ☕
I dislike you British Boy ☕
Tommyinnit: "Look my friends are fine!"   Everyone: "Thats ni- SuBTitLeS?? WhAt??"  Subtitles: "Look my friends are shit!"
You would never guess these people were grown adults sometimes... wait.. not sometimes- ALLtimes.
7:00 Wil looks so scared😆

Great job man Marvelous vlog if I do say so myself 😎
Tommy: My friends are fine.  Subtitles: My friends are s#$%!
Even in his new life, he still has the arms of an anorexic
Ranboo casually wearing techno merch
You’re the best tommy😃
Genuinely one of the funniest videos that I've ever watched. I'm not a superfan of Tommy, but there's something so charming about his channel.
Tom's voice is very good, I would love to listen to his songs if he ever produced any, or his covers.
makes me happy to see that tommy is doing so fine
Wait tom can ride a bike now?
tommy: "My friends are fine" tommy subtitle: "my friends are shit"   Ah yes
NOBODY NOTICED HOW HE SAID MY FRIENDS ARE FINE BUT CAPTION SAID MY FRIENDS ARE SHUT XD
tommy you and ranboo have a very fuckin weird relationship like it's not really just friendship but it's not really romance/bromance it's just weird
As a bton local it is so cool to see famous ppl at places I know
this man severely lacks body hair
Tommy i'd like to let you know i'm bisexual, asexual and genderfluid (they/them) love the lqbtqia socks
The very end from Wilbur’s stream when he was showing Tom some songs 🫠
Simon you gf plays game?
Tommy i have a worse hairline than you
1:48 Look my friends are fine… Captions: I say otherwise
Holy fuck you can sing like a god Tommy
Do you guys remember when he went to New York? It looks like he still has his keyboard from that series
Did you notice the subtitle when Tommy says his friends are fine
I love your editing keep it up <3

*gasp* Wilbur’s still alive?!!?!
lmao iam I the only one that realized when he said "m friends are fine" the captions said "my friends are shit" lol
We need Tommy songs I think. His singing voice sounds very nice 6:29
Must be a God with so many subscribers hanging on every word and facial expression.  THIS IS IDOLATRY, AT ITS WORST,      ISN'T IT?
James just shows up every time you have a side quest. ITS A SIGN
Everyone probably noticed, but at 1:48 he changes what he says about his friends in the subtitles.
"My friends are shit"
i prefer happy tubbo
When you live in Brighton to : I NEED TO TRACK HIS LOCATION 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀 ( not actually)
Tommy is the type of guy to look at Wilbur and say "is anybody gonna annoying that?" and not wait for a answer
Dam i didnt think tom would have that good of a singing voice
daddy tom
... Wt dopu mean person
That lightskin stare at 1:08 tho
Æ
FINE you say
Tommys singing voice is very different to what I thought it was going to be
After all of this, the best part was just making fun of the world mug
Hey that Freddie boi aka Badlinu
I think that song  in progress is gonna turn out great tbh
1:47 "my friend are "fine"
Tommy coming more like his “big brother” Wilbur his even playing instruments
Jesus is on your side….. there he is 💀💀💀💀
FUCK YOUTUBE FOR SUGGESTING THIS PIECE OF SHIT!!! YOU SUCK!!! 👎
How I sleep at night knowing Tommy and Wilbur live in the same city as me.
I just *know* Mr. Simons had a disappointed look on his face when Tommy said he didn't know who Bruce Willis was and only knew Mr. Beast
Why did he blur the pistol?
6:12 jump in the cadi-
Guys,we invite you to know the truth that Jesus was not crucified. The crucification of Jesus was fabricated. Jesus was raised to heaven by God to protect him from the Roman Troops who wanted to kill him. The one who was crucified his name is Aleskaryoti who wanted to guide the Roman Troops to the place of Jesus to kill him,so God punished him by letting his features to look like the features of Jesusand and they crucified him. Jesus peace be upon him is just a prophet like all other prophets like Moses, Noah, Jacob, Joseph, Adam,and Mohammed peace be upon all of them. They are just prophets and human beings like us.
Bruh I thought you were leaving and I was just like noooooooo don’t leave 😂❤
Guys, we invite you to read the translated version of quran into English.we invite you to know the truth that there is no God, but one god ,and Mohammed and Jesus are messengers of God. The God who created nature, human beings, heavens,earth and everything. Adam was created without father or mother.does that mean Adam is god or son of God. Of course not. Jesus was created without mother too as a miracle to the world, but that does not mean that Jesus peace be upon him is god or son of God. Wake up guys
1:47  Tommy: "look, my friends are fine" Captions: "look, my friends are shit"
1:48 "look, my friends are fine" Closed captioning: his friends are shit and thats the biblically accurate sentence
The absolute emotion in Ranboos sigh. I know i ain't the only one that felt that.
Tommy came out into the world choosing chaos

Has anyone noticed that he said my friends are fine the caption said my friends are sh*t at 1:47 lol

This is surreal. I remember watching tommy scream at sky block to get YouTube rank, and getting online to try and bid on his auctions. Now he’s 18? Living in Brighton, with all of his friends, making amazing videos?! This is insane. Congrats dude.
i love the faces added      :l :D   also, why is tommy's singing voice so good
Tommy singing sounds very American, its a bit scary
that hairline is so much more significant in water
my man is making music, living with friends, going out… tom is living his best life and i’m so happy for him
Never thought as of 2022 one of my favorite things about tomathy in-it simons would be his singing
I was just smiling while Tommy was singing :D
tommy: "my friends are fine" captions: "my friends are SHIT"
Imagine having the ability to speak underwater!
I’m laughing so much that he put that his friends are shit in the caption, but really said they were fine
I remember the good old days 2 years ago with techno and the SMP correctly but now its all gone
it’s awesome watching him grow up. i’m so happy for him. he seems to be in a great place and he’s super talented to
Tommy I’m a huge fan of you I watch every video you make 13 times! I’m subscribed to all of your channels stay positive stay happy and stay you❤️love from a bisexual
I never knew that everything could be so exciting.  Even going out of focus is a laugh riot.
He’d be so good as mr beans son
:>>>>>

Tommy how do you feel about looking like Jack Manifold. You will look like him.
Alternative title: Tommy and his friends acting like children

i have a worse hairline…😂😂😂
Phone is so waterproof I believe he is recording on a Nokia 💀

the way my jaw hit the floor when he started singing  LITERALLY IN LOVE WITH YOUR VOICE 😍
we need more of tommy singing 👏👏👏👏

His singing 😌🥲
1:48 lol
1:47  Tommy: "My friends are fine, but..." Text on screen: "My friends are shit" PLZ bro i died of laughter...AND 6:00 was a masterpiece. Everyone in his discord server including me are having celebration. Being a songwriter, everyone that i show my random lyrics to are like "oh thats so good you could sell that" and i sing it out and im like "I make it sound worse." HAHA ALSO, Just subscribed, feelin good. (im just now doing this because I am busy af and dont pay attention)
Tom: My friends are fine Captions: My friends are shit
Even though this kid is “annoying” he deserves this amazing life
I keep forgetting that you live in Brighton and could probably get to your flat in around 30 minutes by car
i love how tommy idea of making music is just covering wilbur.
lives can be
When Tommy says his friends are fine but the subtitles say his friends are shit lmfao
1:48
I'm watching this a day after my birthday 😃 It was my birthday yesterday
1:49 the subtitle lmao
I'm not sure why, but this is just already one of my favorite vids. It was honestly just so cool seeing Tommy having a good time. Love you king!
4:46 ranboo had a techno hoodie on… 😭
I love how instead of fine the editor put in shit insead
6:11 bro i remember how on streams when he started singing like naturally cool in the next second he would be back to "funny" singing but bro that is so awesome
Look at that, our childinnit is an adult. Usually with our favorite YouTubers, it’s where they raised us, but we raised him (no offense to motherinnit) AND he raised us. But he will always be a child in our hearts.
Life as a boy?
You are one of my favorite streamers, and your content is so amazing and funny. Never stop doing what you’re doing king <3
why is every tommyinnit fan gay
1:48 "My friends are fine" Subtitles disagree lmao
0:34 did anyone else notice that he wasn’t subscribed to his own channel?
i wish tommy made more singing content cause he rlly is soo good at it like woahh
Tommy seems so happy :)) 💛❤️
Tommy!! ❤️❤️💛💛 you have grown so much!! I have watched you from the beguinning <33
i like these vlogs sooo much more
OK??
5:07 bro I can’t 😭✋
I love how Tommy had to remind himself that he has a girlfriend before he makes any jokes
did anyone else notice that the subtitles said "shit" when he said his friends were fine?- timestamp: 1:48
1:48 the subtittles don't quite match up lmao
1:48…anyone else see that?
hi
I’m moving out of Brighton
Look my friends are fine(shit) ranboo looks like a nija
🫶🏼
Tommy: “My friends are fine” *The subtitles*: “My friends are shit” 1:45
I tought wilbur was on a tour with lovejoy
WHERE WAS MCC HAHA
Tommy needs to join Lovejoy. Sign petition below 👇
Bro has the peter Parker door
im hate angyr tubo
cannot believe i laughed at a clip of wilbur not even saying a single word
Wilbur casually trying to break/eat tommys phone is what makes me laugh the most
1:49 The caption say “my friends are shit” instead of “fine” lmaoo
KSI watching Tommy ride a bike:  *I've trained him well🥲*
Who are these spazzy randos who get millions of subscribers and make millions of dollars to film asinine content?
heyyy tommyyyyy
Who is your girlfriend
I love how wholesome this comment section is
I know I am not subscribed to this Chanel
I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THE WALES V ENGLAND GAME. WE (WALES) HAD A DISADVANTAGE BECAUSE WE’RE F*CKING SH*T
i would love to meet you in brighton
I'm literally watching this kid grow up. Leaving school, learning new ways of content, forming new friendships, and finally having his own home.  Feeling like a proud mother rn ngl
My sons name is Thomas spackman Alan Wood
How come I didn’t know about this
Tommy: “Look, My friends are fine”  Subtitles: “Look, my friends are shit” Almost missed it. The editor really throwing Wilbur under the bus, I mean slay I guess
He's an adult but he has a mind of a teenager
omg i was shocked his singing voice sound so good dude
Some people say there are multiple James Marriotts roaming the land of Brighton and all share the same memories through a hive mind
james randomly appearing is the most james thing i could think to happen
james is a grabdnpa
i love james so much man
And I thought that grass is dangerous.
It is crazy how a lot of us have watched Tommy from him streaming after school, with his mom yelling at him to do his chores, to him living in Brighton with his friends. It incredible how his life is and he has worked so hard for it, good job Tommy
what the hell?? TOMMY CAN ACTUALLY SING??????
I love how Tommy says, "I know, my friends are fine," but the editor says sh*t.
WTF THUMBNAIL
07:05 I love how the thing that Wilbur does is so random lmao
I live an hour away from you :>
tommy deleted the outro because he leaked the new song that wilbur was singing on stream the other day lol
Please do not drown Tommyinnit I would be very sad if you do
i NEED a friend like tommy in my life😭
I love how Tommy still makes the jokes he has always made then corrects himself knowing he has a girlfriend now 😭
At 5:53 his laugh sounds different 🤔😂 i love it 😆

1:48
Lovejoy is playing LEEDSFEST!!!! IM SO HYPED FOR IT!
1:45 Watch from here and read the subtitles 😂
1:48 he truly loves his friends
What tom says: “my friends are fine“ The cc: “my friends are shit“ 😭💀
The patient said, “I’m a man.”  The doctor said, “the tapeworm doesn’t care.”
I literally think about man or muppet everyday
Still can’t believe this is who I’ve been watching for almost 3 years at this point honestly I’m very happy for everything he’s helped me through
Ranboo’s living the mansion life. Also it’s nice to see you doing well Tommy :D <33
The music>>>>
Legendary
Epic
this made me laugh so much on a very stressful day. That was so fun! Thank you for the video and smiles!
Now that you live in Brighton I can finally find you and get your picture

I just want to say this (may sound cliché but anyways)  You deserve everything life has give to you, and for good reasons it was!  Happy for you mate! I'm here hopping that someday I could have a  happy life when I get older :) Also, about you making music, FRIKING LET'S GO!! I've seen so many clips of you singing and you're so good at it that I thought someday you could have a music career as Wilbur! And that bit on 6:23 was really good! And that also remind me that I have something of music that I'm trying to do but knowing a little of guitar and keyboard it's not the best, but I'll get better! Anyways, (to finish this Bible I've wrote here) I hope you're happy and continue doing what you like!
WHAT IS THE SONG HE USES AT THE BEGINNING
Tommy: My friends are fine Captions: My friends are shit Editor, do you have anything to say for yourself?🤭
you are incredibly influential

Tommy making content:  James Marriot spawning in randomly: 🧍‍♂️

The cutoff at the end lmaoo
"look my friends are fine"  the subtitles say otherwises tom
i did not notice this video until now LMAO
Has anyone realised The bit at the end is a bit of an unrealeased song?
Tommy: My friends are fine Subtitles: My friends are shit
God so loved the world, That He have His only begotten son, so that whosoever believes in Him would be saved. (John 3:16, Bible). We have all broken God’s moral law and have gotten the death penalty. However, Jesus lived a perfect life in order to take our place and endure the wrath of God. He did this because He loves us so much! Repent from sin and trust in what Jesus did for you so your sins can be forgiven and forgotten. <3
♟ A chaotic life for a chaotic gremlin child
THE MUPPETS.
Bro wait tommy can SING???
It’s crazy to see the difference between the first vlog and this one wow
Tommy bought flowers and I thought to myself that's nice he's getting flowers for his girlfriend. When he gave them to Ranboo I wasn't even surprised. lmao
Damnnn
tom simons can you answer my math problem (-3w^5)(2w)(4w^3)^0
At 1:45 - 1:50 more or less, you can see that while he says my friends are fine in the subtitles it says my friends are shit
Oh nooo, I wanted to hear the song NOOOOOOOOO

Just Tommy loving his friends 1:48
"My friends are fine"  Subtitles: *SHIT* "
Who know they never let go of that camera when they get stupidly surprised to see a fish.

This made me have a nice feeling
4:59 anyone else see the PS5 behind Ranboo?
Tommy you have started to become peoples comfort person. i saw so many comments about how much you make them happy. This isnt good. STOP IT. Be more uncomfortable

It’s so cool to see your favourite YouTubers and streamers just hanging out and living their best life. Also Tommy’s so good at singing like seriously
The fact that Tommy got flowers and gave them to Ranboo instead of his girlfriend is sending me😭
When he said "my friends are fine" but the texts spits "My friends are shit" I laughed like a menace. Good work editor

tom:I am a mannn  me: you wish you are a man child
Your father is a good camera man....
He went from a screaming child that refuses to do dishes in his bedroom to a man with a girlfriend, living in Brighton with his idol and friends. Absolute progress and wild, Tommy.
I love how he says “my friends are fine” but the subtitles say my friends are sh*t
Megalovania топ

bro the singing part
I’ve been watching since April last year and I’ve loved seeing him grow. Proud of u bro
Glad I could watch Tom's character development to adulthood
My friends are fine the captions say otherwise
1:47 Tommy : look my friends are 'fine' Subtitles : look my friends are 'shit'
PRIDE SOCKS POG

1:48 look my friends are fine  Look my friends are shit
Audio: "Look my friends are fine..." Subtitles: "Look my friends are shít..."
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO NOTICED THE SUBTITLES SAID “My friends are shit” when Tommy actually said “my firends are fine?”
Tommy, you are literally my idol/inspiration. Your lifestyle, just the way you do everything whether if it's scripted or not, even the behind the scenes that we don't see, I want it all. Your life is literally my dream and while things may not turn out the way I want for it to be, im glad I got to watch you grow into an amazing young man. I hope your life is awesome and you are treated well. Good luck with the girlfriend.
"he's probably out there with his friends, cheating on me"  him and friends in question: 9:40
I want more Wilbur content
Legend has it the but with ranboo isn’t finished yet
Bro Tommy ur singing is absolutely 🔥🔥🔥
Women are not real. You sead it yourself self.
When Tommy's swimming he looks like saul goodman
https://youtu.be/zKPhjkw3Y84 rubid
daang you are good at singing
I don't know why but your just absolutely unfunny now
This honestly makes me so proud on how far he has come and how many friends he has made along that journey
Tommy and under water reminds me of bully maguire for some reason
We need more girlfriend content🙏🙏
Tommy whenever I wait for your videos to load up I aggressively breathe just like you
Am I the only one who wants to see Tommy make music? Like?? He sounds so good???
It’s been what? Two years? I watched tommy since 2020 and I have to say that I’m so proud of how much he’s grown to the fact he has a WOMAN, like- pop off king! I’m so happy of how far you have gone!
tv: peek a boo  tommy : aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Tommy slowly becoming Ash Kabosu?
7:55
HOLY SHIT TOMMY MAKING MUSIC SLAY
bro how do yall keep your eyes open underwater
is this said life BY THE SEA if im gonna be honest i need a little space to breathe
1:47 "My friends are fine-" The captions: "My friends are shit-"
Seeing tommy living the life I can only dream of(for now) is making me genuinely so happy, seeing him have fun, laughing and smiling is making my day
1:47  No one talking about how Tommy said that his friends were "fine" but went on and subtitled it as "shit" 😆😆😆
I prefer happy tubbo
why did wilbur eat me question mark
1:49 “my freinds are fine” subtitles: my freinds are shit.
When he sings he sounds so weirdly good
1:48 "Look my friends are fine" Subtitles: "Look my friends are shit" XD
People will agree with me when I say that Tommy is actually pretty good at singing
I love and admire how him and Tubbo have been best friends for so damn long and are still the same people.. Lots of people just kinda move on with new group circles/new people. But tommy keeps them all close despite always meeting new people. That's a genuine person right there. This was heartwarming to watch.
My favorite part of this so far is when Tom says "Look, my friends are FINE" but the subtitles say "Look, my friends are SHIT", it got me cracking up.  Edit: I adored Tom's mini concert, it completely slipped past me that he could play ukelele, that was very nice.
1:48 “look my friends are fine (subtitles[shit])
HE HAD A GUN
I Don't know tommy can sing.
This just warms my heart
Look my friends are fine (shit)

this gives me so much serotonin- it's awesome you're having fun with your friends, mate. Your music is really cool, too!
HOW AM I 9 HOURS EARLY
Well, at least Tommy admits he doesn't act like an adult.
Did anyone else see that the caption said “my friends are shit”?
Amazing.
i freaking love how you used music from TLoZ windwaker hehehe
Did anyone else notice that right here 1:48 tommy says his friends are fine but the subtitles say sh1t. It’s hilarious 😂
OKAY. ONE MORE TIME YOUTUBE DOESNT GIVE ME THE NOTIFICATION FOR THIS CHANNEL. IM KILLING SOMEONE
Following in Wilbur's footsteps of door problems
The “my friends are crap” at 1:48 😭
YEAAAAAH MORE TOMMY SINGING CONTENTTTT I love you can tell hes always having so much fun when he does it :)))
i love tommys laugh when hes with his dad :]]
Bro it’s actually really good music dang
love your videos tom!
I play a lot of instruments, manly violin and I can concur, writing lyrics is very hard as well as just singing it while playing an instrument
There's a moment at 1:47 that I found oddly funny He says "look, my friends are fine" but the captions say "Look, my friends are sh**"
PLEASE A MOD PUT ME IN TIMEOUT ON THE YT STREAM OR MAYBE TOMMY IDK BC I WAS SAYING BALDY INNIT
Wassup
how did tom fall off the bike but freddie didn’t
He's a man now
Istg, Tommy's so weird sometimes but we love him for that haha
9:22  I’m American so it’s funny to see them watch soccer against us XD
goat
7:06 *eats camera cutely*
Is it just me or... ARE TOMMYS EYEBROWS ON FLEEK IN THE THUMBNAIL
1:49 💀💀 my friends are fine (shit)
Dude I swear to god, make ur own goddamn song, im begging uu
Thus is fucking stupid and I love it
"Tommy: My friends are fine" "Caption: My friends are SHIT"
He is so happy to say he has a girlfriend!!
Ranboo really got an ego boost 😂💕
1:48 “ my friends are fine” i see what you did there 😅
do this again it was funny
Tommy is amazing at singing-
I love how they can just show up and invade each other’s videos
i DID NOT know you had a girlfriend    👏  Edit: 1:48
We need music by Tommy!
this video alone is going to get me through mid terms
Tommy your really good at singing
guys I don't think the Ranboo bit is over... Em might have to watch out /j
5:07... I feel like I need no further explanation
1:48 “look my friends are (shit) fine”
James spawning in everywhere seems very in character
6:00 NO WAY
Water resistant and water proof arent the same.
holy shit david from soot house
TOMMY SINGING MAKES ME SO HAPPY FOR SOME REASON
He was tired of his old one, so he decided to reborn. Rejoice! Tommy reborn!
Not the caption saying "my friends are shit" when he said "my friends are fine" lmao💀
Tommy should make music too. He is very talented! ❤
Yes
TOMMY IS BACK AT IT AGAIN
does this count as early?
4:29 LITERALLY CAN'T STOP MYSELF FROM LAUGHING AT THIS FACE
his new life
6:04 lmao he said he’d never get into music and look at him now
tommy singing lovejoy's music is just so wholesome for me as someone who lives for wilbur and tommy's dynamic it makes me really happy, and it makes me smile to see how far he has come :)
Its not bad I’m a minor and I’m more bald then tommy lol 😢
1:47. Look my friends are fine".  Then captions : look my friend are shit
Actually agree with Wilbur on the semi circle has infinite sides point
10/10 my thirst for tommy content satisfied after this banger
Just got done having a big talk about my friends depression, was sad nobody else knew, THEN THIS DAMN MOTHER FUCKER HERE AND THIS BITCH SOMEHOW MAKING IT BETTER, TOMMY DEPRESSION CURE?
2:19 I think I actually understood that
It's absolutely wild to me that I have watched Tommy grow from streaming in his childhood bedroom after school with his mom yelling at him to do the dishes, to living in Brighton with all of his friends and making amazing and uplifting content as a full time job. So incredibly proud of you dude...I don't think anyone can say it enough
Tommy is Lovejoy's number one fan and no one tells me otherwise.
2:15 A fish named Tom: :0 :| :0 :|
No matter what happens in a day, I can always go to Tommy’s channel to find something to make me laugh :)
It's so cool to see how you've grown in the past few years. And congrats on getting a girlfriend! I love seeing you and all you friends hanging out and making people laugh. You're so confident in public it seems like you never get embaressed (the opposite of me). I watch everyone who was in this video and I love seeing all of you guys together. Also, you have a great singing voice! Can't wait to see what lies in the future!
Dang bro calm down what is em gonna think
okay but like, tommy is actually REALLY good at singing and playing music
tommy actually pretty good at singing
7:02 Wilbur kinda looks like he’s cosplaying Revivebur
1:47 my friend are fine
Weird how i started watching this kid when I was a year younger and now he grew up by 2 years and it still hasn’t been a year for me and now it kinda seems like he’s lying even though he’s actually not.
Tommy singing is one of the greatest things that exists on his channels
Amazing to see loves lovejoy and is making his own music. I really hope we can see his on music in the future.
Is it just me or did anyone notice that when Tommy said “My friends are fine” that the caption read my friends are sh*t
My friends are fine lol (shit)
1:47 "look my friends are fine" I think the subtitles disagree
4:44 Hey you 💅😩
Since when did tommy become good at singing XD
YAS LGBTQIA SOCKS WELCOME TO THE CLUB
"Look my friends are fine" captions: Nah they're pretty shit
HELP- I CAN'T STOP LAUGHING AT THE CAPTION 1:48
Tom is honestly a really good singer surprisingly
1:48 did anyone else see that lmao
"Please don't throw THE PHOOOOooNe OOoooouT THE WINDOOoOOOOOOoOoOoOOOoWwWWWWW" Tom Simons, 2022
Are you a Brighton fan now?
It's sad but nice to see Tommy grow up and slowly get more mature
This video makes me very proud of how far Tommy has come. He’s grown so much and I’m very happy for him :)
6:22 is genuinely the most heartwarming thing I've seen from Tom in a while, just making his own personal music so proud of him and all the effort he puts into his content <3
There are two channels”   Tommy out it  :: ….. “2?..”
You can't tell me otherwise but Tommy has an amazing singing voice
6:15 Yooo. Music!
6:54 IM ON YHE VERGE OF TEARS HAHAHGAAG
You sing very well!
This was so wholesome I loved it ❤❤
Me taking Tommy girl never get a girlfriend until now 😮
YOUR SO GOOD AT SINING OML
it's amazing to watch people grow up and excel in what they love :)
How do you keep your eyes open when swimming??
Tommy is the new baby for the nirvana logo
is it just me or was toms music like super amazing
Look my friend are fine! The subtitle: nuh uh you said shit. (1:48)
8:51 *burp*
6:54 WHY IS FREDDY SO THICC-
Tommy you actually got the girl? Wow I wonder how she puts up with your annoying voice.
❤️
Why is Tommy oddly kinda good at singing, he fits the more upbeat sorta music really well, you know the kind that gets you moving and would probably have one of those moments where they say something and take a pause then pick it right back up or throws in a joke somewhere along the way
I liked how the door actually broke 0:10
At 1:49 the editor made the subtitle say “shit” instead of “fine” and think that it is the funniest Easter Egg in a Tom Simons video.
Tommy: My friends are *fine.* Editor : Your friends are sh*t.
Tommy resisting the urge to say sex jokes
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Better title: I respawned
4:01 isnt this where model buses was filmed?
Nah I just like the zelda music in the background XD
This brightened my day so much, seeing tom do the things he loves while being with his friends is so fun to watch. Never stop being you king!!
ive loved growing up with tom.   also he should make music
Did know one notice what happened at 1:48 ?
1:47 just read the subtitles
Yo cna you try with this lyrics: 6:23  Some times I feel like the  lonely one yet Sometimes I feel like can just fly~ Just fly~  ( what you think )
I prefer happy Tubbo, thank you
M HI
Ayoooo so cool that he makes music
Oh my god you sing so good
"my friends are fine, but no...." *the subtitles said otherwise*
My friends are fine subtitles my friends are s***
nice uhh socks
editors changing my friends are fine to say my friends are shit in the subtitles was comedy goals
Tommy: My friends are fine The subtitles: My friends are sh*t LMFAOOOOOOOOO
I love tommys singing voice so mutch.
1:48 look at the sub titals and listen
im sorry but he is so good at music, he should like release something,
Tommy: "I have a girlfriend." also Tommy: * buys flowers for Ranboo * ALSO also Tommy: * goes on lunch/breakfast date with girlfriend * ALSO ALSO ALSO Tommy: * makes some gay jokes about Tubbo * ALSO ALSO ALSO ALSO Tommy: "I'm straight"  I-i'm confused
Your life is great and you deserve better than this too💗, it's funny how you can accidentally meet your friends on the street🤭!
bro finally pulled
Not to be rude but what LIFE?
The part when he said his friends are fine but the text said they were sh**… yes
Now people I know what you might be thinking, “How TF did Tommy get himself someone”. Now I have a couple guesses: he’s lucky, simply put at the right moment at the right place. He has a persona: he is completely different off camera than one and this whole being a child thing is only for the bits and outside of that he’s actually mature and like-able. Finally he is the same person both on and off and he somehow got the Rizz to pull off the dub in which in that case god help us and the world has flipped. You’re welcome to confirm or deny my hypothesis. But listen to me people of the internet, this serves as inspiration that if someone can tolerate this (potential) child then anyone can get someone special ❤
No bc something about tommu singing makes me wonder.... Music Creator on the DL 🤫
Aww, I missed this. I love this energy <3
i miss Wilbe
vegeta hairline
TOMMY YOU YES ONE DAY I WILL JOIN DA DREAM SMP AND BE HAPPY ONE DAY I WILL SEE YOU SOON I AM KID 0>0
I guess Tom's dad will die hard with old references.
When it comes to chrismas…i hope tommy replied to me comment LoL           ✨Merry chrismas TOMMYINNIT✨🫡
man this is so cool
Nobody:  Whenever James appeared: *a wild James appeared! It used spook you from the background! It was very affective!*
MF stole LUDWIG’S SONG! Tommy is Ludwig’s child at this point.
I really just enjoyed seeing you happy and the singing montage was amazing ❤
5:07 for some strange reason I don’t think the bit is over quite yet

Finding a James in the wild is a rare chance
This is so god damn cool
my friends are fine replaced with shi💀💀
Tommy: look, my friends are fine Subtitles: *shit*
It’s so funny that he said “my friends are fine” and in the subtitles said “my friends are shit” 😂😂 I can’t 1:48
ngl I was clicking on this thinking I were going trans
James: we can't watch YouTube they already are 3 seconds of silence later The other two: Huh?
Tommy is living every teen's dream, congrats on all you've achieved in all this time :) I remember seeing "a week in the life of Tom Simons" like it was last month and now it's already been over a year... man, time is crazy to think about.
At 1:48 when he went “My friends are fine” the subtitles went “my friends are S H I T” Also Tommy is really good at singing at that part was so wholesome 😭
1:48 look at the subtitles💀
8:05 my little sister watched her, her name was Mrs. Rachel or something
Man watch the die hard series lol
Mmmmmm yes enjoyable
vlogs like this make me appreciate life. they make me look forward to my future and the memories I can make when I'm older
Ranboo was confused as fuck when Tommy popped out of nowhere 🤣🤣
i did a try not to smile challenge while watching this and i failed he never fais to make us smile :D
E
PINELY!!!!!! 7:19
Tom:”my friends are fine” Captions:”my friends are *SHIT*”

Love that at 1:48 he says his friends are fine but the subtitle says shit lmao
i cant believe how a year ago tommy was getting taught how to bike and now he’s actually biking 💀
I loved this video so much- It made me smile so much.
Tommy: My friends are fine Captions: My friends are shit
When he said "my friends are fine the subtitle he put said "shit" XD
Him:Look.. My friends are fine! The captions:Look.. My friends are sh!t ( 1:50 is the time of the caption)
1:47  Tom: "My friends are fine" Caption: "My friends are shit" LOL
Tommy’s the type of guy to see a streamer’s house and say “is anyone gonna break into that?” And not wait for an answer
“Jesus is on your side” -Tubbo 2022  “Work harder” -Tom Simons 2022  True words of inspiration😌
1:48 😂 I can’t rn
Lovejoy Snippet lyrics maybe -  Da Da Da Bap Buh Ra Bap Pa Ra-  Nothing says I'll miss you quite like (evidence?) (I brought?) (Your Soul/Warsaw?) i dunno hard to understand
You’re so gray at singing and music and general! It’s awesome to see! :))
7:07  This had to be the most heart warming part ❤️
Tommyinit is the type of person to ask, “is anyone gonna film themselves underwater?” and not wait for an answer.
Whens the first tommy song? He really does have an amazing voice!
1:48 "Look my friends are shit" lmao
James is so vivid
SERIOUSLY TOMMY YOU ARE AMAZING!! I love the song/little piece you were doing! If you gave me a tune, I could write down some lyrics!!!
1:48 “my friends are fine”  The subtitles: “my friends are shit”
I like Tommy’s singing
is it just me or did the “a week in my life” video felt like it was only posted yesterday
More more more more
i enjoy these close views on tommys life it makes me feel more contected with him! i enjoy him and his girlfriend to they seem so cute and i can tell shes so funny
Watching tommy hit his friend with his bike immediately brought me back to when ksi taught tommy how to ride a bike
bruh who is billzo
What happened to slime
he can ride a bike now ☺️☺️
This is just wrong, you're MEANT to be a 16 year old, time needs to stop doing it's thing.
Damn... tommy CAN SING!?
This is my new favorite Tommy video
Low key wanna be his friend SO BAD! Great video tommy! Always making me laugh lol
How is his phone water proof
Tommy is the type of person to look at a girlfriend and ask "is anyone gonna badly flirt with that?" and not wait for an answer.
You should get a picture with Jordan Matter! He takes photo challenges from subcribers in his channel. 🙂
Is no one gonna mention when he said my friends are fine the subtitlee said  **it
you inspire other people to make better content, sometimes forcing a change in the youtube content. PLEASE CONTINUE. youre the best.
Is it just me or did anybody else notice the difference between what tommy said and the caption at 1:48 lol
Guys help last I heard he was moving to America?
New Vlog gun pog😂😂😂
Lmao Tommy:my friends are fine  Subtitles: my friends are SHIT
8:24 why is jacksepticeye in the background?
Ash Kaboshi style but with more of the annoying talking, aye-aye?!

I laughed so much watching this it made my day :)
ranboo does deserve flowers
I’m going to see Lovejoy in 3 days!!!!
OH MY GOSH MAKE MUSIC PLEASE
the subtitles “look my friends are shit” while hes saying “look my friends are fine”
Tommy is living his best life you like to see it
Hey Tom
4:49 this is so strange but I love it.
I love him saying that his friends are fine and the subtitle saying they are shit XD
Ksi training him to ride a bike paid off lol
his energy makes me so happy! it was a long day today and i got to come home to this! thank you tommy!!!
1:48 YOUR FRIENDS ARE WHAT NOW?!? (Hint: look at the subtitles)
IT'S SO HILARIOUS THAT JAMES ALWAYS IN THE WILD
damn so the fortune teller was right crazy hm
Tommy: my friends are fine...  Him editing:my friends are fine(shit)
I love just seeing what Tommy does in a week. It’s so amazing and it makes my day lol <3 I love your vlogs Tommy! :D
I dislike once you started singing
I love how he says "My friends are fine.." Yet the subtitles beg to differ.
Average Bri'ish life:
Wait, JJ- he actually learned how to ride a bike
Is Tommy’s girlfriend the Statue of Liberty?
=)
Tommy: My friends are fine Captions: My friends are Shit  LMAOO
1:47  Tom: My friends are fine His subtitles: My friends are shit
when he's under water it looks like he's got a bowl cut💀💀
1:47 Did anyone notice that when he said his friends are nice the words shit cam up witch was so hilarious
His voice is so pretty :0
Am it he only one who didn’t realize the whole moving to America thing was just for that one video😭
his singing is, genuinely, so pretty. i hope he releases his own music one day. i love how much we’ve seen him grow as a creator and a person. it makes me really inspired to do something like that myself one day this is my favorite community ive ever been in, and im glad to be here
Can we appreciate how he says "my friends are fine" and the subtitles on 1:48 states "my friends are shit"? xD
We need a house tour now
Tommyinnit is so. GET RANBOO OUT!!!!
When Tommy was singing Am I a Man or a Muppet I immediately thought of an animation from @metophoricallyrose
I love how you can see how good of friends he is with everyone its really nice to see :)
Bro's being haunted by James Marriott
These videos where we see more Tom Simons rather than Tommyinnit is better imo
Still can't believe that ranboo changed his entire being to act as Tommys girlfriend. Great job ranboo! That was some wonderful acting!
Tommy's singing is so adorable 😭
Tommy flirting with Ranboo will never stop being funny (even if he has a girlfriend now)
1:48 look at subtitles
What’s the first background song? I like it
2:08 I am under de water please help me,
Tommy: my friends are fine.  The editor: I disagree.
"my friends are shit." - tom simons 2022 -comics
1:48
He wasn’t Kidd when he said it was gonna be wholesome😭😭😭🥹🥹🥹
HELP THAT PART TOMMY WATCHING MS RACHEL...(my baby cousin watches her..)

The man that... is still a child xD  Just kiiiiiidding, keep being yourself my friend.
1:48 lmao he said "my friends are fine" but the subtitle said "shit"

yo hold up, tommy can unironically sing
HE HAS A FUCKIN BOWLCUT ITS HILARIOUS  glad your havin fun tommy, take care yourself. EDIT: this is fucking wholesome
Did any one else notice at 1:48 the subtitles are different then what he says
This video reminds me of Ash's vlogs and I love it
You do not know how happy I became when you sang man or a Muppet. Made my day.
Huh, Tommy singing ain’t bad
tommy singing lovejoy is my new religion <3 /hj
Tommy's vlogs always make me so happy, but this one was just different. I couldn't stop giggling and smiling the entire time. It felt like home to me, but also something like a new boost of seratonin
Mid singing voice
I love the subtitles in the ‘my friends are fine’ and the subs saying ‘my friends are shit’
"My friends are fine-"  Subtitles: "My friends are shit."
Are we not gonna talk about Tommy  and Ranboo
Tommy: "My friends are fine" Captions: My friends are shit 1:47
I love your vids AND YOURE SO ✨A M A Z I N G ✨ and your so funny keep it up   And I just feel like saying this but I got a Giant day gecko 😍
Child
Is no one going to mention that little subtitles Easter egg at 1:48
I would 1000 percent listen to Tommy's music !!!
upsetting lack of wagamama content in this one tom, gotta say
1:47 “my friends are fine” captions: *no*
* tommy holding gun *  “Give me all your money” “No” “Alright”
Excuse me but who knew Tommy can sing? Because he should produce some music
i hope it ends
Tommy singing was supreme
Tommy’s the sort of person to see Jack manifolds hair and say is anyone gonna eat that? And not wait for an answer
gonna end up accidentally getting a fatherinnit reveal on the shine of tommys head from baldness
6:10 if tommy ever comes out with an actual song my life would be complete.
7:00 is that just fucking revivedbur in the wild???
the outro is just perfect
I Hope it Burns down
Love the vids tommy keep it up.
Tom: my friends are fine Captions: my friends are shit   1:47
Egg in it
did tommy really get ranboo flowers and carress their fucking face xDDD
The way he lives his life is like a fever stream to me
had a very not good day after finding out about some stuff and this made me smile
Scientists have been working for years trying to figure out which is more appealing: Happy tubbo and angry tubbo
I swear when ever James get close to the camera like that it’s always like a jump scare
1:47 they way the caption says my friends are shit after he calls them fine 😭
Tommy got a singing voice!
THAT SUBTITLE THING OMG
Wait your 18 now? Well happy birthday toms and its one of my teachers birthday today <:
Tom: my friends are fine Captions: my friends are shit  1:47
Tommy seems to be living best life.  Like Yes, King! You do you!
Tommy I hope you know how incredibly proud and HAPPY we are for you!
Well that was lovely and wholesome and great hec yeah :)
Tommy you never act like an adult
Oh, is this vlog gonna be like that "Month in my life vlog" ??!
1:49 Tommy”look my friends are fine but I know…..’ Subtitles “look my friends are shit but I know….’
1:48 “My friends are fine” 🫣
the way Ranboo just sighed XD also why his house so fancy???
GUYS i found a spelling mistake! go to 1:48 and listen to it. he says,"look, my friends are fine") but down its says "look, my friends are shit')
NEW TOMMYINNIT VIDEO??  And no one told me!??!!
Can you do more of these videos
That lil music bop you wrote is sick I wanna write lyrics now damn my brain
“My friends are fine” he says but the subtitles say otherwise 😂
1:48 the captions say otherwise
Watch Wilbur copyright strike thsi just bc he was mad that tommy filmed him(that would be realy fucking funny)

Wow tommy is a really good singer :0
Ngl, Tommy's vlogs make me wanna move to Brighton :>
"My new life!" *Standing on a tall building "...is now over!"

Iraq

This is my favorite video. Tommy you are actually so cool
i know some people will be looking for it, so here's the link to the video he mentioned in the beginning (: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6qFdyC5DCI

Thats why I am paying YouTube

Why is no one talking about his singing!?
This is how you know you’ve made it keep up the great work tommy you’ve really come so far and seem like your having a great time.
our door handle has been doing that for arounnd a year now, now our door doesn't really lock
You barely post This is amazing And to think this was 5 hours ago Like OMG
Wilbur’s the kind of guy to look at Tommy’s phone and say, “Is anyone gonna smack that?” and not wait for an answer
I wish I had friends like this
I said to myself “awe he’s getting flowers for his girlfriend” then it pans to Ranboo and I just start nodding my head “his girlfriend”
Why do people dedicate so much of their brain into comments all I was gonna say is "haha handle go brrr"
I only hope you grow bigger and better tomtoms you're the kinda guy i want kids to grow up watching and loving
Last song is the new Lovejoy song they’re gonna release :D wilbur sang that on stream to tommy but muted himself so chat couldn’t hear it
"My friends are -fine- shit"
He’s riding a bike. I’m proud
I kept on laughing at the part where Wilbur tried to throw Tommy's phone out the video! Love the video!
"look, my friends are fine (shit), but i know what you're wondering."   im dead
Is it a given at this point that every vlog James Marriott is in needs to have a slightly cross eyed James close up
My classmate has lgbtqia boots!
Tommy. I need a Pokémon Scarlet and Violet stream. Begging.
Tommy:look my friends are fine  Subtitles:look my friend is shit  Did anyone else notice this😭

wilbur being a cat 1:31
Yay 4 h ago
Yeah this seems just about right
1:45 my friends are "fine"
Tommy is the type of person to see a naked person, and say, “is anyone gonna film that?” And not wait for a answer.
these vlogs are my favourite :)
Nice
Tommy is so sad that giving flowers to Ranboo is awkward now.😥
tommy: * has a girlfriend * also tommy when he sees flowers and remembers he knows where ranboo lives:
Jesus loves u
just had a dubious fart
My friends are fine Also subtitles:🌞🫥🫥
5:05 And yet, the bit prevails~  Honestly though, so proud of you, boss man :] You’ve come so far and you seem so happy with everyone in your life. Can’t wait to see what happens next! <3

Hi Tommy! My friends are saying you starting to drink. Is this true and that means.... YOUR 18????
Tom: My friends are fine! Also the text: "My friends are shit"
7:13 does anyone else recognise that music? please tell me im not crazy
“Look my friends are fine” omg the subtitles changes fine to shit.
Tommy is the type of person to go, "Do you want me in your house??" And not wait for an answer.
At 1:48 the subtitles don't quite match
1:48 It’s the subtitles that say “my friends are shit” at the same time he says “my friends are fine” me
Loved the contradicting captions
Did anyone else notice that a 1:48 Tommy says his friends are fine but the captions say they’re shit?
tom: "my friends are fine" the captions: allow me to introduce myself
1:48 the captions vs what he said 💀
2.6k th :)
Bro this was epic also Tommy maybe you should've given those flowers to Em or your mother
1:48 pay attention to what is said vs the captions
Tommy not to insult but still your girlfriend is kinda being a shit. you were called a virgin for all these years and the only time you wont she just wants to make suspense
Awwww This was so sweet. Also The music was so good!!
I will anger the british       Soccer
1:48 The subtitles   XD
4 HOURS AGO?!WOT
i am very jealous of his singing voice.
I like the premise that this video implies ranboo wears the mask in his own house
I need to hear a full song of tommy
1:47 daaaaaaaamnnnnn
8:46 Wilbur is just in the background like: -👄-
Did anyone notice that at 1:47, Tommy says that his friends are fine, but the subtitles say shit? LMAO
The lovejoy snippet omg
Tommy: my friends are fine Subtitles: my friends are sh!t
Thomas: "My friends are fine" Subtitle: "My friends are sh*t"
when he says my friends are fine but the subtitles say shit
hey tommy......                 jump in the cadalac!
1:48 “my friends are fine” Captions: “my friends are shit”
why are there so many roblox bots
I refuse to believe you’re older than me-
I LOVED THE SINGING AND JAMES MARRIOT IS REALLY FUNNY
The fact that a big YouTuber can find another big YouTuber by complete coincidence while going out to lunch is so funny to me
2:13 A BOWL CUT?
Tommy watching toddler videos is so iconic
I like these videos...
im glad tommy is happy
lol at 1:48  “My friends are fine” Captions say otherwise 😂
vro isnt even subscridbed to his other chanel
I like all the totally original songs he made can’t wait for them to be on spotify
You can tell they are gamers when they get so excited to see a fish
THE SINGING VOICE IS SO
5:06 poor ranboo 😆
james marriott scares me
I want to pinch his cheeks like a proud grandmother
Love u <3
Loving the bit where Tommy say my friends are fine and it writes my friends are sh!t
4:40 -5:12 WHAT THE HELL IS THAT??
“Look, my friends are fine” *CC: shit*
You seem really happy :) it’s great to see man, keep it up
I saw the flowers and immediately I said he is going to give those to Ranboo. I was right
You need to promote this channel on your main man!
this is a fucking fever dream
I love how he says”my friends are fine” and the texts say “my friends are shit”
bro tommy innit actually sings really good
Another amazing vlog, Tom! Much enjoyed, bossman!
Whatttt Like... Tommy can sing so gooooood Its incredible!
Hey tommy. I know there's an extremly low chance you reply to this but I was wondering how likely it would be to get in contact with sadist. Im making a 3d recreation of her work. I would love it so much if you could make this happen. If anyone sees this please like this so tommy can see
growing up? whats that?
imagine having so many friends you just bump into them  ive only experienced this once
Tommy: My friends are fine    Subtitles: My friends are sh*t
THIS WAS SO GOOD AND FUNNY I LOVED IT!!! its probably my favourite tom simons vlog so far!
Broooo tommy's singing voice is so goood!!!!!
Tommyvlogtommyvlogtommyvlog :0
He is so incredible at singing
Tommy - "My friends are fine" Subtitles - "My friends are shit"
There's so much singing in this one but my favourite part has to be the "to his flat~" in 6:12
Ah yes the caressing of Ranboos face lmao
new James Marriott bit, randomly showing up in the background and taking over the vlog
2:57 - 2:59  IM GOING BACK TO 505

i need to consume this video its so silly
Best moment 7:55
Best door ngl
him saying "my friends are fine" and the subtitles saying "my friends are shit" is so funny to me
ALLIUM DUO CONTENT.  It’s amazing to see how much Tommy has grown, yet he still seems to be the same amount of stupid.
Still so very shocked Tommy has a girlfriend
I like how YouTubers just spawn in Brighton
HI HI TOMMY I LOVE THIS VLOG  BYE
James carried
My friends are fine (shit says subtitles)
I've said this before and I'll say it again, we need tommyinnnit covers of all the lovejoy songs
tommy’s finally getting some action 🥳🥳
1:47 LMAO THE SUBTITLES
💜
Was I the only one who noticed that he said fine but the subtitles say shit or is it just me…💀
Poor Bruce Willis
Why does James with a flat cap give me schlatt vibes, chaos and genius at once
oh my fucking god, david soot
how has tommy somehow still found a way to continue the ranboo and tommy bit? even after its meant to be 'over'??
Omg I love his singing voice 😭😭
does anyone know what song wilbur is singing at the end?
living your best life, as you should
Tommy : “Look my friends are fine….” The purple subtitles “Look my friends are shit.” 😂
Technoblade :(
Wilbur at 7:03 : it's not funny🙄 Also Wilbur: nom
tubbo, Wilbur, Techno(rest in piece) and dream bust through the door with tommy's nerf guns* 5:52 your chin looks like giga chad
Am I odd for only watching you on this channel and not your other one? I prefer these videos personally. 🌸💗🌸 I love watching you
7:07
I’m convinced Tommys girlfriend is just Ranboo in a wig and their pranking is
I'm this blog there was an extreme lack of cursing and I am disappointed so 8/10
I love the closed captions at 1:48
Don't worry Tom, bald genes are inherit from the mother's side. If your mum's dad is/was bald, you may be.
💫Jump in the CADDALAC💫
Can we take a moment and appreciate how good Tommys real singing voice is? like wow keep it up king!
Nice to know that Tommy ALSO randomly sings Am I A Man Or A Muppet very loudly
HAHAHAHHAHA sound: "my friends are fine" subtitles " my friends are s h i t "
At first I found you quite annoying but that changed!
Tommy seems like he live his best life and i think he does really deserve it. this guy is just amazing. He's living in Brighton with his friends have a girlfriend and making content for living at 18 and i my eyes this is truly amazing and motivating.I love to see how his life changed since the start and these vlogs are reminders that behind the camera and the vids he's a great people who deserve every good thing that happening to him❤️
How did you meet James twice, also, you never cease to brighten my day.
I think it'd be fun to sing with you
Tommy: Obviously, my friends are fine-  Subtitles: my friends are shit-
8:15 me in the shower 😂

Loved this vlog also love Wilbur singing as the outro 💜💛💜💛
And people say Tommy isnt good at singing. ❤🥰
Loved seeing Tommy sing Man or Muppet because my friend just did at my school's art club a few days ago in fromt of like 15 kids and then proceeded to fall on the floor on his back.
1:48 The subtitle don't look right.
i love the fact that james marriot just spawns in literally everwhere
When Tommy said "my friend are fine" the subtitles said shit and I'm now dying
Always a win when we get Music Tommy content
u can see how big it is of an accomplishment 4 him 2 have a grilfriend. he's bragging about it, and its as big as a third world war.
"now look, my friends are fine..." subtitles "fine" as "shit" 1:47
1:47 ‘My friends are fine.’ Subtitles/text at the bottom: ‘my friends are shit.’
At 1:48 his "My friends are fine" but the subtitles say shit got me so bad. Like I don't even know how
man its crazy to think ive been here since u put the very first vlog out on this channel, absolutely insane, you've come so far man and just keep getting better, i really love this style of vlog, just vloging little bits here and there and putting it altogether, just having a good time with your mates and as always, advertising tubbo wherever you go, hope to see another vlog like this sometime in the future, until then cant wait to see what you do next
1:49 LMAOO “my friends are fine” subtitles: “my friends are shit”

Living
Tommy is the type of guy to look at YouTube and go “is anyone going to break that?” and not wait for an answer
What life?
The vlogs are just so amazing, I love this
Tom under water is a whole mood 😂
Tommy can you say: ' je kanker moeder heeft de tyfus'. in your next vlog it would make my day. my unborn grandchild has been hospitalized  due to playing to much fortnite and i dont know if he is  going to make it
o my god HE GOT A GIRLFRIEND
1:48 Captions team has some strong opinions-
tommy: my friends are fine subtitles: my friends are sh!t
Did anyone notice when he said "my friends are fine" the subtitles said "my friends are sh*t"? (Also damn tommy that's some good singing can we get some lovejoy covers or something?)
1:41 Wilbur looks so f*cking tired 😂

I swear Wilbur always eat the camera
1:47 THE SUBTITLES HAHAHAHAH
1:48 LMAOO IM SHITTING TEARS
Hearing the muppet song at the end made me happy

1:49 how the subtitles say shit when he says fine I can’t-
My gosh how shit have changed
This is my favorite kind of tommy content
I know the exact person that makes those kids sensory videos ... My baby cousin watches them
Hi tubbo
Honestly Tom is such an inspiration to me as a small content creator, Funny Fellow British boy
Tommy isn’t even subscribed to his of Chanel
We need defly more of this.
why the hell does James Marriott keep spawning
Did you see naked men or woman
count what you have now dont count what you dont have
You've come a long way big man
tommy im so proud of you omg
5:09 THE SIGH??? RANBOO WHY-
Why can he actually sing?
Late gang wya 😭
Wilbur must really like the taste of camera
my favourite type of vlogs
8:23 I- is that Sean McLoughlin in the background??? Like- no seriously is that- is that him or am I crazy-   Wouldn't be the first time we've seen him in a Tommy video yet im still surprised everytime-   Even if that's not him and just looks like hom-
Hiiiiiiiiiii sorry I couldn’t watch this when you posted it I was in school
Uh oh
congrats, big man 👍🏻
if you did the math eight about 1,121 people comment every hour.
Bro
Wait ranboo moved to Brighton? How’d I miss that
"plEAse dOnt thrOW thE PHONE OUT DA WINDOWW"
If I go to Brighton I'd probably find a wild James
Bro said his friends were fine, but the captions had other ideas
5:10 ooh wow gayyy that is pretty gay
Anyone else realize that when tommy sings he loses his accent or at least his accent changes 🤷‍♀️ excited about the music he's working on though
I recognise the bike paths and rock pools that Tommy, Tubbo and Freddie were on from going on holiday to Brighton many times
"Strange teal colour"
Wom
Tommys singing is my favorite thing
Tommy: My friends are fine Captions: *My friends are shit*
Not saying he's bad, but can someone get Tristan Paredes.
bro is a multimillioner, is 18 years old and still doesnt have a car 💀
1:48 don’t think I didn’t see that, Tommy
Nice
I see this after I get home from a bad day 😍🫶
I'd actually love to hear Tommy'a covers of Wilbur'a songs, bet that'd be great
5:50 just realised that Tommy has a split chin
This gotta be one of my favourite Tom Simons videos
Tommy: "My friends are *fine*" The sub thing: "My friends are shit"
FINALLY A NEW LIFE VOG
That forehead tho. SHEEEEEESHHHHH-/j
Loved this
I love how the captions said my friends are shit right when he said my friends are fine💀
Potato

2028th wooo
7:59 when life gets hard
This just warms my heart, it's so nice to see the joy they get and deserve
He has grown up so fast 🥺💜
I love how he says his friends are fine, but in the caption it says his friends are shit - XD - 10:05
Your friends make me want to harm myself
Im  really proud of you tommy you made it all this way and i hope you get your girlfriend flowers and not ranboo lmao.

SMILING SO HARD :]]

8:11 Coomber Soot
imagine being so humble that you still get the bus
tommy: my friends are fine captions: my friends are shit
“My friends are fine-“  The caption   “My friends are shit-“
6:24 Lyrics are very easy for me. All I would need is what I want the song to be about and stuff. I struggle with instrumentals 💀
i'm surprised by how much stuff tommy does in a week. Extroverted people are truly something :D
I love your vlogs
I really NEEED a friend like Tommy jsjs❤️
"my friends are shi- fine!"
oh right.
"look my friends are fine" subtites: "my friends are shit"
At 1:47 Tommy says "My friends are fine" and the captions are "My friends are shit" XDD
Great video, Tommy!
You can ride a bike now?
“My friends are fine.” Caption: *hehe no ;)*
Tommy has grown from a boy into a man
Bro has the most beautiful singing voice I’ve ever heard from a British person
anybidy else notice the caption says sh!t while he says fine at 1:48
It's been years, yet he is still the annoying child we subscribed for.
Usually when you pull a door handle it breaks off
Who are you voting for?
His singing voice tho even if it was a joke or not
RAAAAAAA YOUR SINGING IS SO GOOOOOOD KEEP IT UP CHAMP
lovely video as always :))
7:57 hahahha
WHAT IS THAT MELODY?
You and Wilbur ranboo and Bill so should be called the Brighton boys
I'm proud of you king 👍
Hi I'm Chad Bussy
"This channel has 5 MILLION Less subscribers"
1:48 Bro the captions  I laughed so hard at this lmao
Is anyone gonna talk about 1:48?
Why would you let tommy ride a bike, he learnt to ride a year a go we all remember that
6:24 okay but that sounds genuinely really good, I would listen to that even if just ba dap da
hello
oh man. the last week in a life video was a year ago? how time flies. no, literally. i cant believe ive been watching tommy for like 4 years
tommy in video: my friends are fine tommy in subtitles : my friends are shit
I love this style of chill vlog so much:DD
Whats the song wilbers singing at the end
James Marriott is that VERY Pokemon on Pokemon go that you get every time.
GIVE US THE MUSIC CONTENT NOWWWW
WILBURS NEXT SONG HINTS
Notice in the ranboo vlip his pc blue screened
2,200th comment
Tommy says my friends are fine but the caption says my friends are shit. 😂
This was a very therapeutic vlog for me
7:58 lol
why is the tubbo moment actually so cinematographic and aesthetic
Who else is probably always laughing at these vids
Did nobody see this at 1:48 when he says my friends are fine but the captions say sh**
It’s about time you got one
1:47 The caption😂
I need James Marriott to quietly spawn in the background of every Tommy Simmons vlog. It will be our "find the Marriott" moment
James is a npc fr
He said “my friends are fine” and then wrote “my friends are shit” 😂🤣
i'm comming to brigthon
So what's the difference between SpongeBob and Tommy🤣
im sorry but does tom have chest hair????
man i can't help but feel proud. I'm not even that much older than tommy and i haven't been a fan for that long but i feel like i watched him grow up a bit and that simultaneously feels really weird but also really sweet. <3
I can now say tommy and tubbo have sat in the same seat as me
bangin cinematography tom
Tommmmyyyyyyy why is it that when I went to England the burgers all tasted soggy
Pog
They say there's 75 per cent chance to see youtubers and streamers in the wild if you visit Brighton.
This was so funny thank you
Alternative title: Tommyinnit irritates his friends for 10 minutes
Wilbur is the type of person who would look at a tom simons and ask if ‘anyone’s going to eat that’ and not wait for an answer
the captions make toms videos 1000% funnier
these are my favorite things ever
i love how tommy is living his best life :)
Anyone else realize that when he said, "look, my friends are fine..." the captions instead said,"look, my friends are shit.."?
Don’t read my name
Don’t read my name
Don’t read my name
NEED more vlogs like this, these are so cool
ligma?
i love how Ranboo really does live in a mansion. Rich bastard  its really neat to see the inside of Tommy's life, the chaotic style of filming and the nature of half his friends being content creators makes each vlog so explosive no matter what they are doing. They have the comedic timing down and its honestly heart warming to see how much fun people's lives can be
am i a man... or am i a muppet?
Okay i didn't expect Tommy to sing that well-😳
Stupid silly yet genuinely heartwarming :) Love it when you film these kinda things
james just appearing from nowhere is so funny wtf 😭
god i hope tommy never decides to make a song        Unless he spends thousands and thousands of dollars on autotune.
This is such a fun vlog! all of your week/moth in my life vlogs are my favorite!
I’m early
1:48 my friends are fine  Subtitles: "shit" smooth, editors.
Tommy: "My friends are fine." Subtitles: "My friends are shit."
Nah he’s somebody to break a door handle
I WATCHED AMSYS VIDEO OF YOU COMING IN HER HOUSE I IMMEDIATELY KNEW
WHEN THE DOOR HANDLE CAME OFF I LAUGHED SO MUCH 😂 and when James just appeared in the video I laughed so much aswell
Tommy is good singer
make a song your really good at singing
You know it's gonna be on fuck of a comedy show made by a madman when Tommy posts.
BANGER VLOG
4:31 Omg GDHASHGDAJHSJHD
I love this so much :)
Tommy is the only reason I get excited to get older
I always get sad when I remember people have a life
aaah i love lil update vlogs like this!! :))
yeah you really shouldn't play around with a shovel. i messed around and managed to cut my lip on the side of the shovel. i put the shovel on a fire and waited for it to disintegrate. Have a nice day and stay fantastic. <3
Tommy actually has a good singing voice
Tommy first think when he sees his girlfriend:Despacito
AYYY

Tommy: "Look, my friends are fine" Subtitles: You sure about that??
how much urine do you think he swallowed in the pool
Why this guy got his eyes open in the pool
Tommyinit: My friends are fine.. Subtitles: *my friends are shit*
Tommy singing Wilbur’ songs is such a cute thing and I love it 😭
1:48 Tommy: "My friends are fine" The subtitles: *s h i t*
Yay
I generally want to see Tommy make a music video
When he says “my friends are fine” but the caption says “my friends are sh*t” 😂 at 1:46
Rambo pc crashed

My friends are fine (they're shit)
Tom: “My friends are fine”  Subtitles: *My friends are shit*
LMAO THE WAY HE CASUALLY PULLS THE HANDLE OFF AND CALLS IT A SMALL PROBLEM 😭 this guy is too funny wtf
1:48 when he says my friends are fine the subtitles say my friends are shit
tommyinnit
Bro Tommy is so good at singing what the hell
When you bought the flowers, Ranboo was the last person I expected them to go to, silly me
The part where Tommy says music time and the proceeds to sing lovejoy and Wilbur soot songs 🫶they are brothers your honor
Favorite part of video( 1:48 )  ”my friends are fine”  the caption: My friends are shit
when you come back to New York
Was I the only one who noticed at 1:47 when he said his friends were fine the subtitles said shit
DAVID!
You live in my name lol
love you tommy!!! <3 <3 <3 very rad
work harder. :]
tommy: “man, if i’m gonna be honest—“   *drowns*
Tommy speaking: "My friends are fine."  The captions: "My friends are shit."
5:23 seeing tommys dad explains so much.
I love your vids tommy and were all proud of you for everthing you have a girlfriend and learning new things whats fun to do is watch tommy grow up and watch the childish things happen
God, you’ve come so far king. I am so proud of you mate. You always impress us <3
love how when he says my friends are fine the words say shit
2:07 bruh how does he keep his eyes open without feeling PAIN
no
2:17 omg I went to there bro I'm going to Brighton for Xmas 4 hour drive omg
Tommy: "Look my friends are fine" Caption saying: Look my friends are shit
Funniest Moments (in my opinion)  0:11 "i will open the door" **breaks handle** "oh well, guess no opening the door then"  7:05 Wilbur: "it's not funny" also Wilbur: eats camera  7:33 James: we can't watch Youtube, they already are! **VINE BOOM**  8:25 "So-" *"oh shoot someone's robbing my house"* "HEY!" *"nvm"* "what are you doing in my house?""  8:45 "cheer up david" "strange teal color" "the lads are on!" "oh right"   _THE END_
Ranboos so fuckingfed up with Tommy its actually so funny💀✋
1:48 look at the subtitles lol
It's crazy, I get deja vu from where he has been in Brighton!
IS THAT THE NEW LOVEJOY SONG
HE CAN PLAY INSTRUMENTS?!?!?!!
damn u got out of the house in luxury newest vid and now u live in Brighton?? Nice man im so happy for you!
Tommy is exactly like his father like father like son I guess
Backrooms
“Look my friends are fine” said tommyinnit  Me “the captions say otherwise”   The captions “my friends are shit”
Wilbur munching the camera is everything 😂
Dude ur vlogs just keep getting better and better :D
My friends are fine the subtitles bwahhaha
tuh tuh tuh, tuh tuh Tubboo  Hi (PEEKABOO) AhHHHHHHhHH  I'm A MANNNnNnN
Seeing tommy living the life I can only dream of(for now) is making me genuinely so happy, seeing him have fun, laughing and smiling is making my day
freddie badlinu saved a fish's life... can we give him an MBE?
i love your vids this is so fun to watch
Tommy's actually grown up so fast what the hell
1:48 of course "FINE"
No one:  Not even a single soul:  Wilbur in every vlog: *eats camera*
Tom Simmons
I hope Tommy knows that baldness is through the mother so if his maternal grandpa is bald then so will be Tommy
Ash kabosu feeling vlog
I actually thought Tubbo would get hit by a car there
Wilbur chomps the camera
I still don't believe he has s girlfriend tbh I'm still convinced he paid a girl to act like his gf for the video
Him :  'my friend are fine'  Subtitle : 'my friend are shit'
His singing is so amazing
that was really cool
5:09 i cant tell if the act is over-
6:05 i love bruno mars songs please teach us how to sing them
Just love the fact that the subtitles don't say what is really being said.
Although he is crazy, he is so funny and a good singer 🖒
Why would I take sertraline when I can just watch these videos?
So proud of how far you have come man! So proud of you!!
poor door handle
HI TOMMY
tomy has whent from aning the f out of wilber to just anping
just rushed home to watch this love your videos man
1:48 the cc vs what he actually says. I can’t 😂😂😂
Bingus
Pretty sure this wasn’t a typo 😂 1:48
Tommy: My friends are fine. Subtitles: My friends are shit.  Ah, yes. The inner thoughts no one gets to here.
My real question is why is Ranboo trying to choose an operating system...
"Look my friends are fine"    The captions : $hIt
Best kind of vlogs tbh
YOOO WHY IS HIS SINGING VOICE SO GOOD
😂😂😂😂 the sigh ranboo gave
Anyone else see my freinds are shit on his subtitles
Yay Tommy, I'm happy for you! Tommy is wildly hilarious and I love the blog. Wilber soot who? Y'all should Collab, I think it'd sound good. I love watching the world cup. My family watched both footballs in one day the am football ⚽ and the pm football 🏈 🤣
1:48 the subtitles say otherwise about your friends
Tommy is actually a slay at singing-
i love the chill vlogs like these
the little windows behind ranboos set up are so pretty
4:45  Me: Aww Tommy is getting flowers for his girlfriend!! Sees Ranboo  Wha- ok im cool with this
Watching toms video is like watching my son grow up
theres gonna be a saying one day that will be the most famous saying ever and that will be: "you wish you'd lived like Tommyinnit."
Did we just get crimeboys singing  This is a really good day
1:48 😭 stop the text that showed up about “my friends are” when he says fine and the text says sh!t 😭😭
i still dont believe the fact that tommy has a gf lol
how the hell can you see underwater
early pass here :
Tom: My friends are fine Captions: My friends are *shit* 1:48
If there's one thing we can count on from an appearance from Wilbur, it's for him to eat the camera. Also, TOMMY HAS AN INCREDIBLE SINGING VOICE WHAT THE FUCK?!
There is no way this guy is already an adult but gj kid
Man I’m Not Gonna Lie! Dropped out of collage, found myself a whole new realm of knowledge sndbdbfjdnebsbshshshsbd dbxjxhdbdndjdjdbdbd😂

Tommy has grown up so much and it’s so good to see that he is enjoying his new life!
The fact that i love everyone in this vid <3

The door handle breaking happend when I went to my friend her house every time (I went there almost daily 😭)
damn, I didn't know Tommy could sing

tom!!! your voice is so amazing!!
I doubt there’s a better thing to find after school than a Tom simons vlog <3

"look, my friends are fine." "look, my friends are shit."
Noice James being everywhere lol

im so happy you're having so much fun, so much laughter, so much happyness. you really deserve it! i love these vlogs so much! appreciate it again <3
We're proud of you Tommy 💜
I still refuse to believe that Tommy bagged a girlfriend and I have not
i can't believe my cousin (the fish 3:37) met tom simons
Why is this comment section full of of bots😭
Bro he said his friends were fine and the subtitles said they’re shit 💀 lmao
bro i love your content tommy
i absolutely love these daily life vlogs!!!
1:47 I like how he says:„Look, my friends are fine... "and the subtitles say „My friends are shit“. I saw that. Can't fool me Tommy and editor Larry.
Nice me too
HOW WERE THERE EYES AND MOUTH OPEN IN WATER
Hold up…. At 1:49 the subtitles don’t quite match… but also, it feels like it’s more accurate.
Legit started cackling at 'Jesus is on ur side'
9:28  imagine someone living there and at 10 pm all you hear is this...
YESSS I LOVED THAT VIDEO! “A week in my life” is my favorite of Tommy’s tbh :) I’m so glad he’s done this
It cant be only me that heard camel by camel started playing
TOMMYINNIT THE MUSICAL ^
His singing voice is pretty 🤩
40 mind
1:48  ok soo i like how the editor i think it was larry but i like how tommy said: " alright my friends are fine" but the editor made the tekst say: "alright my friends are shit"😂
Tommy doing Wilbur’s songs is so nice. They are very much brothers. 6:08
Ok Wilbur soot
I love how the subtitles changed my friends are fine to shit
"look my friends are fine"  Subtitles; "shit"
You can sing beautifully
Your lady has a lovely scalp
You should play strawberry champagne
That subtitle at 1:48 though
Proud and happy for you Tom! ❤️
Ur. Y fav YouTuber btw
wtf was that?
Tommy you learned how to ride a bike! Congrats I am very proud🫶🏽
He's come so far and yet he STILL is unable to properly ride a bicycle.
Do you know that we love these vlogs?
I found out there is a bunny named tubbo and i canttt
I've been seeing a lot of comments saying Tommy's changed. But honestly, through everything, at his core he's still the same person. It's his LIFE that's changed. But also, I love these videos, seeing his life makes me so inexplicably happy. You deserve it Tommy :)
Tommy: my freinds are fine  Subtitles: no they are shit 🔫
“My friends are fine” Subtitles “My friends are shi*”
Maybe be to Grimsby, misery capital of the world
I prefer ANGY Tubbo
✨️perfect ✨️
Tommy is actually a good singer 😭😭😭♥️
Tommy: my friends are fine  Subtitles: my friends are shit
is this tommyinnit?
U have a life?  I am surprised  (This is a joke)
you are 18 now? thats old
Holy shit the singin 😻
love how he said "my friends are fine" but the subtitles said "my friends are shit"
I would not be surprised if Tommy’s dad is dream
DROP THE FULL ALBUM KING
Need more videos like this
Happy tubo
This reminded me of ashs vlogs but with more chaos and more words Really like this kind of content, it's amazing!
8:00 songs for Littles getting free promotion
Yea, I love these videos a little too much I think
Tubbo moment
Do you legally have a gun I thought children weren't supposed to have a gun
This is very wholesome actually
Does anyone know the name of the intro song?
1:48  MY fRiEnDs arE fIne (checks the subtitles)
WHY ARE THERE SO MANY FREE ROBUX BOTS FUUUUCKKKK OOOOFFFFFFFF!!!!!!!! /neg
Damn your 5 years older than me
Intro song??
Tommy come to Bradford. It’s really friendly.
1:48 damn the subtitles gave you away 😔 better luck not losing your friendships next time
Wait why does he have the ice Poseidon shelf????
0:50 I love the caption, ‘Tubbo moment’. Kind of a redemption of the original expression. Nice callback.
I swear that James Marriott is the most devious NPC
man is living the best life
trying to live vicariously through tommy's vlogs cause I'm stuck at home ill and I wanna go riding bikes and singing in the streets with my friends, glad he's having a good time
I love how he says “my friends are fine” but the captions say “my friends are shit” at 1:47
I smell balls
Loved the piano and ukulele moments! More of those please... Also just so happy for you!  Edit: My life would improve tenfold if Tommy made a song with CG5. Just sayin'. Edit 2: OMG SOOTHOUSE MOMENT
tommy is the type of person to say I am an adult but also act like a 13year old
These vlogs are my favorite because they're raw in a very good way.
Just his voice. Why is his voice so beautiful? I'm jealous dude
POV: you're early but u don't know what to say
At 1:48 the subtitles said shit even though you said fine
What Tommy said: “my friends are fine” The subtitles: “my friends are sh!t”
i just find it crazy that we have been to the same places so many times
You should have filled it
Well done you deserve all the love and support you get! <3
these vlogs are the best. they never fail to put a smile on my face
1:47  Tommy: "my friends are fine" caption: "are you sure about that?"
2:05 That noise when he drowned phone sounded familiar
*SOMETHING YOU'RE WORKING ON??!!!*  MATE DO YOU MEAN YOU'RE *MAKING MUSIC*  IT SOUNDS AMAZING BY THE WAY AND I HOPE ALL GOES WELL AND IT MIGHT BE POSTED??????????? MAYBE???
Lad your birds kinda hot
Tommy’s content always gives me so much seratonin, he really seems to be living his best life💅Also the fact that they just keep finding James randomly is so hilarious
I'm jealous
and tubbo was less time than the intro :(
you project the ideal lifestyle. is there any bad side?
1:48  Tommy: my friends are fine The captions: my friends are *shit*
THIS IS SO COOOOL
That song was so good!!! Waiting for the drop 🥱
1:48 read the subtitles lmao he says "look my friends are fine" but the subtitles say "look my friends are s**t
this takes me right back to the summer of 2021 when these vlogs were basically my only company and kept me from getting too lonely. nostalgia
Bowlcut tommy isn’t real.. he can’t hurt you..  bowlcut tommy: 2:12
It's sad but nice to see Tommy grow up and slowly get more mature
6:22 is genuinely the most heartwarming thing I've seen from Tom in a while, just making his own personal music so proud of him and all the effort he puts into his content <3
Hi
1:48 "fine"
TOMMYYYYY AND TUBBOOOOO
1:48 - Tom: 'fine' Subtitles: 'shit' <.<
:D I love Tommy's vlogs so much
the music  bit had me stimming, since when has he played ukulele???? im excited for future content
Tommy is the kinda person to see a bauble on his Christmas tree and ask “ is anyone going to eat that” and not wait for an answer
oh golly gosh
why would anyone willingly live in the UK
Wilbur is such a big brother...
9:21 World Mug...     *yes*

The part that Tommy says his friend are fine and the subtitles said that they are 1:48
For some reason these videos where Tom just films his day to day life are always the most entertaining ones to me
4:40 He never disappoints LMAO-
Tommy you never fail to make me laugh! And I loved this video Love ya Tommy! <3
Fun fact          Fun fact.
Hi Tommy! I know that you probably won’t see this butI wanna say a quick thank you for always making me laugh! You and Tubbo, Wilbur, Ranboo, Phill, James etc. Always are there for me thru the screen  when I’m sad or happy!so all I can say is thank you!

My friends are fine *shit* Tommy is still a child and I’m all here for it

It's great that I never get sick of your vids
These videos always make my day, i love them so much <3
People who dont believe that he has a girlfriend, reply to my comment ⬇
The Americans: “Tom it’s soccer not football!” Every other country: “it’s literally called football in every other country. Football is called soccer and soccer is called football.”
I swear Tommy like gained his own aesthetic through his different vlogs and this one is IT
I watched all of this at my lunch
may i ask, what did wilbur have in his mcdonalds cup? was it cum?
Everyone in tommys chat just waiting for tommy to make a song.

James looks like my cousin when he put on the hat. It was glorious
I honestly love these types of vlogs <3
Tommy foundry found a way to ride a bike
Wow tommy supports the LGBTV 4K HD community
I like how he just has a gun
fell off
I was just saying last week that I wanted another one of these videos
my friends are fine (shit) -Tommy 2022
why is he so surprisingly good at singing? like its actually rlly good i wouldn't have expected that
Literally nothing changed
huh
Why isn't anyone else talking about the subtitles at 1:47? It is hilarious!
0:10 wth.  i just clicked on this video after having to literally *break into* my room because my door handle is broken. what are the chances
No way that you wrote in the captions that your friends are shit💀💀💀
What a legend he is
HE IS VERY GOOD A SINGING/SRS
Even tho he is 18 he is still funny 😂😂
this is my favorite type of tommy content
Um…I burst out laughing in the middle of a silent class…it was worth it!
It's hilarious how now that you've moved you just see James Marriott everywhere 😂. HE'S ALWAYS WATCHING
1:48 Tom: "My friends are fine" Me: Look at the captions they say shit lmao
Okay, can we all please stop feeding into all the spams under the real comments with links, their just trying to make money anoying people.
1:48 HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
He is very lucky to have his own place at age 18. Most people whom are 18 are struggling to even make it out in the world.
DOES ANYBODY ELSE REALISE THAT THE LAST BIT WAS WILBUR SINGING THE NEW LOVEJOY SONG? LIKE FROM WILBURS STREAM?!?!
Can’t wait to hear that song.
Big men.
I always feel so happy when I see your videos :D
hope tommy enjoys his new life now that hes an adult❤❤❤
James is just an npc that spawns near tommy, but the one we see in the more frequent of vlogs (not a compilation, i mean) is a summon. Now that's what i think!
You have a great singing voice!!! If you ever wanted to, I think you'd make amazing original songs or covers.
Tommy singing Wiburs songs reminds me so much of his last "one week in my life" and I love it so much
I LOVE VLOGS LIKE THESE JUST CHILL LIFE VLOGS
7:08 WILBUR WHYYYYY? WHY DID YOU EAT TOMMYINNIT?? NO, DON’T EAT HIM 😭
freaking awesome video as ever!!!! but does anyone know where that cycle path is because it's so damn pretty and I need to experience it!!!!!!!
I had the worst day today, when I saw your new video I cried happy tears❤ you are my comfort streamer❤❤
Ranboo look so confused that you give him the flowers
Tommy is able to ride a bike guys!!
When you bought flowers I was like; wow he's such a nice bf but then out of nowhere ranboo appears and I started laughing xd
Mssmmslsñs CHEESE LORD HAS SPOKEN MDMDMDKSLLS YES MY LORD  I WILL SUB TO TOMMYINNIT
HELP HOW HE WAS HIS FRIENDS ARE FINE BUT SUBTITLES SAY THEY ARE SHIT
And I’m the first viewer
8:50 OMG ITS BRITISH I_AM_WILDCAT
"look my friends are fine" subtitles: i disagree
Back then, Tommy was taught how to ride a bike.  And now, he’s riding a bike with zero issues.
“i have a girlfriend so i don’t need to flirt with you anymore” *brings flowers to ranboo*
Am I EARLY??
This means so much to me 💀
you’re literally with all of your friends in this
Omg a tubbo moment #tubbo
1:48 YEP fine
doin great big man
James is just like a wild animal being spotted in his natural habitat 😂😂
new fav vlog of yours :)
Tommy's amazing at his song skills
Tommy I love you, I do, you're an amazing person and one of my favorite streamers and bloggers, (and btw i absolutely adore your singing voice), but what did that door handle ever do to you??
#tubbo
Bro is growing and elderly-Ing Ps: Bro sounds glorious and excellent bros voice is angelic bro should make an EP and an Album and a- and a- uh yeah.
Tommy is actually a very good musician
Great to see you Tom out of that old place cause the apartment owner was so strict
Eh
It's absolutely wild to me that I have watched Tommy grow from streaming in his childhood bedroom after school with his mom yelling at him to do the dishes, to living in Brighton with all of his friends and making amazing and uplifting content as a full time job. So incredibly proud of you dude...I don't think anyone can say it enough
6:27 OH OK HERE: SOFT BOY: I'm living the dream It's just one of those dreams where you're losing all your teeth And if you think that it gets better Darling, take a look at me I'm in too deep Same dried ramen in a bowl I'm too lazy to clean Not drunk texting my ex anymore I bet my father would be proud of me I won't wear the cat ears I won't wear the cat ears I won't wear... Please, don't make me wear the cat ears Please, I'm so done with the cat ears, don't make me It's not an ahegao hoodie, it's a work of art I probably need therapy, but I'm scared to start I'm looking for a window to another world Where I don't feel as lost and bored I just don't wanna be a soft boy anymore I wanna be yours I'm like a giraffe I cry before, during, after sex I don't look good with my t-shirt off And it's hard enough To be cool with everybody else Mocking your haircut, oversized sweaters Saying that I'm cute And it's not an ahegao hoodie, it's a work of art I get turned on by my reflection in passing cars I'm looking for a window to another world Where I don't feel as lost and bored I just don't wanna be a soft boy anymore I wanna be yours I wanna be yours I wanna be yours It's not an ahegao hoodie, it's a work of art So let me know when my feelings stop I'm just your window to another world Where you ended up lost and poor I just don't wanna be a soft boy anymore  ONE DAY: And stop 'Cause why'd you have to kill my cat? Why'd I have to take you back? Time and time, I play the empath I don't know why Put some lights on in an empty pub A toilet with the seat left up It's closure like a deer in headlights One day, I know that you will be there One day, I'll focus on the future, maybe One day, oh, baby, isn't life so fucking inconsistent? One day, I know that you will be there One day, I'll focus on the future, maybe One day, oh, baby, isn't life so fucking inconsistent? She said, "Let's talk about What I want to do 'Cause all I want to do Is turn back time At least a couple Tuesdays To before I found one life, turn two" I said it last time But I'm not afraid of empty rooms I'm not afraid of new perfume And, in fact, my dear I'm fucking terrified One day, I know that you will be there One day, I'll focus on the future, maybe One day, oh, baby, isn't life so fucking inconsistent? One day, I know that you will be there One day, I'll focus on the future, maybe One day, oh, baby, isn't life so fucking inconsistent? Woo 'Cause I know that One day, I know that you will be there One day, I'll focus on the future, maybe One day, oh, baby, isn't life so fucking inconsistent? One day, I know that you will be there One day, I'll focus on the future, maybe One day, oh, baby, isn't life so fucking inconsistent?  SEX SELLS: You think he'd realize But he's infatuated with ideas Of possessions and far-flung social policy His daddy works on the Council The missus loves the silver spoon Swore she'd never kiss a Tory But this boy was too good to lose And I'll listen carefully With ears pressed to the floor As you make your way downstairs You haven't got far to fall Now it's red, now it's dead Now it's everything she needed Now it's four open doors Pillows pressed under your knees Now it's a sad, sappy sucker To ensure a happy ending I've been scared of sleeping with the lights on Know she's not there, I know she's going to his flat A Capricorn, oh, fuck that They say sex sells, I know that I've been scared of sleeping with the lights on Know she's not there, I know she's going to his flat A Capricorn, oh, fuck that They say sex sells, I know that You could buy my silence If you've got none to lose If he's still infatuated with the truth So will you do what's easy? Or will you do what's right? Please just could you let me know Where will you sleep tonight? Where you gonna sleep tonight? Where will you sleep tonight? Where you gonna sleep tonight? Where will you sleep tonight? Where will you sleep at night? How do you sleep at night? Cultured man Venetian suntan Red wine and club bands Viagra pills on the nightstand How's it feel? How's it feel to be so loved? How's it feel to be so loved, yet so alone? I've been scared of sleeping with the lights on Know she's not there, I know she's going to his flat A Capricorn, oh, fuck that They say sex sells, I know that I've been scared of sleeping with the lights off Know she's not there, I know she's going to his flat A Capricorn, oh, fuck that They say sex sells, I know that I've been scared of sleeping with the lights off Know she's not there, I know she's going to his flat A Capricorn, oh, fuck that They say sex sells, I know that Sex sells, I know that Sex sells, I know that Do you sleep at night?  HOPE THIS HELPS SNWBQNSHWVGWQFCAHAGW
I accidentally read the title as “my new wife” 💀🖐

I love these vlogs, they're always so full of energy and just really fun to watch! hope you're doing well dude!
This blog is very relaxing and funny. Many friends to hang, talking to parents about being bald, music and parties man its really cool that you have a good new life tom. I hope more blogs about your life will be wholesome.  Also Merry Christmas too. (Damn so many bots in the comment section)
I love these homey, chill types of vlogs. Seeing everyone goofing off and being themselves is so fun!

Toms: my friends are fine  The cc: my friends are shit
I freaked out for amoment when they sung that one muppet song (I'm a muppeeeeeeet-/maaaaaaaaaaaaan) song. Love that movie lol.
These are my favourite kind of vlogs!!!

according to baldboyhalo, it's really not that bad to be bald... if you're bad.
We need more tommyinnit in life
I didn´t know Tommy could sing
Very off topic but who else wants to see him do a paranormal investigation with Sam and colby?
ranboo wearing techno merch

TOMMY NEEDS TO MAKE SOME SERIOUS MUSIC.

I love this channel so much because it paints a picture of exactly the kind of life I want to live. Until I can achieve that, I just live vicariously through Tommy instead^^
this vlog is so WHOLESOME wow lol ❤‍🔥  love ur vlogs
Are you people insane. Not one comment asking how he managed to speak underwater without drowning. I've literally been scrolling the comments for years I've even missed my wedding, my sons graduation and my wife's funeral and still nobody noticed. Please guys open your brains a little bit. Please.
Slay?
18mins ago
4:40  Me: Aw he got his girlfriend some flowers :]  * gives them to Ranman *  Me: o h
'my friends are fine' It says my friends are shit-
Tom: "My friends are fine" Subtitles: "My friends are shit"
LUL
Tommy is the type of person to look at a carpet and say "is anyone gonna eat that?" and not wait for an anwser
this was a lovely vlog
omg tommys singing, nice
love this new editing style you got it feels very intimate   tho idk why the video is only on 360p :((
gosh its so illegal to be so early
I envy your life big man
'my friends are fine' whilst the subtitle says 'shit'. peak chaotic friend group lmao
These videos are just so fun and really make so many people happy! Thank you for that king!
Use me as"Im Tired Of Is anyone going to eat that?,Joke" Button
Oh, Tommy! I am glad that you and your girlfriend live happily and enjoy life with your friends, your happy vlogs inspire me and give me strength to continue moving forward! Keep up the good work , Big T.
TUBBO MOMENT xD
6:09 tom's voice is so god damn beautiful it's fucking angelic 😭

THE BITS NOT OVER 💀

I love the energy in this video hoenstly
The singing was actually really good
I love this so much
tommy’s the kinda guy to break a door handle and ask “is anyone gonna eat that?” and not wait for an answer
1:47 i like the fact that he says "fine" but it says "shit" in the text
no'ice bri'itsh
Loved it #famly friendly
I love this man <3
*"My friends are fine (subtitles: shit)"* It's such a simple joke but it made me laugh so hard for some reason lol
James literally spawns everywhere, he is pulling a Wilbur-
Happy to see you happy 😊
YIPPEE GREAT VIDEO TOMMY
This was amazing. Nothing more to say. Just ... Amazing
6:01 baldinnit will always stay supreme
1:49 Am I the only one to noticed ? :>
Soo proud of you!! < 3
so proud of you tommy <3
1:47 He says my friends are fine🙂  But the captions say otherwise...💀
Tommy needs to release music
Hello I love your videos they make me laugh a lot and they are very funny. They literally make my day. thank you for giving me the energy to go to the park or to my father's store [makes me go to his store] and strange random person from the internet who wanted to see my comment. Sorry for making it so long or as they say in the Hispanic community  "Es Mucho texto"
5:43 tom help me know if you don't know who bruce willis is child have you ever watched die hard
7:58 I don't know why but I laughed at this part so hard
love that 💓
These videos are what make me a Tommyinnit fan lmao. There so chaotic but calm in a unexplainable way.
Tommy is just a enjoyable person to watch LOL
Tommy looks like da Jake paul haeheaha
his singing is actually really good ngl
Keeps gamer Keeps :)
is no one gonna mention the part where he said "my friends are fine" but the words at the botom of the screen said "my friends are shit"?😂😂
Honestly the only music I wanted to hear was tommy playing megalovania on piano
When he said he didn't know anything while watching football i was gonna say "this american kid" but then i remembered he isn't American and he is just a nerdy kid 😆
This was amazing
This was really chill!  I actually quite like that! Also, you are absolutely right.  James is just some 5th dimensional being at this point who just spawns in to cause mischief.  We have no hope of understanding this man.  All we can do is respect and fear him.
tommy: now my friends are fine. subtitles: SHIT
Big man lov your'e vlogs and streams
It's not a proper vlog if Wilbur doesn't try to eat us
plz make music omg omg plz sing a song I love your voice PLZ
if you decided to produce music I definitely would be a heavy listener, you sound amazing  your life looks awesome, I'm glad you're doin alright should probably talk to someone about the broken handle though
:)
i genuinely love this vlog format so much
My guy just pulled out a blaster and said "Give me all your money!" and the response was "no"
1:47 My freinds are fine The subtitles: my freinds are shit
Sounds like a better life than mine, that's for sure.
for once I’m actually commenting like 10 mins after this video is released
EARLY
I only got one thing to say, pogchamp (and also this just kinda made my day better and I think that's worth telling👍)
The second I got this notification I also got my new merch this day is amazing
Early <33
this is so beautiful i’m crying
THE NEW LOVEJOY SONG LEAK AT THE END
Never fails to make me laugh :DD
3:38 fishboy
Wilbur just looks traumatised in almost every clip he's in
He should straighten his hair for a video, it would be s o cursed
Pokémon fire red on the game boy
Yeeah Tommyinnit

What was the background music at the start?
This is why i dont like tommy. WHO THE FUCK WANTS TO GO BACK TO BRIGHTON?
Cum
You and Wilbur’s voices are beautiful!!
Hold on is that song at the end lovejoys upcoming song scum? God i hope so it sounds good af
The Roman Empire did not fall, it simply turned into Odoacer's Kingdom

Fathere innitt

Ukulele epic
Hi
i love tommys new era, the old era has ended, bigman tommyinnit has a gf now, you are awesome tommy
Damn Tommys hairline’s almost as bad as James’ 😭
We worship Tom Simons vlogs
1:48 yes tom your friends are s̶h̶*t̶  fine
0:11 oh god I’ve had that happen to me before 😭  0:32 hmmm yep I can read that says tom Simons  1:09 my mood swings be like:   2:34 I have a story if this happening  So I was at a sandwich restaurant and I decided to sit outside  (My biggest mistake) Then all the sudden I hear the voice of my  Friend calling me sandwich girl and I’m just like-   4:10 I have another story of this but I’m to bored to tell it because I’m at the bread restaurant and I’m having McDonald’s internet  4:44 who knew Ranboo sat on a dinner chair 😳   5:12 I’m now obsessing over their office   7:02 me interrupting my friend’s ✨peaceful✨ eating time:   7:21 Em I love how you did your hair <D   7:56 what I have to sit through and watch with my niece   8:25 aimsey your stairs are hot   8:47 my dad but it’s the super bowl and the cowboys are winning 😭
Where tf did James come from?
I live in this general area so this was hella weird to watch
IM EARLY FOR ONCE
When Tommy said „look my friends are fine“ the subtitle said „look my friends are shit“ lmao ( minute 1:48 )
Nah tommy having a gf and still flirting with ranboo
Tommy make another mod video please
why does the bike look like a children’s bike with a giraffe neck for a seat
The my freinds are shit subtitle joke was really funny lol
the Tommy life is the only real way to live
i was so certain the flowers were for his girlfriend. i got got. he got me.
its 4:56 am and i just woke up to see this, now ik its gonna be a great day.
Tommy: My friends are fine  Subtitles: my friends are shit
I thought he was gonna give the flowers to his girlfriend😭 it was a twist
Tom Simons is an adult by technicality.
brighton is the LA of england with how many internet personalities that live there
Thx for the content i bought ur merch!
When tommy said my friends are fine the subtitles said shit
Watching a Tom Simons™ video is a fever dream
1:48 Tommy: look, my friends are fine- Subtitles: look, my friends are sh!t-

Friends are “fine” hmmmmmm
Damn three minutes in and the vid has already got 10k views!!  So proud of you man
Wow im so early, hi Tommy!
1:47 the captioning is going against him
3 MINUTES EARLY LETS GOOOO
Tommy's uploads make my day!
How is New York do you like America
You know this video is gonna be good when it opens with a voice crack
hrm i think he's moved to a new place
Yooooooo
Seeing tommy from when he made small videos in his room (wasn't around then-), to getting his own office, to his own apartment (granted, well, asbestos) to now this is just damnnnnnn the only thing that would make it better is if he got a Cadillac to jump into-
Tommy: My friends are fine Subtitles: My friends are shit
1:48 Tommy i think you messed up a word 😂😂😂 Love that!
Tommy riding a bike???!!!!
Tommy's apartment is falling apart around him
why is it at 360p
yoooo
When he said my friends are fine the subtitles said my friends are shīt
If you want more subscribers you would need me, I am a youtuber just saying
How the hell did this man just pull a shovel out of no where…
the door just couldnt HANDLE your immense amount of swag
TOMMAYYY
I like it when he said “My friends are fine” and the subtitles said “my friends are shit”
NEW TOMMY VIDEO WHO’S EXCITED?
"my friends are fine"  Caption: my friends are shit
Holy Shit I'm first 💀
Let’s go another Tommy video
Hi Tommy
1:48  Tommy: look, my friends are fine- Subtitles: my friends are shit
"My friends are fine"   The subtitles.... my friends are shit
Early
Bike like pokemon
When he says my friends are fine, it says my friends are shit 😂😂😂 1:48
tommy has come so incredibly far, everything that has happened in the past year holy shit, so proud of you big man
Happy Tubbo gang   👇
tommy is the type of guy to see his entire new life and ask:"is anyone gonna eat that?" and not wait for an answer
I’m so proud of Toms wild side I’m SUPER wild usually
Tommy- ‘my friends are fine’ Caption- ‘my friends are shit’ Got me laughing sm🤣
1:48 I just noticed how the subtitles say “shit” and not “fine”😭
I love the chaos of Tommy’s vlogs. Thats what makes them so fun
Tommy: “look my friends are fine” The captions: *are you sure about that*  Edit: but on a serious note, I am so proud of how far he’s come. He’s achieved so much and I’m so glad I could be there on this weird, chaotic, yet fun adventure, and I can’t wait to see what comes next.
He said his friends wee fine but the subtitles say otherwise 😂
HELLOOO TOMMYYYYYY

Hi

Not much of Wilbur has changed then. He MUST grab phone, he must eat phone, he must be chaos
I know he's trying to stay down to earth and all but i can't imagine dedicating that much energy towards /trying/ to stay in such a scuffed place.
1:47 4:43
