whos here in 2024?
And a year later, he did indeed get his maiden win, congratulations George 🤜🤛
Looking at his girlfriend- his taste definitely changed since than 😹 But he still has a good taste in woman 👍🏻
Would be funny with these new regs, Williams build a better car than Mercedes. Not likely but possible
I just hope Reussel can do his own fight on the track and hope the drivers championship isn't as close this year and he has to yield for lewis for fast laps and wins.
Making friends with the enemy George Russell? Good ploy. 😉
I am Happy for George Russell after learning from mistake well done so  hope that he can three years with William help him get great like Jenson Button did back in the 2009 F1 world championship but like that Daniel Ricciardo and Red bull Racing Boss Christian Horner Congratulate him going into season of F1 in 2022 and Jenson is great interview it tell that know him excellence drive and person in Career like F1.
I love Horner. Winding up merc all the time
Do it for the tydd folk George!!! 🤜🏻🤛🏻
IS IT A ONE YEAR DEAL !!!! HERE WE GO HERE WE GO MERC MAFIA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why the mask still?
Christian Horner.... Jealous?
Horner will be slating george next year and questioning his racing integrity
One of the worst kept secrets ever lol
Could you imagine Williams as the team too beat next year , could happen massive reg change , and if they started there car supper early you never know !
My earliest memory of formula 1 was the "walrus nose" Williams BMW
Imagine if after all this, the Mercedes car is slower and George doesn't become World Champion. I'd be gutted for him. I'm only getting back in to F1 after 15 years because I want to see him win it.
He does a better job of hiding it than I could. A bit of a smirk and a wry smile. I would be high fiving anyone and everyone lol
Why is Button wearing a mask?
What deal  ? 🤭
Christian Horner is such a horrible a spiteful little man
Can't wait to see both of these congratulations being used out of context in Drive to Survive.
"I don't know what your mmm congratu mmm about"
Go on George lad
Masked fools promoting this crap it's gone too far now.
Don’t know why but he’s a really dislikable guy
Ha its funny to think Russel will be in (childish) horners firing line next season
The moment he said “next year” we all knew 👀
Thank god it’s been announced now back to racing
Cutting edge interview technique and probing questions from old Button-moon
Sorry, but the look of disdain on George’s face has got me 😂😂😂 it’s like it’s something off the bottom of his shoe (not far wrong imo)
yep definitely the worst kept secret LMAO
Horner is so funny to be fair to him😂😂
Time to panic Lewis.
Not a bad shout from Russell and his first crush, she's aged real nice too, shame her love life hasn't done so well, maybe Russell can change that if she's looking for a toy boy.
3:36 his farming accent slipped out
Anyone else find George unlikeable for some reason or just me?
When are they gonna stop wearing masks
Chad Christian 1-0 Virgin Toto
Well that's the best kept secret in F1 officially out
So excited to see him at Mercedes if it happens
I bet Hamilton went home and kicked the dog when he found out!
Mr Saturday will be a botas mk2 until Hamilton is there which could affect the hype around him but time will tell
They will be shocked when he has the same results as Bottas in this car. Lewis and Max are just miles ahead of the rest and makes the drivers under them look average.
Karen Horner
1:12: George: you think Williams has money to pay me?
Not a huge fan of Russell he seems abit, rich kid paid seat but can't deny he gets some pace out of a poor car and the way he batted that last question was pretty good
My first memory is one of two it's either my dad playing cricket or seeing my nan in her van
He's trying so hard to not spill the beans.
“Next year” just confirms it really George knows where he’ll be next year. Hint, it’s a black car and has 44 and 77 in it atm
Yawn. His answers are duller than dull. Needs to work on his anecdotes and charisma.
Impossible not to like George!! Coming from a lewis fan, so might not be saying that in a year 😂
Well that bit with Horner wasn’t awkward at all! , Russel “mr cool, calm and always corporate answers” even looked a bit nervous and awkward 😂😂
Hes such a decent guy ! Hope he stays grounded
I mean it’s sorta confirmed now since bottas is off to Alfa
I hate this wee guy.
Daniel wanting a selfie. Brilliant! :D Like the way F1 coverage behind the scenes is going. Lots of good natured banter.
3:55 I can hear Scooter - The Logical Song in the background 👍
Well if Russell does not live up to the hype next season he will have a lot to answer for ,personally I dont rate him as he has too many mistakes and accidents to make him the best candidate for the position
Soo.. now Botas & Alpha is public.. next move for Mr Saturday (car whisperer)
Next win = next year. Is that right toto. Ye ye
The fact that this is 44th on trending
Horner is such a weasel! Worry about your own team instead of stiring and bothering himself in other people’s business!
This is BS. I am surprised JB would engage in such tittle-tattle stuff,
Imagine at Monza they still haven't announced it...
Bottas keeps his seat and Williams become title challengers
Lol Horner, that was savage! 😂😂😂😂   British humour at its best!
Ah I miss Jenson
The Radio messages to Bottas will give young George an idea what the next 2 years will be like, a ruined career. The Nanny Goat was not in the same class, or close enough to hit Max again.
2:30 Ricciardo
He supports wolves???
I don't understand why he is congratulated!!!!!!! Has achieved zilch. 👏🤣 lucky to get second in in qualifying.
Russell williams you happy f1 steering wheel 2011s I like Williams to have new f1 steering wheel🙏
Two of the nicest guys in F1 being joined by the third. 😊
At this point I’ll feel personally let down if he doesn’t sign.
Maybe he’s signed for RB
Imagine if george stays with williams 😭🤣
Simple facts here, George is fast, but doesn’t have the car to compete and Valterri is fast in practice, but he can’t produce it when it matters! No brainer for Mercedes in my opinion. 🏎🏎😊
Surely Mercedes have to sign Russell, if they don't then someone else will. Kick out Tsunoda and give him the seat then get rid of Perez after 2022 and he's in a red bull. If Riccardo doesn't improve at McLaren they would want him too.
69 dislikes
Much as I’d love to see the end of merc dominance - anyone else terrified that 2022 is the year Mercedes dominance ends and George will have basically moved into the new Williams like IMAGINE
Just remember jenson works for Williams so he will already know if George is going and it’s obvious they all know he’s got that merc seat
I know it’s very likely that George has the seat, but Latifi has been linked with Indycar and Dorilton have said they don’t need pay drivers so people saying it’s concrete are jumping the gun still
Someone needs to teach George how to keep a secret 😂
I wish he would just bloody say it..."yup, next year in a Merc...ima gonna win a race".
JUST ANNOUNCE THE DEAL WE ALL KNOW IT’S GOING TO HAPPEN
Anyone think Gio will be keeping his seat at AR (clearly alongside Bottas)? I'm not so sure. That would leave two empty seats. I hope Albon has one of them.
It would be funny if Russell got the Mercedes seat next year and Williams dominates 2022
I don't what has been the best worst kept secret in this year, George Russell to Merc or CM Punk signing with AEW?! It's fun to watch the games of it all unravel though. Congrats!!
God I love how much of a stirrer christian is
LOL Love it
Christian jus opened a can of worms there 😆😂😂 brilliant hahaha
Surpised he is celebrating like he won world championship here
Might be the best, worst kept F1 secret ever hah....
So happy for George but yet congratulating him before officially being announced is so disrespectful towards Bottas
I love him. ❤️
Congratulations goerge, a Mercedes AMG Driver. Boooom! Let's go George!
Nice 👍Russell totally deserves it. Look out Hamilton 😎🏎
George is just weird
TBF ,the announcement is being delayed because of presentation. Monza is Alfa's homeGP and with Kimi stepping down and Valteri being announced ,this is the logical place to do this . It also gives Toto justification of his looking after all Merc drivers ,by announcing a seat for George in tandem with a seat for Valteri . So look to Monzato hear this .
Team radio for next year when Lewis gets his first win...  "Not bad for a number 2 driver"
Either way I really hope it works out for George. Imagine though if he did go Merc and the regulation changes screwed him. That would be horrible!
everyone wants that seat until they experience the Hamilton effect.🤣
Russell to red bull confirmed
Worst kept secret in f1 😂
I'm only a casual viewer but F1's social media coverage/marketing is excellent. Even though I'm not fully clued in on the engineering or the strategy, I always follow the season and watch a few races.
He's a class act.
Everyone knows he's going to merc..
LOL
Bottas is keeping his seat, Mercedes have gave it to him as a leaving present.
It would be funny if bottas come a congratulated him lol
The big 3 George LANDO and Alex might be all together on the grid again 🙌
Tell me you have a Mercedes seat without telling me you have a Mercedes seat 😂😂
George is too tall for an F1 driver and will compromise the design of the W13.
Can u make it available in the US plz
Horner: *Touches George*   George: *Looks visibly sickened*
How can you hate this guy. He’s going straight to the top
I am not saying Russell hasn't deserved the seat but I do feel quite sorry for Bottas because of the elephant in the room.
I can’t wait for the Mercedes announcement   “And we are proud to present, our new driver….  Antonio Giovinazzi”
When are you gonna get your first win? Great way of saying are you gonna be in the other Merc?
Horner new what he was doing! And Danny’s just making it hilarious, haha
still think it would have been better if he stayed at williams and took them back to the top, to prove he is 'that good' rather than jum into a mercedes and everyone say 'its the car...anyone can do that in that car'
This is literally drive to survive season 4
As soon as he said Next year I burst out laughing 🤣 too funny, poor valtteri
It's so so obvious now it's just getting ridiculous  Just announce the deal with Mercedes already
The little no I haven't after he said next year says it all
Clickbait
He’s definitely at Mercedes next year
George Russell Said he knows where he will be next year: ‘Congratulations on your new deal’ doesn’t *need* to be at Mercedes, he could have resigned for Williams as his contract ended.  But everyone still knows he has the Merc seat.
Hope he don't get too cocky and flop haha 😂
Maybe Lewis is going to do a Kimi and retire 🤔🤔
F1s worst kept secret
these to are so alike
Poor Russell will have to keep letting Hamilton past to stop Lewis whining and moaning to Toto ... "Please stop Russell beating me" 😭😭😭😭😭😭
We love George
O bottas is out O bottas is out Valtteri bottas  The stinker is out
Any chance for Christian to mess things up for Toto 😂
load of waffle...next year when your in a mercedes
A bit lame for Christian to pull that off, just let them do the reveals however they want.
Unpopular opinion… I can’t stand the media attention on him, so many outstanding drivers from his rookie year. Can tell he thinks he’s special, needs the humility & talent of Lando.  It’s an opinion trolls before you start 😆
What is the deal?
We all know it already just release it
Can’t wait to come back to this when this when he gets his first win in a merc. Worst kept secret in f1 🤣
weird
I cant stand Christian, but that was pure gold 😂
hes trying not to reveal it but hes not good at keeping it hidden xD
3:10 this man is legitimately me
They won’t confirm till bottas has a confirmed seat
gotta be Merc especially after his drive with them last year
I find Red Bull's excitement about George joining Mercedes intriguing. He's more likely to be a better driver than Bottas, and therefore take more points from Red Bull
"interesting 3/4 year old"      "That was last week"
Mercedes have probably won the constructors next year, having 2 number 1 drivers and as I suspected at the start of the season, Perez is a star in a midfield team but when it comes to the absolute top tier drivers and teams he falls slightly short
Last thing Redbull want is Russell in a Mercedes seat where he can actually challenge Redbull, unlike Bottas. Be careful what you wish for.
Looks like George is moving to Merc 😂
Think this is just a little silly now,not to mention somewhat disrespectful to bottas. Just announce it and be done with it.
Deffo at Mercedes you can see it and if he's hinting like that then it's confirmed . Lewis was also so supportive and said George is the future . He's helped williams come a long way since he started f1 . And if horner and Daniel are Congratulating him then it won't be because he is staying at Williams ect. Very interesting and lots of hints
Imagine if Russell is moving to ferrari
Hate this mask rule is still being a thing. Despite the vaccines and ease of lockdowns etc. How does George now have a mask but jenson does doesn’t make sense 🥱
It's hilarious that Merc are trying, very badly, to keep it a secret and then Red Bull gave the game away by confirming that Williams had been in touch about signing Albon 🤣
Lewis vs Nico 2.0 coming soon
It’s sooo obvious George has the seat plus toto let it slip in an interview I think on Qualifying day during this week I watched it and he hinted about the Williams seat being taken by Albon etc. Just admit it now it won’t be a surprise any longer !!
KAREN Horner at it again...
stop talking about GR. sky sports pro British driver. wonder how much they sky are being paid to constantly tap about him.
What happened to DIVERSITY in F1?  So many English drivers...
Could you imagine if they now come out and say bottas is staying in Mercedes and that George is staying at Williams 😂
Plot twist, he's taking Lulu's seat.
lol at christian he knew what he was doing
I have a feeling they are playing with us now and he is at Williams for another season then off to mercedes the season after.
Lmao why doesn't Toto just announce it hahaha 🤣🤣🤣 done deal he slipped up yest saying there was a spare seat at Williams 😂😂
I literally developed a huge crush on Russel during this whole Merc seat speculation 😂
Next years gonna be good.
Fast becoming my favourite driver. Just think he's great at every level.
When are you going to get your first win? "Next year"😁
Next year in a Williams is what he meant.
I think there may be more to the story that we know.
Christian is such a wind up lmaoo
he hasn't bought a house yet?
Christian Horner being nice wow what a miracle 🤣
Jeez, everyone knows, just put the damn statement out confirming it already lol
I really don't get why merc didn't sign him up for this year, he's clearly better than Bottas and would give HAM a good run. Better late than never!
Well seen as Russell knows the 2022 car development there's a chance he could stay at Williams another year. After all he's a Merc driver anyway.  Who am I kidding, the seats in the bag and Bottas is replacing Kimi along with Albon taking George's seat.
Haha you can tell that he so rattled throughout the whole interview after Christian’s visit 😂
Danny is a fan
I'll laugh when George is announced as replacing Checo....
Lmao 😂
Horner congratulating Russell before going away to slate him behind his back.
What if he replaces Hamilton and Bottas becomes no1??! That's what I heard. 😉
I bet Christian waited until the cameras started rolling to congratulate George
3:14 Very interesting
Oh he's blatantly going to Mercedes and Bottas is gonna go to Alfa now that Kimi has retired.  Been all whispers and solid guesses but now that Kimi is leaving, that pretty much confirms it for me.  That and Toto yesterday slipped that Williams has an empty seat.
How awkward.
I think George is staying with williams
Plot twist horner is taking russel to red bull
When I saw this title I thought it had been announced 😂😂
Lot of pressure for George. Hope he arises to the occasion and does well and doesn’t pull a gasly or an albon
Button: when are you going to have your first win?  Everyone: next year… next year…. Just say it for god sakes!  George: next year.  Me: out 🤣
Next year is gonna fire sir Lewis king George at Merc mad Max, Charles. Just like the 80s where so lucky
Cheeky move by Christian, obviously he knows 😂
With Jenson's role at Williams he must know what's the crack with George and Bottas
With Max on fire this season, Mercedes have got to have an ace up their sleeve if they have to win the constructors championship next year.  Hope Georgie will handle the enormous pressure when he gets the call. If anyone can, it's level headed George.
Guys Hamilton going to retire at the end of season watch :D
Cute.
Georges face when christian just says it how it is 😂😂
Bottas won 0 races this season and been nowhere near a title fight in 4 and a bit years hardly suprising he been dropped  Russell should of been in Mercedes this season
Danny Ric is a legend
new Williams deal
Two points to note regarding his prediction of a race win next year. A. He might know something we don't about the Mercedes lineup next year. B. He might know something we don't about Williams' development for the 2022 regs if nothing is certain about where he'll be next year and he has to consider Williams as an option.
George really trying hard to not let it slip that he's a Mercedes AMG driver next year. Even other members of the paddock seem to know!
All thats left to say is congratulations to George! As a Brit this is great news!  I cant wait to watch him and LH battle it out next year.
No one is going to be remotely excited or surprised by the time the news comes because everyone already knows that second Mercedes seat is his!
The way he said 'next year' with a stone-cold face screamed FACTS 😌😋
Horner already starting he's tactics for next year 😂
Look at him he’s beaming Joy and confidence, i recon he’s going to beat the pants off Lewis next season. 👌👌👌
He smashed Bottas in his Merc race drive before mishaps too him out.  Bottas is a lovely chap but now seems the right time to change.
Well if this isn’t a confirmation without confirming anything, I don’t know what is. You’re not fooling anyone George!
Next year I hope Mercedes don't just have George play lackey to Hamilton. We need a Rosberg squared.
Christian moaner really caught him off guard. He sounded drunk with his reply....😂
Jenson Button 1.0 interviews Jenson Button 2.0
Can see the outcome by his happiness.
Probably next year. Thats the confidence. If this man can put a p17-18 car on p2 he ofc knows Mercedes won't be 2nd worst car on the grid next year So He will win in a Merc even if they become 7th fastest car. What a Legend ❤️🙌. It would be a sight to behold to see 2 legends in the same team can't wait.
aight he said it himself
He doesn't look like he is comfortable racing other drivers on track. He always is loosing places at the start and during the race .
It would be really funny if it turns out Bottas is keeping the seat
Christian and Daniel doing a Tom Holland lmao
George to nascar 🤔 😂
How does he even fit in an F1 car,he looks 6 ft 4" tall.
Is he staying at williams or going to mercedes
Next Year...
Georgey boy is wholesome.
This is probably the worst kept secret in F1 ever lol
Idk what to say to get likes    Can i get likes?
It’s too obvious by now
dropping the beans
