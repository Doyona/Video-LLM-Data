Tune into Monday Night Football tonight! 🍿  👌Wolves vs Liverpool  🔥Thierry Henry & Jamie Carragher in the studio
scouse accent is such a stupid noise
One of the best goals the Premier League has ever seen! Bravo Coco! COYS
I’m an Arsenal fan and thought this was an amazing goal, when it went in I was like fair play lad, obviosuly buzzing to win the derby though
it wasnt that good.....
This goal was SO SPECIAL. I was like "WTF did he just do??"  Not ashamed to say I was momentarily mesmerised and it happens again when I watch replays.  Top draw stuff. This goal and Harry Kane's top corner belter 👌
For people who think its weird look at Quaresma, hes mastered using his stronger foot in every scenario where his right side is closed off
“The brain said something to his leg!!” 🤣🤣 Henry 🐐
Carragher basically broke down what Henry already told us what a dope.
I dare say I'm alone here but I think this goal is overrated.
Its just football instinct he definitely doesn’t practice that every day on the training ground it’s just natural for him he knew what he wanted to do and he did it. Their was no time to think it was an instinctive improvisation. Of course he’s practiced the rabona but you can’t practice match situations like this it’s just something he did in instinct
Flow state basically
But is it Puskas winning ?   Ahhhh seee?
Wise words from a football genius
Henry's voice is silky.
That Lamala goal shows skill, technique and absolute vision and instinct. Won't see another like that for decades, Henry said Lamala must practice that shot constantly in training but I would imagine that kinda shot is just instinct  GOAL OF THE SEASON no doubt.  Tottenham will win something this season 😲
Greatest premier leaugue player period.
Henry did a phenomenal job explaining why this goal is not a lucky goal but is the production of training and hard work... only shame is they lost the game so this goal won’t be applauded as much as it should
Think of all the world class goals in history you could be in awe of if they were scored today and you could slow mo them down then analyse them from every angle
As soon as Jamie analysed that goal I fell 😴 😴 😴 so boring
As a gooner myself i have to say, that is a world class goal. Goal of the season so far for me i can't lie.
Good goal but how many points did it win??????
He should manage arsenal. I’d start supporting them
Can’t believe people can see this goal and still feel commenting on Henry is more important
Soon, daft Spuds fans and commentators (if they haven’t already) will be saying it’s the best goal ever scored in the Prem. We all know it’s the Bergkamp one against Newcastle 🤔🧐🤫 COYG
Goal of the season is complete. Congratulations.⚽👌👀
It's a dam fkn goal that led to nothing.
Calm down  It was instinctive
It was a nice looking goal, but could he not just have used his right foot?
It was a good goal, but come on, anyone who's ever played football can do that, I wasn't particularly skilful and I pulled a couple of those off... it's not genius or world class it's a cheeky goal and he got lucky!
Overrated goal
very surprised at Liverpool fans having a go at Klopp also asking for him to get the sack has not been backed again only time he has spent big money when he sold Coutinho be very careful Liverpool fans what you ask for i think Klopp has been fantastic
Goal of the season end off, as a Spurs fan that goal made up for loss thanks Coco COYS
Shame Henry didn't practice scoring at finals eh. Been to every high profile final.... Never scored.
Thierry Henry is a cheat
This man is a cheater, handball vs Ireland
Amazing goal
Henry an Suarez top 5
The best thing about the goal was Reguilón's reaction :)
Arsenal fan here. Happy we deservedly won the game. That goal has goal of the season all over and had spurs won this game Lamela would have made history. When you watch this game again and the way spurs played is big contrast. Kane should have been sent off. Spurs had one shot on target up to 80th minute. Playing passive football under Jose.
Still not as good as Jeremy Lynch and his swaz
I don’t think it was necessarily any repetition on Lamela’s part. It was instinct and coming from a top player.
Goal of the season, so far. Period.
Love Henry. Get back on pitch mate.
Handball
Better than Lowton's goal? Nah.
Strange, im left footed but can get a much better shot on a rabona using my right and feels more natural another strange fact I'm right handed but play pool or snooker left handed
Henry? Cheating handball git
I reckon he's gonna replace Jose...
SKY SPURS TV at its best, you would think Tottenham won this game but no, they LOST and were completely played off the park in this match.  SkySpurs all day! 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Bring back the 5 star skills fifa...
“Repetition and practice” Henry knows what he’s talking about. Carra is still baffled 🤣
1:14 so scripted that it was just annoying. Thierry already explained it so just make it quick such a spanner
It’s not his first rabona goal
Bet Lamela starts on the bench next game
Quaresma Lamela.....stunning
Henry- and I took that personally🤣
Is it me or does Theirry look unwell?
Henry looks exactly the same as he did in his playing days.
As a Gooner even I have to take my hat off to Lamela for that goal but it was nice of the ref later in the game to get his card out and remind him what colour North London is 🤣
the brain sent a message to his leg!
And through Partey's legs. As a gooner that felt like someone robbed you then took a dump on your Rolls Royce.
🤢 🤢🤢
Thats actually not an overly difficult a skill to master IMO.. Looks great tho. Lamelas 2 rabona goals are fantastic. That one is my favourite.  A nutmeg grass clipper curled into the corner. Perfection.
Hmmm 2007 we were afraid of him and now he is saying good stuff about us
Henry still wearing his Invincibles clock end Rolex watch... once a gooner always a gooner
y are people gassing this goal he only did it cus he’s got no weak foot
Quite soothing to the ears once Carragher stops speaking...
I think another factor that might have gone into Lamella's decision there is that the two defenders were coming from his right there, and if he'd taken the shot right away with his right, the defenders would still have been coming over and more likely to still have been in front of the ball when he shot. But doing the Rabona gave him and the defenders an extra half-second/step to move over so that he could still go towards the right/outside and slot it in. I mean, he shot it through Thomas's legs, but had he taken it right away, he possibly would have gotten it off of Thomas's legs (still in movement) than with that extra small bit of time. Some luck there for sure, but still, the extra delay I think served an additional purpose. Brilliant goal nonetheless, obviously.
As an Arsenal fan I got up to and booted the TV when Spurs scored.
Shall we all just pretend that we didn't all score these as teenagers playing about? Nothing to do with training, he's just thought, fk it... Why not
Remember Thiery’s words. And apply them to the real world for what matters or is relevant to you. “Repetition becomes Habit.”Me: “I do not fear the Lamella who practices 10000 different kicks. I fear the Lamella who practices 1 kick 10000 times”
I was speechless when I saw that goal. That was amazing. But Girouds flick kick goal from two seasons back was... out of this world and so was this from Lamella
2.48 - carra that lost for words he starts quacking
"As a French man I cheated!"
he aint no true arse fan wen u applaud opposition goal he could have scored from half line rabona u still peed of he scored
Top bag from 40 yards is a great goal. What the feck are they talking about?
If not by far- one of the best goals of Premier league history! Coz my man Nutmeged Partey 🤣🤣🤣🤣
HENRY THE KING
Henry and Pires should have repeated that penalty a few times in training  🤣
Brilliant analysis from T
Who is the scouse lad talking bollocks?
Nice to see spurs adding this goal to the trophy cabinet..
Great prem player at Arsenal. Average at Barca average for France. He’d be a better manager than that novice Arteta
Seeing how some chelsea fans ripped Lampard apart has me never wanting to see Henry managing arsenal, u want to remember him just how he is
The goal was so good ngl
Henry doing kick ups through the entire spurs team and scoring is better than that Rabona tbh
Get a life... over analysing, it was a good goal, simple as that, but come on... use your bloody right foot man!
Yes Henry is back
I don't think a goal like that needs any analysis
Can’t stand Henry
Sensational goal and I thank Lamela for the piece of magic. If u love the game you'll love that goal regardless of rivalry.
Top players don't need to think Carragher... it's instinctive...
Left footed people < Right footed people
It's the best goal I've ever seen! It's the accuracy an power he gets from a tight angle. I feel for Partey abit too Mugged him off differently.. poor sod🥺
2 tap ins beat 1 Rabona all day every day
Wowwww what at Goal one of the best in the primiere league
Good to see Henry back!
Least Tottenham can make a dvd about that goal
Iz eet just me or do ze french sound even more posh zan uz in zere own vay?
A goal that was scored in a defeat before being sent off. Probably will be released in Tottenhams new dvd.
Respect for Henry! As a Spurs fan, he is humble, was a heck of a player and there’s not a Spurs fan out there who wouldn’t have loved him at our club ! COYS !
Practising rabonas is probably why Lamela needed a hip operation a while back as it must put a lot of strain on the hip joint, being an unnatural movement. Great goal but he's never going to score many like that, no matter how much he practises.   He's definitely an underachiever as a footballer as you can see by how few Argentina caps he's got.
Lmao theirry Henry is Hilarious
Just a fabulous goal, Thierry nailed it in summary, practice and repetitive training routine.
You can see why Henry doesn’t get big managers jobs
Praise from the king.. can’t get any better than that.
Literally nothing special trust
Henry doesn't age does he?
I hate this goal. It completely negates coaching young players to use their weak foot.
The North London Derby is always always always a good game. Best English rival fixture at the moment and has been for a while now.
He should practice his consistency because the geezer disappears for weeks on end. They got beat so his training ground goal counts for nothing. Yes nice finish but he didn’t go on and win the game so stop getting carried away.
Coys
It's like when you use your hand to keep the ball in play. You don't have time to think. It's just something that comes naturally.
Henry pretending like he didn't see Swaz lynch do that every day in training years ago.
take note Jenas, an Arsenal Legend  and legend of the game praising the rivals, Jenas being a former bottler squad player, probably not even a spurs legend, being salty AF!!!
Carragher is so bad. He spent 90 seconds asking Thierry to repeat his first answer.
Still hasnt apologised for france going to world cup instead of ireland...i get passion and automated instinct ...but blatent wronng and right ...?? Its alll he will be remebered for even by his own country
That goal was purely instinctive genius. A Rabona bent into the bottom corner? Through a crowd of three defenders... Unfookingbelievable. You cheeky fooka Lamela!
So good to see Henry back on sky. Big fan 👏
Being a Man Utd fan i was impressed, i have to say that is the goal of the season, goals like that are one of a kind, a fluke moment, a special goal, you wont see that type of goal again thats up thier with greatest.
Thierry Henry, easily the top 5 strikers I’ve ever seen in the last 30 years on the planet maybe even top 3.
Lamelas goal has just wiped out arsenals win yday, arsenals invincibles, Dennis bergkamps goal agianst Newcastle, arsenals double, basically arsenals history. Lamela will be the greatest player ever player to play in a north London derby.
But the thing is everybody knows the fantastic ability of Eric lamela but during games he gets reckless, loses his mind, gets sent off or gets injured lol
But in EA logic no player without 5 star skill moves can create anything special like this on the pitch
“Thierry Henry with a HEATED analysis! 😡”  Sky sports football, probably
Thierry is Thierry, no matter what he does, he is the Bollocks!! I love this guy, He is The Man!! The best player to play with a football in the Premier League, he looked effortless!! The guy is just class, I would love to see him at Arsenal in some way shape or form.
Thierry Henry repeated himself about 427 times in this video.
meanwhile skys own martin tyler sounded like his cat died
Not gonna talk about Kane doing his dirty antics again? or does England golden boy get protection
They still lost. So it doesnt matter. Laca jncident was a penalty as if it happened outside of the box, it would be a foul as Sanches still took Laca down. The ref still showed him what colour north london is after double yellow. North london is red.
From a spurs fan I never thought we’d be seeing a goal from Erik lamela being praised so much on Monday night football 😂😂
Typical Lamela
London red end of
Thumbnail of Henry. He looks like Gollum.
Henry is only va voom now😂... He tried so damn hard tho  Over and over and over and over and over.... His tone got frenchier and deeper with every repeat 😂😂😂
As an arsenal fan I to stood up an applauded Eric's goal. Wow it bought a tear to my eye.
Brilliant and intelligent insight from Henry
HEATED from Thierry. But where does Pogba fit into all this? He should be doing that week in week out
2:49 why did he turn into a Chicken🤣🤣🤣
Henry got rid of his beard
Henry fair play I like him (Man Utd)fanbtw
Yes a great improvised goal but how bad is his right foot , if he has to resort to that ! I never understood how a professional footballer, who's been trained since they were kids , can't even side foot a strike on goal with there weaker side.
What a goal my day
Why does Henry give me headteacher vibes and why do I want him to discipline me badly...   😬😬😬
he talks about how lamela mastered the rabona but wouldn't he been as well of just practising getting his right foot better instead of thinking of fancy ways to not use it
Everyone needs to calm down over this goal
Yet spurs still lost
‘And if we just stop it... THERE’
0:40 does anyone else see Eddie murphy doing Dexter st jock... ?
They talk so well man. Full of passion 👌🏽
McNeil’s goal for Burnley was 10x better than this. It just shows that the show runners are ignorantly bias for the bigger clubs.
Come to the republic
Henry articulated his knowledge so well
Thierry Henry should read bedtime stories. I would be out like a light...
Literally Masturbating over this goal...DID THEY WIN???????!!
Imagine if fans we’re there it would of gone down as one of the best but no fans it doesn’t feel the same but all credit
One of my favourite goals in prem history not just this season
Is no body going to say anything about the fact that if he trained day in day out with his right foot as a professional should he wouldn’t have to do very high difficulty rated shots and become a better player. Don’t get me wrong its a great goal  but if He’s done it twice means he has no right foot
The brain sends a message to his leg 😆 🤣 🤣 🤣
THIERRRYYYY HENRRYYYYY!!!!! THE KINGGGG😍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It’s an absolutely amazing goal. Fair play Erik Lamela 👏🏼
No way! Henry actually stood up! Wow
Right.... there
Henry is best player ever in premier league
A training ground goal. Get over it.
Beautiful shot! Like a silky snooker shot!
As an Arsenal man ..it's time to Speak up....Mikel is not Good enough...apart from our Prem league position his decisions are poor.....From Martinez going to Villa ..Guendouzi Ozil Pepe Reiss Holding..team selection and tactics etc...we started with 1 striker for the 3rd game in a row in Must win games
A Ronaldo goal. Cr7 would be proud of that one!
Henry did not answer Jamie's question and just repeated what he already said. He would make a great politician!
Thierry Henry just completely ignored the question and repeated what he already said before LOL
Welcome back to MNF ,legend all the time hero💥💞✊ Thierry Henry 💞🙏
As a Chelsea fan I will always support Henry's constant attempts to get the Arsenal managers job
Ye course
The greatest player to ever play In the premier league♥️🔥 the king 👑                  Thierry Henry
Why they overanalysing it 🤦🏻‍♂️
Thierry gave some good advice there , repetition is key in any field of life
Henry somehow managed to place his hand on carraghers knee during this analyais 😃
Very instinctive yes, great goal. But is it only me who finds the skill to be quite simple, the ball was not moving quickly....and I've scored a couple of them in my time and I'm only an amateur footballer, I would expect any player on the highest level to be able to produce this kind of goal.
Best premier league player ever
Great goal no doubt but I hear Lamela is out for the rest of the season now waiting for hip replacement surgery
The brain send a message to his leg. Ha ha
Brilliant goal by Lamela. Thierry Henry BTW best striker to grace the premier league
Full marks & respect to T Henry, training and practice in life is fruitful 👍
unreal goal.. deserved fans in the stadium to see that
The only people that didn’t lose their mind in shock were AFTV
it was a great goal because it went in,  if it had gone wide or into the stands, meh !
THERE
Thierry Henry is a pussy batty face
Long Live The King 🤴
Shite enough that analysis of the goal, just say it was a great goal and move on.
Ah.. I see Henry has Mastered the Art of Talking alot without saying anything! 🧙‍♂️
TheirryHenry is right & wrong about left footed players. Yes they clearly never want to use their right foot I've noticed & pointed that out for several years now....No that doesn't make them look more graceful it's a massive disadvantage being 1 footed and it's always annoyed me watching players who don't use both feet you make so many errors in a game if you don't want to use 1 of your feet. You should use whatever you need to use in the given situation. Look at Robben, if he was a 2 footed player he'd probably have gotten Cristiano tallies most seasons, but the highest he ever scored in a season is 23 in all competitions and that is because he's 1 footed, one of the best 1 footed players in his time but still gets less than half Cristiano's tallies for over a decade's worth of seasons and it's not like he did much defensively he's similar to Cristiano apart from the fact he had no right foot (and wasn't as good in the air). Rooney scored higher tallies than Robben in a few seasons when Rooney was a massive team player, played deeper for longer, ran back more etc...but he's not 1 footed it makes a huge difference.
Anyone who didn't stand up in applause after that goal must have been drunk on whiskey
It will forever amaze how a genius player like Henry has absolutely nothing of value to say about the game.
Class from Henry
Lamela has tekkers
When King Henry talks i shut everything else out and just sit there and listen.
It was a good goal but if were this amazed by a rabona, football really has dropped in quality.
What a nice change to see civil humble players like Theirry and Jamie compared to Souness and Keane.
Thenry acting like he never seen Lord Bendtner do this every day 😂
Sky confirming that Henry got an erection from a Spurs goal
No one: Henry: *repetition creates habit*
2:49, 😂😂😂
Spuds are building a statue of Lamela as we speak.
Probably the best goal in the world 🌍 ⚽️
Goal of the season easy!!!
THEIRRY HENRY THE GREATEST PLAYER OF ALL TIME IN THE PREM
HENRY THE 🐐
Jeremy swaz lynch taught Thierry about the power of repetition. If only Henry was as good on the ball 😤
People are acting like this is the greatest goal of all time, the skill level of this goal isn't actually that high.
Leno should have saved that.
I was expecting an answer of I stood up because the studio gave us shitty chairs from poundland
We need Henry as our manager
Henry is the best player to ever grace the pl
This handball cheat 😡
They clearly haven't seen heskey during his prime he used to this on a regular basis
But then again only lemela could score such an amazing goal and then get a red card 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️😂🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴
Sit down Thierry, you traitor.  I'm West Ham but I feel sorry for the Arsenal fans ...
It’s a brilliant goal for sure, but when Thierry talks about hours and hours of practice in training to do that - why not spend that time improving your right foot shooting?!
He scored better than that few years back in the European league
Not a fan of Henry, but respect for his appreciation
"As a Frenchman,I cheated"
If I tried that I'd break both ankles
Why is Thierry not on commentary more?!!!!
The Rabona wasn’t that great but it gave us a lil Joga Bonita nostalgia from back in the days with the Golden era of Brazilian players etc. and shock value too.
Henry: prems best ever player
Look how serious his face is in the thumbnail he is passionate
As a arsenal fan when he scored that goal I walked out my room n came back to clap 🤣
The one from outside the box that he did a few years ago was a better goal
I'm very happy for thierry henry retuning to sky sports 😄
Im an arsenal fan, and its not even the best rabona lamela has scored. Fair play, was a good finish. Glad we won.
Greatest player on EPL history!
Spurs are editing a DVD about that goal as we speak
Errrrrrrrrmmmmp
Thats what spurs thought they were buying years ago, Lamela at Roma was sick.
It's like everyone at Tottenham is competing for the Puskas award.
This is an easy trick... I don’t know why it’s got so much buzz 🤣
I also stood up when lamela got a red card  He deserves it, the amount times he’s done it
No he didn't
and what did alan smith say at the time, nothing!
This goal has been celebrated more than Arsenal's win 😂😂
Lamela showed his inner “swaz tekkers”
I also stood up when Thierry Henry took THAT penalty 😅
One of those goals where my voice went up a few octaves.  Was it a cheer or a scream I made? I hope the former, as a man, but I will concede to the latter as a fan of the beautiful game.
wh wh wo wo
The best Robona I've ever seen.
How did he watch it if xhaka was playing?
I'm absolutely ashamed and disgusted with that performance as a Spurs fan. It's 100% mourinho to blame. Except for Lucas moura,not one single spurs player showed any passion. I think it shows the players don't want to play for mourinho. He has to be sacked, look where we are in the league. Porch on his worst day wouldn't have had us play that badly. JOSE OUT
People forget lamela did a better version of this few years ago 😂😂
Henry is a legend. My favourite player in football when though I’m a Villa Fan 💜
Henry doesn't look a day older since his goodbye video to Arsenal fans all those years ago in 2007.  Carragher by comparison has aged considerably.
Good to see Henry back on Sky again.
Sky sports acc need to upgrade their calculator for filming the slo mo replays
Where's the analysis on Harry Kane's elbow tackle on Gabriel ?
THE GOATS BACK
Thierry seems to forget about a certain 15 year old who was even better then the first team doing this in front of him on the reg.
Thats why in training you just have to go out your comfort zone and just try things otherwise you will enver become good at them in a real game situation. Training is the perfect time to mess up.
Scores possibly the goal of the season, yet get sent off and Spurs still lost.😂
I’m a Tottenham fan but Henry needs to come back to sky sports
You probably wouldn't know if you're not Chinese, this goal reminds me of the goal Zahavi scored when he was in Guangzhou RF (just search Zahavi Rabona). That goal killed the game thus makes it even better.
Thierry is a traitor!!!
Thierry Henry: greatest player in Arsenal’s history.
The legends back 😭😭😭
If only we’d won
and that's why Thierry is an elite commentator. the Argentinian Reflex Shot
Thierry Henry’s description is poetry in motion.
Breaking News; Thierry Henry STOOD UP
Goal of the season all year long
Henry is saying Lamela goal was great but it's "Normal" to Lamela. He did this goal i swear in the Europa League so clearly its Lamela go to trick shot that he probably practises every day. Still amazing goal
2:49 listen closely with full volume 😂😂😂😂😂
Reguillon couldnt believe it
As a spurs fan I love this guy, the way he talks about football and the way he does is so inspiring and motivating
Lamela acquired the rabona ability perk
Just shsuh and go to bournmeath
How many times does he do it in training...does he repeat it over and over again, repeat? What you reckon Theirry?
Was a quality goal but the best prem goal of all time is Dennis Bergkamp vs Newcastle. If he did that in 2021 with the internet would go into meltdown
Jeeweez I used to do this 30 years ago down the local park....
Lamela did that so quickly I didn't even see it first time
Spurs are forever in our shadow.
I love whenever Thierry Henry does his thing as a pundit
Carragher - Thierry was there ever a time you were going to do something in the box and then had to change your mind in a split second and do something else?  Thierry - Yes. Against Ireland. I realised I couldn't use my head or my foot, so I decided to cheat and use my hand instead to win a match.
Amazing goal, shame he was an idiot for the rest of the game
Phil Jones slots in goals more sophisticated than that
I remember seeing Lamela at 10 years old and I have followed him ever since. He is a exceptionally talented, dedicated and well trained player. This goal dosent surprise me he is under-rated.
Lol he scored a  Rabona and then after he got sent off lol 😂😂😂
No one hates spurs more the  henry. Best player in premier league history.
One of the best goals of all time IMO
If youre going to ask him a question like that, at least show a clip of his backheel goal to overlay the answer!
He left Montreal Fc to return back to punditry? I’m not complaining just asking
You can achieve anything you want, but you need to go on the training ground, and repeat. The Wisdom of Football 2021
Henry. The greatest
I stood up to swith the tv off for 30 seconds, I can't even watch them celebrate a goal.
2:49 Jamie waiting for the bass drop
I can't help but feel he must have passed on so many scoring opportunities because it wasn't on his left foot.
Everyone talks about Carragher saying "There" a lot, which he does. But no one mentions how LOUDLY he inhales!
One word:  LEGEND
My guy 14 🔴⚪💯
Henry the legend
As much insight as a blind man in the dark. How Henry keeps collecting cheques as a pundit is staggering.
All these so called “arsenal fans” twerking over the lamela goal not realising that we could’ve lost the game from it had we not came back. Plastic fans belong in the recycle bin 🗑
They should ask him about Evra's story.
If you just stop it THEEERE
Thierry is just different class
That's why martial arts have set patterns of moves that students repeat thousands of times - the body learns and is faster to react than the mind.
You know that when Henry stands up, it’s special.
There's no way Lamela doesn't win the Puskas award for 2021 off the back of that
Who remember that back heel goal that Ronaldo scored against I think aston villa, similar goal. Instinct
Fifa 21 update lamela 5 star skill ⭐️
Lamelas just gone up on fifa rating for that goal 😂
Been a while since a goal shocked me so much... wow
As an arsenal fan What I'd like to know is how many Tottenham fans stood up for your goal against them in 2002?
Jamie Carragher makes incredible impression of a duck at 2:50
As an "Arsenal man" you never get up for a Tottenham goal. Especially against Arsenal!
Henry’s back
I missed Henry, good to see him back :)
Thierry Henry acting like he didnt see swazalious lynch do that day in day out infront of him.
How many times is Lamela going to bring up his 250th appearance at a family BBQ
goal of the season tbf
Good goal but they lost the game
What a goal (united fan) but man said 0* weak foot 🤣🤣💯💯
Great goal
No the beard is gone
Henry: “I remember a few years ago a 15 year old who was able to do that”
even rivalry cant take anything away from a great goal
we were all reguillon lol
So did I to be honest.
Thiery Henry looking for a managers job :                                                                                                                        QPR : Va Va Voooom
Henry is ouzzing So much class ,
Im an arsenal fan but i have to admit it was a good goal but he still got red carded  its a tricky one to score a potential goal of the season and then get red carded is a bit mad  😬
The arsenal legend is back💥💥
It's a fantastic goal but for me, I still prefer Lanzini's as far as goal of the season goes
great goal tbf
Nice to see Henry back in the Sky Sports studio. Masterful punditry.
Not even the best rabona he’s ever scored
Good to see Thierry Henry back
Lamela just has to work on the other 99% of his game now
Arsenal fan or not, nobody can deny the class of that goal.
Carragher coaxed that data out of Henry very nicely.
I'm still angry lingard didn't win potm
Life lessons with Henry
Hopefully he didn't celebrate Son's injury like some worthless, pathetic Arsenal fans did.
It's good to see this man back on Sky
Stands up when Spurs score. Wont watch when Xhaka's captain. Who does this man really support?
I ejaculated everywhere wasn't pretty
This goal
Imagine if patrice was on this show 🤣🤣🤣
Tune into Monday Night Football tonight! 🍿  👌Wolves vs Liverpool  🔥Thierry Henry & Jamie Carragher in the studio
He still got sent off😂😂
As a Man City fan, Henry will always be remembered in everyone’s hearts
Respect for Henry for giving credit to a Tottenham goal as a former Arsenal player
Take notes, guys. This is what a real fan looks like; someone that gives respect where it’s due while still clearly showing where their heart truly lies, in a peaceful, non-violent manner that doesn’t involve things like racial slurs and bricks.
Have you ever been in a Trophy Cabinet?   *Didn’t think so*
Jamie “thereeeee” Carragher
And yet aftv are still going on about the win not talking about the goal
60
That goal was disgusting have to admit
Tbf Thierry we all did🤣to do that in such a tight situation and think about that shot in a small interval of time it was impressive
Nice quick upload because it’s Thierry Henry
Wonder what happened when he saw that Lanzini goal. Maybe he went out the room
That was a great meg and and a great rebona but sorry you lost Tottenham 😢
Goal of the season already
The Greatest Premier league player ever is back!
"Pascal Cygan used to score these all the time in training"  Thierry Henry 2021
Tottenham working on a DVD for Lamela’s Rabona goal as we speak  It’s the History of the Totnum
Again!!😮😮😮👏👏👏👏
For ME, henry is the prem GOAT
True say the left footed man are quite tekky
North London is red 🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴
Ladies and gentlemen......I present the greatest ever premier league player
One of the best goals I've ever seen tbh

Happy we beat Tottenham, but you’ve got to give credit to lamela👏🏾
How did this goal even happen? Lamela doesn't have 5 star skill moves.
You can’t deny it’s a simply outrageous goal! Doesn’t change that just because we’re rivals!! 🔴⚪️
He turned into Eric LaMessi for about 10 seconds
You could say that spurs fans got a raBona
