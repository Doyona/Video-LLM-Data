As a tall person, I relate too hard to that. I would find myself leaning over to hear her half of the conversation. Even simple displays of affection were cumulatively hard on my back over the course of the relationship
16:03 mans thinking about Kylie Jenner
2:37 by flapping his arms and jumping
Only $30 a month for all of Adobe's software? What alternate reality is this?
4:15 you guys should make a secret club
I hate movie spoilers so much
We suggested our engineer - far out in the southern ocean on a company computer with traffic that DEFINITELY gets screened by IT search “how to sink a fishing trawler in 5 minutes or less” just to see where that adventure would take him.  Much to our disgust, he refused to play the game.
I never liked Pepsi but after seeing that commercial I will continue to never drink it 😂
For the record, Fergie was massively underrated
1:55 thats just the beginning part of barry.
Huh! Historian is short!
9:40 There's a Russian... art guy who looks exactly like that
8:54 I never thought I'd see an Australian make fun of a... Brit? Is he British?
Where is this tall guy from? I mean, which video on the channel? Is it not available anymore?
14:33 wait wait wait....does having the philosophers stone in your rectum mean that you shan't be able to shat without dying?
11:21 I was thinking "Mmmh, liquid mercury."
I rewatched incognito mode so often I forget wich clip was rejected.
You know I love the fact that you are the internet historian but I also want you to do the actual history that AI is on its way to erase
14:00 isnt like Albedo n shit Ingredients in The Witcher?
Craigslist hitman... hotline Miami?
"I'm turning 360 degrees and walking away" *Walks into customer service desk*
0:31
Need more ordinary things IH collab
how much can you discount me from $2500
This should be an annual series at the end of ITF seasons
Lmao Internet Histo4ian got completely *owned* by those chads
Any sponsor that rejected your ad reads is insane
"Just do kewl shite..!!"   Brilliant advice..!!
Don't buy hellofresh. It's a waste of money, takes a ton of time to actually prep and cook, and every box always has a TON of plastic packaging for no reason
12:08 Mitchell and Webb sketch
I got a YouTube Disney+ ad during IH's Hello Fresh advert and I swear to God I thought it was just part of his advert 😅
WHY are you still here.
0:55 here we see IH planting the shadow of doubt well in advance.
*Video Starts* *Christ Benoit music starts playing*
Will Internet Historian EVER collab with a woman??
Back for a rewatch, IH adds are still the best in existences. period.
lol redditors couldn't touch this
10:34 It looks good?? It looks like he took a bunch of dry and dirty leaves during fall and put them in pieces! 😂
I worked in a busy restaurant Kitchen for a few years, and I know what Heston is getting at… 😏
How did I never listen to this episode before? “ something happens it’s a cheat code” had me dying, laughing
I love how right after the adobe bit I got an ad from ADOBE 😂
I rejected this episode for over two years. Im better now.
Pepsi vending machine kid ad was weak. Think about it. Coca-Cola actually made 2 sales vs the 1 Pepsi sale.
Is an ejector seat just people lying to themselves about the airplane rejecting them?
Freshboy.
On being tall: I’m a tall woman, and sometimes I see other tall women and I think “wow she’s so tall! Like noticeably tall. I’m glad I’m not that tall” then I walk past her and realize we are about the same height.   My brother is about 7 or so inches taller than me, but I’m really used to his height. Yet somehow when I see other guys that are his height I’m like “wow they’re so tall!” But then with my brother I’m like “normal height”
20:20 you that guy totally cheated lol ur not allowed to say or do anything to draw the other persons attention to the sign ; its supposed to be like, mythic difficulty "made u look"  kuz ur in their head 😂
19.40 that's literally my town???? it's like a half hour walk from me??? what the f is he doing there
Soooo, the N word literally means black!! Why is it bad then? Unless black is a bad word as well?
1:55 Why did I think Craigslist hit man was gonna about be us, as the main character, hiring a trailer park killer? Wtf, my weed must be decent…
0:56 not right now 😬
I'd totally play this Hitman game.
Never heard JonTron bust down laughing quite like that. I already didn't expect him in this video
I really wanna know what "big fucking spoiler" could have been to this day
My favorite intro to litterally anything.
My uncle is very tall. My dad was an absolute bully. So when my uncle was small, he prayed day and night that he would get big so my dad wouldn't pick on him anymore.   He's head and shoulders above absolutely everyone else in the family. Though his wife's only 5 foot.
12:32 ive always thought of that meme from like a dude on the street that says ive been searching for the philosopher stone for years , and i never understood what stone he searchin for
Crazy to be watching a video and see a stock image of the movie theater that I saw Revenge of the Sith at.
5:27 Adobe
Blue and Red saturated scenery is also highly prevalent in the Austin Powers movies. Representing the Union Jack, I figure. (Referring to the Pepsi ad.)
4:34 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
How dare you reject this ❤
Jesus loves you. I love you.
20:29 Allow me to enlighten you about what those guys did. What the did was an example of playful taunting. A better example is when someone asks for a high-five up high, down low, and in the middle ; where, when you’re about to high-five them in the middle, the other person will pull their hand away and say too slow. I have that exact same thing that IH experienced done to me numerous times, but I was never punched in the shoulder. Maybe that’s a British/Irish/Australian thing…?
15:42 i have not heard johntron laugh like that before oh my god lmao
Jontron's laugh gives me life
15:35 😂
It took me way too long to figure out this video isnt about rejection, its just unused clips
Craigslist Hitman sounds like an absolute banger of a TV show, love the premise.
I see why
This onion represents my sadness - coz I cry when I cut it :D
I'm 6'6 and I've never had any of these problems.
the only people who are more smug and artsy than actual artists are definitely chefs.  jeesus christ give it a rest lmao.  they are all trying to be Gorden Ramsey and it really shows. just make delicious food and stop pretending you are some kind of galaxy brained entrepreneuric connoisseur its fucking obnoxious lmao.
Free seat next to the emergency exit in a Boeing didn't age well. BTW: This Pepsi Ad made my favor Coke.
Damn last comments a year ago
Tall guy interview questions. We know you want to talk about it.
I know how a nuclear bomb works. The hard part is getting enriched uranium.
Tall people work well together cause they see eye to eye.
"The Ok game" I was homeschooled, and was (am) incredibly painfully socially retarded when I finally went to public school.  It took me like four years to figure out the inane rules surrounding the stupid hand sign, and why I was constantly getting punched and laughed at.   The 00s where a rough time to be a kid.
Short guys sitting down when they meet a girl. Stand up, and the height of their head doesn't change. Walk off like a boss.  Sploosh.
lol...
Craigslist Hitman sounds like a fantastic game im being completely unironic, reminds me of hotline miami
Everything this man says about freakishly tall people is correct. I've done that thing where the tall monster of a man is really shorter than me at the grocery store like once per month. You gots ta be more than 6.5 feet tall (metrics need not apply) to understand what's up.
You know there's some clips in here that would have done great in your Ads video....
The kid in the pepsi advert buys two cokes to buy one pepsi. Coke still won 🤦‍♂️
Craigslist hitman sounds amazing!  Level 2 is the trailerpark, then Walmart... theres so much potential
"I will remind you that I have 6 years in this professionally..." "Uh, hello." "I'm on break." FLAWLESS
Also none of their meals are "affordable" it got to the point where they charged me $40 for one box, I cancelled immediately
That sucks.. if I worked at Best Buy… or any Pc store, I would tell people about torrenting lol
Spaghetti 🍝 is such a funny word. (ad over)
"I wanna talk to a manager"  "Feel free. He also isnt Jonathan Adobe "😂😂
clearly he produces better content with his deadbeat friends than with rando youtube celebs
For anyone wandering, "how to make a pipe bomb" did spike in searches a lot after this video.
Must’ve been the clean, radio friendly version but I always thought the song was saying “let’s get it started in here, let’s get it started in HA” 😭
this is why one michelin star restaurants in asia would be better. they just "here food eat it" and the food just good.
god damn rubedos taking our jobs.
Hell yeah Isaac Butterfield! I didn’t even recognize him until he said he’s 6’8!
it took me 11 minutes to realize these were rejected segments of other videos also i should probably get some sleep and i am probably very dangerously acoustic
Nei gschaut!!! hahahahaha XD Best story ever!
I was on WSB before GME. Feels bad, man
Why was Lewis's episode binned? Surely you had more salvageable material than the one height anecdote.
WHICH EPISODE IS LEWIS IN, I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE ;_;
That last one is the movie equivalent of a waiter placing your order on your table and then spitting on it in front of you
You want to know how to make the philosopher's stone? Piss in a bucket for 20 years and combine. Not even joking.
I don't think it's "murder for hire" that's gonna get you dinged as a search term. Because the subject itself is broad enough that it's understandable. It's like the difference in speech between "I hate you and would kill you any chance I get" and "I am going to kill you tomorrow on your porch at 4 PM". You probably get put on a list for stuff like "can I hire someone to kill another person" with specific locations and etc. Useless searches, but it shows more intent. Overall though I don't think these lists are probably that useful. Almost everytime there is a mass murder or terrorist event, we hear "the FBI had them on their radar" or insert the appropriate agency for another country. Setting aside the whole possibility of agencies purposely allowing killers to do their stuff to justify their existence, the reality is that with millions of people potentially planning to do bad stuff, they're not going to start pursuing those leads on all those people. It just becomes another potential checkmark/categorization in a government database somewhere that may or may not ever be used.
I can understand why you’d want to reject the Johntron bits…
The "I know what to do, I did this for several years: I'M ON A BRAKE!" moment made me snore coke throu my nose, like the liquid kind.
Everything everywhere all at once was so overrated and the end got wo stupidly outrageous that it was just annoying.
😂 omg yes, the Adobe bit killed me. The idea of buying a used Toyota and running through the front door of Adobe.😂
Did I see Isaac buttercuck?
You know what...I like the ads better than the actual content.
Paying $2500 for photoshop when there’s a cracked version of every single year is outrageous.
He is the best guest hands down the funniest every time hes on.
What's that sneaky lad in the background @ 10:45 doing? Dusting the light fixtures?
12:10 - This is a Mitchell & Webb sketch, almost word-for-word.
The moment he said "Ad time" to begin his sponsorship part i got an ad...
I've been watching the main channel quite a bit, but now I'm mad at myself for not binging the alt channels as well. These are amazing.
3:48 always has to be one of my favorite jokes, lol
As a man who is 5'1", that guy who was 6'8" is now one of my many archenemies. I'm not going to seek any sort of vengeance or anything, I'm just very upset with him.
I’m glad I’m just 6.5 now
1:21 I don’t know if it’s still up, but there’s a website and it’s not on the dark web that you can go to to hire a hitman! It was originally a joke, but as we all know, a lot of people are not so.. bright!  Edit: rent – a – hitman if you search that on YouTube, you’ll find out what I’m talking about! People actually go to it and it’s leading to arrest! I’ll blame the lack of common sense/ logic & education… never mind there’s so many variables!  If anybody knows what I’m talking about about let me know !
ah.. the "got rejected" thing prank
THE TIM ALLEN “OOWHA?” AT 17:24 RUINED MY ENTIRE DAY HAHAHAHAHA THATS SO FUCKING GREAT HAHAHAHA
Oh boy. The bit about the dead kids ghost seeing the nft rocket going to the moon as he ascends to heaven was really special.
The Craigslist hitman game would be kinda awesome.
Many kudos, johntron, and ordinarry things are pure legends, its nice to see the historian finally spending time with his kids😊
Sumito is just too op 😂😂😂
"I sit back down and the spell breaks" got me
Algorithm feeding time for your stats
You have made my common denominator hole quiver.
Jesus H Christ you do the best ads on the whole internet
That's the hardest I've ever heard Jon laugh 🤣🤣🤣
15:06 yo Jontron
Honestly the whole bit about being tall automatically makes a guy look more attractive than he is...uh did that sentence make any sense? Whatever.   It makes me wonder if there's ever been a serial killer who exclusively kills tall people and whenever he does, he cuts off their legs and maybe their arms. Like some guy who's always been picked or passed up on opportunities because of his height, and one day he can't take it anymore. So he starts with the guy his crush or ex girlfriend is dating, and slowly starts racking up a killcount by prowling around basketball courts looking for the tallest guys he can find so he follow them. Maybe they go to a bar, he buys them a few drinks, and drugs them. Then they wake up like 3 hours later with their legs cut off dangling in front of them like Christmas stockings. He looks over to his side and sees multiple corpses. Some with their eyes cut out, some with the throat slit, and some with bullet holes in the head. But they all have one thing in common. They're all rather tall individuals with no legs.
The Adobe bit with Sumito was brutal. Historian is real good at improv and here he got totally demolished. Felt like Sumito used up all of the stuff he always wished he could tell the customers and just beat down Historian with it with 0 goddamn mercy. Hah. Brilliant.
Im turning 360 degrees Hahahaha
4:00 as a 5'7 guy this killed 😂
I really want a game like Craigslist Hitman
YO where can I find that Lewis episode?!?
15:30 "that one didn't age quite so well"
Im a chef and im so embarrassed by the sheer levels of pretention in my trade
This is completely Radom but i just realized that north America jokes about the bowing in Asian cultures but we all do it as a courtesy. I probably nod to like 40 people a day just on the street
Wtf thats my hometown at 19:43
I haven’t watched in a while. I’m glad the first one back had ordinary things. I’m a big fan.
9:15 the kid from the Stede video
Dude, I just love you, the way you talk, your cadence, humor, god I feel like if I knew u in life I wouldn't be able to breathe round you haha love your stuff
where the fuck do you l ive where it costs $30 for a bottle of Whiskey???
2:50 I tried this recently being 6'5". Did not work...
The murder for hire one is literally just hotline Miami
Unique name for a podcast.
I now understand why there's so many tall men with short women but no tall women with short men.
Alright lets all google how to make a pipe bomb .. lets DO IT
20:45 wouldn’t… wouldn’t it make more sense to shoot the people who assaulted you?  - Peter Griffin
(15:35) I know JonTron pretends to be evil to the people who work on his videos with him (he'll have a behind the scenes where he goes off on them), but that laugh is GENUINE villainy.
Craigslist hit man... You're describing GTA
1:42 Legit couldn't help but laugh from here onwards.
Forget about photoshop… you really can get fake tits for $2,500, I know that sounds sketchy but the pair I saw in that price range looked like a million bucks.
I'm sure it's been said, but all the colors of the materials for the Philosophers stone are the same colors we refer to people as. So...FMA intensifies and all that.
you really could probably get tit embiggening surgery for less than lifetime photoshop
my fav has always been ordinary things, for anyone else who agrees his bits are at 0:38 and 11:45
0:18 Disco Elysium.
you just know that guys works in a theater just so that he can 'accidentally' spoil movies for everyone he talks to
I feel like a JonTron + IH collab would be fire.
buddy of mine passed away back in 08, but he was 7"4 and his wife is 5"4, it looked hilarious
Pepsi < Coca-Cola
I THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME BUT YOU HAD JUST ACTED
FED POST, REDACTED
Omg . Yes, fuck with the nsa...I'll go do those searches now.
so if i were to sacrifice 1 person from each race i get immortality? specfics on the ritual, asking for a friend.
seeweed chips are very tasty
devestated
"And I'm going to shoot my useless friends who didn't help me" 😆 wait what
Why does your food look like the actual contents of my stomach?
I know how to make a atom bomb....its just that the materials are so hard to come by..... you need a sufficiently sized sphere of uranium 235 surround it with explosives causing it to implode and well BOOOOOOOOOOM!
ahh yes... the philosopher's stone... just *Elign* to *Asshole*   perfect spelling no problems.
The fact that The Boys made a parody of the Kylie Jenner Pepsi ad is hillarious.
Did anyone actually look up "how to hire a hitman"?
Fun fact, in the United States instead of the first Harry Potter book being called Philosopher's Stone, it was called Sorcerer's Stone.
As much as I love this and your main channel, I would absolutely listen to a podcast done by IH and friends.
10:10 Ah, finally, I can see where The Menu got its inspiration and script now.
I think tall men don't befriend short men because they have to constantly look down on them which is just awkward for both of them.
now we need the directors cut of all the times jontron said the n word during the shooting
How can you recognize a bomb if you have not seen one before? I mean what if someone tells you his weird bread box is a bomb. If you haven't seen either of these two things before, because I don't know, ...you are are a 3 year old or something, how could you know the person lies.
I feel as though 90% of IH's stories have happened to me before - even like the two dudes saluting him in the new video. Damn it hits home - maybe it's an Australasian thing.
The truth of the philosopher's stone is actually quite interesting. You create one by distilling your own urine, leaving behind a precipitate. By continually adding urine to the flask, heating and distilling, you eventually create a philosopher's stone. I am not making a joke, this is really how it's done, it's that ridiculous.
Does anyone know where the rejected clips with Lewis are from? I thought I'd seen all of the Incognito Mode vids, but I really don't recognize Lewis or that background. Was there an entire Incog that got rejected?
Monetized? Rejected !
I think Pepsi should've gotten MORE flak for that dumbass ad.
IH is the absolute gold standard when it comes to advertising. I hope they give him extra for making ads people will actually sit through
We need a full Lewis Spears episode
When i think about it that pepsi commercial withe the kid is horrible. Yeah he didnt drink the pepsi, but coke made 50cents
women into tall guys are fatherless, so when I'd be down bad I'd just vibe with whomever and if my flirting was going anywhere or not didn't matter cause I'm 6ft1in so any average height female seems me as like an authority figure. But they want a guy that is fatherly and just treats them like a princess and shit like that, but they're wh0r3s so they'll be with you till they're bored so it's a cheat code for getting with easy idiots but someone worthwhile will see it as a bonus not this highly desirable trait or maybe its desired but it's not enough to shift the needle a lot.  idk but be careful cause short fatherless women are the worst.
you know whats cheaper than 2500$ and 30$ a month, piracy!
even the bomb search would put you on a list, they have a dumb list of keywords
I don't know if your sponsors like the way you incorporate them into your videos or not, but they bloody well should.
5:36 Sumito's comedic timing is always on point

guest? :(
hello fresh: send stuff to your house and maybe use it
Craigslist hitman is unironically a hilarious game idea
Fancy seeing Lewis here. I've seen his shows in person never expected him to show up here. Legend
GIMP has always worked for me, but I'm not a designer 😊
4:11 that is very true. funny to hear someone montion it though.
Was this reuploaded? I feel like i watched this years ago.
We need to know what the movie clerk said to spoil everything everywhere XD
some times you just lose track of short girls. amazing line!
So when it comes to Everything Everywhere All At Once, first off I didnt think it was this just amazing cinematic masterpiece. It was good, but not even particularly great. I don't know what IH could mean abt spoilers, the husband character legit describes everything abt it in the opening twenty minutes at the IRS meeting or w/e.  Rly the only thing that I picked up on was how totally excellent a job the girl actress did w/ the daghter character. What a treat it was watching her just annihilate that role. Even, uhh, Jessica Chow(?) wasnt particularly great. She's been better in many past Hong Kong cinema roles before imo.  But yeah. Dunno what like, major spoilers IH could even be talking abt...
20:16 my mind told me to instantly say “no I didn’t?”
12:13 what if alchemists accidentally created a behelit?
My spoon is too big!
I worked at a theater for 8 years and we couldn't meantion anything about the movies incase people ha ent seen it yet. But you should have demanded a refund.
there's something eerily familiar about the Hello Fresh chef
I know exactly what the movie theater guy said and that was not in any way a spoiler
13:41 took me out lol
This show would make for a fire podcast!
I should catch up!
Best hello fresh ad ever.
internet historian DLC
Hello fresh man is great
Press (F) to numb conscience
next: Regard. you are regardet, and thats okay. we are all regarded
Denied
So, are we still searching "how to make pipe bomb" or?
Hit man game should be called Craig’s-List
5:00 those aren’t pranks, they’re incel entertainment 😀
8:48
Bro i'm height afflicted also and legit at the airport they just offer it straight up every time.
Lewis in Cartoon form is just Pierre Emile Hojbjerg. It's uncanny.
Jontron is fuggin hilarious
When you just listen, the seaweed sounds like a massive dump
I have been a chef and eaten at some fancy places. And it's all shit. I hate it. J just my $0.39 burger at McDonald's baby!
The story towards the end where the guy did the ok sign and punched you is wild as hell. Just wow. Screw those guys
Did anybody know from what video at 20:54 ?
Dude, when did you make a video with lewis?
My dog freaked tf out when the dog barked in the ad break
Difference between us True Kiwi's and an aussie Kiwi: Ausie kiwi gets punched in the shoulder, says nothing and walks away with little dignity. True Kiwi would punch them all in the head even if it was a losing fight.
This all are good tho
When IH's cut stuff is still absolute gold
Rubedo is that resource in Warframe. And its main distinguishing feature is that yes, it is red.
All of the stories I tell about food are about how the food tasted good and not about the presentation
that pepsi ad was truly 100% soulless evil latching onto societal unrest I dislike late capitalism and its parasites
bruh, the only offensive goodbye was jontrons LMAO.
The ULTIMATE COMPLIMENT:  this is the *only channel* where I actually watch the commercials because they are funny.  I even look forward to them.
As a dungeon master, there is a good chance i am on at least a few lists...
A gastronomic kitchen is exactly how they describe it though. The tools and stuff is complicated for nothing
The Adobe bit was too good. Way too good
does anybody know where that scene was pulled from? 8:00
aaah lewis was the chap they didnt like hu
Absolutely shocked the hello fresh one didn't make it
tallman here, had another obscenely tall guy I worked with and we'd always high five as HIGH AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE in passing. It was like our thing. Never really talked to him beyond that, just hi-5'ed a lot.
"You can also pay 30 dollars a month." Shows that that is an older rejected clip. It's 60 now.
I want to hire these guys to do adverts for me 😂. We seem to think in similar humor sketch format.
hey hey, im 5cm smaller.......yea small girls are bitches for tall guys.....dont know why.......
5:36 finally the resolution to sumito’s “i’m on break”
ok, so it turns out there are two versions of the song at 17:16; there's "Let's get retarded" and there's "Let's get it started", both by the same band. I had no idea there were two versions of the song.
wanna read something dumb that will make you think why people dont want you to bring fruits to a plane there might be 2 reasons first reason is so you spend money on more expensive food cause of airport economy the second reason food gets radiated so they dont want to bring mutated plants down
This tube made me get Hello  Fresh.   Tru Story(R) bro(R).
3:34 I had a very short partner back in the day, but I'm not Lewis right so she wasn't _outside_ my peripheral vision, she was on the border. If she walked up to me from around a corner I would just see this strange amorphous shadow creature (aka her black hair, which was the only visible part of her from my height) moving towards me. Got startled every time.
Oh sick the slur cut
I would love to see Mr beast in this art style
Sumito and Jon are so fuckin funny, you have such good chemistry with both of them I wish ya'll could just do this forever ;u;
The philosophers stone conversation was on while I was watching fullmetal alchemist
Hello Dad, I'm Fresh
Wait, did the video with Lewis get deleted? I don’t ever remember a video with him ever releasing.
21:27 *Bold statements from Internet Historian!*
That chef is the one that made the print on the back of Mother, same vibes XD
They got it all wrong, it's not the Philosophers Stone, it's a stoned Philosopher pretending to turn Mercury to gold.
idk how you're so good at getting people to improv so well but keep it up, your guests seem to be having just as much fun as we do
I love how the cooking portion is just basically the movie Menu.
6:25 Turning a 360 just means you back where you started.
That Pepsi Vending Machine ad... They really just advertised Coke selling TWO cans to their one can. Even if they kid didn't drink them, that's still double the profit for Coke vs Pepsi, okay???? I guess marketing???
"im turning 360 degrees" got me 6:19
unironically the only ads i actually look forward 2
Seems that in ahole man video got rejected again
Soooo he just accept he lost his password to internet historian right?
GIMP is free
All women secretly have size kinks.
Are you allive and good Historian?
Cave reupload got rejected. lol
The cave just wont let him upload.
Where did the cave re-upload video go I had it saved I was just going to watch it and it's gone
Lmao it is almost cheaper to get fake tits then to buy photoshop outright nowadays.
Jontron nft bit was the best
Who striked the reuploded hole
can you go back to making main channel vids again?
Craigslist hitman sounds like it could be a flash game in the Golden age when I was in high school
you are on my list.
Craigslist Hitman actually sounds like such a banger of a game
When he said its like an orchestra....im pretty sure he only meant that every section has to working in SYMPHONY to make sure everything is ....he should have said engine ...all parts working together and in conjunction with the others to produce the forward motion...its a chefs job to make sure every section of the kitchen is working to one end goal....get the food out ...but i dont think he was also tryin to make it sound cooler  or more important than it is....he just didnt know another analogy lol
Lol all women care about when it comes to dating is public perception and looks...yet wanna get mad when you do it right back ....im a midget its how i know
Can you do one of these with Marcintopants
Reminder: It is always morally correct to pirate Adobe Software
I like the Mitchell and Webb reference with the market place Philosopher's Stone
Every 6 weeks my ass!
That tall person conversation was hilarious. Every point was spot on 😂
We just need Pepsi to achieve world peace
I really appreciate the other channels playlists. I'm just sad more channels don't do the same.
I feel like I should be surprised JonTron is a /biz/raeli, but I'm not
I had a dream that Incognito uploaded a video titled, "Ghosts" and it was just Historian's face on the girl from the Ring crawling out of the tv and I got so excited about them talking about spiritual folklore and then I woke up to this sad reality
IH and Sumito doing some retail interaction roleplay is my favorite recurring bit
Why an Aussie and a Brit wearing American combat gear in a battlefield?
Voice is very familiar Mr IH..
What's the intro music?
The movie "The Menu" makes do much more sense now
That Pepsi vending machine ad always made me laugh. CocaCola still got 2 sales out of the deal.
When I killed my wife it seemed to make me very unpopular with the local ladies. Married and unmarried. I  dont know why tho. I'm just a NORDidanary man .. NORD !!!! reeeeejec🤛
13:03 CORRECT! 🛎🛎🛎🛎🛎🛎🛎🛎🛎🛎🛎🛎🛎🛎🛎ding ding ding ding ding!
Can you go to alchemist restaurant, i want your thought about the place, situation, etc. (i never go there)
I just hope there's a full length Lewis Spears episode coming soon
Was the lewis spears video not released?
Main channel when?
Trolling the NSA is angelic work
I hope these guys have seen Barry cuz they basically describe his personality with the craiglist hit list 😂
I'm surprised he didn't call this In The Bin (like a rubbish bin)
"Goddam Rubedo's" is my favourite Internet Historian Quote
I'd like to see an "in the field" with donut operator
Why did the Hello Fresh ad get rejected? It was so funny
I think I know what the guy said, Spoiler incase you haven't seen everything everywher all at once                so I think he said " there really are a lot of social analysis/appreciate what you have movies coming out these days"
Hey, you dropped your wallet!      👌
Speaking of rejected... What happened to the cave episode on the main channel?
2:12 Barry, they are describing Barry
I used to work for an airport, and I assure you that if you've ever searched for a copy of The Anarchist's Cookbook you are on a list.
So you're a midget
All the guests are excellent, but Ordinary Things is top tier for me
hey brother! i noticed you forgot to answer to my last text haha its okay! when are we going to make the collaboration!
It took me half the video to realize that these were not, in fact, clips that were themed around rejection, but in reality clips that didn't make it into videos
_"I am going to spend 5,000 dollars on food that is the size of two American quarters"_  -Rich People
for 2,500 dollars I could get a cheap car, a pistol and rob a bank in minecraft and then use my ill-gotten gains to just buy the Adobe company outright.
Acutally you could probably get implants for 2500$ instead of just making them larger with photoshop. That really is a baffling amount of money.
Did he got rejected from art school?!
That photoshop talk, JESUS like I had JUST bought it for like 500 or so and they switched to that fucking monthly thing XD
8:57 only someone that has no fucking idea about how an orchestra works could say that.
I would like a rejected part 2 please. Thank you.
Feel like if you went to 3 home depos it would look a bit weird on the system
Philosophers stones are people!   FMA fans will understand
What happened to the guy who got stuck in a cave video on his main channel??
Damn, that pepsi ad was released 5 years ago. Feel old yet!
This channel is shyte compared to internet historian
If you want to set someone up as a fall-guy for the murder you’re about to commit, I always thought it would be prudent to use his device to search “how to get rid of a dead body” around the time of the murder.   …which is why I never search for those kinds of things. You never know when someone around you might disappear and reappear as dead. Never hurts to be safe.
There's actually a spike in trend of "how to make a pipe bomb lmao"
1 year since the last Internet Historian video 😭😭😭😭
That guy got your ass!
Capitalist advertising decides supply and demand what is rejected and dejected?
You are the only content maker on YouTube where i never skip the ads, they are gold!
The searching for illegal stuff actually puts you this spiderweb of connection. The system sees your messeges and searches and puts you on this web of connection. The more you search these things that trigger the algorithm the more you stand out in the web. This system proved good result many times when it comes to avoid terrorist attack and preventing them before they happend
being 6'5 i have to bend over to hear my stepson or crouch
21:00 completely agree with you.
This video needs more ads.
What psychopath works at a movie theatre and assumes ANYONE buying tickets has seen the movie??
15:58  I've never seen that done unironically before, had a real good laugh.
And episode about flirting, you know, funny stories, fail, and successes would be cool.
HEY Internet Historian, How about an episode about.... Cars!
wow mate you really fucked the pipe bomb analytics
That bit about the rocket to the Moon is why JonTron is super funny and sharp!
YouTube excuse me why did it take you a MONTH to alert me to this video
2:18 f-35 or f-22 in the background
Why did I miss this
20:02 WAIT! That is called an OK sign?!?! 😮
The amount of time I needed to realize that this episode is not about rejection but consists of rejected material.
okay, but everything everywhere all at once was actually an excellent film.
dude i punched him
What was the spoiler? I saw the film already. I'm imagining him say "there sure are a lot of multiverse moves coming out right now" if it was that though that's kinda sad to get upset by. Like calm down you should know that from the title.
God I love your ads
I can attest for what bro said. Im 6'2 and work with a girl who's 4'10 so I literally have to crane my neck all the way down to talk to her
bro even the out-takes from the shit post channel are some of the best content on this platorm. why do other people even try?
for your knowledge, the "philosopher stone" is a type of truffle.
one of those voices at the end makes me realize I should go see what's new on RadicalSoda's channel
What happened to the Man in the caves video? Was it rejected?
Omg the tall people thing! My husband is 6ft and he's the short one of his friends. One is nearly 7feet tall. They run in packs.
🍈
the cut parts are the best
hello Fresh. Stop Eating Trash. there is no better slogan for them. IH is not being paid enough
Oh, I remember back when Internet Historian made content
That was the day Kendall Jenner solved racism and became the greatest hero of the human race
Is JinTron part of SANS now?
20:40 gotta be the best twist ending
Any one have the video of The Hole or Man in Cave I used it to sleep now I can't.  I'm not saying it's boring I'm just saying it helped me sleep by keeping my mind entertained. Thank you
The pain of randomly receiving a spoiler for something you had purposely gone out of your way to avoid any spoilers of is the worst. I was lucky enough to have almost completely avoided spoilers, but if the same happened to me, I might've just had a break down right there in front of the employee.
“I’m trying not to spoil it”  Proceeds to flash the spoilers to 30 movies on the screen
sucks that man in a cave is gone
I’d kill to see him do podcasts after his. He has good chemistry with everyone here
the jontron crossover?! god I love it
Bro that sai baba photo in the shop 💀💀💀
Everything everywhere all at once sucks
I also wanted to see that movie but the video that introduced it to me also spoiled the entire thing despite saying they wouldn't include spoilers and then went on to talk about the entire plot and its ending. :(
Sorry for the Clip-Show ey?
Umm… why did Man in Hole get taken down???
0:05 rejected is a film by don hertzfeldt
I honestly thought the rebelsis ad I got was part of the video at first.
War crimes make more sense than Wokeism at this point.
im like pretty tall for my age and i always have been so i would hang out with these 2 other kids at school. now there like so tall there looking down at everyone and im just there lik "hi heheh rem- remember me"
the title of this video predicted the fate of "the cave" video.
Yeah, that old bepis ad. In that ad, Coke sold 2x as much of their soda. Laughing all the way to the bank.
Yeah, the chicks going for the really tall guy just want to rest their knees
Funny how in the making of this all the footage of him typing in the search terms in the google search box actually does the search even if you dont press search
Do you know that HelloFresh uses monkey slave labor?
To be fair to that guy who “spoiled” everything everywhere… it’s not like a spoiler of a twist. He spoiled the premise of the movie that you would have gotten from even seeing a trailer
I crave these
i guess "man in a cave" got rejected XD
Serious suggestion:  I'd love it if you made a video on "Stockholm Syndrome" - Kristin Enmark (the woman the phrase was invented because of) cowrote a book about it in swedish. I would offer to translate it for you, but frankly it would take a year, considering I also have to work :( But the book is quite eye-opening. Like the fact that she didn't actually fall in love with her captor, or that she had very good reason to not trust the police. I figured with your viewer-numbers, it might really help get the truth out there in her lifetime :)
I just love how watching these vids is just massive shit posting. Its what I'm here for. Just hypotheticals and whatever topic for the kick lololol
Now im on a list .. I just wanted to know how to do my plumbing...
Iloveinternethistorian❤
Love the jontron cameo
I had to look up “ facile” fuck you internet historian for making me learn.
The opening is always the best part of your videos. Never fails to make me smile.
I can hardly ever rewatch any of your videos because they are so memorable
Turns out they're all slurs lmfaoooo
I was much smaller than all of them.   So anyway, I started blasting.
That NFT joke from JonTron at 15:30 is honestly the best one I heard from him ever! (His laugh makes it even better!)
Why does this bloke use the Imperial system to describe people's height but the Metric system to describe distances between people? Where the fuck is he from??
Curious if anyone has actually used his code with how awesome his ads are
What happened with the hole video on the main channel?
I've had a crush on a girl in my class for a year now, and I think she feels the same way about me. But, I'm an introverted person, so I'm too shy to ask her out. I'm not sure if she's into dating but i really want to hang out with her.
15:30 is unbelievably funny
It's called the circle game and is probably as old as most of your viewers.  It comes and goes.
"They said there's fire, but the fire was Ice". Fire = Red; Ice = Blue
New hello fresh. What do you think?
The black, white, red, and yellow that go into the Philosopher's Stone happen to be the colours of the four humours. Coincidence? I think not.
With IH's lady, that is the only time I can except the word HERstory...ian.
Rejected? Art? Art school? Uh oh.
How tall was the tall guy?
No matter how many time I watch, the "I shall warn you, I have years of experience in this domain" followed by an immediate "I'm on break" is absolutely hilarious
What episode was lewis in? I dont think i remember seeing it
Lmao "how to make pipe bomb" is actually trending on Google trends
Godamm Rubidos...
Loved this!❤
We need more JonTron. Easily the funniest guest aside from OrdinaryThings.
What makes the philosphers stone such a rediculous concept is that if any ever used the iron in their blood would turn to gold and they would die
the most rewatched part of this video is the ad.  Revolutionary, dude.
Awesome 👍
THE KING RETURNS!!!
Yo just imagine a philosophers stone buttplug or sex toy. You don’t know what will happen because of it but you know it will at least be just like any other buttplug or sex toy
So did yall google bombs?
Please do more stuff with Lewis Spears!
i was the guy that *okay'd* internet historian. ive seen his face. contact me and i will draw up a police style sketch for $99.99
That ad is definitely how you combine horror and food together.
Hey come on IH, your tits look fine!
incogneetus
I work with revit/autoCAD which requires a $30,000 liscense. Software shouldn’t cost so much
Pls one about ghosts…. Ghosts! What iiiis a ghost?
This was great. I really hope you can collab with JonTron more lol
Thanks historian, due to the VPN, big brother thinks I am in Nicaragua, after looking up "Murder for Hire". See, I put "Internet Historian" on the contract, so now, ya know, your life depends on how anonymous, you can be.    XOXO love ya babe
"You see a tall person, their best friend tends to be tall" Not the case with me, all my friends I have ever had have been small. I'm 5'10 and they are in the range of 5'0 to 5'4. I just find this funny
bro honestly you could just make ads for videos and id watch that shit
Why can’t all ads be this entertaining 🤧
The cut section about meals being a story predicted "The Menu" plot
presteige humor
id be so tight if the theatre clerk spoiled the movie
15:47 to skip JonTron. He is chronically unfunny and I don't care that he hates minorities
Already have Hello Fresh and will say, it has some bomb dishes and helps you keep to a diet. I go for the vegetarian and vegan dishes but once and a while will get the meat ones (meat makes me sick after eating even if I enjoy it, don't know why but it does) because sometimes I need some steak or burgers, etc. I will say it is a good buy. Save money on buying ingredients and other unnecessary stuff I would regularly buy with it though. Although, you will have to end up buying cooking tools/utensils you wouldn't regularly have, here's looking at you potato masher and ribbon peeler.
Jontron NOOOO!! Your Headshots!!! and NFTS!!!!
Kind of wished the police just started chucking tear gas into the crowds as they all strap on their gas masks and start hosing down the crowds that’s the Pepsi ad I want to see. Maybe even the police loads a tear gas grenade launcher with a Pepsi and fires it back into the crowd
Please tell me where I can get a bottle of Beam for $30
Make a podcast
so this is where  a train got his ad
I am just a hair under 6’8” and the stuff Lewis talks about is all 100% accurate. Including 4:27, that moment has happened to me a few times.
everything everywhere all at once sucks
you're my favorite youtuber. your buddies are awesome. i binged everything you guys made. keep being awesome :)
I find your content funny, but the part about murdering someone with a hitman is a bit to much for me.
problem with turning mercury to gold is that golds price is directly linked to how rare it is. make more gold, and its not as rare, so its kind of defeating the point.
6:44 He starts opening his cleavage
Has it been a year!?
Ok that is what we got, in 3 months of waiting here and nearly one year in the main. At least you finally found your credentials for this channel.
props to the editor for the movie spoilers bit, I watched every frame and loved it
When the tall guy said method it sounded like meth head.
coool ahh video, my g XD
Nigredo ❤
Wait when did he do a vid with Lewis Spears? Can't find it anywhere
You're almost there! You saw the blue and red Of course there's blue and red in every shot. Those two colors represent the pillars. Jachin and Boaz.
I had endgame spoiled for me by the ticket guy when going to see it myself. Also had a gamestop employee spoil Detroit: Become Human when I bought it. I was so pissed. How can you work these positions and not comprehend that people have not seen/played something they are actively paying to see/play?!
You turn Lead into Gold by selling it
Internet Historian was a VTuber before VTubers were a thing
Was the video with Lewis Spears entirely scrapped? I don't remember seeing any videos with him in it
This video is literally about me, you released it when I got regected for a promotion
Can't wait for the next ITF: demonitised.
pog jontron cameo
You need to start rejecting other duties and make more content or not fu©k you...<3
Yea i can tell why they were rejected
Oh god the ads are beautiful
Is that true that you can buy a lifetime license for Adobe Creative Cloud? I would actually consider it: although my license is about half of what was stated in the video, it is only good on two devices (I have three that I use regularly). Plus, I've easily exceeded five years of use, which appears to be the approximate cutoff where a one-time payment would have been more cost effective.  Granted, I don't pay for my license, my employer does. But if this is true, I could potentially get them to see the benefit of paying that lump sum right now.
I can see why this way REJECTED
Just what I need after getting reject from uni, a job, and a house. Hello parents
How hard is your job as a ticket master? All you have to say is the following "cash, or card. Okay. Here are your tickets, enjoy your movie it's in theater X." that's it nothing more, nothing less.
OMG I am 6"7 and YES! I can't fucking hear people below a certain height because background noise diffuses their sound output too much
Imagine thinking 2m is suuuper tall
Looking up how to make gunpowder won't put you on a list, but looking up what hardware store products commonly contain potassium sulphate for making nitrocellulose will.
... where's the random gunplay?
Wait, So brits boy still got mercury for tooth filling in 2023 ?
14:00 Oh my word! A Xenosaga reference!
HELLofresh... hm... how interesting...
The Craigslist Hitman is just the plot of Hotline Miami. Almost.
3:46 has to be the funniest shit I ever heard
*"Babe, wake up, new Incognito Mode video"*  Babe: *_*Vanishes*_*
"Oh I know exactly the one, it's got a vending machine. You think I wouldn't fuckin' know that ad?" Cracked me the fuck up. It's such a DEEP and ENCOMPASSING lore! @sumitomedia
About the tall thing, I'm not even as tall as him, and that shit does work. I usually start meeting people sitting down, then I stand up and they find out I'm 6'3. Even if they don't mention it you can see the bewilderment on some peoples faces. That shit even works over the internet. I won't get nsfw but I have some funny stories because of my height. I mean, I'm also really fucking handsome but hey, aren't all internet historian fans?
Hey historian deleted his man cave video anybody know why
Claimed, claimed, what issssss claimed???
Internet Historian confirmed fed 1:00
Or you could use the device that belongs to the person you dont like, "Hey Jerry, can I borrow your phone for a sec, I just want to look up how to fix an issue I am having with my phone"
About the bomb thing, sometimes when dealing with something that might go boom, I look up how to not make it go boom. When dealing with electronics and things
So internet historian got done by the circle game! Unlucky my good man.
I would pay money to watch Sumito just destroy some wannabe influencer.
I was today years old when i learned that the black eyed peas's song is lets get retarded. I always thought the song said "lets get started"
me when not everything dies in winter
Please, someone do the Craigslist Hitman game.
What happened to the man in cave video?
love me some crystal bapis.
This video made my day better.
You know what else got rejected? The “Hole” Video because it got copyright claimed by “Pro Sportority (Israel) Ltd. dba Minute Media”.
Well we all know what we must do…
I left this episode at the part you started talking about 'everything everywhere' because I was JUST about to watch it only to come back after watching and find you hadnt spoiled anything about it lol.  But I will. And if you havent seen it you should it was pretty damn great, for the most part.  ............. .................... ........................ ............................. ......     SPOILER (i guess)    ,.......      I first heard about it in relation to a critical teardown of Dr Strange 2 talking about how it did multiverse concept so much better and had no idea we weren't supposed to know it was a multiverse movie before going in. I managed to not know anything else though
Great ending but this was a fever dream.
More bite sized stories like these would be wonderful 😂
this guy counted his money for too long and now we get this trash.
Lewis is freaking tall
IH can make any ad interesting
That instant "I'm on break" hit me waaay to hard 😂
Now i want all the movies to which the spoiler corresponds to. Actually only the "they were human all along" and maybe the "future earth" one.
i did watch this earlier but youtube just told me that it was uploaded
“I aint saying that word aloud just in case” killed me
Sit
There is no worse pitch for a movie than “the less I say, the better, to me. I CAN’T STAND THAT, it makes me certain that the movie is definitely going to be bad, because clearly there’s nothing valuable enough about it besides the surprise factor.
4:50 HAHAHAHA THESE ANIMATIONS ARE JUST, PERFECTION!  9:28 Um… excuse me, waiter? My dessert haz a sad. Why is my desert big sad?  13:39 Nigredo, Albedo, and Rubedo were characters in the PS2 RPG, Xenosaga, sir.  It’s always a treat when you release a new video.
I'm glad this video was jected 👍
It quite simple to make a bomb all you gotta do is take some sugar and-"TRANSMISSION CUT"
I used to play that finger circle game with my friends but not strangers, and if I ever did it to a stranger I wouldn't punch them unless they obviously got it lol
just realized that these videos are adult swim skits 😂😂😂
As a 6'5" guy, I can say that everything they said about tall people is completely true.
The best podcast
666 dislikes?
8:53 "the gastronomic kitchen"  I dare you to show me an auditory kitchen
22:53
You should have called this one "In the bin."
should have rejected that entire episode with that racist pos jontron  *BIG YIKES*
I almost cried when I seen nfts fade onto the screen
… did anyone else get an AD for keyboard cat? With a link that leads nowhere?
One pound fiffy is a good deal
Im so confused about what this video is
Johntron was a surprise but love the content
I remember someone who was rejected from art school. Don’t remember much about him though, besides his funny little mustache.
Never expected Lew to be on an IH video, but I'm all here for it!
the other guy sounds like fred galante
We came we saw I shxt blood
Yeah no, photoshop is way overpriced. The clearest evidence for this is comparing the pricing nowerdays to just 10 years ago, back then I was able to buy and own photoshop for less than $100. Sure it was photoshop elements without the full range of features; but I was able to buy it and still use it on my old PC.  Now though, elements no longer exists. There is only the subscription service, and at $30 a month in just three months will overtake the cost of the photoshop elements that I bought and have been using for the last 10 years. Fuck that. I'm happy to pay to own a program that I use, but renting it at a rate of $1000 every three years? fuck all the way off; when my old PC gets too slow for editing with my legal copy I'm sailing the high seas for a cracked copy.
My girlfriend just said (just - about two months ago) that it's all finished. But we are in different cities, so I think, maybe I've got something wrong. But even the title had resonated something in me, and I'm afraid this video is about me as well. But I hope it is not. But it sure somehow anyway will be about me as well. Me is a little sad right now.
IH Could definetively say "negredo" without the algorithm censoring or demonetizing the video. "nei-greeiido"
Hearing all this talk of Photoshop as a GIMP stan makes me laugh
Good.
When he said how much photo shop was I paused the video and googled the number. Cause I thought I must be thinking of the wrong number. Nope
I have a great video idea that my friends and I used to do. We would sit and listen to the most amateur, incoherent rap songs we could find and play a little at a time, writing down what we thought the lyrics were. Then at the end of the song we'd read back what we each thought was being said. Can't think of many other times I've laughed that hard.
I lost it at Sumito mentioning the vending machine.

InternetHistorian gets me watching his ADS lol  if he made TV ads it would be entertaining asf .. id wait for the ads :D
i see why this episode is in incognito mode. I too would like to hide my rejections
when are we getting a internet historian dnd podcast- the improv is so on point
we need more videos like this
7:00 I was honestly expecting this sentence to be “do you know how many kids in Africa I could buy with that money” lmao
Rofl, that 'spotting how much a tall person sticks out then realizing youre taller' moment has happened to me. I bet theres a german word for it
"I could buy a used Toyota for that. Drive it through the front door of Adobe" It's Christmas every time you upload. You absolute LEGEND!
I checked google trends and "how to make pipe bomb" skyrocketed in search in Febuary and March and is the most times searched in a month since 2006 if the analytics are anything to go off of.  (genuinely look it up for yourself looking from 2004 till now there is a massive spike 💀)
That Hello Fresh ad was fire.
That Pepsi ad is basically internet carpetbagging.
The photo you use at 19:46 is a street in galway Ireland where I am from
Hello Fresh. The ONLY monkey slavery company. Sign me in.
After all this time I thought it was ‘’let’s get it started in here.’’ 💀
Oi, I thought this channel was all rejected videos from the main channel
I ject this video
If height makes you more attractive then I must be ugly enough to negate it. I'm 6foot 6 and no-one mistakes me me for good looking.
“First girl I had sex with she was 5,1 I came and found out she left 20 minutes ago” literally sent me into hysterics
I’m accepting this
"I'm on break" and I literally woke my whole house up
My favorite series on the internet! Everytime I see one in my feed I stop what I’m doing
Wait since when is Lewis part of the channel? Haven't watched in a while
I looked up murder for hire on google trends and while I was let down that not many people searched for it I was surprised that Kentucky was the number one state by almost double the next one down. What is going on over there?
Hello fresh ad not as good as the tbh podcast ad reads
Why was the Hello Fresh sponsor ad rejected though that was gold
What about the dejected folder? I want to see all the times you cried
I just typed in the pipe bomb search boys. Let's make it happen
17:37 What the fuck does it look like? She's preparing to rob the diamond casino, obviously.
Oh internet historian doesn't know about the Got emmm Ballgazer game 👌
Why are you recommending "Buying photoshop?:" You can literally just pirate it
I am 1 foot, 72 inches tall
"You are on a list" is the cringiest thing ever.
which episode was lewis in? dont remember seeing it
I miss. you
That guy is tall as fuck makes that girl look like a midget
"Will you be my mom?" killed me immediately.  Instant classic episode
2:08 I spit my omelette out while eating from laughing  Wow those tall people problems I honestly never thought about. Now I look down upon super short girls who try to date super tall guys even more!
Just let IH make every ad in the world please
Craiglist Hitman sounds like Manhunt  😄
19:22 in a hijab touching a man haram
Just checked google trends for "how to make pipe bomb".  I was not dissapointed.
You make me want to buy things that I don’t need
My favorite part of the word assassin is the two asses
Right you get a hot plate and set it to 54°c then you get a cooking pot and fill halfways with bleach, then you simmer for about 20 minutes until you see clear coloured cristals forming on top then with a spoon you carefully scoop out into a lunch box to add petroleum jelly and mix carefully then pop it in the fridge to become solid and there you go some bleach based C4, ask me if you want me to tell you how to make gunpowder from piss and grass cutting's
That add still cringe
everything, everywhere all at once, was a steaming pile of shit. it tried to be "john dies at the end" and failed horribly.
'get put on a list' 🤦 like conspiring murder isn't a recognized crime.
4d
I laugh so much everytime i watch these guys xDDD
gets hello fresh ingredients list: get the butternut squash [gets only sweet potatos]
Why do his ads go so hard
It took me half the video to realize why it was called rejected.....
Dude, is Hello Fresh a scam? Seeing it everywhere just like the Lords Title service.
It's been a while, good to see you guys back
I thought you were gonna talk about being rejected by a girl
How much would someone who owns the Philosopher's Stone sell it for? They probably have so much gold already so they don't really need more money by selling it for a lot.
so you just remove the best parts?
Was that the lightfall song behind the hello fresh ad?
YO; facile a really good word
Can you tells us about tools. 🔨
I am so confused why that timeline isn't full of after effects linked compositions. Your editor is a masochist, or I am an idiot.
I could swear the pepsi ad has 'feel it still' as the song instead of what they showed here.
The michelin food bit reminds me of the movie "The Menu".
Everyone should sponsor historian at the same time so we get crossovers of all these ad story lines.
ah yes, truly, "i-ain't-sayin'-that-word-aloud-just-in-case" might just be my favorite color.
Top tier content
<3
OH I GET IT HE DID THE THING IN THE MOVIE.
We missed out on the chance to see customs throwing a feces or blood covered philosophers stone into some type of receptacle, preferably on a pile of other similar stones, implying many such happenings. Hire me! I want to make an ass of my brain things!
I love how all your advertisements follow the same basic bs formula, I say that with love.
I’m 3 segments in and it’s the best incognito mode
For someone who enjoys InternetHistorian videos I kinda miss the old style no mans sky videos. There was just more effort than this mindless talking….
5ft1 and realised she left 20 minutes ago
I mean, you joke but if it was written well Craigslist hitman could be a very dark, interesting game.
It's been 10 years and I finally get to see another incognito mode episode, can't wait til my grandchildren get to see the next Internet Historian vid.
God I  was waiting on a new one for so long
my favourite type of rejection: assassination
6:20 i like the idea that he 360’d back into the conversation like it’s skyrim
If you work in a movie theater and do that, you should be fired.
10:46
boooring doo a video on the main channel
Jokes on you, i would never reject any of your videos man. I know as a perfectionist we want to show more quality but man.  *you are da quality*
women really walk around dressed like that?
3:26 THIS IS ENTIRELY TRUE I AM 6 FOOT 6 AND CAN'T HEAR SHIT FROM MY SHORT FRIENDS.
I'm sorry, did you really have JonTron on? The guy who unironically defended the idea of a white ethno state?
Two of you jerks have actually gone and tampered with Wikipedia and I for one think this is not enough
weird rejected hellofresh sponsor ad
guess you cant even TALK about how to make a bomb on youtube
_To the moon!_ 🤣🤣🤣
Murder for hire, the story about a depressed hit man, actually has so much potential.
6:00 why do you think adobe PS is among the cracked software IN THE WORLD, along with MS Project! none of those prices are in anyway, shape or form fake, these software prices are actually insane. The mofos who invented photoshop, the knoll brothers, were dumb though. They sold the rights to adobe in 1995, until then they had royalties for each copy sold. Though they did get a nice 34 million dollars for it.
as a 5'3 woman i cannot explain the relief of being defined as "not tiny"
wow. IH really upped the number of mid-roll ads for this video. its ridiculous. also, the fact that IH has an affiliation with jon tron is my least favorite thing about IH. isn’t jon tron like an obnoxious, misogynist or a bigot? i know he’s obnoxious. i am unsure if he’s a bigot.
We need a whole episode of Sumito trying to sell you things. "Sales"
17:06 Correct
I'm 6'4" and I relate to  everything that tall guy said.
I mean, we how how to get put on a list because it leaked. All that's needed is being a Linux user, lol.
Finding the correct meds it's hard, but it's part of the process. It's really good that you touched on this side of the subject, because many people give up on just not getting fast results
Notice me internet historian
caughtcha ball gazing *punch*
a professional kitchen is more like a military squad, and is literally what escoffier modeled it around
You fuck you think we're only good enough for your scraps now do ya? Well you're right!
We would never reject anything from you, master
Oh fucking Johntron is the worst. Just put his avatar on the thumbnail so I can sit the ones with him out please.
Please compile all the stuff you've cut into a video please IH I'd watch anything and everything you put online, much love from the Middle East
Someone ruined the end of Fight Club for me the same way,  like first week still in the theater.
First
(((Heston Blumenthal)))
21:19 I’m really curious what the guy said here. Unless it had the word “parallel” in it- in which case, that’s not (technically) a spoiler…
Ah, being tall. i remember i was leaving class at school. i heard someone call my name behind me. i turn around. no one there. Someone call my name again. Turn around noone one there. What the hell? then again...below me. Short girl says "you just looked right over me didnt you. thats fucked up" lol
3:46 ROFLMAO
That Hello Fresh ad is so good it made me want to sign up for a second subscription
Omg… I’m 5’ 1”… like baaaarely 1”
My week has been significantly improved thanks to Mr Historian
wtf he got lewis on here?
Holy hell. The rare incognito mode upload scrambles together one million views in 2 days. This cozy little channel is getting way out of hand
I remember on a whacky website there was a discussion about the Philosopher stone. One guy was convinced it was made from rine which is fermented and dreid up. So he was collecting his urine and doing all kinds of experiments to build his own philosopherstone.
"Hello fresh, I am Dad"
Nice
Love a good reject! Always worth the wait dude 🖤
Nice video !
Should we tell him about GIMP?
4:14 this shit is so fucking real you have no idea I experienced this countless times 😭😭😭
In the past
Your hello fresh ad just reminds me of that comedian who would dramatize the most bland concepts for a movie sound fricken amazing. LITTLE DRUMMER BOY
Everyone with the fear of rejection are screaming
11:20 Sludge is my favorite food, looks like what I leave in my can after a night of drinking with the boys... I am a Slavic peasant, I like my food to look like food and not like dried things that fall on the ground. Simple, you and your grandma eat a few kilos of pork, drink a bottle of rakija and then go outside to fight with neighbors... Do you think you can run from the cops on that small portion when grandma hits a drunk guy over the head with the bottle? I.THINK.NOT!!!
I REJECT TO WATCH THIS VIDEO!
gimp2 is free
I hereby reject your rejection of me rejecting your rejection.
Bomb making, napalm, sabotage and other unconventional tactics,  conventional military training. Probably is something a higher % of Europeans close to Russia is trained in, then US citizens. Previously a large number of the men was called up for conscription. But as long as you don’t use it wrongly and the Russians are not coming 🤷‍♂️ YouTube probably have videos with napalm production, Ukrainians civilians made napalm and put it in flasks, in the beginning of the invasion.
The conclusion to the Okay-Game story, pure comedic genius
historian needs to do a video where re reviews food shows with like Marco pierre, gordon Ramsay or Anthony Bourdain and whatnot that could be pretty funny
when was he chatting with tall person?
fucking loved the commentary to the chefs being dumbasses about their food
there sure are alot of time travel movies lately areant there? im assuming, havent seen the film
I feel like the Craigslist Hitman game would have 2 possible effects on people: some people, (hopefully most), would immediately be put off by the gross, monotonous, tedious aspects of committing a realistic murder and it would convince them that they never want to do that in real life. But then you'd have the other people, perhaps people who had always secretly wanted to know how it feels to kill someone, who become enthralled by the game's realism and it pushes them one step further towards committing murder in real life.
Oh boy what a time to be alive! Plus i would be your mom!
did u just make a fullmetal alchemist brotherhood reference? my man
Don't think I'm too weird, please? But I'm 4ft'11 and I'm obsessed with men who are 6ft'9 (exactly) - not that I ever meet anyone that tall. But it's the height I hear and go "Ohhhhh, hot!.' lol.
stfu and make main channel content
The only adverts that visit upon my eyeballs
Marvel: "Infinity War is the greatest crossover ever" IH: "Hold my beer"
Holy shit even the rejected parts are gold
Im so glad that unlike my father mr historian always comes back
It's Friday, my beer is cold and you have a new vid out - perfection
20:41 Optimal play tbh
I've only ever recommended Historian/Incognito to friends. And every time he uploads, he adds more reasons to recommend him to more people
Holy shit a mythical upload!🤣
2nd channel rejected content is still some of the best on YouTube
If you ever stop this series I'm gonna find you.
This is just a podcast...
I love these videos ❤ keep ‘‘em coming, I’ve rewatched them heaps ❤
This is the best rejection I've ever seen!                                 👌🏼
Thematically, IH manages to 'reject' even the implication of saying a slur.
you are the only person since 2008 of watching youtube that i actually 1: dont skip the ad and 2:: look forward to the hilarious ads lmao. Keep it up mate you deserve a huge marketing check for these.
What I think is funny is that Mercury isotopes can decay into gold.
Extremely rare IH L lol   It’s reggae music like cmon 😭
I love in the field 15:22 was hilarious because I can see this happening for real
We need more Jon, another episode would be pure bliss.
I genuinely had no idea Let's Get Retarded was a thing, i've only ever listened to the censored version
As someone who is short. Yea my tall friends often lose me. I just go: HEY IM DOWN HERE
Largest crossover episode ever!
This mans sponsor adds are always on point
There were so many ways this video could have opened, I did not expect it to be with assasinations
this channel used to be my cope for the main channel. I've now become addicted to this channel so the only option is a third chaneel with a gopro strapped to your head for your every movement
If these are the rejects and they're all this fantastic, I want to see the stuff you rejected for this video!
Holy fuck I love you Lewis
Goofy
Its crazy IH thought Sumito wouldnt know something with a vending machine in.
Everyone knows the best way to get Photoshop for a discounted price is to pirate it!
I can't tell you how much I appreciate you not actually spoiling the film for us all.
For some reason youtube didnt notified me when this video is uploaded now im 2 days late.
Oh shit it's the clip show episode but actually cut content instead.
The sumito episodes are the best.
No pyrocynical...
All the greats and some great new additions.
I just want more Internet Historian Videos man.
fbi gonna love this one XD edit: bruh b.e.p. is good
8:50 if the kitchen is like an orchestra, H2B is 100 Gecs.
That movie story happened to me too. when I went to see no way home. knew nothing about it. not even who was in it. fucking sits down in the theatre and the, like, friend group that enters behind me loudly talks about how much they like Andrew and is looking forward to seeing him again. completely ruined that movie for me because all I could think about was "when will he come on".
Kinda scary that Internet historian knows the correct chemical to dissolve a body
That segment about the chefs and restaurants is so fucking true... chefs are so fucking full of themselves haha
I had to look up 2 words. Did IH get a word a day calendar? I should get one...
IH encourages "jamming" from The Prisoner...nice.
the only channel where i actually watch the ads
Considering the task i do at my work is rejections i can already tell this is video for me
Do you know how many kids in Africa I could "save" with that money... Alright Madonna, you've had enough
The genius lyrics over the commercial is comedy gold
Lewis spears episode coming soon?
Yeah, the tall thing is true. As a man, your looks don't matter if you are 6'2-6'5. Not even your personality, honestly.
I guess you... INJECTED this video into the web
So, for $2500, you can get Photoshop for life, but not the new versions or the other software.   Or... Pay $30 a month for 6.9 years and still save money.  It is in fact overpriced lol.
I was googling how to make a pipe bomb before it was cool
amazing how the adobe guy countered the conversation from "wow photoshop is expensive" to "no you're the money hungry beech who wants this product for your own gain"  what a saleman, I still don't engage with swindlers tho
Dont eat taco bell while clenching the philosopher's stone in your bum... .. Trust me... you will have 10-15 minutes left...
Only videos I don't skip over the ad time.  The ads are just as funny as the video sometimes.
Banger video and I love the jontron cameo
What was that website in the late 90s? Maybe 2000?  Rejected..
LEWIS ON ICOGNITO XD what is this
Hello fresh is great, but the quickest I’ve ever prepared a meal from them is about 90 minutes, idk what kind of deity they get their timings from but it’s bullshit
What is this "hello fresh" I've never heard of this before 🤔
The vocalist from As I Lay Dying, Tim Lambesis, tried to hire someone to kill his wife. Turns out it was an undercover cop and he got busted. Sentenced to six years but only served 2. His wife divorced him, obviously lol. His band took him back after he got out of prison AND the absolute madman got remarried.
Internet historian lost the password to his main account again
"If I'm talking to a girl not short girl height let's say 5'3" Me, 5'3 male: "Oh great here we go again with this." ಠ_ಠ
We missed you
The Tim Lambesis special.
My guy saying 5'3" is short girl height T-T
This is the only person in the world that can make me watch an ad voluntarily.
Typing in Google: "Murder for hire"... and after minute of thinking add "in Minecraft"
9:04–9:44 specifically about the desserts, I don’t think that guy in particular was trying to do the post-modern art bs. I think he genuinely just believed that each dessert on the menu should bring something new/unique to the menu, which is absolutely true for a michelin star restaurant. Any Michelin inspector will look over the whole menu and seeing items on the menu that are too similar, or seeing an item on the menu that offers nothing to the menu (crowding the menu or just being filler), will count against the restaurant when awarding the star.  Also, it’s not pretentious to compare a high-profile restaurant kitchen to an orchestra, it’s a perfectly adequate analogy. The sections of an are is akin to the sections of a kitchen. Managing all sections, whether you’re a conductor or a head chef, requires a fair amount of coordination and leadership. Many people from each section contribute to everything you put out.
"Do you think papa Nord will ever come home?"  "God I hope not."
'Hungry? You should be.'
I love these types of videos. You'd better release sequels to his as more of your videos come out!!!
Rejected: what I got this week after asking a chick out
NEVER buy software
JON!!!
yeah that image of Isaac Butterfield is definitely enough to get the video... Rejected~
Craigslist Hitman is actually an excellent idea for a game lol
I did my part
Why no more uploads in the Main Channel? :(
RIP Nord Man
Love it
Did he say "the west way to cover that"?
Best Hello Fresh ad, hands down.
Man even your rejected ad reads are league's better than 90 per-cent of other YouTube ad reads.
why jontron tho
How many lists are you on?😂
9:05 a kitchen is kinda like an orchestra: the chef is the director and each station of the kitchen is like a section of instruments, they all need to work in harmony. If it was just one guy making that stuff on his own then who cares, but he's coordinating a whole bunch of people to make that stuff to order; much more impressive.
I like the old man in your videos, you should invite him over more.
Real talk I knew the guy who invented photoshop when I was a kid. His wife started an elementary school for their kids to go to and I went to that school (I was there grades 2-5) One of the other kids was the son of the President of Ford, and another was the bastard child (literally, not an insult) of the Tobacco Mogul, Phillip Morris.
The pure joy I just endured seeing Internet Historian uploaded. The genuine happiness I just went through watching his video. The absolute love. Now I get to feel the empty void I get waiting for a year for the next upload. J/k kinda...Love you Internet Historian!!
Drake ?
The philosopher stone bit is wrong,  its not 4 components to make a single one, being the stone. Its actually: You start with a black colored substance/matter, then you must through varied processes transform it between each color until it reaches rubedo, then you got a philosopher's stone.
overjoyed lewis is on this video!!
briish 'people' drink mercury confirmed
Sumito's "i'm on break" is so on point.
5:00 exactly what we expected.
5:28 i have this in the watch later playlist just to know that there are that many buggy shits from adobe
I’ve been saving this for the perfect time and it’s now
Adobe wants 20/mo for pdf reader premium, fuck that.
Despite being a year late, I managed to see Everything, Everywhere, All at Once without spoilers. And it was a delight. I wonder what that chud said to you to ruin it
Woah... Who is this "Lewis is tall" customer?! Is there an episode I missed?! Even more new Historian videos for me?!
2:00 yeah that's called Grand Theft Auto. Bit REJECTED.
I need more tall guy problems with this guy
How’s the main channel vide coming along
Wtf Lewis spears on incognito?
Publishers are sleeping on 'Craigslist Hitman' hard as fuck
Didn’t expect to see Mr Butter at 2:58
IH + Sumito is equivalent of Goku & Vegeta team up
Rejectiob
My Grandad is 6"2 and he would speedwalk so my dad as a kid had to walk really fast to keep up with him  Then my Dad became 6"6 but he still walked the same way so he was walking extremely fast  So i had to keep up with him as a kid, now I'm 6"4 but i still walk the same way, so now i walk about 3 times faster than everyone   If i have kids and they have kids, eventually i will create the worlds fastest walkers
This is the serotonin I needed
YAY ANOTHER SUMITO VIDEO HECK YES.
He should do a collab with internet historian
By the way, there has been a surge in searches for "how to make a pipe bomb".
Make a main channel video alreadyyyyy >.<
I look forward to playing Craigslist Hitman sometime in the near future.
I WILL BE ACCEPTING ABSOLUTELY NO WHERE IS THE LOVE SLANDER AT THIS TIME THANK YOU
Better ad than they have ever put out 🤣
OK I AM GOING TO LOOK IT UP
More
another banger
Just seeing the Shirdi Sai Baba statue in the background while learning about the inherent value of paying $2500 for Photoshop has made my entire weekend, Sai Ram and thank you fellas.
Really wonder what the movie theater guy said lol
Petition for everyone to google how to make a pipe bomb rn
I got a whiskey ad when bourbon was mentioned.
0:18 same fr fr
Really scraping the bottom of the barrel with this one hun
18:50 To be fair, though, the kid bought 2 Cokes to get 1 Pepsi, so who's really winning?
The bit about NFT's was hilarious.  Absolutely perfect.
When I see that notification it makes my day 🥲
Nice Adobe Premiere Missing Screen
Aw man what an emotional rollercoaster to start off with.  "Is that ordinary things!?"  "Oh, he's sifting through the guests"  "Holy s*** it _is_ -Average Objects- Ordinary Things!"  Edit: "Oh... okay then"
Craigslist Hitman would be a damn good "simulator" game.
As a big guy its true. I see the other tall guys and We always connect.
Im 6'4" and everytime I see someone freakishly tall, I feel bad for them. Then I stand next to them and realize they are 6'5" or 6'6".
It took me a moment to realize this was just moments that didn’t make the cut from other episodes. I seriously thought everyone came back for this…
Todays gonna be a good day
I’m in the middle of reading 20th century boys so I had to click
0:28 Actually the smart move to ject it because rejecting it implies it would ject it, only to ject it again.
Thank you good sir, your upload has made my day.
What the fuck why is notorious white supremicist JonTron in this video literal admitted white supremicist
Post modern art is actually good though…
Ok, so who is the tall man, and was all his collab rejected, or is this only a preview of something coming in the future?
As someone who is 6’8, this is absolutely hilarious
1:40  I used to work for TSA. That's airport security in America. We were doing a meeting on bombs and stuff and the instructor said and "I want you to go home and look up how these work and how they're built and all that stuff on your personal computers. Learning at all times is important for the mission etc.  And I was just like uh what. Wouldn't it be problematic if we looked up ingredients and how to look up that stuff on our computers at home. He basically said that we would have special privileges and that they would overlook it. And my attitude was, well you know what you can try and I'll just take your word for it.
The kid, the NFT, and the rocket ship. hahah, omg!
The part about the cheat code where the girl looks up and is immediately interested, I did that to myself once.   I was in a high school locker room, had to crouch because the lockers were little squares and mine was at the bottom row, and I looked up at this one dude in his underwear and that was the first time I felt like dating someone.
As someone who is 6’6 (2.02m) I can confirm that the flirting, the losing people, and the not hearing smaller people is a genuine struggle… :/
my ex was two feet shorter me and i spent a lot of time pretending to be able to hear her when we were walking together
Quay street, Galway!
I wish i had tall best friends
You guys would crumble working in a kitchen
surprise xenosaga cameo
To be honest I would literally watch any fake conversation roleplay from any of the people involved. This is such gold content, the freeflow acting is so great.
oh fuck yeah the troopy in the background
You can also get adobe products for free… technically…
I'm trying to understand the target demographic for this channel. I think it's not for kids... It's for people with high school education, perhaps. Adults with limited complexity? Click bait? I think the work of demographers is growing in difficulty as international media bleeds into various countries. 1.8 million subs across 7 billion people isn't a large group; probably disparate. The digital commons is a strange place.
Everything everywhere all at once was def a movie was it good, idk it was kinda everywhere 😎👉👉
Fun fact, "murder for hire" is skyrocketting on google trends rn because of thia video
First episode of incognito I didn't finish. It was a bit boring
I would unironically just want a refund and go home if that happened to me at the movies.
What if the cop in that Pepsi commercial was like "wtf I'm diabetic, it's literally on my name tag, Diabetic Dave"
if only adobe CC was 30 bucks a month
I would listen to a podcast of this
No clips of the great Dr. Mashirito??? REJECTED!!!!
you should'a made the beginning say "in the files" or something like that
Yeah mate, what?
SO MANY COLLABS TIS TIME
Everything Everywhere All At Once is the type of movie that I tryna make in my head while staring at the ceiling .......
Honestly, I respect cooks and their metaphors give them deeper meaning to what they do. I have 2 friends working at Michelin restaurants and the average person wouldn’t even last a shift. I respect them so much.
Here’s an odd historical event I stumbled upon that I don’t have anywhere else to share it at: The Children’s Crusade was an odd historical occurrence I suggest checking out
Idk
I love all the cheap TV brands.
Jon is one funny mfer my God
rejected. REJECTED!
What he says about tall people is EXACTLY true. I've done the same tall guy thing where I see a freakishly tall guy and he's shorter than me. I'm 6'6" (don't know how many millimeters or stones or whatever that is) and it happens every time I see a tall guy in the grocery store. We don't realize how monsterously tall we truly are.
19:20 I finished my level right as he said mission accomplished and my game said it at the exact same time 😆
God watching this made me realize how much I miss Sumito on this channel lol
Mitchell and Webb did that bit with the holy grail.
Every Incognito Mode, Internet Historian, and Storytime video brings me so much joy that it almost offsets the pain I feel when it's over
Get mutahar on more hes a cool guest he should feature mure
My favorite song is My pall foot foot. Horrible story but amazing attempt
You should get Mutahar on and just use the Sumito avatar.
it is somewhat amusing that the prices of cosmetic surgery (with insurance) and Photoshop are now comparable. How did we get here?
Just searched it up
I literally thought about if he was going to post again soon like yesterday. Thank you for this <3
I had hello fresh for 5 months or so, and I got tired of the meals... Nearly every time I got chicken, the packaging would leak raw sticky chicken juice onto everything. The majority of recipes seemed to have a lot of breadcrumbs and sour cream, so I canceled. They called me every week for almost a year trying to get me to subscribe again.
the Craigslist hit man idea is literally the plot of Barry lol
Just checked the 'how to make a pipe bomb analytics' and I have to say I love you guys lmao
If someone had told me you died I wouldn't have been surprised by the upload schedules lol
lol, that height black pill was brutal! And "faminist" have the nerve to lie that women are not shallow...
I wasnt expecting to hear Lewis, love that guy. nice video bro :)
Witcher 3 players when they see the philosopher's stone ingredient: *Leonardo DiCaprio pointing meme*
One thing I don't like about tall guys is that THEY NEVER GO FOR OTHER TALL WOMEN
The greatest cinematic crossover event!
YouTube didn't give me a notification god damn it
Great video - links in description seem to not be working.
22:22 goes by too quickly.
I'm the 800800th viewer. Hope that makes me lucky for the rest of this sh**ty day
Oh hey internet historian uploaded, my grandchildren finally have proof that hes real!
Philistines, have they never even heard of Oxford's Assholean Museum?
Thank you zaddy internet historian for another videos
You and rad chad are the same entity
this video was the first time I've had a ad for an Adobe product in years, good job historian
No guns or random violence in the intro? Enjoy your dislike.
Now I’m going to play black eyed peas
pov: you're an Italian cruise ship ex-captain trying to get an appeal in court
5:10 what the hell? Honest question: Do random women realy walk around like this in the U.S. or is this a prostitute or something?
ill watch anything you put out man, why are these rejected?
I'm glad there's still content creators who support monkey slave labor. Kudos for fighting cancel culture :)
this guy sounds just like internet historian wtf
It is always noble and commendable to pirate Photoshop
Wait, the sponsorship wasn't a rejected bit? Damn you and your ads!
I've never been rejected so gracefully please TAKE MY PAYCHECK
I'm disappointed to hear that woman are as shallow as Lewis Spears described
Bake
22:18 herstorian pregnancy confirmed
I would happily pay this man all the money in the world to do every advert on TV ever
the craigslist hitman your describing is just Barry from Barry lmao
As a tall of average looks, I confirm that the sitting down trick then getting up works.
Imagine paying for something like Photoshop.
3:47
It's official, id watch anything you put out
I'm 6'6", when he said he can't listen to short people that really hit home, is not just me! Also looking forward makes me not notice people right in front of me
I wish you made more videos thanks for the amazing videos
11:19 reminds me of cowpie
The tall jokes fucking killed me
FINALLY! I get another hit of that sweet sweet Internet Historian content. I was starting to get the shakes Edit: it was like resin hit, but I still got Internet Historian off of it
I would so want "Hitman Simulator"
lol i love how the pepsi protest is actually a mostly peaceful protest. unlike everything that happened in 2020
I went from one of the tallest people in my friend group to one of the shortest, I am 6,2 and most of my friends are 6,6 to 6,8
The pun at the end tho
So does this mean there is a full in the field that was never released? I feel like I'm missing out on more IH
3:16 true I m not even considered a very tall person and its hard to hear short grills when they speak
wait, is the hello fresh ad also a rejected midia?
An upload from my favorite bi annual YouTuber
thank you Mr internet history its been too long since you last posted
I’m 6’4”, not hearing people is such a real problem
Redacted comment
Decided to look up hitmen for hire. Stumbled onto an obvious honey pot site 😂
im 14 minutes in and just realised its called rejected because its rejected clips lmao
"Can I have another receipt please, I ate the bill" - that was an underrated joke. Got a chuckle out of me.
WTF
Every disgusted "Uckh..." makes me want an IH x Anthony Cumia collab more and more.
I KNEW THEIR WAS GONNA BE A CUT BIT OF THE PHILOSPHERS STONE FROM THE MYTHOLOGY EPISODE! I EVEN COMMENTED ABOUT IT WHEN IT CAME OUT!!!
I almost choked to death on an apple at the Michelin Food bit XD
5:00 Stephen Merchant tells a story about how he was at a party and some ladies approached him and asked him if he was staying for a while. He thought they were looking to hook up or hang out, but they just wanted to use him as a meeting point for later in the party because he was so tall.
I really love those super random unpronounceable brands of the tvs/monitors
i literally just pirate photoshop. you think i'm giving in to the whole you'll own nothing and be happy trap? fuck no! fuck adobe!
What's so bad about pronouncing Nee-Gray-Doh?
It's amazing seeing so many other guests in one video, how did these get rejected?! It really is an event when an incognito video comes out
Holy shit I just realised this whole series is just a really elaborate podcast
$2500?!?!?! Is that how much it costs? My god, I didn't know the value of the thing I pirated. :D
8:44 It's not Hellofresh, it's "Hell'ah Fresh"    ....get it?
those chefs are just nerds :(
My spoon is too big!
The Lewis Spears part is great!
Team Sumito
Reject me, Senpai!
Small detail. I love that Internet Historian refers to his GF as Herstory.
6:19 is that a Annalena Baerbock joke?
I wish I was tall
just thrilled to see shop street in Galway in the OK sign scene
Holy shit, that's Galway... I work there! ... What the fuck?
> Hears hardware disconnect sound > Panic
I think i was the movie theater employee who accidentally spoiled the movie for him.
watched this on shrooms and it fucked me up
I don’t want to know how that pineapple was smuggled in, but I am curious how much the smuggler was paid to do it. Literally tore him a new one!  I guess it’s sorta like those coffee beans the monkeys eat and then pass, but instead it’s a pineapple suppository?
Okay but who contacted who first, I love if it was hello flesh
Excuse me? Where's the video with Lewis?
cant wait for rejected 2
Why did this not show up in my subscriptions ?!
if only john wasn't here
The ad was fucking amazing this vid
A story time and Incognito in the same week? And all Historians "Friends" in this one?  A desperate cry for help if I ever saw one.  REJECTED
Algorithm go brrrrr
Love me some second channel
I still haven't seen all of Everything Everywhere All At Once,  because halfway through the movie, the power went out in the movie theater and we had to evacuate.  Apparently there was a fire at a restaurant next door and it took out the power in the whole area.  Fun times.
That sponsor section was amazing
"Someone help me, I was rejected by the future!" - Time Traveler
do one on chatgpt
holy fuck that part with jontron got me gasping for air jesus fuck
Absolutely spectacular, i can tell you spared no expense
Im running to McDonald's real quick, you guys want anything?
ah, the Hell of resh... scary
"our heads are floating above a sea of heads" 💀
I'd have watched the full Lew + Historian video.
Only guy on YouTube that can get away with having one word video titles
My guy needs to watch Barry
I've had 2 kids and payed off my mortgage, but finally we get an update 🙌
What an unexpected crossover
Oh Hello Fresh, you guys have no idea what sort of promoting you have signed up for.... Cannot wait to see what you do with them lmao
11:46 Those who have watched FMA Oh shit
At 6'4" I love talking to really tall guys (they're usually guys) because my neck doesn't hurt but at some point in the conversation I start feeling inadequate and jealous. Anyone else get this?
great stuff
“Babe wake up new AD lore just dropped”
How to bomb the NSA
What was the Lewis Spears episode? I know about the other videos (mythology, art, food, etc.), but I dont know which one had Lewis Spears as the main guest. Can someone remind me?
Your videos make me feel so warm and fuzzy inside, I am always so happy when I see you have made a new one
This video is great. Thanks for the laughs!
I love you but I hate that I love you because you only post every blue moon😔
I can do one better on movie spoilers. I was at uni when Endgame came out, and it's all anybody could talk about. All my uni friends had seen it except for me, as I was waiting a few weeks to save the money for a ticket. For those few weeks I was constantly dodging spoilers for the movie, and finally the day came when I was going to watch it.  I made it into the cinema, bought the ticket, and made it INTO the theatre, ready to watch the movie without a single spoiler. And what comes on as a pre-roll ad? The ad for fucking Spiderman: Far From Home where Peter goes "What am I going to do now that Iron Man is dead? :(". Fucking livid.
Today I learned that the lyrics are not “let’s get it started” and are in fact “let’s get retarded”… sometimes I wonder how much shit I was exposed to as a child that just got mildly censored and then shoved in my face lol
The only channel where I look forward to the ad.
20:23 is why we have the 2nd amendment
This feels like a chrismas special where you see all the past characters from the old arcs
Gimp > photoshop
"it needs to be a story" was this recorded before The Menu came out? did you predict that movie? lmao
I LOVE U FUNNIEST MAN EVER AHHAHAHAHAHAHAH love u ih me and my gf watch u all the time amazing work
Your mom is rejected
I like how I skip the sponsorships than realize it’s Internet Historian
Man I thought this was about to be just clips that sponsors declined to have used.
My man really took a sponsorship from the monkey slave trade people top kek
Well, time to make a new channel.
Love the casual sexism. It really elevated this video.  Elevated it like a hydrogen blimp.
who tf invited shrill up
Me immediately googling: Murder for hire
I pirated photoshop and Sumito almost sold me on buying it. $2500 is a pretty good price for a lifetime license and If I used it professionally it would be a pretty good investment.
Seeing those goddamn monkeys pop up at 14:33 for 1/4 of a second before cutting to an ad was truly a genius marketing strat if it was intentional.
You know what's truly sad, i too am an exceptionally tall man and yet i never get the tall thirst and am forever alone
You need to start a podcast 🤣😂
Oh cool my favorite video series got dlc
There was once this really cool Austrian painter that was rejected. He said screw it, and forged his own destiny. Don't let being rejected keep you from accomplishing your dreams!
The seaweed guy simply figured out that if you talk fancy enough, you can get a bunch of rich morons to pay absurd amounts of cash to eat garbage
It never ceases to amaze me how upset people STILL are at the Pepsi ad  It’s like…passive aggressive raging so hard, they started trying to make fun of the song “where is the love” that literally points out that constantly harassing one another was making the world a worse place 😂
19:42 it's terrifyingly funny how quickly I recognized that street from Galway
Hey, look at these twigs and seeds on this interesting looking plate.  Tell me a short story because I’m walking the fuck right out of here.  We’re going to five guys where my wife can get a cheeseburger and I can have four dudes bang me in front of her.
I was rejected from my dream college today
For those of you wondering, you don't actually have to Google anything sketchy to get put on a list. Watching this video is enough to accomplish that.
I remember playing deep rock galactic and trying to figure out one of the mods for the gun. The gun? A grenade launcher.. with the perk being named something like 'homebrew explosives'  Yeah that worried the fuck out of me
The guard in the Pepsi commercial is turning the can around to make it isn't an RC Cola can. If it had been, the commercial would have gone in the opposite direction 😂
i want your baby!
14:00 wait the whole point of RWBY is the Cintimani Stone oOoOO oh?
Lol 2:23 is literally my brand of cigarettes I smoke and the liquor I drink after work. I guess I'm in the wrong profession.
I started this video as I leaned in for a kiss from my girlfriend and the first words through the speaker are “REJECTED”
"Aw shit I got a sponsor.  I need the money, but have no video ideas.  What should I do?"  -The thinking that lead to this video
The Saddest part is, some bits were rejected from this video. . .
Лайк за камео Артемия Лебедева 9:41
Ayy its HelloFresh the monkey slave labor company
9:40 i think he is right about this. The most interesting food stories are the ones about unique places, like that food truck with a Mitchelan(dont know how to spell it) star
Woah what the fuck, I thought I was subbed to you
Did he reject the gun bit at the beginning?
I looked it uo
bepis
You read my dating profile and came up with this title, didn't you?
As your soul is leaving to heaven you can see the rocket ship going to the moon. The greatest thing I’ve heard and I could believe someone would say that on Twitter.
8:39 "Get meals delivered right to your door with premueushurud ingredients"
wait  Black white yellow red?  The imps in runescape are dropping ingredients to a philosopher's stone???
All my faves in one, goddam.
Did the whole video with lewis get rejected??
We need to invest time into making Rubedo an ethnic slur to retroactively make you look racist.
please dont work with jontron. hes a racist pos. you are better than this dude.
I work in IT and Jesus that pitch from Sumito hit hard
I want to see the google analytics after this. Also sorry everyone, but 5"3' is average height for women. And for men it's 5"9'
its the movie brainscan  edward furlongs character plays a game that lets him simulate a murder from the perspective of the murderer
The Michelin Food section is why "The Menu" was filmed.
Speaking of rejection, in high school we had to do some test or something and I needed a pen but only had pencils. So I did what any other person would do and asked the girl next to me “hey can I borrow a pen” but she interrupted me as I said “i” and put her hand up and said “eww....no” but she like eyed me up and down when she paused between the words. All I wanted was a pen and I got my self esteem punished. I didn’t even do the test, I just stared at the paper. That was like 5 years ago and I still don’t talk to new people. Rejection sucks, even worse when you’re not even asking them out...
The only youtuber I watch for the ads. Simply brilliant XD
I don't even recognise the episode with the super tall guy, what episode is that?
NEVER sign up for Hello Fresh. I had to jump through hoops to get the damn subscription canceled, and I have asked them multiple times to stop mailing me bullshit offers like, “Get 10% off your next order (of $100 or more)!” Plus, I’m pretty sure they sell your data.   They’re like a crazed ex who doesn’t understand that you broke up with them.
i love to be rejected! thanks!!!
"It's about a ghost psychologist who helps a kid"
Amazing vid! JonTrons laugh had me in absoulte stitches
This was the scariest notification I've received.
Welp I'm now on a pipe bomb list but at least I have some interesting stuff to read tell they come knocking
As a 6’5” man that was the most accurate description of what it’s like to be tall
*me chillin*  *jontron shows up* "yeeeah ima head out"
We are at the "clip show of discarded clips from the second channel" level of this abusive relationship and it's beautiful
The worst deliberate spoiler I ever saw was for a Star Wars film that I had already vowed not to see.
Google Trends is showing a preliminary spike in "murder for hire" as a search term.
My best friend is 5' 6" and I'm 6' 6".       Ok I lied I'm actually the 5' 6" friend.          When I tiptoe
I went to hello fresh and it sucks because they want me to pay for it before I even know what is on the menu. Fucking yeah right im going to put my credit card info in before i even see anything. Hah.
3:45 “first girl I had sex with, she was 5foot 1, I came and found out she left 20 mins ago.”  That is an EXCELLENT joke. Idk if he came up with that on the fly or if that’s a prepared line but, as a comedian, the construction of that joke is exemplary 👍🏽
Been searching my entire life for the philosopher stone and I finally find it here thank you so much <3
IH is angry about being a sissy. And gullible. I can see why he cut that.  🤣😂🤣 Yeah playing the "circle game" with random strangers is definitely weird. But not that insane if it was like the late 90s early 2000s and the majority of you are young. Dropped your wallet is kind of a lame one though. On both ends. He couldnt be more creative? And IH actually fell for it, instead of doing the waaay more normal thing and sticking your hand in your pocket to check. Would have been funnier with a "dropped your pocket". Atleast that one's a joke...
Love yous guyses
JonTron with the cancer kid, hodl this you're going to see this rocket going to the moon. I'm dying.
I'm the Queen of France!
"once i said something funny, at last a couple of times."  Well done.
Hey none of your friends' links in the description work.
Yeasssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
I needed this so much. Missing your content. Its always so funny
You might need to redesign the sponsor characters.
I laughed so hard when he said he sits down and the spell breaks
0:42 - 2:32 Assasination (Weapons) 2:33 - 5:27 Lewis is tall (Unreleased Video?) 5:28 - 7:26 Adobe Acrobat Man (Ads) 8:49 - 11:49 Food (Mother Energy Drink Ad) 11:50 - 14:33 Philosopher's Stone (Mythology) 14:34 - 15:50 JonTron is dead 15:50 - 19:26 Bepis (Ads) 19:28 - 20:47 Okay Game (Childhood) 22:48 onwards - EEAAO (Unreleased Video?)
Even your B material is grade-A comedy
Wasn't Pepsi orginally the Republican one and Coke the Democratic? But I really love how some morons get utilized by big money and doesn't even know it.
If you like to cook crazy meals, then the "it's like an orchestra" remark actually makes sense. Well I could see that with a team of chefs, when alone it's like a dance when you really start getting into it.
I bet the cinema employee said the word "multiverse". I bet that's what spoiled it.
Happy March 1st Movement day by the way!
great stuff
I can guess the first 30 words in any of these videos based on the title.
speaking as a sous chef, molecular gastronomy is stupid and those guys deserve to be bullied.
comment
Love the colabs in this one
After watching this I feel jected, and after years of rejection, that's nice.
i already predict a "rejected rejected." with the content cut out of this masterpiece
all the links in the description are broken ae
I wonder if he charges them more for making these quality advertisements.
The bit with JonTron about giving the NFT to the dying child has me in tears. I don't think I've ever laughed that hard at something so stupid.
8:39 get meals delivered right to my door with what kind of ingredients? Primojon ingredients? Is that what you said?
Can't wait to download this video, for personal raisins
You guys wanna play my new game "how to hire a Craigslist hitman"?
This is the exact quality content I pay my internet bill for
@4:10 I'm 6"6 and this is my life story
Wait what are we googling?
bonus video where you overanalyze cringe lyrics with sumito for 50 minutes
Craigslist Hitman sounds like the plot synopsis of Barry especially the being sad after every hit part and doing all the boring parts of murders for hire lol
incognito is so much cooler than historian it's crazy
I too am a tall Lewis.
I am so glad to be part of the few that Hideo took under his wing and rescued us from the circus tent society was being funneled into. Now here we all are, getting old... fox...dieee....19
The Pepsi video was so pretentious it made me barf a little. I had the same reaction.
About damn time
I like how he tells JonTron that dropping some headshots on the ground is the most embarrassing thing you can do if you're famous. Like buddy, did you not notice the elephant in the room?
Hey look, it's asmongold with hair
Damn, here I thought I was incognito and yet my secret kisses are being made public, that's another L for me.
Yeah I’m really not thrilled to see more clips of you talking with Jon “Rich Blacks commit more crimes than poor whites” Jafari
No main channel video in 5 months? Too bad, you're getting 2nd channel leftovers! Muahaha
1:40 I did my part. Now everyone else, go search it!
No u
BRO OUT HERE UPLOADING I WAS REELING FROM YOUR GONE HOME VIDEO LETS GOOO
Just looked up murder for hire and got a call from the sheriffs office to pay them a visit, huh, probably nothin....
Nothing better then watching this video in the middle of the night while waiting for the train to arrive.
There's a Herstorian?!
Sonic 2 is miles better anyway
That Jontron chemistry is immaculate
kinda fell off with this viedo
0:05  Idk me 💀
Yay, moar JonTron 😄
@19:42 Quay street, Galway, Ireland.
Make a video about Chris Chan
I fucking love these videos.
"what is rubedo?" he's best boi (Xenosaga).
wait... when was Lewis on Incognito Mode and why can't i find it?!
Height is increasingly becoming a status symbol for upper class and height disparity/discrimination against short people (men especially) is more real than racism. There is no legal protection against height discrimination and it isn't taken seriously.
Thank you.
"I'm turning 360 degrees and I'm walking away." Ahhhh, that takes me back to when /b/ was good.
When did you go to shop street in galway
"Just do cool shit. Don't add wank to it."   Truly words to live by.
I checked Google Trends ~20 hours after the upload for USA region and two terms saw breakout searches: 'how to make a pipe bomb'; and 'how to hire a hitman'. However this didn't show any significant increase on the general 30-day trend.
I love how one of your stock images was Galway. Hahahahhahahahhahahaahaaahahhahhhhhahahhaahahahahahhaahah.
19:44 where did he get the pic of galway
19:48 thats galway's quay street ayyyyy
That tall dude casually saying he talks to woman as if they exist, smh.
Hearing that being tall is a cheat code really hurts when you are 5’5” and had no sex for 3 years 😢 Life is so unfair.
5:51 DaVinci Resolve would like a word with you.
Don't you know Hello Fresh uses monkey labor?
Why is every single YT link in the Description broken?
The conclusion to the photoshop bit is great
Everyday I'm rejected a new main channel internet historian video.
It is criminal how all of the best crgators don't upload frequently. We need to get a petition started to force this guy to upload every week or monthly
Can you please stop posting videos every 3 months?
It took me about 7 minutes of randomly changing guests to realise the theme of the video actually is bits from the rejected bin, not that the beginning was a bit about the word theme of the video which was 'rejected'
Didn't expect Lewis Spears on this.
adobe suite is $50?
I didnt know there was a sequel to the adobe store 😳
You will he pleased to learn your video *did indeed* increase the search trend for "how to make a pipe bomb" around a couple hours or so after uploading. Contrat
There is a website that originally started as a site for tech security but cause of the name people actually contacted the owner for actual hitman jobs. Now he uses it as bait to report to the police and despite this being public knowledge he catches a good handful of people every year
I love to see the IH cinematic universe expand.
The best parts about the Pepsi ad where the kid buys 2 cokes to stand on is that 1, you never see both brands in one machine. And 2, coke made more sales there. So they win any way.
What's the song during the ad?
Omg i needa see the whole in the fields with Lewis Spears
The guy selling movie tickets spoiled the movie premise?? What the heck. Not cool, Robert Frost.
based
My god, THOSE were the ACTUAL lyrics to that Black Eyed Peas song?  I always assumed they were saying, "Let's get it started hot, let's get it started in here!"
Genuinely you’ve got this YouTube thing on lock!! 😂   Please keep doing you!❤🎉
the Craigslist Hitman is basically the plot of Barry
21:32 This exact thing happened to me when I went and saw it
this could be the title of a movie exploring the rise of the national socialists in germany 1930s
This is like the all star game for Incognito guests
Only person I watch the sponsored spot, just because he actually tries to make it engaging.
Make new videos on the main channel!
I HAVEN'T SEEN THE VID WITH LEWIS SPEARS, IS THERE AN ITF OR SOMETHING?
where is the rest of the two hours of mother energy?
Just wanna say, HelloFresh is really of our times. Like we have a whole generation or more of kids who's parents separated or never had time for them working or was a single mother or where raised by their computer/tablet or whatever whatever, so literally have 0 idea how to cook. Businesses like hellofresh or Freshly or whatever other services there are (there's a bunch), wouldn't have been possible in like 2000 or 1995 or whatever, every gen X and early millennial would have scoffed because they learned to cook, especially the women and by extension the men didn't need to worry. But these services are unisex because nobody knows how to cook, and people want home cooked meals or just can't afford to eat out everyday.  I put very little effort into learning how to cook, but I grew up with a functioning mother who was available and cooked everyday, so even though I don't think I can cook that great, I'm the best chef in my entire group. All the others subsist on pizza, microwave meals and whatever leftovers they can get, washed down with the cheapest drinks. I grew up on home cooked meals and I will have homecooked meals. Genuine advice to guys, learn to cook it's cheaper and she'll be impressed 10x more if your meal is half decent, Bonus points the bed is only a few rooms away. Trust me once she accepts your hot food into her mouth, she'll accept other hot items in other places.
No I don't know who you are because you don't want people to know so I rejected you and I'm sorry can we make up please thank you. kiss kiss kiss.
his sponsor segment is fire
Couldn't manage to get us 4% more off on that sponsor?
Did not expect to see Lewis Spears in one of these videos, but I am very happy it happened.
sumito is the best reoccurring character on this channel
Saws, chisels, and rolling pins are also tools of trades
JonTron is just naturally funnier than most.. co-hosts
4:26 as a 6’5 guy all of this is actually true af , I seen this 7’ dude texting away walking down the street but as soon as I was in his peripheral he looks down at me and I’m like fuck he noticed me
2:49 - 2:50 impressive
where is the secret nick mullen episode
JON NOOOO 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I'm sorry yet that Pepsi commercial with the coke just shows some kid about to lose two free cokes for one Pepsi. He paid Coke twice for one Pepsi...who is really the loser there?
about time, what a pleasant surprise!
I'm ten minutes into watching and i just now realize I'm watching rejected clips. Honestly might be one of my favorite vids cus there is so many topics covered and u get a nice mix of everything from the channel. Another high quality video from IH.
I reject your rejection.
While chefs are usually pretty pretentious and talk too grandly about their food, a good kitchen is like an orchestra. Things have to move very efficiently and smoothly, and everyone has to do their part in a very specific way tailored to the menu. Every dish is a composition and needs to be executed correctly and all that takes an incredible amount of planning and thought
I love how he starts  the video with an assasination for an example
As a tall person we don’t hang out with each other we’re in danger species
I almost skipped the ad and then I remembered I was watching an Internet Historian video. Thanks Hello Fresh!
19:26 - a few years ago there was this group of guys that came up to me and my friend while another guy had this shitty phone out recording. Mumbled something and pointed at the ground. I looked and there was nothing. He went “AHHHHHH!!!” as if he did this amazing gotcha and they walked off laughing. Didn’t understand what the fuck happened but now I understand it was probably this.
20:39 chad
Jected is the new approved
Ih just mad he lost the circle game
20:02 sigma
"Each dessert should offer something"  He says about a serving so small that it hardly offers anything
YEEEEAAAAAAAAAS NEW UPLOAD
You're old if you remember when "Let's Get It Started" was popular. You're ancient if you were aware at the time of the original title.
The honda civic at 1:53 is my ACTUAL honda civic, like it's actually a pic of my car that I posted years ago lmao
This didn't show up on my sub feed. Fuck you YouTube.
When I applied for a job with you I didn't think you'd post a video of your answer
I'm 6'10, on top of people being several feet below you, people tend to look down a bit and talk making it even harder to hear people.
e
I'm glad you posted all of these.
"Hey I have a question"  "I'm on break"  Killed me.
I am the only so one invested in the VPN-verse that its difficult to adjust to the hello fresh saga
Tall people are friends with other tall people because it's easy to see eye-to-eye.
With how hard it is to avoid spoilers sometimes with the internet being what it is I can't imagine how infuriating  it must have been. Plus he already paid for it too
I generally agree that these were good calls on what to cut. And I like having them all neatly in one video.
I had the opposite happen to me. A guy came up, said "hey check this out", pulls his hand out of his pocket and it was the ok sign, then punched me. He laughed, turned around, and his wallet fell out of his pocket. So I pick it up and say "hey you dropped your wallet" and he's like "no way, you're not getting me with that one!". So after yelling at him and finally resorting to shouting the full government name on his ID and his address along with the description of the contents of his wallet he turns around and is like "oh shit, I thought you were going to do the thing and then punch me haha". He then says "thanks so much man, I would have been screwed without this, let me give you something" and pulls the ok sign out of his pocket again, punches me again, laughs and yells "thanks man!" before running back down the street.
You're almost pitching Bill Hader's "Barry" the game
The whispering in the Hello Fresh ad sent me. Can’t stand that style of dialogue delivery.
bruh that hellofresh code doesnt even work 😔 better call your sponsors
20:03 Is that why everyone was flashing the 👌sign on videos a couple of years ago? Some kind of dumb made-you-look game?
Y E S
The Sumito Adobe Salesman bit at 5:30 is so good how did that get cut
Jected has the same energy as whelmed
Craiglist hitman aka hotline miami
That's why I'm so loud; I'm 5'4" and all the dudes I know are all over 6'2" and yes - they lose my goblin ass all the tiiiiiime but hey - I can always get stuff from the top shelf 😎 by whining a lot
Celebrate the rejects, they're the fruit of success!  Or at least, like, the brown spot on an apple you still want to eat.  Just eat around them.
My 2 favorite comedians together? Weee
soo you dint pull out a boomerang, a Didgeridoo or whistle to attract a pack of trained dingos to attack the 4 guys?  weak
Injected
I need more 22mins is not enough
Love seeing sumito in your videos
When he said "ad time", and a youtube ad popped up, I felt that.
There was a Lewis spears video?!
I started to watch this on the train. I had to stop because I'm laughing to hard.
Come on, the Philosopher's Stone, the grand achiecement of alchemy. A bit of culture gentlemen.
Doing my part with the google searches
omg the bit about the pretentious meals is exactly what The Menu movie is about
The tall guy thing is so true. One of my closest friends is 6'5 and girls literally leave their numbers for him with the bar tender; without ever talking to him first.   It's kind of fascinating. It's the equivalent I guess of a girl having huge tits or something.
Everyone thumbs down the video in solidarity with the video
If I reject rejection, am I meta?  Also... $%^# Adobe.  As someone who's been using graphic design applications since ALDUS... I DO NOT approve of their pricing... AT ALL.  It's not a value.  It's absolutely egregious abusive price gouging.
19:42 that's Galway
Where is NordVPN i miss him :,(
And with this IH has fulfilled his video quota for 2023.
If he’s running out of ideas, he should do stuff like Cars, Sports, Movies,   And do more “worst case scenario” that was a good one
Why don't you post on the maaaain channel anymoooore
Its christmas again! You make the best content.
So nice to see someone else talking about the tall experience. I very much relate to the meeting eyes over a crowd and realizing you're taller.
How to make a pipe bomb?
I love the little chris chan "I'll do a 360 and walk away" reference at 6:17
Should've rejected the concept of having jontron as a guest at all. Everything else you've done is great, there's really no reason to humor that idiot or anyone who likes him.
Eyy
Oh it must be so hard for you Being tall and stuff... 😑
Even the rejects are great!
why no deaths in the AD!!!
Rest in peace, Sumito
Sir Incognito, you dropped your wallet                          👌
As a newly physically retarded I can say no offense taken y'all good.
lthe
Do you think Internet Historian bought photoshop? Or does he have the monthly subscription like a poor?
All of the links in the description are broken
I was really hoping for more MOTHER energy talk
These were amazing lmao, great to see all these faces!
Imagine being the guy in the last story thinking which one from 23 guys you did that was the Internet Historian
NGL if someone did that movie thing to me, I'd have demanded a refund on the spot.  Your literal only job as someone working at a movie theatre is to not spoil movies - that's basically the only way you fail your job.   Thankfully there are self serve machines at mine that let you scan your phone so you can have a 99% human free experience except for the checkpoint where they rip the tickets.
This is like the Avengers of Internet Historian.  Also you doing my boy nigredo wrong.
craigslist hitman is just the premise for the show barry on HBO btw
"You know, short girl height, like 5'3" Literally the average height of an Australian woman lol
Behind the Front and Bridging the Gap are two great Black Eyed Peas albums. Then Fergie happened...
21:33 When marley and me first came out, me my mom and my grandma were all in the line to get tickets for some other movie. My grandma sees the marley and me poster and says “Oh I don’t want to see that movie, I don’t like movies where the dog dies at the end.” And the woman behind us got pissed for spoiling it. To this day my grandma still thinks she did nothing wrong.
i won't lie, hello fresh meals taste great each and every time
Love Don Hertzfelt Rejected
And now I need to wait another 3 months?
“Hello-“ “I’m on break…” instantly broke me.😂
Yeah but Photoshop is a complete ripoff and free software is actually better now or you can literally pirate it.
Every other YouTuber sponsor plug: click click click click  Internet Historian Plug: Babe grab the fucking popcorn!!!!!!
Man, going through that absolute cringe of commercial by Pepsi got me ptsd. I got why it was rejected
There is so much vitriol towards 6’+ guys that we never get a chance go explain these odds things that come with with our size. Being a foot or more above the average person has a lot of drawbacks…
How this guy makes ads just plainly isnt a chore to watch anymore. killed me with the "hello fresh, i'm dad"
Blerry, two videos in two days! Is he going to go for the hattrick and then not upload for the next 6 years?
10/10
U heard it here kids. Steal adobe
I feel rejected
Nice collab bro.
Rejected by Anthony Davis!
I was working at a movie theater when Amazing Spider-Man 2 came out, and I was working at the concession stand on the night of the premire. The minute it ended a couple of guys walked right up to my counter talking about how Gwen died. Like... for real man?
Wouldn't the opposite of rejected be injected?
16:48 IH kicked the hornets nest. Sumito just posted a video about it. ...Or was it SomeOrdinaryGamers?
My beard has grown to the floor waiting but our savior has finally returned
I can see why they were rejected.
Omg we finally got the conclusion to simitos role play as costumer service professional
honestly, my favourite cartoon ever is the raggy dolls: a uk television show that aired from 1986-1994 it's about rejection, in the form of the raggy dolls all being rejects of a toy factory by being put in the reject bin because of something wrong with them
I wanna know what the movie was that got spoiled and what the guy said that spoiled it
Lewis? Is there an ITF that I missed?
So is this a video about that rejected film? The one where they're bleeding out their anus?
NEW UPLOAD THE DOPAMINE RUSH IS REAL
What video was Lewis Spears in? Did I miss that?
wow 2 vids in one year thats amazing
Hallo fresh and gousto are both shit, quality of ingredients is just poor. Some of the recipes are good, some are awful but the times show are complete bullshit, if it says 15 minutes it'll probably take 40 unless you hustle like a trained chef.
Rubedos, ugh. Glad somebody finally spoke up.
The philosophers stone is made using an ancient incantation: Red and yellow black and white, they are precious in his sight, jesus loves the little children of the world. COINCIDENCE!?
That dad joke at the end kek  Also, I really liked this format, it was fun, Lewis was really great, hope he shows up more. Though, as much as I love Kudos and Ordinary Things, Sumito's pure comedic skill is hard to beat.
3:13 I've actually experienced this too! I'm really short for a girl, 5'0", and I once dated a guy who was 6'3". Going out in public was really hard because between the background noise and our height difference we could never hear each other! He was also Ukranian with a thick accent so that made it even harder lol. In public he would just about bend in half to hear what I was saying and/or I would stand on my toes to talk up into his ear. Needless to say we got a lot of stares when out and about haha
God bless you, and all who sail in you.
i remember back in like 2014 i had to use my dad's computer and i started typing in "how to" and it autocompleted "how to kill." was fairly terrified by that one.
7:12 is.... that the man's actual name? the CEO of adobe are John Adobe?
The good thing about being told a spoiler for Everything Everywhere All At Once is that nothing, absolutely nothing can make that movie worse than it already is.
Something I've had to be more aware of, being taller than most people I know, is my walking speed. I'm already a pretty speedy strider but I forget that equates to a brisk run for some of my shorter friends.
@9:29-9-41 Watching this segment, hearing what you’re saying…. Having watched The Menu, just last night…. NOT EVEN 12 hours ago.
I have 6 years in it professionally...  Hello!  I'm on break  xD true retail experience
the hello fresh commercial 🤣
____. What issss ______?
The tall person bit got me. When you are short you don't get noticed and get ignored which sucks, but when your are very tall you become an attraction, people look at you like it's a freak show. The end result is that you get dehumanized a bit either way just because you're outside the norm. Especially the bit where you see a guy and think "what a freak" and then you realise they're shorter than you, you are the freak.
i'm 1.50m (4'11"), I want to switch heights with Lewis for just a day. like "freaky friday" but worse
Brilliant fucking catalogue video, it gives me hope we'll see the cinematic cut of the Mother banter one day.
Those prices really are outrageous. Starting to think Adobe and Big Implant are in bed together.
That tall guy bit made Me lose my shit made eye contact with people that have just had they're heads floating over the top of my 6ft plus fence it's just weird especially considering the dips and  drops in the pavement and You just see this fucking head peering over the fence line as they're dog takes a shit and You just stare at each other for like an eternity.
Which episode was the tall guy from?
I find the fact that the HelloFresh sponsor's music is from Freshman Sound funny.  Sause: Freshman Sound - Fear
Jesus... hello fresh looks like the best thriller to grace us since cabin in the woods
But you didn't say "A Gun" in the intro! (I'm joking, good vid.)
what is the video the tall guy is in (lewis i think his name is) called? he didnt cut the entire video did he?
0:02  The blood bank after I go to make a donation (I brought it on a bucket, and is not mine)
Is there a video of just IH ads?
The Internet Historian expanded universe is finally starting. All previous guest are here.
The genius of running a Hello Fresh ad on a video of expired clips is just beautiful. ❤
Looks good?  That looks something a dog yacked up, including the intestinal parasites.
on the other end of the spectrum, many of my friends are much taller than me (like a foot taller or a little less) and i can't hear from down here either it's terrifying
So, is this your way of telling us you’ve been rejected from NordVPN ads?
A fellow tall person at 6 ft 7". I can relate to that Airplane bit so much. Once was on a plane from Chicago to Hawaii (approx 12 hours). I couldn't get a second of sleep the entire flight and it ruined my back.
Surprised that all of these were cut out, yet the 10+ minutes where IH went on a tangent about a random energy drink made it in a video
I wonder if this is gonna be about how his main channel feels
I like the Collab format. New story mode AND incognito. It's Christmas in March!
Hello Fresh is a terrible product
I didn't expect this was the "Drive 5'9" manlets into suicide" episode.
IH and Sumito should cover Harry & Meghan South Park
How is it that not a single link in your description works? :D
Lesson: The best part of being absurdly tall is never having to listen to women.
Hitler and Artschool?
3:10 5'3" is the average height for women. 5'4" in the US.
4:05 it's the same when two people with guitars see each other lol
Rejected... by the wahmen
i laughed alot during this <3 thanks again historian ilysm
Lmao. No sooner than my visa got rejected that I saw this video. It hurts for real to not be able do erasmus this year.
I'm average height but its mainly in the torso, so the Lewis story about standing up works against me.
When I saw an upload from incognito, I totally jected
Rejecting clips from an In the Field video? REJECTED.
0:40 Mr. & Mrs. Smith
i like that jontron is a reoccurring character on the channel now
NOT YOU MAKING THE 360° JOKE LMAO. greetings from germany
historian without nord is like an earth without oceans, a poem wihout rhymes, a song without voice, a galaxy without stones
Hello Mr Internet what happened to you at the end of this video could have been an encounter with a german fella. In Germany when u look in a circle made from fingers its called "reingeschaut" and they have the "right" to punch u for being stupid and folling for it. They typically punch ur arm and mark an x before or after punchibg there. Greetings from Germany, huge enjoyer of ours.
Avengers Endgame - the most ambitious crossover my ass, did you see what IH just dropped??
19:42 Galway baby.
was there a full Lewis Spears episode that i missed? or am i like a fuckin idiot?
Soooo .... ummmm .... any new vids on main channel in next decade ? Just want to know before I call my bookie ;)
I need Craigslist hitman now...
Your content these days… I dunno, slipping. Do Concordia part 2.
I finally signed up for Nord but when the it was time for the promo code I completely forgot about Nordman. Ill cancel before the 30 ghey guarantee and re sign up using your code IH .... naw I lied thats too much work...sorry
Internet Historian: small man, large anger
That was their only good song.
Yes dude…. Finally. Yearly update.  I like how historian made this channel for shitposts and faster updates but it slowly evolved into high quality, high effort videos that really belong on the main channel.
When you least expect him he uploads again!
WHY WERE THESE REJECTED?!
I am 6.3f tall and I can confirm everything that was said in this video 🤣
The Pepsi ad criticism 🫡
Who is that tall guy?  Which video is he from?  I don't recognize him.
the only ads i ever watch
Very reassuring to see this while waiting for my University application results
I’m having a fever dream, When did you make a video with lewis?
I searched for hitmen and bombs, and now the feds are outside. Thanks obama!
Internet Historian uploads just often enough to remind you how much you wish he uploaded more.
I stole my neighbors HelloFresh free trial meals because that dumbass ticked the "contactless shipping" box on order where they leave it on the doorstep during the coof was okay i guess would never pay that amount of money for that stuff though, shit's retarded
where is the hour of unreleased mother footage
Do Psychology!!
Haven’t even gotten half way through this vid and I have been interrupted five times by my family, once time for 3 hours. Im about to reject my loved ones.
I just realized that i don't even know how real life harold sounds like and IH's voice is just so default on that face in my mind now
18:56. I get the message, but in reality, who really won? Coke, who just sold two drinks? Or Pepsi, who sold one?
Hope we get to see the Lewis Spear video eventually 👍
Oh man the hello fresh ad was a thing of beauty
Not even Hello Fresh is immune from the chaos of IH's ad-making.  The world must now be ready for Hello Fresh Man!
The amount of time it took me to realize that this what not just an episode about rejected, but actually previously rejected clips is embarrassing and no one shall ever mention it.
That NFT meltdown might be the funniest thing to ever happen on youtube. God damn, bear witness.
JESUS! Who the hell pays for Photoshop? That's insane.
You know that's funny because I had wish that YouTube had rejected me from ever seeing this channel again.     Edit: I love you guys this was literally for giggles.
The short girl thing is real
That exact scenario happened to me with EEAAO too
2500 FOR PHOTOSHOP WTF
What the heck. I got an Adobe ad after the Adobe segment
As someone who’s also 6‘8 and lives near the German - Netherlands border I always find it slightly unnerving seeing someone who’s taller than me…
@hellofresh discount code doesn’t work
1. Look up "How to kill someone." 2. Take a quick screenshot. 3. Look it up again but add "...in Minecraft." 4. Dodge the feds.
I demand that you release the Lewis Spears episode.
I would try to get the movie theater dude fired if he spoiled me a movie like that
I reject reality and replace it with my own
The ad had me in fits
6:17 "I'm turning 360° and I'm walking away!" She's coming right at us!
'craigslist hitman' sounds like an amazing game. There's so much real-life stuff the producers of the game could use to get you busted, like you might think you got away with a murder but three in-game days later the police come to bust you because of you neighbours Ring doorbell or something. Your character might suffer a breakdown the first time they chop up a body because you rush it or something. I'd go for a real grimey, down-tempo, disturbing vibe. Not a hitman doing high-value targets but the descent of someone into a serial killer. The Son of Sam could be a real interesting one because he was basically a schizo but no-one noticed because people can be so utterly alone in a big city...
Craigslist hitman turns out to be a thing.
I never knew photoshop cost that much. What a world we live in
Wooooah thanks for the Marley & Me spoiler!
As a guy who does work on the industry: Adobe cost too much money, outrageouslty expensive in-fact. Oh, and also don't you dare cancel the subscription to Adobe midway or you'll have to pay for the rest of the year that you won't use, super costumer friendly
What the f is that Pepsi Ad supposed to be? The older one got it figured out already, why changing? Pepsi has a proven better taste than Coke... just highlight stuff like that
The other funny thing about being tall, other than it makes girls wet, is that people assume you are more of an authority figure and that you are tougher/stronger than you really are.
I am a bannana      The true rejected video
give me those IH scraps, I've starved enough
Internet Historian practices skin theory??
14:10 no way they didnt realise this 😭 literally described all races
Gastronomic restaurants are a lot of money for next to no food.
i will never forget watching the jontron destiny collab in its entirety where jontron makes up racist statistics and fear mongers about the white replacement conspiracy theory. after which he made some of the most insincere apology videos i have ever seen. jontron is an embarrassment to youtubers like IH who have enough respect for their audience to not say weird racist shit to them.
Bro brought the whole squad for this video and we love it 💯
Dude hello fresh is the best sponsor ever they use slave monkeys Based
Which episode was Lew Spears in?
I got rejected by IH. Probably incognito mode as well. Unless...
I only wonder, did it take 5ish years to collect these outtakes, and do we have to wait another 5 years of quality content for the next drop of quality outtakes? Longer?
What an absolute treat. ❤️‍🔥
Wait! But now I already know that the less I know about the Movie the better. Would it have been more better, if I didn't even know that the less I know about it the better? Because if yes then shame on you for the spoilers, I am thoroughly disappointed and my day is ruined!
Now you're working with the monkey slavers?
Everytime I watch an internet historian video, I know I need to make my content 20% edgier
I miss the 'Okay' sign meme.
So excited
The only videos on youtube where I actually look forward to the paid promotion.
On the topic of food, an Australian chef at a fancy restaurant said the dish is made to recreate the taste of almost drowning on a rocky cove due to strong waves. So that guy knows how to do story in food.
Cooking is a cool art. You don't need to compare it to an orchestra.  These chefs are so uptheir own asses it's horrifying. I want food that looks like food and tastes good. I don't need some deconstruction of nature or philosophical nonsense applied to it.
Ahhh, good idea uploading it on Incognito. They will never find out you un-rejected them.
no more tall people please
Man I love this channel. The guests, the skits, the animation, all of it.
Absolutely loving shopstreet getting an accidental shoutout
fun fact if u would only use photoshop to make ur boobas bigger, then its acuelly cheaper to get a surgery....
YOUR ADS ARE AMAZING. FUCK OFF<3
10:36 THAT looks good to you? That looks like something you scrapped off from the bottom of the grill while hoping it doesn't give you 10 different diseases by accidentally touching you. Is New Zealand cuisine really that depressing?
Oi buddy, ya links in the description seem to be a little... Off. Just lettin ya kno ^^
The conversation about Adobe had me laughing in sympathy pains. A lifetime purchase of ToonBoom Harmony Advanced is three times the amount my first car cost.
I misspelled my name on my taxes and the irs is auditing me now please help me i am very scared they are outside my house now.
"i dont even work here"
comment
YESSSSSS YESSSSSSSS ANOTHER ITF VIDEO YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS I MA SO HAPPY THIS MADE MY DAY!!!!!!!!!!
omg release more videos now its been 11 hours you little b!tch
╭( ･ㅂ･)و ̑̑╭( ･ㅂ･)و ̑̑
Sorry mate but early BIP is fire
Craigslist hitman sounds bomb tbh
These uploads are so rare that I'm not even watching this yet, it would spoil the excitement.
Many people get rejected every single day.  I met an austrian guy once.He said he was rejected  by art school but he still  found a way to enjoy what he loves doing and that is politics.
Isn't Craigslist Hitman just Hotline Miami?
That Pepsi ad encapsulated Twitter activism so well it's hilarious in hindsight.  I never understood the backlash. It's a soda company trying to sell us their drinks. What social injustices did most people expect?
that was a weird topic. but as always a great video
Rejection
Did I miss a ITF video of IH and Lewis?
"Rejected" is a legendary cartoon by Don Hertzfeldt. This video is _almost_ as good as that one.
7:23 did you cut it to the beat of the flash trailer?
I got a hello fresh ad right before your hello fresh ad
i reject having this rejected for i laughed
Yo this is absolutely funny the cinematic about the fridge and having no food is what got me dying 😂 Subbed
More lew spears features please
I'm like 5'10 and i've had difficulty hearing girls like 5'2
My favourite ad so far 😂
You know multiple people have vandalized Wikipedia since this video.
Dude I hated everything everywhere all at once   I payed heaps to see the premiere and it was shit ☹️
I just want good tasting food I don’t need all that fancy pansy stuff on my food
Release the full Lewis cut!
not ashamed but it took me til after the pepsi bit to realize these are rejected bits instead of them all being connected and tied together with the theme of rejection.. smh
I'm searching for a job rn. Very timely.
FINALLY
Petition for rejected 2 where he shows full version with the tits
11:30 I'm sorry but did that caption say that the spoonful of their dirt dessert was supposed to be for two people????
Sumito is a gem
I made the first car door
This video is jected.
I thought you gonna talk about rejection from work after appling for 9000 jobs
I loved this episode!
yippee jon here
Release the Mother video coward
Seeing this video pop up on my feed I finally understood how a dog feels when it’s owner comes home, tail wagging just pure excitedness
oh my god heston is such a throwback. he was all over the tele back in the day making edible wallpaper and houses out of sugar glass.  i'm pretty sure he made the worlds biggest cup of tea at one point, it was pretty cool not gonna lie
This man makes the only ads on YouTube that people don't INSTANTLY skip; probably looking forward to...
I feel that with Lewis. My gf is always upset that I can’t hear her and it’s just cuz she’s talking into my chest lolll
Guessing HI is below 6 ft
I’ve got video ideas: animals,movies,cars,sports,electronics,jobs,and video games
Even the rejected skits are good
SUCH A GIFT FOR A DAY. THANK YOU FOR UPLOADING
Yay, more Incognito plus Ordinary and Sumito!  Nom Nom Nom
Oh HELL YEAHH
We would never reject you, Historian.
Should've rejected that DnD session vid (the rest is pretty great tho)
"Hello Fresh, I'm Dad" That killed me. PERFECT
YES! I always wanted the adobe skit!
What do you mean there is nothing good in the fridge ? Let me check...  There is beer... and... mustard.  That'll do.
BRB going to change the entry to the philosophers stone on Wikipedia. EDIT: I did it. Not sure how long they'll keep it
The once-a-millennium upload is here, yipee
I want to give this video thousands of likes.
Imagine if they took the can of bepis from her and loaded it into the rotary grenade launcher
Oh shit I remember this guy from the official podcast
As a 5'2 girl I am greatly offended by this Height privilege
"It's like the universe init, and everything is a galaxy but all the flavours come together as the planets and we are all star dust" Sounds like something Russell Brand would say lol
tall gang
top quality, another serving of rejects for the table please
its so funny watching non american people try to fuck with american agencies and not their own.
I'm on break. Hilarious
Damn fucken Lewis spears Internet historian collab
I’m really tall and I always thought I’m just half deaf! I never realised I’m always a few feet away from everyone else 😂
Did I miss a whole episode with Lewis Spears?
Tall people, they do walk in herds
how could you reject a full episode of making fun of lewis and us tall people. now i want more of you two together. you cant just tease such a great collab to us.
Holy shit ballz.  IH posted a vid.
THE ADIMATIC UNIVERSE HAS JUST EXPANDED
We now have a new character for the internet historian cinematic universe
I love this "Greatest hits edition"
20:08 in the united States you could just unalive all of them with your fireleg that you already had stuffed in your belt
"I wonder how much damage we could do" I like where this is going
Thank you for not including the everything everywhere all at once hate
That pepsi ad is basically better call saul for it's use of colour
more plz
The downfall of NFT bros has being a wonderful thing to behold. They thought they owned something other than a URL to an image and despite this they thought they could buy a Dune book and own the Dune IP. Almost as cringe as those gamers who thought NFTs meant they could play their NFT asset on any video game cos something something blockchain. Yeah. It don’t work like that. A modicum of proper research would have shown you that. The best thing about NFTs is that it represented a bubble bursting. So long suffering holders of various crypto schemes may still breakeven or even see a profit if they can afford to hold for long enough. But those bros who pushed NFTs as the next bitcoin…you deserve the pain.
wait no gun?  also, next time someone does that to you just shout WTF MATE TF YOU CRZY so your mates can hear. or just go to town on them alone, usually those kind of folks are not expecting someone extremely violent. but you do have to be extremely violent, not like give someone a little push or some punches. only go for it if you're really in for it, otherwise just let it go.
17:02 that was the Black Eyed Peas only good song, and they changed the lyrics to “let’s get it started”, ruined such a good song
6ft 8 here, wassup brother.
Bruh. Lewis Spears episode where??
Rejecting the usual one on one style of these videos for a revolving door of the boys was a pleasant surprise.
oh yes
I was just thinking about you last night when scrolling YouTube, thinking I hadn’t seen any of your videos for a while and checked to see if you had uploaded. Then today I get blessed with a video ❤
At this point finding aliens is more possible than finding an Internet historian episode
I was gonna try get Google search to recommend how to make a pipe bomb but realised if that becomes the most searched topic from my IP it will automatically recommend it if my mom typed anything into Google and that would freak her out
zero anuses bleeding. i want a refund.
For a second I thought this would be about Don Hertzfeldt
Speaking of Rejected... JonTron...  Ooof
"God damn ru****s"   Internet Historian, 2023
Why is Mutahar in a Sumito video?
the "rejected.......reeJECTed" made my day
It’s like the universe innit💀
Honestly my favorite content creator. Only one I never miss a video
11:18 THAT'S cow shit! That is straight up cow shit! Get the hell outta here with all that cow shit!
Is he hot or is he just tall is a game so many women have to play lmao
I looked up the analytics for "how to make pipe bomb" and it indeed has gone up quite a bit in the recent time frame. Very interesting.
Am i the only one who thinks IH could have died months ago and this video is just cut content from other ITF and his relatives are making 6 months worth of videos to have more Raid, Shadow Legends ads? I know its a stupid theory, but in my head is soo funny
What a Pleasure is to start my morning watching this. Thanks for remembering us and uploading once in a while!
We need a vid on scam ads on here. Almost all are get rich quick, the gov owes you money here is how, take my not free class and payday loan cards and my fav chinas Tik-Tok really wants you to download them. Just seems all the normal ads are gone and all that's left is scams.
Finally
Best advert yet not gunna lie
Didnt subscribe for 20 minutes of rambling
Internet historian is a good example of quality above quantity, which is way better
jontron again!!! Really!!
Damn I can't believe I missed when internet historian was in shop street in Galway, sorry that those Irish guys bullied you! 19:44
the greatest movie crosover of all time
now we will get to witness a  Hello Fresh lore nice
With all of these AI voice cloners... I can have the soothing voice of Internet Historian join the other voices in my head in my daily life.
A kitchen is like an orchestra in one way. Each person contributes their "part"(food or instrument) to make a whole . A meal or orchestral piece of demonstration.
Waaait a second, black, white, yellow and red.. hmmmmmmmm I think Fullmetal Alchemist was onto something.
18:48 I legit thought I had a Mandela Effect moment because I could swear that was an RC Cola ad where the kid buys a Coke and Pepsi, stands on both to reach the RC.  But no that was a real ad too that they ripped off wholesale.
God, I love these youtube videos more than my own life. 👍
For rejected clips these are actually pretty good if you have more in the future maybe make a part 2!
I'm new to Internet Historian Man™ but I'm starting to suspect that his titles aren't the topic of the entire discussion but are just a random word chosen to make you click on the video. I'm calling it, that the next Incognito Mode video is going to be called "gardening." and they're going to spend the entire video talking about Coco Chanel.
ive always said being tall is a headache, literally
9:07 The "wank" is how they justify the $$$. People pay to lap up the wanky shit.  Not hating, but that's just how it works. I've got friends who obsess over this, but it's just not my thing.
Ad time music was by the channel Freshman Sound and they make pretty good stuff
There was that defunct game "Dirty Bomb" that got shut down. Its developers decided to take all its design documents and other supporting items and release them to the public, so there was a wave of people Googling "dirty bomb PDF", "dirty bomb design" etc. That must have been a fun day at the American three letter agencies.
Wait was there a lewis spears one that I missed?
We need more SumitoMedia appearances. Dude's hilarious.
So with the explosion of VTubers, when is IH going to cave in and just get animated for real? Lots less montage time with it...
Dope
I am Santa, hear me raw.
That's what happens when you don't get it from TrustedTorrent that guy is basically giving it away for free.
I dunno why the story of the frat bros punching IH in the shoulder for looking at the "ok" sign got my blood boiling something fierce. Like I legit fantasized about them trying that shit here in Texas so I could shoot that asshole "in self-defense." Kinda funny that IH then goes on to say he's in the process of buying a gun. Too shoot his friends though lol...
but did you like everything everywhere all at once?
12 minutes in just realising this is cut parts and isn't about applications. "why is there so many guests?"
You know, this guy sounds really similar to the Internet Historian. Connection?
Pitch an ad to Pepsi for their Super Bowl slot.
SO YOU MADE US WAIT FOR MONTHS JUST TO GIVE US A COLLECTION OF RANDOM CLIPS YOU CUT FROM OTHER VIDEOS????  Based that was really fun to watch 🙂
My boyfriend is 6’9” and I’m 5’1”. It has been so interesting learning how he deals with life.
I don't think knowing everything everywhere all at once is a multiverse movie remotely affects your enjoyment, it's like the entire premise, it would be like knowing back to the future has time travel hahaha
Was this vid rejected from the main chanel?
5:04 who the h**** goes drest like that?
More Lewis pls
what's up with the 'ok' sign in the context of the story? only heard of it as a white supremacy kind of sign
"cregslist hitman"  Yea.. that sounds about like Postal 2
THE HELLO FRESH NECRONOMICON... XD "Clattu foodarata nec-cough-cough.."
I hate restaurants like that - they always take a really long time to give you these bite-sized courses that look kind of interesting but taste mediocre. Just give me a single course that tastes amazing and costs half as much, thanks.
The links to the other guys are broken in the description. Internethistorian is out here rejecting advertisement lmao.
Sometimes dead is better
Finally some tall representation as a 6’8” man I’m glad this is finally out in the ether
Damn I didn't expect to see Lewis spears here
He's back thank god
i googled how to hire a hitman and how to make a pipe bomb and apparently no one else on google trends has searched it recently im probably on a list now :(
2 videos in 2 days... Santa is real
I was hoping this would be a video of all your rejected ads
my man, i always auto play your comfy incognitos in your playlists so i can sleep fast because its like a asmr but someone talking in the back of my head.
I thought he was gonna say, "you're rejecting me!? I have over 50 million power..."
This was the infinity war of the internet historian cinematic universe
That everything, everywhere all at once was trying to be that, but because it was highly leftist the left wing hollywood loved it, but it was not anything anywhere and did not happen.
I went to a 2 star restaurant in Bangkok with my wife. This place cost us around $1,000 dollars for both of us. We left hungry and would have rather gotten kfc or something 😂
nice new video
my and my mates got really good at giving eachother dead arms doing the ok game
I love this channel
I feel like internet historian has rejected the main chanell
$2500 would buy one breast implant.  Infinite digitiddies, or one IRL enhanced tiddy? Quite the dilemma...
He bought two bottles of coke just to get 1 pepsi, I think that's a win for coke
Didn’t expect Lewis to be in an incognito mode episode what. a pleasant surprise
Lmao Nebz is here
Your ads are too good to skip
My spoon is too big, fkin easy
Oh fuck yeah my man Lewis!
My theory on this: So IH actually died and his video guy put this up so that nobody gets suspicious. Gonna be a sad day when the next main channel vid is supposed to come out.. in 2024 :/
Another 20 mins of beautiful madness
liked the video before started watching. in IH we trust
And here I thought I’d see a talking banana and an oversized spoon.
brutalmoose has a better hellofresh man
I read all the comments and I am here also
OH DAMN that tall person conversation was too relatable 😭😭😭
It would be scarier, if in 7:40  kid said „There is no pantry”
4:26 I feel seen and accepted. Thank you. 🥲
HAHAHAHAHAAH i'm 6"9 and that bit about the tall guy and not understanding people when they are shortish since their mouth is so far away is very true. And all tall people nod to each other hahaha.
I can see why these were rejected.. Internet historian is so needy and insecure all the time.
Got an Adobe ad watching this. What the fuck
Razor sharp edge, boys
I really wonder what that everything everywhere all at once spoiler was, I watched the movie and don't have a guess
Love not getting notifications on youtube no notification squad today😞
Even his b-sides are a top tier video
Internet Historian posting right out out of the friendzone
Stop being a fucking pussy…love you
Sup IH, if you ever travel SoCal I'll comp you and HIH's tab at my brewery/deli and don't want a photo op. Patreon is crazy and YouTube as well. Just hit me up and drop the merest hint and I'll getcha.
2:34 Either there’s an IH video/channel out there I haven’t seen yet...or he made this clip specifically to trick people into thinking that.
Can't belive my sub was rejected
Tall people make tall friends because they see eye to eye on so many things.
The most subtle quick jokes are always the best!  "You know what, I'm gonna help the poor!"  *cuts to affluent middle-class suburbia*
I understand the statement that Bepis ad was making, but still I can't get over how dumb it is. If standing on a can is enough to reach the button, just fucking jump.
I have officially became the first person ever to buy food using someones promo link. Now I just gotta buy a fridge. And a house.
In all honesty, as someone who loves going blindly into a movie, game, book or show without knowing anything, f**k the dude at the cinema that spoiled the movie for you. Serious a-hole
''Hod'l this '' 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Rubedo is like an Italian version of a rube.
Loved the bits with NFTs and bepis.
What was the spoiler!
Companies that agree to let Internet Historian make ads about them are legends.
Oh wow a new vid!
What's with all the videos with these other lame ass people
Jontron the best
This was neat. I like all the different guests together in one video. Funny, as usual. Curious to see what the next topic of discussion will be, but I will wait patiently. I have a backlog of IH and Incognito Mode videos to watch in the meantime.
@20:25 Typical USian.... lol 😕
Aaand now pipe bomb has spiked to a 3 year high on trends.  Funny enough, it's not nearly as popular of a search as Jan 1 2018. I'm pretty sure I don't want to remeber why that spike is so high.
lol, hi dad, I’m a lime.
@18:53 LOL used the cokes to get the pepsi... LOL  Told you this was sponsored by Pepsi in my last comment lol....
Finally, video with a normal ending
@18:00 For those who dont like Pepsi Commercials, Turn back now :-P... LOL 😛
That face when the rejected videos turn out to be best videos, every single time.
I like this video because I have been rejected too! We have so much in common. Perhaps I should ask it for a date?
@17:25 I don't think so Tim... lol
Another ad to add to the adverse
@16:50 you suck at singing, this in that way.,.. Never do that again! LOL
Hello fresh horror? Pure brilliance.
@15:15 Some child finds one and shakes it while looking into the sky, in his medcal pajams as he was praying into the stars, and when it lands in his hand, he looks at it, and the excitement in his eyes grows, and he yells out... I AM RICH!!!!.. 😛
Dawg wtf this gotta do with rejection
@15:00 You start pointing at everyone who kleeps picking them up and yelling how much they owe you for that picture... LOL
Lol, nice find Mr explorer.
I want more and i want it now!!!
@14:41 he looks like a Beetle 😛
that hitman game actually sounds good
Gotta love wasting two cans of Coca Cola just to buy bepsi
Google trends says murder for hire is a not very common search term, however "how to make a bomb" does have data. But, surprisingly, the search term doesn't have more than 300 searches between march 2022 and february 2023
Jokes on you, rejection is the only thing that does it for me anymore
Lewissssss!!!!
It's called uxoricide . It's also great for cleaning toilets Also, also, just watch 'the menu'
Watch tall girl
@11:45 you boys are getting rich, and starting to research longjevity ehy :-P./... Typical 😀
@11:11 You get Comfortable is the new; You are used to eating what we give you... LOL
Internet Historian is most definitely an AI program operated by the Australian government, the long time between posts is due to the program being given a huge number of inputs and processing times.
I love you Daddy
@11:00 Does it actually change from purple to green???
@10:25 it looks like Bird feed. No thankk you.. Only a bird would think that that looks good LOL 😛 Little bit of mud on the sticks.... EWWWW
As a life long experts in rejection I can say this is indeed rejected.
@10:11 I dont think these so called cooks, even know what food is LOL....
Smokin dos peqies
This entire episode is just stuff IH never used in other episodes and is literally a vehicle for historian's Hello Fresh ad as he probably realised he needed to post a video before a certain time to qualify for the sponsor money, and I don't care.  Brilliant.
@7:30 Hello Fresh 😛 I dont trust a food that is mass publicized ... food is a weakness for poison if not protected against....
🥹
I’m definitely on a list I’m fucked
I Love you guys 😀
7:20 shit, I just realized the cost of surgery really takes about the same or even lower than buying adobe photoshop for 2500 usd.
I would have Karen'd the fuck out of that ticket guy to his manager after the movie.
The multiverse expands!!
...and down below you will see all the rejected comments from the videos above, such as: "First", and smash hit: "first", and don't forget everybody's favorite: "first!".
Goddamn Rubedos!
Michelin restaurants are gimmick factories for wealthy people. People just don't want to admit it's bad because they spent $150 on a tiny serving of overly complicated crap.

What did the movie ticket guy say?
This makes me remember that episode of the Simpsons that was just a behind the scenes "cut outs" of certain episodes.  And I love it
you need to do one of this vids with @friendlyjordies
Rejected? Sounds like my childhood and I knew this was gonna be a banger  Jontrons laugh was so instinctual lol
There isnt a single youtuber that I check up on as much as this guy.
Don't think, just 'ject it.
I really dont know his schedule lmao. I literally check the trello schedule and this one isnt there
So if you wanted to buy photoshop, it'd be about the equivelent of paying for it monthly for about 7 years.
When I saw the title I thought this would just be rejected sponsor reads, which had me thinking "wait, with what they let through, what did they REJECT?"
One of your best.
Thank you for this, love in the field, always a treat when it comes in, your voice is amazing and the improv bits make everything that much more enjoyable.
When you make videos with actual quality and end up making a small circle of guys who also put effort into their content
AS A FELLOW 6'3 AUSSIE, LEWIS IS PREACHING GOSPEL
Some might say that IH fell off, some might say he’s run out of video ideas… I would agree with both of these points, but I’m still here for it.
Me, never skipping over an incognito ad. You, shoveling good content into my hungry hungry mouth.
On it, that video game- I’m on it
"They released a song titled Let's Get Retarded" 🤣🤣🤣
Can’t wait to watch this, then watch Asmongold watching this.
What video was Lewis Spears on?
Can you do a video about dream
Our P.E assignment required us to do a hip-hop dance and for the song I jokingly suggested Let's get Retarded to my classmate and she agreed to it lol
Shoud've changed the tittle to  "the times i wasn't chad enough to make edge content"
7:23 hello fresh
Greatest ITF colab ever!
3:04 fucking kangaroo
You had me at Hello...Fresh.
"Freakishly large" at 6 ft 8.. Dude I am 6 ft 8, come over to the Netherlands you'll be about average 😅
Well well well look who it is
Holy shit! That's MY AMC theater here in Vegas @21:15! 🤯
Introducing: Fresh Man
"It looks good" a pile of spices and herbs and something gooey like cat vomit looks good?
I hate snooty cuisine. I'd rather have a heaping plate of mediocre food than a tiny dollop of fancy art trash.
I can't tell if you're actually sponsored by hello fresh, or if it was just a bit.  And at this point I'm afraid to know the answer.
Babe wake up, new content
The fact that I got a fucking Jim Beam advert immediately proceeding 02:25 is proof that the Storymode characters are becoming more real and powerful with each episode.
i would be comflicted about the tallness and women commentary but like, ive had similar occurences while talking to other women in the same context so.. being tall affects all?
FINALLY WE SEE WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THE I'M ON BREAK BIT
Should have rejected the whole Jontron ep tbh 🤷🏻‍♀️
new upload on the main channel when?
The only channel on Youtube where you cant wait for the ads 😁 Much appreciation sir! Thanks for All the work 🙂
Bruh got $470 left enuf to get shit faced enuf to go to a Lewis Spears gig. Wait I also heard Sumito media say super heroine.
15:37 damn he got Jontron SCREAM laughing for this one
I did the tall flirting thing as well but in reverse because I'm short as heck.. didn't work though
The Hello Fresh code doesn't work outside the US. I feel rejected.
Hi IH and friends. Hi editor. Thanks for the video. See you in 6 months.
Thanks to that video I now now that they memed the pepsi ad in The Boys
Never have I felt so good about being rejected. 💔
IVE MISSED YOU
It took me way too long to realise that this is a compilation of rejected clips from past videos
I’ve always thought Sumito was funny, but wow did he have some of his best zingers in this one. “Remind me what you were doing with you time again? Making your tits bigger for Instagram likes?”
2 in 2 days damn son
At 13:48 these are literally lyrics in a Nirvana song. I'll give half the chorus and replace the other half with these words.   " With the lights out, it's less dangerous Here we are now, entertain us I feel stupid, and contagious Here we are now, entertain us  A Nigredo, an Albedo Citrinitas, a Rubedo"
What video is Lewis from?
Is it just me or does Incognito Mode sound exactly like Internet Historian? 🤔
Ohhh, lewis spears is the king charles dead guy
Boys a new video just dropped.
the google trends for that hitman search did spike 4-5x higher than normal in the last hour. well played lol.
We love JonTron :)
You made me watch everything everywhere all at once, thank you. Came back here to finish the last bit of the video, didnt want to risk spoilers
Someone legitimately could make a decent videogame out of the bottom shelf  murder for hire trying to get their shattered life back on track.. while managing your addictions.. and *work*
I got here pretty early I would say
Well this was great, sucks that the clerk spoiled the movie... my dad did the same thing to me with that film.
omg
Very nice WHERES THE EXTRA FOOTAGE OF THE MOTHER ENERGY DIALOGUE? we need it.
Having been rejected and then ejected from my school cause they thought I was using drugs( was just having an extreme existential crisis) , I know what being rejected means xD
but you havent said what you thought about the movie? did you like it? please i need to know it's important.
Wait, so is there a whole rejected Lewis spears episode?
Honestly a cinema enployee spoiling a movie would turn me into a full time karen.
Plot twist: the surgery is actually more affordable than photo shop
Very interesting.
Now we need one that titled "redacted"  redacted  redacted  rrreeeedddaaaaccccctttteeeeedddddd
I have zero context for the coke/pepsi bit and it was not funny :(
I’m on break
Lisa: It chose to destroy itself rather than live with us........ You can't help but feel a little rejected.
Philosopher's stone just sounds like a very strong neutron emitter.
Did Nord and Hello Fresh have to do a sort of bidding war to be on your video? Like, Nord mails you an offer with $20 cash as a kind of down payment, but then hello fresh sends a trivially better offer, BUT also send a care package of 2 or 3 meals?
The most ambitious crossover in history
That sponsor edit is making me cancel hello fresh.
Wow, when I paid for CS6 lifetime, it was like $300 or something, and now they're $2500 holy moley I am sorry new digital media people.
I hope lyft sponsors one of your videos. Would love to see pink guy again
The hitman thing reminded me that the singer of As I Lay Dying tried to hire a hitman to kill his wife and he got to keep being in a famous band. So trying to kill people is actually pretty chill apparently. Seems like a lot of cool people are doing it.
Is there some unreleased Lewis Spears collab in the works or was everything from that rejected?
Wow 2 videos! 🙌 Its my lucky day!
Howdy ripe green person offer free shipy .... aquire now
Hitman for Hire? So the TV show Barry with Bill Hader? Great show. 10/10, love noho hank
Meh ad this time, not enough abuse
Crossover of the decade
You could've turned the whole thing around with the okay symbol guy by just shouting "This man is a racist! Look at his racist hand!"
Basically all trains here in Finland have all the seats facing towards the centre of the railroad car and I 100% know that awkward stare between tall people. Except in a train you're just continuously facing the other guy for like two hours. I'm only 6'4 though so if I'm willing to sit like the cool kid in the back of the classroom in middle school I can just barely hide behind the headrest of the person in front of me.
Internet historian makes me wish I was Australian.
I feel like tall man was attack me whole time talky ....grrr
and the IH multiverse keeps growing.
I am now on a list. Thanks ;)
I’m starting to suspect that Historian is a Craigslist Hitman
Cog be all up IN the nito
Honestly you could probably build an entire Part 2 out of all the unused Mother Energy Drink footage.
A new Incognito video? To hell with sleep, I must watch
Watch after your amazing intros? Rejected
Your ads are so good. lol
You're finally back 😭
Jon Tron the racist is also on here. How fantastic  And before anybody asks, just watch the debate between destiny and jontron
Wish I was rejected. Somehow what I’m going through is worse.
Finally, a new incognito mode video to put me to sleep.
LEW!!!!!!!!! DADDY LONG LEGS!!!!!
Craigslist hitman is just the pitch for the HBO show Barry
"Palpatine is Sidious" isn't really a spoiler, any more than "Anakin is going to grow up to be Darth Vader". You mean the guy named Senator Palpatine and Emperor Palpatine are the same person?  What a twist!
Is this why all the deleted videos ?
The sheer amount of creators that you have in this single video with you is giving me whiplash. And I'm a glutton for punishment, so I love it  😍
T'was about time, wasn't it?
When your rejected content is better than 90% of the stuff out there.
I'm doing the searches
A movie theatre employee did the thing they’re not supposed to do.
I have the same experience with the height thing. Im not very tall by international standards but Im above average in my country. When its time to stand up during my trip in a public transpo, I stand up and my head nearly is able to hit the roof. Everyone looks.
Goddamn rubedos! :)
Hellofreshman's lime helmet must be worth about $193, I reckon.
Yess, better than me birthday.
Wow, I’m 9 minutes in the video and I’m finally starting to understand the title of the video.
You shouldn't be working with Jon Tron. Really not a good person at all.
White supremacist jumpscare
In Hestons defence, you don't make the stuff he does without forcing yourself to think a bit pretentiously, and especially artistically.  When he compares it to an orchestra he is trying to be akin to a poet, comparing a drop of dew to the sun rising in the sky. Whether he achieved that, is another point, but I'm pretty sure that's what he was trying to do.   In a large commercial kitchen you really do need some level of coordination between roles, more akin to an orchestra than, say, working in a chemistry laboratory where there are often few scientists, machines doing a lot of the work, and less harsh deadlines (its pretty rare, as a chemist, for me to need to provide a result to someone sitting at a table waiting for me to finish my job)...
Les duit
I avoided Everything, Everywhere, All at Once for a long time based on its stupid art movie name. When I finally watched it, having heard a sufficient amount of good shit, I felt like I'd been fucking tricked. Lied to by people I trusted. It was.. It was just such a 'normal' movie if not for the frenetic crap going on. I was fooled by the presence of actors I like and apparently easily impressed friends...
I'd honestly listen to the unedited footage
Man, I'm only 5'11", which is Reject Height on a guy. "Almost good enough for a woman, but not quite." I'd KILL to be 6'8"! Or maybe hire someone from Craigslist to kill for me.
Yes!!!!
I always heard the "Let's get it started" version of that Black Eyed Peas song growing up so when I first heard the uncensored version, I thought it was a parody.
Historian's rejecting everyone in this episode of Home Alone.
I can’t believe you rejected me, I’m go cry in the bathroom
Hell yeah Lewis Spears!
you should have put the kitchen part  before the add, so people would be more willing to watch it or maybe think its part of the video.
What video is the tall dude in?
Have I told you lately the you are my god and I am truly not worthy
When will JonTron return to providing candid content with friends? Has his social exile ended yet?
i see we're in the second round of hello fresh shoving the absolute shit out themselves into everyone ones faces again. Except instead of adds, its paid promotions. at least sophie monk isnt involved anymore.
Hello Fresh. Coming from a small Delivery Service In Berlin, to the Grandmaster of the Internet. Couldnt be more proud <3
I legit skipped the ad...
good vid, but fuck jon tron
0:21 missed the opportunity to say I'm the guy with 80.000 Power.
I'm 6'10" and i dont like short people bevause we have different temperaments. A short guy needs to be loud and annoying to even be noticed while we tall people get noticed all the time and want to minimize it so we are more reserved and calm.
I love that someone at HelloFresh saw his ads for Nord and said we gotta pay this guy
I got to this before my father and brothers and I will brag about it forever
2 videos in one day!! That’s crazy .. I mean counting story mode. So 2 more like , mid April ?? 😂😂 love it tho
“He also is not jonathan adobe” i lost it😂😂
Never knew I needed this until it's here
oh hell yeah
Jontron already thought of, and did, the most embarrassing thing a famous person can do lmao
LEWIS
Cum
2:58 reminds me of a time where i saw an incredibly unimaginably tall woman walk into her ice cream shop, and while i was baffled, her even taller boyfriend walks kn
Breast augmentation surgery is actually cheaper than Photoshop.
Here's hoping next video comes out soon, since this one was already pre-made
2:58 Except I'm a whole foot taller than my best friend, and it's always been like that, even when we were in elementary school
I can understand why this was rejected this was terrible thank you
Story Mode AND Incognito Mode videos within a day?? HELLA YEAH! :3
IH has both the most high quality and super scuffed ads
Albedo, Nigredo and Rubedo are names from characters of the Anime called Overlord....bye.
I know the name of the track used for the ad, also the channel. Very good tastes 👍
11:42 underrated joke
This is a pretty lazy video internet historian, but im on board, being quite lazy myself. 😁
I am smarter after watching this.
I was just watching the classic Don Hertzfeldt cartoon last week. “I am a banana!”  “My anus is bleeding!”
Reject
The video is picking up after the weapons episode 😂😂😂😂
Seriously whenever I hear the word “rejected”, I think of Master Shake saying “Dear Frylock, we are coming to hurt you. You are rejected because you’re a red gay ass”
I know what those colors are, those are the four humours.
Thank Christ for the Adobe Photography subscription. $10 a month for LR and PS
Funny thing on Google trends pipe bomb skyrocketed
This video summed everything everywhere all at once.
Protip: Hello Fresh comes with three vouchers for free shipments for three friends/family members, they just have to pay the shipping price ($9.99 Canadian for me). I got twelve meals for ten maple leafs, then immediately cancelled before the next week's order was shipped. My free food came with three more of these vouchers. Surely a large friend group could capitalized on this deal...
Him explaining the philosopher’s stone being made of black, white, yellow, and red explains the bead colors from the Imp catcher quest in Runescape.
WOKE UP TO THIS!!!! WILL SAVE IT FOR LATER
I still use Adobe Photoshop Elements 2002 edition, on my current build of Windows 10. I pirated it over twenty years ago and it hasn't failed me ever.
The "With that money, I could just get a real boob job" joke could have been timed better.
Alt for photoshop: Krita (free program) Photobea (free web)
Has it been 6months again? :o  Obsidian, chalk or salt, ruby, brimstone. Mix it up und down your rabbit hole it goes.
You guys googled how to make a bomb? Swear that shit was taught by the shadow people yaknow
This is like a clips show, but not a clips show…… 11,000,000/10.
i cant believe you didn’t make a “my spoon is too big” joke given the title
Running out of ideas 2023
Even when that guy just speaks the lyrics they're borderline unintelligible. That's kind of impressive.
I love the every episode starts with the same cadence and intonation. So you can basically karaoke ever intro without actually hearing it before.
Honestly I have no sympathy for short people. You should have drank more milk as a kid and also been more Dutch.
wait a second, what video was Lewis in
"Free software isn't going to get you there"   I had flashbacks to trying to tell a guy at Staples eons ago that I used Krita and was just seeing what new repackage Adobe was selling
Welp. I am exact short girl height. Glad to know I’d have to yell to be heard by this dude.
The all stars are here
Would be a shame if someone were to post an easy way to obtain Photoshop in an alternative way. It would be wrong, don't do that.......sure would be a shame though, wouldn't it?
Never imagined we'd get the rest of the "i'm on break" bit
So glad i know more about the philosophers stone now, I had no idea before very informative 11/10
I love your content good sir it's so succulent and juicey
7:23 Really puts Hell into Hellofresh X)
I’ve always couched every verbal threat with “in minecraft” and that seems to keep me safe.
I did those Google searches and forgot I was on work wifi.
9:00 hold on, let him cook.  But in all seriousness, I think it's honestly an apt comparison *when cooking is a creative endeavor*. Assuming Ratatouille didn't lie to me, high end/professional kitchens have several people with different tools and specialties working in a harmony of sorts. Maybe I'm talking out my ass, but it feels a bit mean to discount his passion just because his analogy didn't make sense to you.
Wait, you're dad?
your upload schedule rejected my health 10/10
im 6'3 and this magic trick doesnt work for me... im too average, wish I was 6'6
I love this idea for a video
The only man who can upload b roll footage from months ago and still get 200k views
Murder and get away with it game would be kinda fun.
I couldn't agree more with IH's take on fine dining. It's reaching pretentiousness levels only seen in spaces like the fashion industry, where every creative work is just a bunch of esoteric, metaphysical bullshit. I hope the current culture is rejected (ha) and we see future elite chefs creating traditional dishes that are just cooked to perfection, or have some crazy twists or whatever. None of this alien-looking molecular gastronomy nonsense.
Is anybody else wondering why the thumbnail for spooky was changed
Lo and behold, "how to make a pipe bomb" is at a recent high in search frequency.
Based.
Wasn’t expecting the cohost to change with every segment but I’m pleasantly surprised. It’s like the Infinity War of the IH-verse.
Nice video but did this video really took 3 months???
A kitchen is actually more like a kitchen.
Fantastic video as always, IH. All-star cast and every segment had me hootin' 'nd a-hollerin'. I look forward to the next one after carbon-14 has another half-life. ;)
Cool
Men who have never conducted an orchestra: "what I do is like conducting an orchestra"  As if that's easier to explain than cooking food or they somehow know what it's like to conduct an orchestra
more ManyKudos please!!!
You make THE best ads.  You could make a video that’s all ads.  I’d love it.
This just in, 'The Menu' was made exclusively from Incognito Mode outtakes
Is this demonized???
Comment
Psyched to see sumito lol
+1 comment
My wife is going to think it's a gift I've given her when she sees this share. Thank you!
Im never ben rejected
Can't lie I've been needing an incognito mode video almost as bad as I've needed an internet historian video
tall bastards...
Who else hat that voice from IH in mind whhen he speaks over scettino? Reejected
More JonTron! ♥
EEAAO is a decent film, but everyone sucking its fat clit should shut the fuck up about it. It's not that fresh of a concept, just a fairly good execution of it, and the only people who think Baby's First Multiverse-Induced Nihilism is really smart probably thought Rick & Morty was for real galaxy brains.
YAY lewis made it on !! more lewis !!
BARRY!
As someone who has had Hello Fresh for over a year, I can confidently tell you that almost none of the meals they send you actually take less than 20 mins unless you actually are a professional chef and can do all the prep super fast lol
I love dollar store mutahar
Quality as always
I'm confused... which video had Lewis in it?
Craigslist Hitman should be your next production venture...  Great Title, Subvert our expectations.
I assume this is a Hitler video.
Wtf is this. Why are you blessing us on multiple channels. What trickery is this?
What video is Lewis Spears from? I don't recognize it and can't seem to find it either :(
HelloFresh is a scam, you’re not actually gonna get those meals at that kind of price.  I would know, they advertise at my business.
The point about not being able to hear someone shorter when you’re tall is actually really true
Internet historian has become the thing I watch on repeat while im recovering from a hangover. Bravo sir.
56 seconds into this video and I’m already crying
Wow, I really got the wrong impression about Everything Everywhere All At Once. I haven't seen it, and everyone I know who has just says it's a slice of life movie about an Asian-American family. Figured it was a Joy Luck Club type movie. Never heard anyone talk about any twists or action or anything, so when Historian was talking about a spoiler I had to look it up and see what it was. This must be what it felt like to be one of the people who didn't bother to see Psycho because people they knew were following Hitchcock's request and not talking about the plot. I mean, I just figured it'd be a snoozefest.  Like how everyone was going on about how good Life of Pi was while giving very little in the way of detail, then when I saw it it was boring as hell.
What video is Lewis is tall from??
jontron went off hahahaha too funny
for a moment i thought it was a Mother Energy add... still pretty cool discount
Can confirm. I'm 6'5", not particularly attractive, but had decent luck dating because being super tall compensates for being ugly.
As a retarded man I use to sing lets get retarded all the time as a retarded child.
All that shit about being tall is absolutely true. I'm only 6'5" so I imagine it's even worse being that poor bastard
Lol got an ad for bourbon right after he said bourdon.
I can bet that Hello Fresh ad got rejected
If you’re gonna kill anybody…you should do it yourself
The kendall pepsi commercial is one of the few times the entire internet united to suppress ultimate cringe.
You think you can just TEASE US!!?…well you can and we’ll wait patiently..BUT YOUD BETTER THINK TWICE PAL
Finally another public mode audio
I think some method of philosopher stone need some soul
Did the video just end!?
Wtf, I thought I clicked on a Story Mode notification. It's just a small indie channel, can't believe how I thought for a second I was watching one of their video.
Thank fuck!
not the bees
If you were wondering. Photopea online is basically photoshop in a browser and I've been using it professionally for years. Its just as good, if not better.
Ledeledeledele
Bro Jontron's aussie voice was fucking brilliant
Great way of making sure cut content doesn't stay lost!
She hates those pictures so much she is going to put on a vest and
That bit at the end about the craigslist hitman being depressed and counting down how long he has until he needs to find the next job just hits too hard man... it's a vicious cycle...
2:35 who the heck is this? I haven’t seen one video with him.
What video was the tall dude in originally??
Was hoping to see the whole mother thing
IH posts 2 videos in one day? Who are you and what did you do with the real Internet Historian!?
I would never reject Internet Historian
Apparently I missed a video...
A Hitman 3 video is right below this on my YouTube feed lol
21:00 i watched it. I don’t know why everyone says it’s so good it’s actual dog water.
Thank you for giving us the bottom of the barrel clips, after making us wait months. Truly what I've come to expect from such a rejectable man
I wonder why high art talks itself up so much(Chefs, actual artist, etc)? Do they not realize how ridiculous and condescending they sound? Jus make me my $200 steak ffs, so I can waste another night out trying to get laid. Its not art, its a service.
Another masterpiece! BTW none of the links for featured list work fyi!
Excellent ad as always 😊
If a stranger does a punch game, play it back, but swing for their balls, or a shorter jab to the old Adams apple, they'll think twice next time they play that game with a stranger
I will never understand why so many women are obsessed with tall men, unless the woman is tall herself, why do these hobbits need to date giants?
The fact that this content was rejected and it's still funny as hell really shows  Historians level of quality!
Can't believe you got everyone back to re-record their line's good video.👏👏👏
Im 6ft 4 in but I don't get those kinds of looks so I guess I'm just ugly
These are always good.
Have you guys seen Barry? because Craigslist Hitman is pretty much the sparknotes of that show
And all the thumbnails in the thumbnail are ones with cut content? Well played, well played. I guess pepsi got pissed about you shitting on their ad lol
Can’t wait to hear the story of how Internet Historian got readily ejected (or “rejected” as the lads say)
Within the first minute of Rejected video we all got Jected in the Assassination.
This is actually an Avengers movie in disguise. It's the full lineup of almost every IH's guests in one video
Well holyshit...
Which video had this Louis Spears guy? I can't find it.
Two videos in one day! My emotional breakdown has been pushed back once again!
Wait there was an episode of in the field with Lewis Spears in it?
Did you take my director's cut idea?
5:26 I've been waiting for this one for all of one year
Remember when Samito was shilling for the jab lmao
That movie scenario is devastating
you really are out of ideas, huh?
Add a comment...
I hope older IH videos never get rejected. I want to watch them all in order and slowly watches his improvements.
Did nord vpn REJECT ih? Havent seen a nord ad in a while
Oh god he's back
4:32 whenever i was walking and holding hands with my ex boyfriend (6'6) i felt like i was holding my parents hands and was a little kid lol couldnt shake it
When new mainchannel video
hello fresh watching IH ad break: "dafuq is this?!? i love it, but dafuq is this?!?"
The title just makes me think: "My spoon is too big."
Y’all chinese
I can't be the only one to notice the time spent on ads vs. making a new Historian video. You're a filthy procrastinator.
I never thought I'd say this, but thanks dad
5:58 Can you even still do that? Adobe is quite adamant on their website that you can only get Photoshop with a subscription these days.
we are rejected!
20:38 ngl I see this as fair
Dude, you need to do a full episode with Lewis Spears
"Im going to need you to print another receipt I ate the bill" is a really understated joke for how they were literally serving dirt and shit so you didnt know what was to be eaten.
I hope internet historian does a video on the friendly jordies fire bombing situation that’d be awesome
Finally, another video I can rewatch 20 times over the course of the next 6 months while I wait for a new one.
Never expected Internet Historian Kitchen Reveal
I love it when companies remind creators that they have a contract. HELLO FRESH: you said you'd have a video out... IH: I guess I'll check the floor for usable scraps... no hate, just jollies. Oh, is that a new story mode? You really press their timelines huh?
You been working hard, 2 videos in just a couple of months..
So i can actually confirm this, you can google this stuff once or twice, its frequent searches that raise eyebrows
r(ejected) ඞ
You’re completely right about tall people hanging out. I’m 6’8” and have maybe one friend under 6’2”.
10 dollars for photoshop a month isnt bad
I reject the idea that you would make a new video. False and lies, why do you never make anything
that hello fresh ad did scare me because im 26 and have no food in the kitchen, honestly it just made me sad.
Wait, where is the original Lewis Spears in the field vid?  Never seen it.
Which episode had Lewis spears?
Damn, I thought this would be a video about the animation by Don Hertzfeldt
Bro finally uploaded
Yes! Time for my therapy session.
I'm an acceptable six foot tall and the height thing on girls really is a thing. However from what Ive experienced and talked about, its just about being 'substantially taller'. There are diminishing returns to height in that once theyre only up to your chest and they have to look up to you, there isnt much value in getting substantially taller. Knew a girl who was literally dick-height with her bf and at most it was a minor complaint for her in that most positions were hard to get to sexually.   I imagine being uber tall is still a bigger positive, but not as big of a step up as it should be given its rarity.
So weird hearing the bloke who I’d see while walking to tafe in Frankston in an internet historian video, going up in the world Lewis
It feels like years since the last video
Spot on observation on tall men gravitating towards one another. When out in public they travel in packs the way fat women travel in pods.
Please help reject the water from my lungs
I had to look up the significance of the ok sign and now I regret it
Nothing but gold
It's about time fellas; wouldn't miss it for all the cheese in wisconsin.
This is the Pulp Fiction of Internet Historian
Links in description are broken.
1:40 “how to make pipe bomb” good job gettin that past the 90 second mark, I see you IH
Thanks for getting me to learn more about pipe bombs
Omg guys, it’s a clips video. It’s a funny bits compilation video. We truly, are both blessed and unworthy.
I reject this guest you have (Ordinary Things), Internet Historian...
This show is great!
Ah yes, this will last us until the next upload in 2024 thank you daddy
Is it time for the biannual IH video already?
Where the hell have you been?
IH rejecting his guests one by one throughout the video
So re: the tall person gf fiasco- my boyfriend is stupidly tall, like- I'm 5'5", he's an entire foot taller than me, and at like... 14 he hit that height- wayyyy before we started dating.  Usually I can't sneak around him but there have been times when I *have* just straight up been forgotten about because he turns around and doesn't look down, so he loses me bc the top of my head doesn't hit his line of sight it's hilarious   I do get a taste (albeit a disappointing one) of that heights experience when I'm wearing obnoxiously tall platforms rm shoes, since my balance is scarily good, and it's always a huge deflated feeling when I take them off and go "oh right this is how things look when I'm 4 inches shorter 🥲😭" my heart goes out to tall people, you're doing fine
Get home from work to see a new Historian video= great day
Aiwa, lol. That was the brand of my first ever stereo system with 5 cd changer.
I love you Historian, but I've worked in kitchens all my life...if they run well, they are like an orchestra....shit happens VERY fast, and if shit goes wrong...it only goes one way...and it goes there fast!
You might like the movie the 'menu.'
I still can’t believe that Nord for Women ad got rejected. It was safe, empowering and really enticed me to buy NordVPN
finally a sponsor that knows the worth of monkey slave labour
17:30 is it just me or does this feel very similar to the a-train ad in the boys
I mean I was going through a IED course in the Marine Corps so I was googling a lot of the chemicals and different shit they could use to make them. Also you'd be surprised how many military publications on warfare are available that will teach ypu how to make a bomb and the best way to use it.
My best friend is 6'6 and I'm 5'9 and I love how he can make me feel small lol
Whit the infinity gauntlet, you would be able to hit on every men's wife at the same time.
“I Look at the Desert Menu as a Collection and Each Dessert should offer Something, so That’s why i put a human eyeball in here Because…It gives i kinda Tangy taste to this lemon  Spaghetto i think it Enhances the Experience”                      Every Ultra-Expensive Restaurant Ever,2023
Super expensive food on big plate and almost nothing on it. Did I pay for the plate as well?
like two days ago i sort of remembered the black eyed peas had first taken out *that* version of let's get it started and thought "... naah that must've been some internet meme or something, they couldn't have done that level of crap". well uhm damn
Outstanding.
Sam Hyde wrote a book titled  "How to Bomb the US Government"
Everytime he releases this type of videos I just imagine them next to a fire place in comfortable chairs chilling talking about random things
honestly, cosmetic surgery may end up being cheaper than buying Adobe...
I'm 6' 5". Release the tall episode with Lewis.
It’s funny how the more of these videos that get released we hear the most personal and embarrassing stories about IH and yet no one knows a thing about him
You know it’s a good ad when you see yourself smile through the black screen.
oh god theres another one now
Pretty good bits
Since when was there a lewis spears episode?
The crossover I never thought we’d see
I was literally just thinking about this, do you operate only on sneak attacks
The started bad but IH released a new video. Day saved.
What's better than an Incognito Mode video with one guest? An Incognito Mode Anthology. Well played, IH!
Accepted
thats a pretty fucked spoiler but dont worry that movie was garbage anyway, the most impactful and deep moments in the ENTIRE thing were the scenes with the rocks
Rejection... accepted.
I wonder what the deleted scenes for this video are like.
There better be a part 2 of these rejected clips.
What's rejected?  My love!  (Oooo... I'm sad.)  Ooooo!!!  New IH video!
Storymode and Incognito videos on the same day?   What a time to be alive.
That dude on the street was playing "Big O".
First thing I thought about when I saw rubedo was xenosaga and they actually landed on a Wikipedia page for the character lol
My dad is 7 feet tall. The whole airline thing is real. My dad is often moved from coach to 1st class free of charge because the 1st class seats are bigger and fit him better.
His ad reads are hilarious. He could probably make those for a living.. oh wait.
"I could buy a used Toyota for that!" ".....drive it through the door of Adobe" LOL
Oh fuck.
That's not really a Hello Fresh sponsorship.  It had to have been rejected, which is why it appears it this video.
me: "when are you going to make another main channel video"  Internet Historian:.....  "SHUT THE FCK UP SHUT THE FCK UP"
Ahhh yes... my old friend rejection, we meet again so soon
I'm only 6' but I should try the standing up thing
It’s a shame that Jon Troy clip never made it. That was probably the best one ever
Wait I’m genuinely curious as to why girls think a guy being 6ft + makes them more attractive? I don’t rly think abt height that much, I’m 5ft3in and as long as a they’re taller than me I’m fine, I’ve dated like 5ft6in guys, but I never understood why some girls require 6ft + ? I even had a friend tell me that even if a guy is not attractive or fun to be around, they still like him bc he’s tall…. but WHY ?? What’s all the hubbub ??
The only reason I remember the Pepsi ad is because it was in the beginning of the first ad-pocalypse and Pepsi pulled their ads out from youtube right after posting that.
Saw you in an email ad sent to me by my mum for a whisky subscription company thing, Craziest shit ever
This video has been injected into my brain
Felt like forever since I saw your last video, loving the content!
Vaguely on the topic of the philosopher's stone: in the rush to find a method of creating gold, one alchemist decided to try taking his pee (it's yellow, like gold see) and iirc boiled the hell out of it.  It started glowing.  Instead of making gold the madlaf boiled his pee and made Phosphorus, discovering a new element.
A new video means that winter is finally over
Imagine bringing out a song with the lyrics lets get retarded in 2023.
Wait a second. I just realized 5 minutes in. This ENTIRE video consists of rejected segments.   I know he said if at the beginning but I thought it was a joke to Segway into the topic of the video like usual
It's a clip show. It's just a lousy clip show.
I only watch your ads. They are great short stories.🤣🤣
Well its about time!
This dude needs a podcast. What an amazing cast of quick minded comedic geniuses (I had to look up how to spell geniuses.. in fact, I've had to look up how to spell genius for the last 30 years.. I'm 40 years old...) K bye.
Well, guess I better go search "How to hire a hitman"... If anything comes back on me I'm blaming you IH
Oh my god oh my god
As a short person, its nice to know that I can quickly turn a walk with a tall person into a stealth mission
Daddy is back. Please don't leave me again.
You have to put "in minecraft" at the end
Jecting off to this
internet historian and herstorian are definitely having a baby. you heard it here first.
Dunkin’ on Mary Orton, she taught me it was cool to keep hot rolling my hair.
Next do "Marge becomes a Robot"
REJECTED!! Not by the gods in heaven this is soothing the drug like addiction I have to your content
Anyone else recognize quay street in Galway when he was getting the ok and punch in the shoulder?
Holy shit, that craigslist hitman idea is literally gold, that'd make an incredible game.
Even your rejects are gold
That "OK" sign is apparently a white nationalism thing
Are you sure this video was sponsored by Hello Fresh, and not O.J. Simpson?
Historian! You need to watch "The Menu." Enjoy.
A blessing from the lord
I reject the rejected and reject the jected call me... jobin hood
I love the hello fresh promo not working for the Australian site
Finally, an episode about my love life
I quite like black eyes peas
Anyone remember when the black eyed peas were a legit good hip hop group? And then SHE happened.............
I pirated all of my Adobe products, and I feel no shame whatsoever
moar!
What do you think was said about everything everywhere all at once that could've spoiled it so bad?
video on april fools😂😂
Pro tip: Whenever some random do that to you on the street, you just yell "HEY GUYS THOSE DUDES ARE NAZI" and done.
What I searched for after this video. How to make a bomb. How to hire a hitman. How to kill my wife. How to hire a hitman to make a bomb to kill my wife.  Come at me NSA / FBA / CIA / KGB and whatever bullshit alphabet organization you're from.
Wasted an opportunity to offer 69% off Hello Fresh, IH.
2 vids in 13 hours? Very cash money of you
One time I saw Lewis Spears in a video and he was in a normal Kitchen and just seeing him inside made me realize he is genuinely freakishly tall.
damn I wanna kno what the guy said
So this was a video made of all the In The Field clips that didn’t make the main videos, huh?  Sweet.
He found his password again guys.
I’d totally play “Craigslist Hitman”! 😅
Money must be getting low... Internet Historian actually uploaded.
incredible video
I swear everytime I watch this man he uploads another banger
Orchestra, hm? Every chef is an abusive bully at work and an alcoholic at home because of stress...
Plot twist: Raycon and NordVPN rejected the chance to advertise for this episode of 'in the fieeeeeeld'
forgot he did a video with jontron. Had to skip it. 😒
And thus the work day was made even better, thanks Historian.
i would play the shit out of Craigslist Hitman
6:12 See this is why we just pirate Photoshop and After Effects. I've never paid a dime for any editing software, and I've been editing as a hobby since I was 12 (im 20 now) every version of SVP, AE and PS.
is this a clipshow
"how to make pipe bomb" had a large spike in searches just after this video came out.... A majority were from Aussie lmfao
HOLY SHIT LEWIS SPEARS
that cut jon clip was BRUTAL, but fucking HILARIOUS
What episode has the tall guy
PLEASE. Don’t die before me.
You and Sumito have insane chemistry, that Best Buy bit had me dying 😂
I would have so many questions, but you're so elusive man, that i doubt you would answer any of them.  Sometimes i wonder does your mom  even know what you look like.  Great content as always! 👍
I’m 6’5, when I see someone taller than me, I become suspicious that they are mocking me and my small stature. This makes me immediately aggressive and seek to fight them for dominance
Not me, a black woman, cackling about avoiding ' nigredo.' " Just in case."
The "OK" hand is a tricky thing. On the one hand, you don't want to be called a f** and punched in the arm. On the other, What if I REALLY did just drop my pocket, like the man said... And what if there really WAS candy in that white van?
Internet Historian, how hard did you try to make your code for HelloFresh end in 69?
Me. I'm rejected 😞😞😞😞
I’m 6’7” and can corroborate everything this man said.  Short people need to speak up. We cannot hear you.
"that looks good"  what mate?
Always a good day when IH posted even if it’s the bloopers which is an amazing idea
rentahitman is an excellent site 10/10 recommend buying some merch or sending a paypal gift. Don't try to hire them though, they report inquires to the appropriate authorities.
i love you sir 👁👄👁
A new vid on two channels in one day? God has answered my prayers
I guess I'll just drop whatever I'm doing to watch this
I'm going to use vague terms so youtube is less likely to youtube. My clone really likes your uploads and out of the blue today is like "can I watch the guy that says "Space is space?"" And lo and behold, new upload 20 minutes ago.  Nice timing my clone.
Wait. In what video was this lewis guy?
“What if we kissed in the rejected clips and I never posted it” while embracing Kudos just fit too well
brb im going to google "how to make pipe bomb"
HOLY FUCK HOLY FUCK HOLY FUCK
The adobe bit is the best satire I've ever seen
another thing about being tall, there is a lot of dust on top of everyone's fridge...
We have a new hero in the Universe: the freshman
It's so weird, every time I think that you haven't posted in a while you post a video. Am I God? Or just magical? A magical God?
Show us the full Mother discussion, you monsters!
Did I miss something?  I don’t recall an episode with Lewis (unless it’s one still in the works)
Aww, shame IH had to get spoiled by Everything Everywhere all at Once :(  Such a great movie. Would definitely recommend. And such a good palette cleanser too after watching Multiverse of Madness.
Philosopher stone is the average American
I'm 6'4 I have one tall group of friends and 1 below average height friends
I wouldnt want to make a bomb by accident
You're like an absentee father who shows up randomly to take us to a theme park with two videos in a day, then disappear for six months.
Sumito is a very good salesman, he almost got me to believe 2500 was at all a reasonable price.
I just imagine the executives at the ad agency reviewing your script, destroying an 8-ball of coke, breaking the desk with their head, staring over at Historian and whispering gingerly, "rejected".
Being told about the bagel before the movie even started would have made me buy a gun...
[Rejected]
Craigslist Hitman will be on Steam in 2 months.
just googled how to make a pipe bomb, if I get arrested I blame you :)
That was the best hello fresh ad.
Oh boy another video in my lifetime? Hot diggity dog!
That sounds like a great game.
Thank you for the new video!
Finally, a video about me.
please bring back the 360 degree meme
So you are telling me this isn’t a video about Netflix cancelling shows?
Ah, the 28th eh?  Hit the deadline for the ad contract?
We are getting absolutely spoiled with a double dose of IH
Oh gross. Johntron is in this one
I'm curious what description of a that movie could instantly spoil it. That would also be a kind of movie that is coming out a lot lately.... desperate to know actually.
lol adobe, I just use gimp, and it costs $0 and gets the job done.
Hopefully that was the last episode with that lame jontron
Omg yes!!! The best way to end my day! With rejected clips from in the field
To be fair, I knew the dog died in Marley and Me the instant I first saw the cover of the book.
Where on earth is the Lewis episode? Is this one that's gonna come out?
I love you IH
"I'm on a break."  lol
Even the factory floor sweepins are on a schedule. More, please, sir.
These were all gold
You helped me photoshop my tits and now I'm trending on Craigslist. Thank you so much!
Man, I just absolutely enjoy this channel.
What’s the episode with the guy from Ididathing? Was that whole episode rejected??
LEWIS FUCKING SPEARS!! I never thought I'd see the day where he would pop up on a damn incognito mode video
It took me the whole video to realize these were convos that didnt make the original videos. I was so cinfused the entire time.
do you think they pay him more because he does such amazing sponsorship ads?
I swear if you're not being paid extra for these masterpiece ads, the sponsors need to have their brains fixed.
Missed opportunity to just run 20 mins worth of ads being passed off as unused content
Honestly, shoulda filed a complaint to the manager for that spoiler. That was a dick move
Accccccepted
How can they censor the historian of the internet
I don’t recognize the clips with Lewis Spears. Can anyone point me to that video?
I would complain so hard if my ticket guy spoiled the movie I was about to watch... Maybe self service stations aren't all doom and gloom
If a person working at the theater spoils the movie for you, just call the manager and ask for a refund, tell them their employee ruined the experience for you. If you play your cards right, you get to watch the movie for free.
I literally scream when I saw that you uploaded a video. Omg ty so much
Mf when they realize your channels gonna die if you don’t post videos
Pipe bombs stocks in the green rn.
Amazing, love the content. Sadly i need  more cause I've binge watched all your other channels videos as well 😅
CODE DONT WORK
5:00 ending it all.
Reject society embrace internet historian incognito mode videos
Great timing, I was just rejected by a job today.
WHAAAA??? Has it been 6 months already!?!
He rejected each of his guests, that's [redacted]!
The google trends data for that thing that uses plumbing stuff is already going up.
A new Incognito AND Storytime video??? Is it Christmas already?
Use the dollar sign and you're on a list. No joke. The criteria really only excludes the word "the". Everything else is suspicious out of context.
I'm having the worst couple weeks. Currently stuck in the rain with a flat and a broken jack. This still made me smile just seeing it's up. Thanks bro.
This is the video we need in the time of YouTube shenanigans
21:15 amc rainbow promenade 10 in Las Vegas
My spoon is too big
she turns 360 degree and walks away - future german politician
What perfect timing! A video on rejection after being rejected from too many bloody job applications that demand four years of experience!
Jon Tron good to see you
Normally I hate when foreigners mess with the US, but messing with the NSA? Go ahead!
The rejected stuff is funnier than the released stuff, what a tragedy
soz, i reject hello fresh
oh shit!  Incognito mode at 6 PM on a Tuesday.
Sumito's "I'm on break" gets me every single time.
The week is saved
also must say as a tall person, bending your legs more and completely fucking up your spine so you can actually see the people you are talking to is not the best solution either. Works for me though I mean back pain is fiiiiiiiiiiiiine
I can't wait for rejected rejected
Hell yeah!!!
Internet historian is 5'3 . You cannot prove hes not. He cannot prove hes not. Hes 5' 3
"Sometimes you just lose track of short girls."
missed you bb. xxoo
I can't believe you got the cartoon Bennepen Conderstronch on your channel.
Honey the new incognito historian video dropped!
Bro got got by the circle game by a total stranger and now wants to shoot his friends lol.
As someone who's 5'5, it makes me sad all these tall guys won't ever be able to live in a Hobbit hole
Reject more like Reject-On
Even this mess was entertaining
I knew there was more to the "I'm on break statement. And Jesus that statement of your soul seeing the rise to the moon, simply lmaooo
I remember when I was rejected in 1979, and followed her wherever she went for 11 years. (I'm such a nice guy)
5:38 has me dead 😂
props to guy who punched the Internets Historian  lul
4:35 Man, I've never felt so represented in a video, as a 6'5"/2m guy this rings so true, i mean there are times where i even go "this can't be right" but even when this idea leaves my awareness eventually another woman's body language will confirm this. Also another thing i notice in public is that they like standing close to me(in trains/bus stops etc), I've been told by women that they like "feeling the height difference" that it feels "dominating", had a female friend literally ask me to height mog her "for fun" when we were teenagers. Life's a mixed bag though and attracting women was a double-edged sword that wound up with me getting molested before my balls dropped by sexually aggressive females that thought i was up for it, ages were me being 10 the first time 12 the second and 13 the third, having a late puberty didn't help either, and with a middle-school allowing people that had failed classes to stay up to their 18th birthday i had a 17 year old legit trying to force herself so hard to the point of leaving trauma that led me to associate sexuality with generally fearful and disgust responses, needless to say despite getting good chances with girls later once my balls dropped i just couldn't function in that way, eventually having to undergo therapy for this(along some other issues). Ultimately, be grateful of what you have, being tall also made me a target, once i moved to a small town due to the female attention i was getting many of the other boys tried to knock me down a peg by pretty scummy methods after pretending to be friendly upfront, also usually when you are the biggest guy in the group you are the one everyone counts on for when things go south, having also grown in a rough area of the city initially didn't help since it sort of instilled the physical resolution to conflicts, and thing is when the guys you go up against all assume they can't take you this is when you have knives pulled on you right as you turn 12, worst thing being that the idea of calling help from parents or the cops never ever crossing my mind and still trying to deal with those situations on my own. Dunno why i felt to share all this, i guess since i didn't want this to just be a brag-post i thought I'd also add how being tall also kinda backfired by drawing negative attention, or envy (one might call it).
Oh great a video about my dating life.
This reminds me of a time I was rejected
Hello Fresh ads. You should’ve gone with “Fresh Man” and it’ll just be 1 year College student.
unironically, that Craigslist Hitman video game idea sounds bloody smashing
I can’t believe he made an episode of B-roll, and it’s still good
How... HOW was that hello fresh ad rejected. That was literal gold!
The first thing i saw in the thumbnail is  "Rejected" and "Art" it scared the shit out of me
Should've never jected this
Good timing space cowboy
This is suxh a coincidence
21:56 Don't feed the gremlins
Even in low end kitchens so many chefs and cooks have their heads shoved firmly up their own ass. If you want to experience unbelievable levels up cringe look up 'chef tattoos' 50% of chefs actually think they are pirates.
nice
4:12 I always think this. When I see another tall person I'm always like "wow what a weirdo" and then realize we're the same height
Why was the movie spoiler one rejected? That one sounds absolutely hilarious. Not to encourage that kind of behaviour or smth is it?
Home improvement aaooou
This is a nice coincidence, I checked the channel for a new upload a few hours ago and was a bit disappointed. Fantastic timing!
Holy shit Lewis spears 😀 very pog
bro that Windows disconnecting sound at the beginning got me spooked for a second
Whaaaat 2 videos in one day why have you blessed us with this?
Out of all the Youtuber ad's IH does them the best!
I am of the philosophy that if a spoiler ruins a movie then it wasn’t a good movie. A good movie can be enjoyed even when you know what’s going to happen. I do think everything everywhere was good enough that spoilers wouldn’t have bothered me.  However, I do understand why people dislike spoilers, and I avoid giving spoilers. I just think people put too much emphasis on spoilers.
Heads up, the channel links in the description are a tad fucked, just thought you’d want to know.
17:04 Dudes... just... no. Don't say that. Even if you're quoting something, at least bleep it out. You refused to say a word that even sounded like a slur, but now you're contradicting that by just saying a slur outright.
I had a bad day but this made me laugh and I’m happy for that
As a tall person My Best friend is short and we make a Lot dwarf jokes
Don’t worry, I saw the trailers for EEAAO and it was still one of my favorite movies of all time.
I always Ject for NORD VPN!!!
Is the Lewis Spears video down?
You can tell the protest was fake because it wasn't 90% green haired obese unemployed 20 year olds.
How I have missed this
Turning 360 degrees makes him walk faster towards the guy in the bathroom line. Brb, googling things to fiddle with analytics
"So I go to the cinema with Herstory..." Usually YTers just call their girlfriends/wives Miss/Mrs [the guy's YTer name], but I guess Internet Historian has the option to use Internet Herstorian.
Does that mean this isn't rejected?
My man has finally arrived
god these were all such good bits i especially love all the sumito ones, you gotta do more with him man
IH, you gotta tell us if hellofresh is part of the IH CinemAd-ic Universe cause Freshman just aint hittin the same as Nordman or Shadowman
Dear Historian, did you ever thought of the possibility of making a video with the "I did a thing" dude?
I can only read the title of this video as Randy Feltface saying "rrrejected" to that one dude at his show that said his biggest fear was rejection
lmfao. fantastic.
Why bother to make a new video when you can just pull bits and pieces from old ones? IH=eco-conscious recycler confirmed
I feel so god damn bad about that last expereince just from hearing that.
I see what you did with that ending and without spoiling it I can say... clever girl.
woo
An upload on both side channels in the same day?! That means there's gonna be an upload for the main channel next, right Historian?   ...Historian?
New video idea: i hire a hitman on craigslist so you don't have to
We sell Heston Blumenthal equipment where I work and it’s the most overrated trash.
And out of nowhere a wild Buttsmarn appears! Lol
Incog Mode has massive pea-nis and is full of ingognito's.
Kamala Harris' brain REJECTED
Imagine asking to be IH's sponsor and he agrees. Nordvpn must be a jealous ex right now.
Giving yourself a 6 is extremely generous
Woohoo new sponsor
As a tall freakish human myself, Lewis' jokes had me dying.
Fun Fact: often writers have to google certain things in order to explain/understand them in their stories, ie: googling how bombs are made or how long it takes to die from something
very nice
A can of pepsi can extinguish a burning building.  That would have been more relevant.
Well great now I really wanna play Craigslist Hitman
I was contributing to the "How to make pipebomb" trend, and now the FBI are knocking on my door what do I do help
Adding "fassile" to my dictionary
9:24 anyone else recognised this guy immediately from a previous in the field?
4:15 LITERALLY THIS. This happens in Japan a lot because I’m 183cm and then I’ll see someone towering above everyone else and think “wow they’re INSANELY tall” but then they walk past me and I’m still significantly taller
these videos are absolutely lovely.  internet historian, you are the gift that keeps on giving
As always, thanks 🙏
Hello fresh, I’m dad 😂
i love all of this
we need the cut content episode every 3 or 4 in the fields to tide us over during the dry times. storytime helps tide me over but i need in the field.
Never in my life would I have expected 2 IH uploads in a 24 hour period. It almost feels ominous
Had the same thing happen to me at the movies.  I had avoided everything about the Batman vs Superman movie.  Went to get my tickets and the dude said something about Doomsday.  Bro
Please don’t cancel
This is top Fucking tier content and I’m never disappointed
Even your cutting room scraps are the funniest thing this platform have to offer lol
Booo, booo jontron booo
I reject this video's rejection. I'm a rejectarian.
15:37 Jon's a gifted comedian
NOOOOOOOO EVERY GOD DAMN TIME.
I’ll never reject you from my heart ❤❤❤
Incognito is already so good that a compilation of rejected clips is only 20 minutes long
So we dont need humans for a philosopher's stone? Oops...
IH and OT is my fav pair ❤
Looking forward to the Hello Freshman Cinematic Universe!
I'm here for the ads.
Rejected for being TOO GOOD
If you don't want a mo ie spoiled then just become deaf duhhh
i rejected a guy and he told me i fucking sucked
These were rejects? But they're great. IH and Sumito is always comedy gold.
This one almost slipped me by, nice try youtube algorithm
thanks dad
I've worked in high end cuisine. I'd say it is like an army, but not an orchestra. Working in kitchens like that is the closest thing to being at war without risk of dying. Cutting and burning, ya. But rarely death. Very rarely.
13:59 Couldn't stop thinking about Xenosaga during this part and it turns out Wikipedia agrees with me
I got second-hand cringe from that movie theatre story :(
As someone who is also very tall, this hit hard
I'm starting to think this guy isn't a real historian
Wait did my man really just post high quality whole new video with 10 special guests and try to pass it off as rejects from previous episode? Im on to you mr. Historian
finally
sinep is historian spelled backwards
"I'm on break" Sumito knows his shit
4:52 - Paging Dr. Freud.
my sadness was rejected after witnessing IH, Ordinary Things and SumitoMedia in 1 video
People who can't handle Taco Bell have a weak bloodline and will be forgotten by history.
The "The Boys" parody of the Pepsi comercial is a masterpiece
The Menu is a good movie to watch for all you foodies out there.
Can you label what the original videos these came from are? I find them less funny without the context of why you brought up each topic.
There really are a lot of multiverse movies coming out nowadays.
Tbh I don't think EEAAO could be ruined by a spoiler, it's just a cool emotional experience overall.
Today is a good day
my anus is bleeding?
Glad to see IH supports monkey labour. The animals have been free loading for too long.
LETS GOOOOO
What an assortment of co-hosts.
Going through the college process and can’t wait to be rejected
I googled "how to make pipe bomb" for your stats.
I hate your work ethic.
I'm glad I can finally get my Historian fix, been too long.
where are the other videos that were featured here?
Oh I would have been livid at the movie ticket guy. This is why I use the kiosks.
two videos from Internet Historian in one day??!
Wait..So is the Hello Fresh ad part of the video or a rejected bit?
Honestly the greatest ad's I've ever seen. Never have I ever in all the ads I've seen been willing to try Hello Fresh until now. I'm terrified of an empty fridge.
This is the only channel that I don’t skip the ads 😂
Mans used the extra footage that didn't make the cut, mashed it together and ran some ads.  I'm here for it.
I saw the word rejected and then the art thumbnail first. Had me worried for a second
Who the hell is Lewis
When's the full 9 hour cut of My Immortal dropping?
Funny thing about tall people is they gotta get an extra big casket when they die.  Now they’re family has to pay way more for their funeral.
That's the best Hello Fresh ad of all time...
It's been 54 years
Food... water.... IH uplooooad!!
Finalleeehhhhh we have been blessed
It was an absolute pleasure to be rejected by a man of such prestige
Why is Story mode missing so many videos?? I loved frog detective T_T
When is ih going to have the entire audience on incognito mode. It'll be like times person of the year 2006, but answers will be typed out by twitch chat.
Meh
Lewys Spears 🔥
I can't wait for the sequel, Unjected
But who’s the tall guy? Did I miss an ITF?
Whoa, guess who decided to leave his cave
I made huge savings by just using code INCOGNITO100 to get 100% off! Thanks Fresh man!
Hasn’t missed tet
These are the rules for the OK game I learned -see OK sign, you can punch, but you have three seconds to wipe the punch off -if you don’t wipe off the punch, they get to hit you back (same wipe rule applies for this) -OK sign must be below the neck -you can reflect an OK sign if you “shield” the OK by doing a sorta one handed binoculars over your eyes with your hand when you look at the sign. If you reflect, you get to punch them -you can also use an open OK sign with the index  and thumb not touching. If you look at an open sign, you get to punch them -if you reflect the open sign, they get to punch you
man i want to see more of lewis spears, a good comedian.
Damn ih rolling out the deleted scenes now
I still will never reject another hilarious episode of in the field
this was rejected?   i'm appauled.
Welcome back internet historian old friend.
21:20 I've experienced this when I went to watch fast and furious 9 with my FAMILY, when my mom put on one of her favorite podcasts on the drive to the theater and they spoiled one of the only funny parts of the movie.  It made the scene less fun to watch and spoiled a major plot point ( not that the fast and furious movies have any important plot points.)
I like to light a few candles and dim the lights before I enjoy a little incognito mode.
New ARG
As a tall person, Jetstar is a punishment unfit for human kind
I reject this rejection
Nice
craigslist hitman could actually be a pretty badass immersive sim
Let’s be inclusive boys. Hitwoman and hitthey/them
...I think I just got sold photoshop and also a 12 month subscription to Adobe acrobat what the fuck??
AH SHIT NEW IH DROPPED PACKING HEAT 🔥🔥🔥
It stresses me to no end to hear them using the stupid imperial system when talking about heights.
7:40 i know that song
Nice 360° reference lol people are dumber these days
I skipped work because I’m sick today. Thank you for this amazing video to start the day.
I have given up on life guys, i can't be bothered to create another spam email to get these subscription promos.   I've only created 2 so far
That movie theater guy is such an asshole. He WORKS there! What the hell man!!!
Best of luck to her
Holy shit bring us more Lewis he's a legend.
15:30 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣
Seriously....please can we get "How to make a pipebomb" trending on Twitter?  I think the response to this would be hilarious.
What a terrible movie clerk, how dare he spoil something
this was a great video. hope more clips gets rejected so we can get a part 2!
21:00 you can skip 'everything everywhere...' it's essentially the jesus story, but without jesus. "if nothing matters, everything matters."
[REDACTED]
Jokes on you I'm already on the list.
NO FUCKING WAY there's more to the "adobe roleplay bit" !!!
Tall people can see things some people never think to check. Going to a Hotel for instance anywhere too high for an average person to clean regularly like if its got a kitchen in it, the top of the fridge is almost never clean
Stop being fucking hilarious and upload a lot more, you fucker!
The links are not working =/
Wait, what video is lewis in?
I just love the intro every time 😂
As soon as I saw IH follow up rejected with assassination, I knew this one would be a classic
The exact second this video released I got a rejection letter from a job that has strung me along since Jan 1st... Uncanny how IH is always there when I need it
The logical resolution to being accosted by ruffians in the marketplace is to arm yourself and hurt your own crew; if only Tybalt and/or Benvolio did this in Romeo and Juliet we could have been spared some peace in the streets of fair Verona.
i luvvvvv
This feken guy had the best Ads on YouTube.
Time to google how to make a pipebomb and white house location at the same time
this video was a wild card, what are the connections to rejection
goddamn rubedos
I can definitely see why the JonTron clip was rejected...
I immediately searched that ... 1:40
Damn the Lewis Spears cameo was a surprise, but a welcome one
My rejection sensitivity is not pleased about this rejection I choose to reject
Thanks IH, I just searched "how to hire hitman" because you told me to.
****** (marley and me spoilers ahead!!!!)        THE DOG DIES IN MARLEY AND ME?!!!!
IH did an In The Field with Lewis Spears??
0:17 Harrier Du Bois from the hit game Disco Elysium moment
Thanks IH, for the cool word "facile." I will now never use it BUT know what it means, and I instead will say "that's wanker," which you also taught me.
wth i just rewatchgd cost of concordian like 20 minutes ago
Ooo a new video, nice way to wind down after a long day
Despite being released after weapons, this trully belongs before, for the sake of narrative flow.
it took me a couple of segments into the video to finally realize why the co-host keeps changing. these are rejects, from past videos.
Craigslist hitman actually sounds so good !  A hitman game focusing on the "in-between parts" of the hit like buying hammers and shit from Tesco would be amazing!
A murder for hire game in the style of Weed Shop 3 would be amazing
Glad to se IH shares my views regarding monkey slave labor.
It's 2 am but I don't need sleep when I can get me some incognito mode
*starts video* "Rejected" *video goes black and buffers for a solid 30 seconds* "Rejected"
Love the channel, keep up the killer work!
Two new videos!
Cool
Is this the episode where Historian's anus is bleeding?
FreshNordHelloVPN Legends
I cant stop thinking about a stone being shoved up my ass
That ok-game was called the asshole game by everyone I knew.
2:58 Wow, as a 6'6" man whose best mate is 6'4", I never thought about that before.
Alright everyone let’s go Google how to make a pipe bomb, enlist to join the list my brothers.
IH and the team need to "add more wank to it" in these videos.
Reject an incognito video, never.
Historian is probably the only channel that have rejected clips that is still fun to watch
I don’t when I noticed that In The Field videos start with the same format, but I throughly enjoy it
As someone 6 foot 7 or 8 myself (depends on the day and the shoes), I am so glad I'm not an inch taller as the top of my head brushes on the average door frame if I was any taller I would be smashing into every door frame as I forget to stoop. I once smashed my forhead into a low hanging ceiling fan on max speed, that was over 10 years ago and I still feel the pain sometimes.
Literally, copy-pasting nft's is the best. if they don't try to enforce the copyright, it will default to public domain. It's great. Just by copy-pasting, you can force them to spend tends of thousands of dollars in a copyright lawsuit.
I literally had to pause to wait and finish laughing after that joke about the kid's spirit going to heaven will their NFT went to the moon
BEST… FUCKING… ADS
I liked this a lot
Always nice to see Stede and Pell in the same video again
Thankfully I search with incognito mode. No one knows about my Craiglist bomb-making Hitman
Story time and incognito mode uploads in one day? Boy oh boy
I thought this channel was already made for the ideas for the main channel that were rejected.  Yeah, don't think I forgot about that, IH.
I actually used hellofresh for a bit. not bad. I suck at cooking but not bad.
"Do you have any idea who I am!? Because I don't. Please help, will you be my mom?" Not even a minute into the video and we already have a very underrated piece of comedy.
why was I rejected on valentines day?? will this video explained?
Always worth a watch. Puro 956 ALV
So, this is like when sitcoms used to do cheap clip shows when they were contractually obliged to make a new show but really just wanted to sleep in and jerk off all day.
Y'know I was just wondering when the next IH vid would drop, your vids never fail to brighten my day!
A Gourmet Restaurant kitchen is most definitely like an orchestra!  We got the preps getting the ordered food ingredients to hand off to the particular chef but also multiple chefs and line cooks come together to make a meal happen.  It's all timing too just like music so everything comes out when it should. It's art.
This is some tasty stuff lad
I got halfway through the video and didn't realize this was just, like, rejected clips and not a whole video with multiple guests on the theme of rejection
I think I remember IH talking about the movie spoiler on twitter at some point, lol. Also, is the episode with Lewis something upcoming or is it something that's been scrapped entirely? (Or have I just missed it somehow?)
Omg your still alive old man
I knew it was a sumito clip as soon as i saw “Alternate Adobe”
One of these days, Internet Historian and friend will talk about how crazy dinosaurs are and we'll all love it!
“Bc I cry while I cut” lol 10:14
Main channel????????????¿¿
Great stuff, always love a new video from this channel wish youd post more
This channel is like modern philosophy. Makes me ponder about lots of things.
Wow
A story mode and an incognito video all in the same day!!!!
The "I'm tall" cheat code world be very cool. I think it only works for dudes. Or does it?
Honestly that is the best Hello Fresh ad I've ever seen
Which in the field was the one at 2:16 with the tall ah dude, I’ve watched them all and I don’t remember that one
What do you mean the intro didnt feature any guns??
There's got to already be a asset flip cheapo Craigslist Hitman game that's just a kids first time designing a thief/hitman game
$30/month isn't that bad  I use a software at work that's about $1/min.
Myyyy gosh this made my day !!! Thank you!
10:53  saffron is the equivalent of eating a specific flower's dick, btw.  And it's not as hard to grow as you'd think, considering the price.
Ello mates
I'd love to support but just ended my Hello Fresh :( after around 2 years it just got repetitive and not enough meals. Plus as a solo it got quite boring. Maybe with 2 in the house it would feel different?
Fuck, that HELLO FRESH ad was legit
I've never been this early
I hated "everything everywhere all at once" the story doesnt even remotely hold and they try to hide it,,, fucking pathetic. 1 Anus out of 5 Oranges.  I get the sense people watch a movie and they dont understand it they just give it amazing reviews to not sound stupid.
Good idea making your character the same height as Lewis, IH. I'm sure you are just as tall as him.
Haven’t been rejected this hard since yesterday
Maybe that's why so many people get their appendix removed: That's where you Install the Philosophers Stone 🪨
It almost looked like a briefcase full of condoms with his face on it fell out for a second lol 🤣 Now that would have been embarrassing lol 😆
Also, how do you manage 1.8k likes and 0 dislikes?
I heard this was made by the guy who did those Poptart commercials
i love it when internet historian slips the entirety of a good youtube video into the rejected folder
The fact that you refuse to remove the watermarks from your stock images... that's what makes this channel more art than reporting. There's a lot to unpack.
You know what you're doing. I don't know what you're doing, but *you* know what you're doing, and I love it.
The last story, about Everything Everywhere All At Once, that's just an insanely big "Oopsie" on the cashier's part. In fairness, it does seem like one of those times he realized his mistake the instant he said it, but still. "Don't spoil the hot new movie" has to be, like, rule number 4 of working at a movie theater.
Ah yes, my daily in take of IH content 😊
sorry college essay you're gonna have to wait, there's a new incognito mode out
Before I watched I thought "Hm, this is a bad idea, putting all of your rejected segments in a video it's gonna be a bad video" BUT MAN WAS I WRONG this is hilarious, don't know how that didn't got in the videos!
His Okay Sign story reminds me of them time a strange girl slapped my ass really hard in public for no reason
What, no gun joke in the opening segment? Can't believe IH is all washed up...  (jk, love your stuff man)
If the channel is incognito shouldn't IH use a different avatar?
I was just prepping myself to hear him say he didn't like Everything, everywhere, all at once.  Like, that would be devastating lmao
Internet historian has been rejected many times I’m guessing.
That Hello Fresh ad has every modern horror movie trailer trope you can imagine. Amazing.
Everything else JonTron said was too spicy, he only gets one segment
I just googled how to hire a hit man. I'm now on a list. I hope you're happy
I thought I had to buy the dvd to get the deleted scenes, what a lad this guy.
14:10 So like... obsidian/coal for black, chalk/salt for white, sulphur is naturally yellow and last is a Ruby for red? Just a funny guess.
The food isn't for Historian, it's actually for the guests he keeps in the basement, it's obviously because Hello Fresh is cheaper than buying grocery, saves you time, you don't have to go outside anymore and you can even use code INCOGNITOMODE65 to get 65% off
Is like an orchestra in after effects with the pirated version of office
That guy looking like a minecraft head is one of the sickest burns I've ever heard
IH's story of being in public with the shoulder punch reminds me when someone growled at me telling me they would eat me in my sleep at my community college.
yay!!!!! <3
God, I wish Adobe was still $30 a month
commenting before ive seen the video, cause ive never seen one this soon after uploading
the ending rollcall where everyone closes with their goodbye was cute
Weird question, but was the ad also a reject that you repurposed for the video, or is that just... the ad of the day?
so, what is that big spoiler in everything everywhere all at once ?
hi
Huh? 2500? No, Photoshop is free. Says it right there, Photoshop 2015 Crack Torrent.
Grab a big hand full of that seaweed and throw it in the trash, because that crap aint food!
Nice to see that you didn't rejected your other channels.
2 videos in 1 day. This mad lads on a roll
The subscription scam is the worst thing to ever happen. Pay monthly for a piece of software that you will never own and if you ever end your subscription you can no longer open your old projects. Davinci resolve is $300 to won and you get free upgrades for life. It has the BEST color correction in the industry and the rest of it it pretty damn cool too.
Speaking of non-sequiturs, I had a dream about being a failed author that kept getting books rejected for the whole dream, and the first minute of this video unlocked that core memory. Welcome back?
To be jected again
I’m only 6’6”, so maybe there’s something magical about those 2 inches, but I have never had an airline give a single fuck when I request a better seat, and I think the attractiveness thing with women is completely overhyped. But, maybe it’s a case by case basis, good for him.
Finally some good content.
Man, I feel for the internet historian with having everything everywhere all at once spoiled. Was a dick move by the cinema attendant to talk about a movie they know you are about to go watch.  I'm pretty sure I can guess exactly what they said and what the other movie mentioned was. It's not like the Usual Suspects level bad a spoiler but it would definitely have taken away some of the magic.
It's either 2 videos in one month or one video in 6 months never in between. 2 videos a month from now on please.
Am I crazy? Where is there a Lewis Spears incognito mode?
I reject the dislike button, only like in your future
Great vid
He's still alive!!!
Jected video
I reject this rejection by pressing the like button
Damn rejected culture at it again!
5 star?
Looking up tails gets you put on a list.
hope the lewis spears video gets released in full one day
Oh wow I love Don Hertzfeldt
I feel rejected that I wasn't allowed to see These clips sooner.
I'll reject you only uploading every few months
WAIT WHEN WAS THE LEWIS EPISODE?
19:49 is literally a street in my home city wtf
CUTTING ROOM FLOOR
Rejected
LEWIS from the funny vaccine rally!! What a treat
Bruh 2 videos in a day?? My birthdays come early boys!
“The worst he can do is reject you and say no.” -people talking about asking Internet Historian for a consistent upload schedule, before having an entire video dedicated to them
Watching IH is like an addiction. I am constantly in relapse and he is not giving me my prescription.
Guys we should definitely not search and put in the comments *Hitman for hire* and *how to make a bomb*
At this point we would eat up any scraps that IH produces
Abortion rejected me😕
why do all of Internet Historian's Ad characters look like they are in the KKK
Bro was actually spittin about seeing other tall people in the wild. I'm 6'5 and I'll be walking through the halls and see some absurdly tall dude and just think to myself "Wow that dude is freakishly tall bro that must be tough." and then as I get closer and closer I realize that I'm actually taller.
What's a better way of disposing your dead wife's body other than blowing it up using a pipe bomb you learned how to make online
Yippee!
“Murder 4 Hire” sounds like a 90’s boy band
13:37😂
1:40 IH plays Hotline Miami
NOOOOOOO IF YOU REJECT ME YOU WONT GET YOUR FRESH FOOD DELIVERY
Woo hoo! Incognito mode! Just made my day!
Never have I felt a moment quite as thrilling as the IH's Hello Fresh ad as I myself am making a hello fresh meal
2:32 Who's Lewis and what video was he in?
Whenever you upload I watch it twice immediately because due to the phizer jab I now have alzheimers
I will never feel rejected as long as I can get my annual dose of IH. BTW tell ordinary things that his comic " cesspool" is fantastic! Just finished reading!
I love this channel. It's the format for me
I rejected my family for this video
first
YES!  A new Internet Historian video!  *unzips pants*
I missed him so much
You laugh, but I guarantee that google search result for building a pipe bomb will have a small spike in the aftermath of this video being released 😂
My cats been just got struck by a car but IH posted 2 videos today so it’s not that bad
Fucking lost it at “Let’s Get Retarded”
Sometimes you just lose track of short girls holy f'ing kek
i went to the other channel wondering when you will upload this is a treat thank you <3
You know you’ve watched to much Incognito Mode when you know which video each clip is from.
After Taco Bell and Starbucks he would not have been clenching for much longer....
Omg yessss!!! It's so shiny and new!
I rejected the video I was watching to click on this one. Also the people in the room I was with at the time.
its looks good no it dose not its looks like a pile of dirt and stick something that a vegan would eat  10:34
1:35 i looked it up and there is actually a link "to hire a hitman" cant believe google allowed it XD(100%not a scam or a virus btw)
I love it when my favorite content creator eggs me on to look up pipe bomb recipes
Trying to cope with something today are we?
YouTube has ruined YouTube
Thank You Brother.
Sumito is actually my favorite co-op, but unfortunately I'm a white supreme, so I gotta vote JohnTron Nr. 1.
Googling "How to make pipe bomb" rn
*Googles how to make pipe bomb*
I work in a Michelin-starred restaurant and you're right about most of them. They're more interested in trying to copy Noma and Alinea and seem super artsy, than they are in making really great food. Only a few restaurants are really cutting edge.
More Please.
Full Lewis Spears upload when? 👀
Might as well make the next video just titled              .
oh it's a video about my love life
Does this mashup or rejected clips signify that he’s finally run out of ideas?
Love your ads lol
30 mins, 39K views 500 comments. Amazing.
Seriously, why the fuck are adobe's plans so crazy expensive? Like, I just wanted to make a couple edit videos, but now I'm stuck with software I can't even use...
Ngl, thought he was about to say "do you know how many kids in Africa I can buy with that sort of money."
I’ve never clicked on a video so fast!!
Man! You just make the best ad-reads in the world IH! Sometimes, I wish the ads where longer! Have you considered maybe making a movie in the same format? Or maybe a series?  Like a twisted, stock-photo version of South Park or something=)
i woke my family to tell them if this joyous occasion. they all punched me and went back to sleep
Spears!
my dad tried to get his wife killed. pussy. def on a list
No one buys photoshop.    People go the high seas.
finally a video i can relate to
Turns out they are all slurs 😂😂😭
I love you
yippeee
“How to make pipe bomb” trend on google analytics? Say no more boss
I love that this is essentially a greatest hits of guest hosts.
Who's that Australian guy? Is this the first time he's been in a video
im pogging so hard rn rn(right now)
Not the rejected folder 😭
Two videos in one day? On a TUESday, no less? He's toying with us- I bet they've got a pile of videos 10 feet tall at the IH offices, and this is all just some sick game to them. I'm onto you.
hi
I knew there was a reason goog god lagged me out of cat videos and still didn't want me to go to bed.... Here are be
You rang?
I assumed this was to be about Don Hertzfeldt's cult classic, Academy Award nominated animated short film, 'Rejected'. Which seems like the kind of thing you would do a main channel video on or featuring. maybe weird meme videos of the early 2000's
I've had a long day and I'm watching this in the bath, thanks for helping me unwind
"i reject this vid" -this opinion got rejected due to these vids never getting rejected
I love how summito is talking to you from a casual roadside mobile shop in Asia
the fact that there is a spike in "how to hire a hitman" and "how to make a pipe bomb" searches just after the video came out is so funny
"The only song I've ever cried to" 😆😆
what is rejection?!1! we at the university of reddit can sing you a veeeeeeeery long song about the art of rejection!  Certified reddit moment, did i mention that i use reddit certified redditier moment thank you for the gold kind stranger
Fuck yeah
Since internet historian hasn't said "ad over" I will take the rest of the video as part of the ad.
Finalllyyyyy I’ve been craving a video
Two episodes in one day?! You must’ve been held at gun point IH(Mark, Story Mode)
I reject your posting frequency policy :(
Internet Historian keeps the darkness away.
not first
I feel like I’m watching the directors cut of in the field
His uploads should be celebrated
reject society, ject monke
piratebay vs. the $2500 software with subscription services and installation limits. who would win?
14:56 apparently Billy Mitchell does it, just carrying around pictures with his autograph on it giving them to people that recognize him lmao
Does rejected rejected folder exist?
So were these just a whole bunch of inthefields that didnt have enough content to make a full video? I miss raid and nordman.
Hotline Miami Craig's List Hitman sounds like game of the year just waiting to be made
This was an awesome collab with everyone, always look forward to a video by the Historian.
Please don't reject me daddy 😭
got the notif and i screamed. hello again, old friend
hi Internet Historian
old in the field was better. these new ones are lame and people just blindly praise you for it.
hi
There are clips in here from videos I didn't know existed. I would've sworn I had binged every video but there are people I've never seen before. I know it's 95% I just missed something, but knowing this channel there's a 5% chance the video the part I don't recognize is from was unlisted until today.
Hold on a minute, some of these clips aren't from previous ITF, like with that Lewis guy. Where are those from?
For the algorithm
I’m 5’10, my best friend is 4’11. REJECTED.
i'll almost quit this video 9:18 when the galawxy appeared. Then 9:20 happen and i bolted. Overall funny as hell right up to the space bit.
How to buy Hitman?  Hitman the video game.. please daddy google don't put me on the list.
Did you see the story a few years ago, when Google released a load of anonomised search data? People discovered this user who had searched for a whole bunch of bad stuff. Like how to murder your wife, how to destroy dna, dismember a body etc. Basically people thought he was a serial killer or something. Well the guy reads some of the news stories and comes forward, explaining that he was a staff writer for the TV show Criminal Minds.
IH is like me when it comes to spoilers. An the reason I could never watch Jojo, entirety if the series was spoiled to me word per word even the jokes and I was bored when I forced myself to watch everything.
What episode was Lewis Spears from?
yknow there's a lot of things i'd search for a gag but 1:40 is something imma stay way from
where's the gun in the intro
There was zero hesitation with clicking on this notification
Ha! You thought these jokes weren't good enough. BUT THE JOKES ON YOU! I actually really like those jokes!
Le me: Barely resists urge to google how to make a pipe bomb
creator links are dead my friend.
It's a good day today, had a good laugh!
PERFECT TIME to cook my meal and look for a good video to watch. This is the highest degree
1:00  Yeah I am not trying that, I live in the UK and my government puts you in prison for jokes, ain't no way I'm pulling that pin and testing it.
More like “injected”…. Straight into my dick vein
Even the rejected clips are really funny, what's your secret IH?
It's that time again, folks. Time to forget the Ohio poison death clouds and inevitable incoming nuclear annihilation and watch an Incognito Mode video!
i don’t get why so many of these were rejected they’re pretty good
20 MIN AGO
At this point, incognito is ih’s new main channel
MIKE
Dads back from the store
Niggredo.
HELLO
Dhfjc
Life is worth living for another 22 minutes at least, cheers IH.
IH using the picture of assassination of archduke Franz Ferdinand is 👌
tall thing: all cars and beds are made for people under 6'
Baleeted
My mom loves you, IH. Welcome back. ❤️
Aww rejected :(
IH is blessed that he knows his password on the 2nd channel without having a post-it note.
Finally, a new video 😍
My soul just left my body and I saw the rocketship, it gave me the strength to live on
What vid was the Lewis Spears one, it seems funny just imagining it
IH is one of those youtubers that makes their sponsor video really good and fun to watch.
Holy cow a new incognito mode and story mode in the same day! That must mean he's got something huge coming out on the main channel too!🤗
cannot wait for video and OFC THE SPONSOR SEGMENT!!!
The philosopher's suppository effing killed me.
Yay the next season of Internet Historian has started!
my menstrual cycle and ur release cycle are aligned, i think my eggs are dying <3
Who is the tall guy? I've never seen that episode before.
Rejected? The Internet Historian?  *HERESY.*
the first thing i saw was a website  RENT-A-HITMAN
Craigslist Hitman sounds amazing
The chefs explaining their food sound like your 8 year old nephew when you ask him what he’s drawing.
He still makes videos? Nah, this is obviously a fever dream.
accepted.
1:30 🤣🤣🤣
I did my part in the analytics.
Praise the heavens another ITF.
These guys make me feel like I have friends.
It is always morally correct to pirate Adobe software.
Firet
“How much mercury do you have at home?  Oh loads, just like every other British person”  *that explains so much*
So glad to see Hello Freshman join the Sponsor Cinematic Universe
Why this 2 months felt like 2 years
I'm 6'6 and feel the tall guy struggles.
Having this guy post feels like an important event in the month
Wasn’t this video about rejection how did we get to *How to properly prepare seaweed*
2:00  IH just described Joel's Bodyharvest Moon: Hitman Edition.
Yes, new video!
Even at 6'3", I ALWAYS feel like I'm in the way in public places. The "you're tall" realization from the opposite sex is always a nice confidence booster. Also, doesn't everyone just pirate photoshop?
Man you already know craigslist-man would be an instant hit
LEEEEEEETS GOOOOOOO
3:50 🔊 BRUH
hes back
"Hello Fresh Man" doesn't quite hit the same way as NordMan.
man i never skip the sponsor segments they're so fun
Reject? OOHHhhh....I thought you had said Re-Jeff. I was so confused. The reasons seem obvious!
This man about to hit us with 3 videos in a day?
"Imma turn 360 degrees and walk away" uh buddy, you're walking THROUGH him bro!!!!
Finally. I've unironically been waiting for an In The Field on In The Field.
last
Hey can you delete my comment? I don't like it very much.
Mr historian has been working hard😳😳😳 2 videos total in less than a month wowweee
The year is 2035, it has been 12 years since Internet Historian has released his last video 'rejected.' . The world is in turmoil, people are hungry, the One World Order Youtube Costco Corp has put out a bounty for his head. Copium levels are dwindling across the globe, and the OWOYC has instated a global Ligma Vaccine. All we can hope for is a new release of Internets Historians sweet....... sweet nectar video. It was prophesized by Jesus after his return in 2023 after the apocalypse that Internet Historian would return once more, to clean the lands and the seas and the heavens of deez once and for all. A video would be released returning global sanity back to its autistic state.  We are waiting. What IS waiting???? Stock images help us all.....
Appreciate the video! 👍
“i came and realised she left 20 minutes ago”
Are sponsors having knife fights over being in your adds ? Honestly your adds are actual highlights of the videos for some reason.
Glad to have another Incognito video, For some reason these always pair well with Mark's expleened videos.
OMG I THOUGHT THE THUMBNAIL SAID "AIDS" INSTEAD OF "ADS" 😭
How to jected Internet Historian.
Trump ballots in 2020.      REJECTED

Only 1k views a min? Man this channels fallen far..
*googling “how to make a pipebomb”*   I’m doing my part!
I'm feeling so rejected.
:0 YESSS I was just rewatching your stuff for asmr and here is a new video!
I rejected my virginity. But my biology says no.
It's a great day in history when the Internet Historian uploads a video.
another banger
Now I'm curious of what got rejected from Rejected....
I still don't know what a Rejected is :(
2 videos in a day, which one of you guys is holding Internet Historian hostage?
Incognito mode , not rejected
That editing timeline rejected my mental health
ohs hti
Just realized this was the rejected scraps of previous episodes, fucking based
I like the new format for the ITF videos with multiple guests, and the callback to the “i’m on break” joke. awesome video!
🗿
I thank you
These videos always make my day, like literally
His sense of humor is a gift to the world.

Nice to see you again😊
You really took your time on this one😒
2 videos in a couple days across 2 channels.... i guess that 90 day depression nap did it's job
Well, time to google things like a good watcher, don't mind me.
I come online and you posting, what a day, nice
Random Lewis Spears appearance? Noice

exactly, on the day, I was sitting here 2 weeks ago looking if there is a new video, and by looking at the other uploads, I assumed "probably still another two weeks" and guess what, here we are!
I never rejected a dream with internet historian and ordinary things. We would [REJECTED] for hours.
I'm pretty sure the game IH described was some form of Mahhunt.
If you're going to kill your wife do-it-yourself very ordinary thing Mister ordinary man
HELL YEAH ANOTHER
Yep. I’m living in a simulation.
Wait, is this the Internet Historian in a cunning disguise?!
2 months of therapy down the drain
I'm a simple person... you post, I click.
Its 2 AM in my country and i need to sleep but i IH just came and said "fuck your sleeping schedule bro"
You know it's going to be a good night when internet historian blesses us
Nah
Story of my life
Full jection points.
Ah yes I see now. Thanks 👍
The most relatable video title of all
The king has risen 🙌 🙏 😂
Nice.
uh storymode AND mainchannel video. Pog
funny as hell dude but i wish you got more recognition in the space, i usually send the bangers you do to all my homies but man, you really do deserve some sort of spotlight on the content you do. Enough with the praise and all that, hope u good and keep it up ✌
Rejected rejected has pretty much been the story of my life trying to carve out my little niche so far  on YouTube but so far it's been rejected!
3:47 Story of my life.

Another Holy Tome to pass on to my child. Hopefully he will be graced with as many videos I have.

Yooooooooooooo you got lewdogs on
SWAG SWAG SWAG
My spoon is too big
This is a great video title for the status of my job applications.
Sometimes I binge watch every single one of your videos nonstop, then forget about your channel, and then that cycle repeats when I get a notification of your new upload.
First 🥇
This is a certified CbT moment
IH escaped the authorities yet again!
Man I’m so glad I played “murder for hire list your name and address in the comments” it’s a 10/10 Amazing game and story
In The
Within a minute of uploading I found it.  Man I was have a depressing day until now. Thank you, IH for making my day.
I did as instructed and googled how to make a pipe bomb now I see flashing police lights down the block
Blessed day 🎉
If you're gonna hire a hitman, just make sure you share the juicy goss with me. Lord knows I need the content!
You know who else is rejected? My mom!

Dam 2 minutes late
They have no right to reject you
I'm in the middle of my wedding, but a new video drop is far more important, so she is going to have to wait.

This video should be rejected.
Accepted.
Watching this while in class
Oh look, two rejects talking about rejection and shit

I can’t even imagine how long it takes to make one second of this video
My day is now complete
Dude you gotta upload more often we miss ya lol

Banger video
Holy shit I'm here before 100 views. First time!

It's 2am and I wanna sleep. Well, time to postpone my sleep
I bet this took years to make
When theres 135 comments, 1 view, and its been uploaded 55 seconds ago, you know you’re early.

Now that Hello Fresh sponsors IH we can finally confirm that he does indeed have a human form that requires food.
Great video, my favorite part was the title
I don’t need to watch it to know it’s already quality.
Funny, i was in incognito mode when this posted
It’s always a good day when Internet Historian posts something new
