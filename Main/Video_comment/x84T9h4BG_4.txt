I just realised this was in the place I was born in, DUBLIN! 🇮🇪
I was thinking of niall the whole time because of “does it involve the booder sock?” and “we took a chonce”
The eyeroll in the beginning 🤣🤣🤣
Omg ur in Dublin can u do a QaA
He new what was about to happen when she said to say chance
so the comment section is full of directioners😌
eyearlind
we took a chonce
butar
Tell him to say 33 😂
Its CHONCE no exceptions 🤣
Even when it doesn’t seem like it there is a purpose for everything. God loves you more than you know, He has a purpose for you and He’ll help you through whatever you’re going through if you let Him in your heart. And one day He’ll show His purpose for things that don’t make sense right now. If you ever need someone to talk to you can dm me <3 John 13:7 “Jesus replied, “You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand.””Isaiah 41:13 “For I am the Lord your God who takes hold of your right hand and says to you, Do not fear; I will help you.”
buttersock. A sock full of butter
we took a 'chonce', god knows we tried
aahagahha this one is like too much for directioners
He definitely does       Trust me I’m from Ireland 🇮🇪
He sounds more ‘British’ to me 😊
You mean your ✨ husband ✨💖💖💖
“Higherlundt”✨
I am from lreland 🇮🇪
I I live in Ireland too and when I went to visit my friends live in America they said I had the biggest Irish accent
“Booherh” Lewis is starting a new language rn
I love his accent 😂
Ok 2 things  1. I’m pretty sure this is supposed to be a cute joke, she ain’t tryna hate on irish accents so stop typing in the comments that they should break up. It’s rude and clearly ur parents didn’t teach u how to be respectful.  2. Stop his assuming sexuality it’s disrespectful because he’s in a relationship. I’m saying he couldn’t be bi or gay but you can’t assume it unless he comes out himself. I know I would hate to be labelled as well. So i’m just saying maybe don’t.
Chonce!! Yaaasssss!!!!!😅😅😂😂💕💕💕💕
That Irish butter is 10/10 btw
"We took a chonce"       Iykyk 🇮🇪    💚🤍🧡
Butter really got that accent out strong 😳

CHÓNCE
Half of the comment section is either niall horan fan or a directioner 😂 I love it!
say butter  "dairygold"
Everyone says one of my best friends has a British accent, but I never hear it. I talk to my other bestie Maddy and she is always like: “Yea, J has this heavy British accent I hear it every time he talks.” But I’ve known him since 1st grade and I thought his accent always just faded away after being surrounded by people without an accent like his. Maybe I’m wrong and I’m just used to it??
Dublinnn
So uhm, I just watched a video of how to speak in irish accent 20 mins ago and I'm confused. Idk if the accent of this man is british and not irish, but idk also becoz some of what he says sounds irish
A falm is a movie in Arabic so I think 🤔 your bf is an Arab some Arabs have blonde hair :)

For some reason I love  when he said Ireland and chance
Im English and some of the words are the same

When she asked him to say butter my mind just went straight to iCarly's one direction episode where they said butter in three different accents and Niall was just like, "Does it involve the budder sock?" 🤣🤣🤣
I love his acsent
Chonce
Andrea: say chance Lewis: chonce  Niall Horan: wE tOoK a cHoNcE
alright alright you guys are my parents .. dead
He reminds me of the foot doctor Lady
Can I get a shout out

Americans have a go at English people for sayin butter without the t but this girl said flipping burrer and every english person says h like that
He does
U mean girlfreind? Acts like a girl lol and his poster
As I am from Ireland and have an Irish accent I actually say Ireland like him too
When he said butter it reminded me of that episode of icarly when Niall says “does it involve the buttuh sock”
I thought he was gonna say chonce like niall😭
Fiancé now
Hi

I really want to know what part of ireland your from
Say bottle of water

Chonce✨🇮🇪❤️💛💚💙
1:00
Okay amni the only one who thinks of Niall horan
What the heck 🤪BuTterr
I bet they watched a nice filimum
Im pretty sure that he knows he has an Irish accent.
Honestly I feel like she is being pretty rude always talking about his voice. I get it, it's supposed to be funny but I'm sure to someone who doesn't have an American she sounds funny too . I wouldn't want someone to keep pointing out my accent constantly.
I speak like that 😂
The way he said film it’s the same way we Arab say film😭
Doesn’t sound that Irish tho
All the English ppl saying        THatS nOt gRamMar AmeRiCan LaDy    Aka me

That's a great accent
I say how he said chance and H. I live in 🇬🇧 England.
Sounds like British or something
He isn't gonna be your boyfriend for long lol..
I don’t see why you just leave him alone. Like he has an accent so just let it go already.
So fucking fake
It don’t really matter cuz there’s a thing called an American accent too or British
OMG
All I could think of with the "chance" was Niall Horan and his "chonce"😂
Welp hes a idiot if he thinks he doesnt have one
Irish accents are really cute in my opinion like how he said butter ☺
All the Irish fans in the comments
Everyone believes that they font have an accent when we ALL have one 😐
Irish people cool
Say: "I'm breaking up with you."
I never realized how close my language accest was to irish
Me from ireland ve like : Whats wrong with our accent
"we took a cHoNcE"
He’s not straight
*Nialler left the chat because he didnt say chonce*
C'mon girl he is ur boyfriend not a fucking alexa 😩😩
Booter😂 I am hearing it now!!! (I am irish)

Your boyfriend looks like your girlfriend 😂
Macke him say 3
Well if he's from Ireland technically it's not an accent.
I feel like ive seen yous around dublin before o_o
When he said chance i hoped he would say CHONCE. My directioners will get me
You sure he's not gay?
Boyfriend? You sure? 😂😂
I hope my girlfriend  makes a video of my indian accent...... Oh wait .... I don't have a girlfriend 🤔
His boyfriend  does not like you right now
Your bf is gay. On to the nxt.

He also doesn't think he's gay.
Bwota of bowta
Lmfao yeah he's so gay can't belive everyone else thinks it
Does he know his girlfriend is an annoying attention seeking idiot?
First, there is a thing called bi, gender nonconforming, pansexual, etc 🙄
Does he know he’s gay?
❤️ https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=esr_J8QIKEs
He sounds dutch
Preeeetty sure he knows.
I am from Ireland and he doesn’t have an accent but the way he said some words where how we would say then but no he doesn’t have a accent
"My boyfriend doesn't think that he is homosexual"
Next video: Why my boyfriend broke up with me
Is that your boyfriend or your lesbian sister?
This is someone pretending to do what they think is an Irish accent but is a crappy english accent
Am i the only one that thinks her boyfriend might be gay🤔
Wtf is that shit. And who the fuck Sees this as entertainment.
Nobody cares
Say fuck...FoRk!
Imagine dating that girl 🤢
It's not Irish it's an English accent
Where’d he get his jacket?
Why do her laughs sound so fake tho
You are going to ruin the bloodline
and people troll indian accent lol
What u mean he doesn’t 😂
This comment section is embarrassing. I dont understand why people are making rude jokes about him seeming gay. Like, unless he said that himself, dont mis-sexualize him. Believe it or not, there are "feminine" straight guys out there. Edit: guys its not that deep. If he's not straight then ok. There are many other sexualities then just being gay. And if he was in the closet, these comments are probably not gonna help him wanna come out any time soon.
I think he has a irish and australian mixed accent
Is he actually Irish bc if ur just saying he has one then is he really irish
The first one was okay, but this one some of the words are the same as how many other people all over the world say them
Your boyfriend doesn’t know he’s deep in that closet
Gay
GOOOD PET, YOU WERE SO GOOD TODAY!! HOW CUTE
Tell him to say garage.
he looks so irritated. i don't think whatever accent he has is a toy for his girlfriend to use as public entertainment.
I think he’s heading out the door soon.  Bitch I annoying.
Yo do u know Desmond Dennis
He doesnt look like a boyfriend, more like her friend who she can have sleepovers with
Ngl I heard some leprechaun in that “butter” and “Ireland”
Trash video 75k likes Good video that took a long time to make 5k likes.
bo ohw o wo er
Mad kid laroi vibes
Not Irish London
He's faking it
He is international super spy, supa spayyyy
Girlfriend* fixed it for u
Or hes just gay using you as a cover up 🤷🏼‍♂️😂
Guy's....        Go to bed
Tell him to say “Horseshoes, and rainbows, 4 leafed clovers and balloons! Lucky Charms part of a nutritious breakfast”
Bri'ish VS Eireish Word: Butter Bri'ish: Buhhuh Eireish: Buhheir
feel that
U do know i dont care about your boyfriends accent
Chance legit isn’t even an accent though unless you say it the USA way
Another brainless couple,truly profound content.so entertained.
Idk but ask me to translate anything german except swear words
That eye rolling, bro. Kinda suspicious... 🤔
Your boyfriend is gay
I'm pretty sure he's well aware and she just said that for content lol
Am I the only one that thinks he’s  straight because um I don’t know he has a girlfriend…also y’all the same ones that be like “don’t assume people’s sexuality” just shut up😐
Can't see the beard but can hear it.
You can use his body as a cocaine suitcase too.
She's forcing him to say this
"Say H" "Heych" "HAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHA"
you BF should have been born a woman. this is his nature
Man when they break up she won’t have any milk
How come when Pierre and his bf do it yall are like omg they're so cute I love his French accent but when she does it with her Irish bf yall are like "OmG talk about milking ur bf" like what? Double standards much?
Your boyfriend likes men js
Just not tho is it I don't say booer it said but err together and it's not filum it's just film
He has a british accent more than an irish accent
Haven't heard Indian, English and Australian accent from the same person
I hope she validated his beautiful accent after this tho :(
Uh I think your boyfriend's gay.
Idk about Irish but he def got some fruit in em.
THATS A BRI ISH ACCEN NOT A IRISH
I think the boyfriend should date a boy not a girl because he is acting so gay
Alright looks like my I don't get enough likes, time to move on to the British
Well he's right because he doesn't
Make him say thanks he should say tanks
These people do realise basically each county in Ireland has a different accent. So Irish accent, which one?
Yeah he looks so tired of her  ass already.
He sounds like george not found not gonna cap
…… i have things to say about him that im going to not say because i have a fear that everything i say will make people uncomfortable  *next time on im an over sharer*
Why does he sound like GeorgeNotFound in some of them-
Your "Boyfriend" obviously doesn't know he's gay yet either...just give it time...he'll figure it out!
The butter was the give away
Think accent is enticing.
Sounds fake.
girl: Say h dude: h girl: omg Irish accent moment!!!!
sounds like GeorgeNotFound
Fake
He’s in denial about the accent and his sexual preferences 🧐
me: OMG SHE LOOKS LIKE GINNY FROM GINNY & GEORGIA
The horrible giggle she does after he says something 🥶🤔
Girl: Say Butter. Guy: Bo-er.
Don’t be fooled they both play into the cringe 😂
Okay so I’m from the Netherlands and his accent sounds like a Dutch person who tries to talk English lmao
Simpleton.
This is racist too
I’m sorry but uh I don’t really care what accent your boyfriend has sorry (;´༎ຶٹ༎ຶ`)
This guy sounds more like an South African

He does
Connor MCGREGOR would kill yeeeeeeee
His smile tho 😀
Irish accent better than american.
Yeah, like anywhere in the world people have accents, and to people in Ireland the American accent is weird
It’s not massively strong like he sounds more northen
I think she’s a cover
Say Ireland: home
Not Irish at all completely fake
I can't imagine people listening to me and saying "you have an accent" although sometimes I do hear my own NY dialect kicking in
Your boyfriend also doesn't think he sounds gay , not that there is anything wrong with that .
Are you fucking his accent or him ?
Ur bf might be gay
Real funny....m
Thought that was your gf.
Seems forced
No straight guy rolls his eyes like that
Your boyfriend might be playing for the other team. Just saying.
Too funny...I do the my my gal..
Love the way he says butter lol
He sounds… gay
He gay as fuck bruh
Bruh that’s a northern English accent 🤣
I am Irish and I don't know if that's a Irish accent or not 😐
What accent does he think he has ?
I wonder how old this gets….
Coming from someone who was born and lives in Ireland,that's not an Irish accent. Sure its similar but not Irish
His pronunciation is just like saying English word in Hindi style *who's agree with me*😶😶
This man looks like Justin Bieber
The first one sounds similar to how we say it in Arabic
Her: say AcH  Him: H
J
Sounds like he's from Ukraine
No disrespect girl but you know your fool is gay. But all good

Part 7 "my boyfriend got tired of my video's and is no longer my boyfriend"
...🙄😏butter...😂😂🤣🤣😅😅😅
He sounds brittish not Irish
No way he says butter like that. He doesn’t have that inner dub. Probably from Carlow or something 😄
Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith                               / / /  //.,., .  ., , / ., . , ., , /  .,          ., .,
Sounds like a posh manc accent tbh
She’s like an 8 mans is like a 2
Someone save this man
An Irishman doesn’t think he has an Irish accent? 🧐🧐🧐 I smell…. Attention
It's cute tho
fake
He’s kinda feminine I’d love to see them interact real life no camera.
If he thinks he doesnt have an irish accent I'm a fuckin rainbow farting unicorn flying at 1 million mph through space
Why Lewis is soooo cuteee???? ❤😍
Butter=Bu'er  It is......acceptable
How does it feel when your boyfriend is prettier than you?
Butter = water
He cant rock that jacket like nle
Ur bf is very feminine, you sure he’s ur bf??? Hahahahahahhahahaha
Have him say “ shut your fuckin mouth”
Your boyfriend is pretty..
So does he know he's gay yet ?
Say three🤣🤣🤣
He know he does 😒
That's more German than Irish at the start
So just the 1st was irish sounding. the rest are normal 😕
U sure he straight?
He does have a accent
He dose
More English than Irish can’t lie
should we tell her??
who's your boyfriend's boyfriend tho
If this is a male. I'm Superman.
He does really speak beacuse there from another country so where not d and not being mean beacuse u can tell there different country for some of y'all don't know! It's that she says he speak he's actually learn it or born with it!
Yeah defo not Irish, more south England that.
That dope sweatshirt tho
When you have a speech impediment and not an accent  but you’re just constantly be made fun of  for it.
He's in the closet.
You sure he is straight after that sassy eyeroll?
Dudes definitely gay
If he pronounces the number 3 as "tree", you can definitely confirm he has an Irish accent!
Why doesn’t she just date a girl ? 🤨
we took a ✨chonce✨
Your boyfriend gay
that, my friend, is an english accent.
That boy can't be her boyfriend cus he just as gay as they come!!! Sorry not Sorry Ma'am!! 😞
Not gna lie, homie looks like he currently “in the closet” Meanwhile his gf’s tiktoks will likely force him out said closet. Winwin imo.
meanwhile facial hair left the chat🙄
Make him learn Roadman
stop please
I saw you before on tik tok with some other guy I think. Y'all broke up or something?
he sounds more British or Australian
Ask him how he says, "in the closet".
Why does he look like adrien agreste thooo
Not me thinking about nail when you asked him to day chance!
He has an Irish accent
sounds abit scouse to me
He looks like a trans
Her boyfriend be like : please god help me
Your boyfriend might be your girlfriend
We say in the Netherlands “filem”
Thats not irish thats british the way he says chance
Now say 3333 Tree thousand tree hundred and tirty tree
He doesn’t
Honestly idk what so irish by pronouncing word by word, who knows if he is even irish, also before you judge my ass ive listened to how thick irish accent is and i kidd you not that it was barely understandable if you are not used to it
My gaydar is off the charts detecting girls man.
Yup he totally doesn't have an Irish accent😉
Thats the least offensive irish accent ive ever heard. Most irish people i can understand and my granparents are from these
can someone tell me what shoes he’s wearing? they’re cool
He sus
Make him say three trust me then you'll find out if he's really Irish
"A fil em"
Nah it sounds British
He sounded like hes gay
I'm assuming he's Scouser somewhere down the line too?
I think your BF has a secret in the closet...
When your boyfriend is prettier than you 😂
He is gay.
I love Irish accents ngl If I had any other accent that wasn't my British one, it would probably be an Irish accent
Well he's right. He doesn't because he said Ireland and not areland
He acts sus
Are you sure this isn't your girlfriend?
Do the DNA thing and see what country he comes from
We troll a chonce      Directioners would know this
my gf always makes me say shit because I’m Scottish then says “I love your voice it’s hot and cute” etc :/
OK he's right lol...I'm Irish he definitely doesn't 🤣
GeorgeNotFound
Ah yes, i love philums
Is he gay? Looks and act like gay
Yeah that’s 100% a Irish accent
I like the butter one
Only the last one was realistic he isn't Irish trust me
Sounds like he’s from Newfoundland tbh
That's actually how H is pronounced. The sound of each letter is in the pronunciation of the letter's name.
THIS IS ANDREA FROM BREAKING BAD
People do have different accents in different countries... so ?
A filum
Clearly not your boyfriend....he has a boyfriend I'm sure.
Filim
Girl stop harassing your boy for views
This annoying me so much
He does he really does
Say potato

Still making fun of accents? And you're old enough to date? And have a phone?!!
Make them say water
Say “Jehzus croist they’re arfter me loicky cherms!”
Your boyfriend doesn't look like he would have a girlfriend.
My man got the wrong girl, ngl.
when he said chance he reminded me of george not found lol
I’m from Scotland and one of my friends went to London to meet this American friend of hers, it was winter time and my friend pointed it out it was snowing and the poor girl couldn’t understand her accent. She said she had to pronounce things in a “proper way” even though my friend was speaking english. But I have been told by family members in other countries that we talk way too fast and don’t pronounce words properly. So i dunno?
I hate when people make fun of accents . . So what if we all have accents? Langers
Very handsome 😍
British accent?
He is handsome ❤️
That guys for sure gay get out while you can
Oi boyo leave em alone
Sounds more Welsh or queens English but I'm just American so wtf do I know

He's someone else's "girlfriend "
All I could think of when he said chance was Niall Horan
He looks and acts sus. Are you sure he's not gay??
I heard Niall's voice in him 😍
Leave the bleeding youngfella alone I'm from Dublin and he sounds normal to me, you are American, us Irish speak better English than you lot who stole the language and claimed it to be your own... It's from England & that's right beside us. Leave your bloke alone and stop putting the camera in his face asking him to say words then proceed to laugh at him. If anything you sound strange & fake
No shade but hes your friendboy..
I’m sure she’s a nice person but this would start to annoy pretty fast.
"a filum" gave me john mcclean vibez xdd

Feeling sorry for the dude honestly

To be honest. Her boyfriend pronounciation is a lot better. Better in a way clear to hear, because english is not my first language and your jargon and weird slang is just an alien to others.

Guys i have a very very good news it is Jesus is coming soon and if you think o man i have done alot of unrighteous things i broke the whole ten commandments you dont need to be perfect all you need is accept Jesus as your Lord and savior and after you do that Live like Christ Live righteously it says in ROMANS10:9 if you believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord you will be saved. I mean sometimes you would fall to sin but you can stand up and go to God,s way again that is normal what is not normal is you keep doing those big sins again so do not practice those sins God bless you see ya in heaven😍🥰🤗,,

As an India I don't know what accent I speak in.
Show him a side by side of him and Jackcepticeye and he’ll understand, and I think he gets the point
No I think he has a British accent or unless he was trying to make it seem like he does
Hmmmm... 🤔. This most likely will not end well.

People might seem to think it’s not hard to immigrate if you’re from a England Ireland and Scotland. I’m here to tell you while this seems cute it gets annoying very fast. Especially when every single person you talk to has to mention something about a place you no longer live in and that you have family that you miss dearly still there.
Why? As an irish native hes not ya boyfriend he is ya play thing you act like ya have never heard of Ireland or heard the accent please never come to Ireland also his pronunciation is off I'm from Cork and the way this lad says butter tf

If that's your boyfriend his boyfriend has something to tell you hunny.
Hi I'm half Irish and I've heard a lot of Irish youtuber talk but ur bf kinda sound either scottish or british and that is my opinion

Omg I am not alone I say h the way he says it my friends don't like it 🐻
Faking lol
I’m not even Irish (I’m part Irish but it’s not enough to count) and I think he’s trying too hard with the accent
"There are no gays in Ireland Kathleen"
So you have him put on the accent for vids even tho he aint got an accent
Say butter.   Buh-uh..   Lmao
"Say butter" "Wooter"

Three will get em

I think British
He doesn't...
Ok I'm waiting for the Irish accent
Milking the shit out of your boyfriend's accent be like:
Him: chance Me: waiting for him to say CHONCE!🤣🥰🇮🇪🌹✨
This kinda thing doesn’t work because telling him to say something in your accent gives him a reference making it less natural. If you filmed him saying it without any context beforehand that would work
Leave him alone
Your in Ireland of course he has an Irish accent
We took a 🌟CHONCE🌟
butter sounded Irish to me
OMG HE DOES LIKE 😩
Dude use that head you have an accent 🙄
OMG ALL I COULD THINK OF WAS NIALL SAYING CHÓNCE AHHH 😌

His accent is great, lol
Wtf is this shit????
I am irish what county are you from

She just want them views now
Chase you have a Irish accent if you like it or not
He don’t got no Irish accent she needs to learn the accents 😭🧡
My friend is Irish and, well sir you have an Irish accent no denying it
I think He might be from Ireland. I’m just throwing that out there.
They really milking this one subject
He would get kicked around in town
So I'm confused, is he Irish and hasn't been back in a long time, or is he faking, doesn't sound close at all, but who knows he might be real. If they are faking it, then oh boy is this cringe
What's so weird about that? That's how everyone speaks English in India too..
He dont got no Irish accent im dead
Clearly a btc couple
Man's has that Irish accent 1000000%

I don't think he likes girls..
I could only hear the accent on butter and Ireland
They think that it's so cool but it's just shit
I think he’s still In the closet using u as cover
I can say I am Irish and I would say he has a bit more of a British accent than an Irish accent
Im a bit sus bc like im actually irish
Love this
Trying to decide if she's in on the faking for clout or if he's always putting this on
Not all irish people speak like that
If he's Irish, call me a canoe and ride me down a river
He don't
Irish wrist watch next
Oh my god.  I'm not gay...BUT
"Daddy say ..."
If she was English then what lewis is saying sounds a lot more normal.
