I counted three times Matt called the Audi a supercar.. 😂 bro it’s a TT in a skirt
Well done Mat ❤
"I'm never going to buy a car like this ever again." Haha A few moments later (around a year) - buys new 911 S/T.
Rat...
10:45 satisfaction
For all car guys here, when is the best time to drive fast down twisty roads? As in, when is it least likely for you to run into a lorry? I tried driving them at night once, but I don't like not being able to see the road. Don't really have the confidence to drive fast at night on the road.
Wauw you really take care of your car, most youtubers just trash it Even with a cold engine
I have a feeling Matt will be saying goodbye to CarWow and going alone full time. I hope he does not go to Top Gear, that would be tragic. Let him develop this channel.
I love your license  plate, classic😂
I literally have metal gear shift pads in my Thrustmaster T300 RS GT GAMING wheel but you get PLASTIC in a supercar Audi??? Damn...
1st world crisis: Stones in my aero kit.
Mat is so lucky he got ppf cause I could see all the scratches in the ppf where those rocks were but it didn’t stress me out cause I knew he had ppf
Why am I just now finding out about this channel??? I've been a fan of car wow but I know it's not Matthews channel so I didn't subscribe... This channel on the other hand!!    Pure love from Jamaica Matt... You should do a off-road vehicle test here, if you're up to it, I'll help you to make it happen
Agree with you to prolong the excitement!
Iv'e spent a whole day enjoying your Porsche Experience! It's been so much Fun for Me to See You Enjoy your GT3 RS! Love the Spect, but put the Porsche Decals on it to Round it Out! Thanks Mat.
He just called us poor in 50 different languages with this intro
Why are they so loud? It sounds like the exhaust pipes are broken.
Your enthusiasm is great you never lose it
Well done mate. Fully understand😁.  Very nice car by the way Mat
i done the same journey in my 987, I'm hoping you do the top gear road, i had my photo taken with the front bumper on the floor coming around the hairpin, stayed in Aberystwyth hit the nightclub on the pier then on to porth maddog in the morning and had a day on a water park, all in was 586 miles of pure driving pleasure  and a whole lot of fun in-between, and managed to do it before the 20 mph limits
I have a question the GT3RS is it a key less go????
Audi R8 for the cold Start
Well, after all these videos on this car, it has only cost you 150,000 pounds now.
Dude does some really dodgy overtaking
what a beautiful experience, i would run that car in exactly how your are. Cheers to the love of motorsport!
doing math to drive a car  is insane !!! that's why i didn't get the porsche 911 gt3rs and instead  went with the honda accord !
What is it about the Brummy accent that is so annoying? Weird………..
Any carwow fans from denmark?
@MatWatsonCars are you using Xpel PPF?
The best car is one you don't have to worry about. Period.
If the break-in procedure isn't written in the owner's manual or is not handed over together with the keys, than I really wouldn't care.
I literally had the same strange noise on my 991.1 3Rs from the front last evening. First time Ive ever heard it 😂
I'd rather be in my Yaris GR said nobody driving there GT3 RS, other than Matt Watson. 😂😂
blud how much do you get paid to but a 911 992 gt3 rs ?
Surprised you're selling the audi.
How wide does that car feel to drive?
fuck its like having sex watching you NOT rev the  red line.......just the tip.....how deep will you go.....same thing........ just go for it and put it in already.......really don't think it will make any difference after 950 miles, its broken in.......like having sex and ejaculating with just the tip in thinking the girl can't get pregnant or get a std......
It's just rod knock.  Nothing to worry about.
25:45 real nice sentiment for happy and good things in life tbh
Matt you have my dream car collection
Nice looking porsche
Jesus they must be paying you well at Carwow!
This guy sure does love to hear himself talk
Wales looks beautiful. I think I will have to visit soon.
What’s up with the side script, it looks like a yellow smudge
beef
The crease on that fold phones looks annoying as fuck.
That's emotion 🤌🥹
17:59 🤨🤔
Interesting vid but I actually know the route taken very well. Fair to say the journey sequence was completely mangled and many a photo op jettisoned in the process. Could have achieved the same doing a 20 mile circle around Staffordshire!
Stop grabbing it by the window Mat, you should know better with those frameless doors :)
Mat you have to come portugal to  test drive our super car, made in Portugal, was presented recently https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3reKhszuPEM&t=400s
New respect for you Mat: Running in properly is very important to the life of a racing engine!
Porsches never sound good.
how you got allocation for the gt3rs can you say the process please  i am intrested to buy a new one
we need to see more of your gt3rs
Even if the GT3 RS is a fantastic car, the v10 R8, in the spider spec, with this deep green tint matched with those gold rims is simply GORGEUS!!
Nice IWC top gun watch too. You have great taste @MatWatsoncars !
I’d only take advice on break-in from engineers or scientists that have actually done tests of some sort… seems ridiculous to me. Everything is so precise and I’d guess especially so with Porsche.  My guess is a hundred miles of varied revs below 5k and a few hundred below 7k and call it perfect.  Change oil to get any metal bits out of the pan that didn’t make it to the filter…Maybe 20 miles under 4k or something first.  I’d think I set of heat cycles also are important.  But again, engineers with actual testing proof is what I’d want to see.  I’d guess extended ones are more for safety for new drivers to not do something out of their means for the first month or two.  Learn the car etc  Great point at the end.  The prolonging the exp for excitement and emotions… this is a good way to look at it.  Enjoying the new found power and sounds at each increment…
I’ve got a couple of GT3’s, they’re rubbish, don’t drive em, just keep em in their boxes
Bet Jo finds this desperately sad.
nice video mate
7:35 hahaha  My GolfR 310 horse power  😆
Gt 3 rs dreamcar
Gt 3rs sooo nice
Followed you near Builth wells that gt3 is a road full in the flesh the sound was unbelievable 👌
3:24
The GT3 RS is the dream car of a lot of us....Enjoy and thanks for the video!
what watch are you wearing?
OH NO!!!! WHAT WILL YOU DO? First world tragedies..  Meanwhile your tax is paying for a genocide.
You could always let me run it in for matt
I love how Mat is playing Forza Horizon 4 in real life 🤩🤩
Sad that Porsche let you jump the list of all those who have been waiting for years. Lame.
In all his gt3 rs videos it always bothers me so much when he grabs the window
I don’t drive automatic, how do you make sure the rpm doesn’t exceed a certain point when you’re trying to run it in?
How can you say the Audi motor sounds better than the GT3 RS when you haven’t heard it at 9000 rpm?  That’s like saying Whitney Houston isn’t a good singer because you heard her humming .
Your RS sounds exactly like my $145,000 2018 GT3 .
No longer a normal bloke….I’ll thrash my Kia.
I agree with being cautious about "running-in" your Porsche GT3 RS. A Porsche is an amazing car and by carefully ramping up the "run-in process" your car will be more reliable and the motor will work better with gentle use, particularly in the first few thousand miles. Porsches do not go well with being driven extra hard in the first 10000 miles. Porsche which has been taken care in the  "running-in" process will give you a lifetime of enjoyment! As a Porsche owner, you have a responsibility to take good care of your "pride & joy" of a car. .
Embarrassing……Porsche stool pigeon…..sell out!!! Xx 😂
imagine clicking on this and finding mat watson just flaming ur dads car
I knew u were gonna pussy out about the mileage, I just knew  it.. 😂🤣
Matt I can happily do the miles for you in your Gt3rs. P.S. I have no driving licence
Matt watson, Nico and Mattarmstrong for TOP GEAR IMO.
Mat my namesake, amazing reviews and congrats on the GT3. Stunning car!!
Matt owns one of the all time great sports cars. It’s just fantastic to look at, listen too and watch perform.
I’ve got something rather embarrassing to tell you …… I can’t afford a Porsche 911 GT3 RS. 😂
How did this moron get a GT3RS
It's not so serious damage at audi A6 just bumper,light etc no car body is not dangerous to driving it,you are extravagant Matt
Someone give me a well paying job like god damn 😭
MAT SIIT
New car would never end
I don’t understand Porsche… this guy has hardly any purchase history and is financing his car… and my family has bought 23-25 cars over 2 generations including GT3’s, Spyders, and GT3 RS and we don’t even get an allocation for an RS or ST and we don’t finance our cars… how can it be that we can’t get one??? Do we need to become influencers and sell our businesses??? Porsche is fucking up big time…
Matt, don't worry so much about the car. You are a You Tube content producer, you will need content and will be getting something newer and faster. You Tube guys never keep their cars very long.
The best way to break in a motor is to always keep it under a load and very the load from light to heavy to moderate and switch it all up and keep it moving
The 3rs of a great car but it's a 3rd car the 2nd would be an r8 and the first would be a commuter
Is the R8 colour Goodwood Green Matt?
All this run-in stuff is such BS. This is supposedly a race car/engine? When I used to race, it's redline within the first few miles. No issues.
When you mention the legroom in the R8 Spyder, it sort of reminds me of the BMW M1 years ago.. the BMW/Lamborghini collaboration.. It was a very long wheelbase car, but the legroom sucked.
what part of Wales are you in for smooth roads? lmao.
Carwow needs some road trips too
You must have been the most patient child on the planet
Mercedes has the same 1k mile procedure for their AMGs. What I did was to just drive to work normally and take it on some long drives on the weekends until I hit 1k miles.   Took me about two to three weeks, but I was elated once I hit 1100 miles, so I could floor it and “drive it like I stole it”. 🤗
Switch DRS on to make it faster on autobahn
It's embarrassing because it's a waste of money and you got a free ride from Porsche when others had to buy loads of Porsche Taycans to get on the list. Well done for taking their place in the queue.
Do you guys remember when he had that green kn the brown rs6 and hated it and then bought this thing 😂
The number plate looks like MAT SH1T to me 🙈
i would just resell it for the profit, you can buy another one later
I love Mat talking about the seating position being a dealbreaker for potential buyers on the R8. When people ask me why I don’t have one that’ll be my response. Seating position, no no not the price tag.
The hands on the glaaasssssss 😫
Porsche mechanic roared with laughter when I took my first 911 into them, it was the millennium edition. I saw smoke on start up so took it in. They told me they all do it on cold start up. I was really worried as I spent nearly all I had in that. My first of 4
How can you even compare the 2 Mat ? Totally different machines
How many other cars did you have to buy off them , to even get put forward to own one. Massive con artists dealerships
It’s worse on the car to have it at stationary rpm over long drives v reving hard a couple of times.
Best of luck ❤ 😂 First world problems 😅😂🎉
Clever In depth verification to show he’s not over revving the Porsche to keep the resale value as high as possible hehe
I’d have gone to 932 miles and then opened her up.  If that’s what Porsche says, then it must be ok.  And if not, that’s what your warranty is for….😊
just leave it in drive and cruise it 😅
So do you compare track car's gt3 rs gran turismo capabilities with usual sportcar r8? meh
Money can buy the car but not teach you how to say the brand name apparently
Great video.  At this point, I’d go for it.  The benefits of running in are much greater in the first 300 miles.  Diminishing returns now for sure.  I revved my GT3s to 8,800 rpm right around 950 miles.     YOLO!
Look at a video of what Porsche do to there engines before you even get the car.
16:35 did you guys mount a drone on the R8?? Smart move!
What a faff.
hes edging
I even would change the oil before rev it to 9k
I can do a Road Trip for you and get it to 1000 miles, then you can have a go at pushing it to the limit.
My dad's had his m3 touring for 2 weeks and done more miles than that 😂😢😢😂
"my"
As you’re going to keep it forever, plus the price and how exclusive it is, you’re totally right to take it easy 👍🏼
For an England Guy, you hawe a lot of German Car 😅😅😅
Looks like he just had the same haircut but from a different barber.
Ferrari are bench run in, let the, rip day one. Assume Porsche make too many units ?
I think you are doing the right thing with that fabulous car
Absolutely mind-blowing footage! Your passion for the GT3 RS is contagious, and the stunning landscapes of Wales make the perfect backdrop for an epic drive. You've ignited a fire in me to chase my dreams and hit the road in search of adventure. Can't wait to see more content like this – keep living the dream!
the whole break in is complete bulox.   Rev to redline and then let it drop down in rpms while in gear.
Honest question here:  how many porsche's you bought along the way to get a gt3 rs? Great content as always Mat!
You need to go to the Autobahn for a drive
Driving it you would expect to get all this rubble in your gaps and crevices 😂😂😂😂😂
Mat, you car needs Akrapovic.
Awesome video. Respect that monster. You have more access than most. Spread the knowledge.
I know the feeling… finally ran in my Landcruiser. Only took 20 years and 400,000km.
As a senior Porsche tech I advise changing the oil every 1000kms for ultimate purity. That's 100 miles in your language. Cheers.
Dam it was gonna buy 3 R8s but I’m too tall
You did the right thing expensive machine needs to be respected and broke in correctly you will enjoy the next step more now
Why can’t Porsche program the ecu to have a “break in” rev limiter that rises as the car makes its way through those initial 1000 miles. I would guess that to be a menial task with their capabilities..
Srry to say but you sound like a whiney kid. Whining about stones while it was your idea to take the car to a country road.
Nice!
Watching Mat hold the window glass while opening the door 💔💔
Yes
Nice watch Matt Iwc goes well with your ride
I’d literally (and without a 2nd thought) commit multiple murder to secure myself a GT3RS, but I’d much prefer that glorious 5.2L N/A V10 aboard the Huracan EVO than the R8.
I didn’t think it was possible to  make a 911 look ugly.
can you add an r1 rsr exhaust on your 911🥺
Running it below 7k rpm for the first 911 miles was a missed opportunity.
it looks like a car from a cartoon. What a waste
How the hell can you afford these cars? Thats about 5-600k pounds for those two no!?
Good video. The drag races are OK but we need more of this.  On a side note: not a good advert for Samsung. That fold 5 is about 6 months old and it looks like the screen is lifting at the crease.
Impatient for the next journey where you'll pass 1.3K miles hoooo
Only thing men want in their life to make them happy
Why the clickbait title. Its not needed
12:35 Mate needs a window repair
1,4k+th
i love your watch, what is it?
I'd love either of those cars but it would be easier to climb Everest than get one. Fair fex to you, Mat. Really not sure about the black aero bits on the Porsche, or the massive rear wing. All a bit Ali Express looking to me!
It really must be an awful thing for a car guy to be born in the UK.  It's always wet or raining and the roads are rubbish
You should give this tech marvel and beauty a time.
Talk about a click bait title..
Not watched the video yet, but from the question "Which would be better for a roadtrip" Then my answer is the Audi all day long. 2 Reasons. Firstly, It isnt track orientated. Its much more comfortable than the porsche. Secondly, its a Spyder. That automatically makes it a better car for roadtrips. We have a Mercedes SLK AMG. We also have a W204 C63. I would take the SLK over the C63 any day of the week. Its less practical yes and slower with the smaller engine. But the idea of having a convertible for a roadtrip is unbeatable imo.
How many cars does Matt own, and what are they?
The click you get when you shift gears 👌🏾😊👌🏾
Cant believe you didnt use Yianni for yoir PPF 👀
When your finally ready to max it out on every gear will feel extremely special do a 2 mile draggy
Always worth running a car in properly to increase its potential life span
You have taken the crown of the name on youtube, the rest has been eliminated
Why do you track the distance in miles if you're in the UK?
Two mistakes  - bought the wrong 911 and overpaid for the number plate.
On performance cars like this, why don’t the manufacturers program in the maximum revs based on the miles covered, as this way the revs would actually be limited, ensuring that the car is run in correctly 🤔
Wonder how MW got his GT3 allocation?!! Hmm...
Matt never took off a womens bra till the 10th date. By that time she showed 5 other guys her cans. Great car reviewer though.
I wonder how much over sticker Mat had to pay.
What's unnerving about rear engined Porsches is the number of them I've seen swap ends in the wet on the Nurburgring, even when driven by much better drivers than I am. Physics overriding electronics when at the edge but not nearly as relevant for sensible road use though. I could just as easily kill myself on my motorbike, which I'm going out on very shortly. Will try not to ride too n n  nervously.
I think you made the right decision, the engine will be better for it.
I wonder is his tv remote still in the plastic bag :D   But, seriously, I would do an extra oil change right after running in this engine to get all the metal particles out.
Like training a crew in blitz.
Your Porche is so gorgeous Matt. Collecting those little stones is more a quirk/character 😅
Clickbait title
As a 911 owner for over 35 years and a current Exclusive Manufaktur 911 owner, I am the same way with proper run in and prolonged gratification.  It’s my $200k+ car and my rules in how I want to own and enjoy my car.  It’s easy for others that have no skin or $$$ in the game to have a “opinion”. 🤫
This guy made so much money from carwow now he in the cars he was racing
Is it just the US that they are all manuals?
Great video!!! Can wait to see the rest on the drive back
Mr. Watson …. 44mm TopGun 🤩 Love it, nice choice👍🏼🕐⌚️
Nice IWC Pilot Matt 👍🏻
I dont even hahe to look. Obviously gt3rs is not deisgned for a long road trip
Not sure if AI trickery was used making this video, but matts been de-aged
Mat Never dell tour gt3😮
You have no free time my friend. You are not the owner of yourself
One of your best videos - Very much captured the full experience with the GT3 RS - Thank you for taking us along
This is non sense :-) R8 vs 911 Turbo S is what you want to go for. As those are daily drivers. Bring the R8 and the gt3 rs to the Nordschleife and have a full hard track day and see what get you quicker around the course over and over again
here's an idea, stop ordering shit off the internet, start eating food from your local farmers, then we won't have to drive HGV's in Wales. As a lorry driver myself, I love the views you get in Wales, but trust me I don't want to be there.
I am actually so glad you didn’t rev it all the way …
Audi ALL DAY LONG!  No-brainer.
that wing is stupid
You are clearly making too much money!
Embarrassing channel doing ad for flipping it
Love your IWC ;)
I’ve always been a 911 fan but this GT3 RS is getting really boring now. I’m far more interested in the ‘under the radar’ looks of Chris Harris’s yellow GT3 Touring with 60k+ miles.  Matt, I do like your colour spec with the gold though.
Imagine having a car but not being able to drive it...
R8 Sounds better
its a car...there is always going to be problems and stains :D
Nahh a R8 isn't a supercar for me,it's a boring looking sports car
Got make those videos to pay for those lease payments huh Mat.
It took 8 seconds into the video for an argument to start with my wife "why can he touch the window when opening the door and you don't say anything"
UK have the worst roads in the world. Getting chip  from stones almost everyday. Roads are very bumpy, and very narrow. I still can not believe UK still have roads like that in 2024.
Imagine being able to own just one of these cars 🥹
The RS is a track car, And built, And meant, To perform best on the track. You sir are not a track driver. Beautiful car though.
Aren't you supposed to change the oil after run in period so the engine doesn't prematurely shit itself with all the small pieces of metal wearing the engine.
Painful viewing.  Ooh a twig.  Ooh a stone.  Ooh 2rpm too high.  Drive the damn thing or buy something you can drive.  Rag everyone else’s cars up and down the runway and a complete old woman with you own.  Hmm.
Matt you have a great taste in cars, colors, design…
Matt: Really experiencing the down force now at 20 mph 😂
How did you get it?
Rev it ya wooossyyyy😂
How is matt so wealthy?  He doesn't actually own carwow.
Matt is EXACTLY like me I’d do same thing with the run in e.g., when I got my last Ducati they gave me rules about run in and part of me would say ah all the run in rules are bollocks but then like Matt I own these bikes and cars why risk it only to blow the fucking thing then fight with dealer/manufacturer
Running my M3 in to 1200 miles and then having to wait to book the service in was torture. Get them final miles done!! 🎉
that noise is standard in wales
Matt, most roads in Wales are full of pot holes! Nice car though.
Mat, you should really remove those lame yellow side skirt decals. Definitely not "gold" as you keep saying. Put on the factory decals, it'll look way better.
What a load of bollocks. Why don't they deliver the car with the engine properly run in?
If it is really that important to break in these cars this carefully I would be super worried about buying a used one. I am willing to bet very few people that buy a brand-new Porsche 911 GT3 RS and go easy on it for a thousand miles. I'm sure anyone would be eager to put the pedal to the metal.  On another note. Just curious what was your reasoning for purchasing the GT3 RS? I mean, as opposed to another Porsche model. I understand if it's primarily a track car. But if you're going to be driving on the road a lot and getting rid of your more suitable road-car supercar, why not get a Porsche 911 Turbo S? I guess it all comes down to if you plan to daily drive or not. GT3 RS definitely a solid choice, possibly the best possible choice for tracking. But if I was going to daily drive at all I'd get a Turbo S because still an incredibly fast car but also pretty much made for cruising and carving public raods.
Refreshing to see a star with a cooler watch than Rolex
What about a race racecar motorbike break in?  It beds the rings and bearings in well. Most manufacturers done recommend it, but Aircraft engines and motorbikes seem to do better with a short, aggressive break in procedure.
Is car wow hiring? 😂
What’s real? Mechanics say it’s a myth to run in a car so idk what to believe
So glad you didn't follow the manual.
This guy is hard to take.
After the break-in period like after driving for 500-1000 miles you get a boyfriend and go to a gay bar, it is just gay.🤣
Change the pipes on your Porkka...for symphony of the devil
That spoiler looks like shit, get rid of it.
Honestly - how can you be posting about what's wrong with this car - ungrateful so and so. -
RS Audis seem to have a similar exhaust note no matter the engine size, ie RS3, RS4, R8 all have a similar burble. Hows that work?
Such a boring guy
How long did it take for Mat to run in his girlfriend? 😉
sorry mate, but carvertical is trash :)
Are these cars as fast as a 500 whp honda
Put some nuts livery on it !!! :D
What a 🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱..🫤
Running in cars is shit but i would do it everyday to own a gt3 rs
GT4 RS all the way
I love how you respect and treat your, a true car enthusiast.
That is such an amazing car. Wow
Out of context by i just love your IWC
GT3rEDGING
It's still not a PORSCH you i
I know it’s no R8 but the engine sound from my RS3 is what is keeping me in it, can’t manage to sell it, nothing comes close to the sound it makes in my budget.
Edging
What pretty roads, cant wait to get in a nice car and drive through a couple of them 🥲🥲
Oh mate running in procedures are so confusing , I was told by quite a few to leave in in a higher gear and make it work up a hill so the pistons bed in properly.
it may have not chipped your carbon fiber roof! however a thin sheet of ppf is less durable so makes sense there is a mark on it
Wait doesn't the Audi r8 have a hurcan engine?
Yeah it's a great car, but I'd feel like a complete, look at me tool driving around in it. And that's coming from a car loving petrol head.
R8
the way he opened it by the glass😭
New R8 sounds terrible compared to the older models.
I’m not gonna buy something like this again!  Says the car guy that has a car business 😂
@MatWatsonCars Ceramic coat the wheels perhaps?
Is that a *GT3 RS* . . . . . . You should have said !
Nothing will change beyond 50 miles after run in, and its alresdy been run hard at the factory first start/Dyno
W video
Hey Mat! You’re the king of edgeing;)
Great video Mat. I doubt I'll ever have the chance to run in a brand new 911 myself but if I did...I'd follow Andreas as well!
18:35 did bro just say 4 cylinder na?🤣
5:30 I wish I had those problems
Why wouldn’t you drive through Europe?
Bro is comparing both of my dream cars 😢
Mat already messed up the video on the beginning when he touched the window while opening the door 😂
The GT3 RS is an astonishingly capable machine but this kind of comparison video just highlights that for daily driving a less extreme 911 (992) would make so much more sense. A Turbo S would be more practical and a great deal faster on roads like these, not to mention safer.  For me though a 992 Carrera 2S with a manual transmission would be all the car I could ever want.
I drive like "Matt's Worried face "a lot of the time... In any car of mine... If some noise of sound is off.. im suspitious... :D
Stones in the aero isn’t just a “problem” in your Porsche. Neither my 2020 or 2023 diesel Defenders can match the performance of your Porsche but you should see the muck and stones that collect in the front aero ducts, especially after an offroad day but it happens all the time on the road too………. so no need to spend £200k on a sporty car to have dirty aero slots!
Why wouldn't you buy a damaged car..?! As if a ' un damaged' car are any good.. :'D
Mats spec is so fkn boring
Wow Matt rocking an IWC chrono as well, what a flex.........
any watch enthusiast here? wondering what is the watch on matt's wrist
Can’t imagine sending a quarter million + on a car and not driving it…while it wouldn’t necessarily be my daily, would out as many miles and drive as often as I could…those who put them in their garage, truly didn’t want the car, doesn’t appreciate the car, they’re just trying to flip to make money.   Unfortunately, those who buy this and others like it…are normally too afraid to drive it, mortgaged the house, making payments, and are otherwise broke because they bought it…and now too afraid to drive the damn thing.  Let someone else go through all the break in period, pit 10-30k on the odometer and but it at a reduced price. Too much hype, too many of them out there for sale..imho the GT3 will be a financial hit as opposed to a 💰💰  Just watching Mat, I just couldn’t imagine going through so much worry and anxiety every time you drive it…every little tick or sound…paranoia sets in….just NOT worth it
The "spoiler" on the back, is quite horrid, but in case you weren't disliking it enough, they write PORSCHE on the underside, to really rub it in.
You broke it by revving it too far 20:00. Revs hitted 7000!
Honestly porsche should include a burn in mode
Yes great car car only problem is its not for road use in uk  revving to 3000 you are over our speed limits so car cannot be used to its full potential ok on track but pretty pointless on our roads, better off with something small that you can thrash and still keep your licence
For the break-in period, there is no need to really overthink it, just drive the car easy for at least the first 1,000miles.
You shouldn’t talk down on other peoples vehicles you give me a really bad white boy posh vibes
That R8 in that spec... omg😌
U.S. driver here. Your roads scare the mess out of me. No space for error with opposing traffic.
Love your vids and hate to be that guy but its Bannau Brycheiniog not Brecon Beacons
No comparrison.  Useless video, in my humble opinion, respectfully.    GT3 RS is in a class of it's own.  This is not a car where I start wondering about its creature comforts etc.   I only care about 1 thing..   RIPPING THE PAVEMENT OFF THE ASHPHALT.
Engine sound drool in both GTRS and R8 but the mouse click gear change in that 911 is a bit mousey!
You ahouldbe mashing the accelerator running In and working through the gears being conscious of not over revving. The rings need loading up when running in so they bed in properly.
Takes advice. Tosses advice.
Self worth is the REAL limiter...
Mat you shouldn't break it in for longer because by doing that you make the engine lazier and its gonna become a problem in the long run and I thinks you should make the milage to reving it a extra 500 rpm a bit lower to about 50 miles and not 150 and play around with the gears more so that you don't make your engine lazy
This bedding theory is not relevant nowadays. Come on
It's sounds like a 280z with itb's😅
Excellent video Mat!!!  I am 100% with you on making sure you do everything you can to break it in properly and safely!  Cheers!!!        🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁
25:48 yeah! That's once in a life time opportunity #porsche
Those stones will not be there when you can redline it 😂
Top video Mat! Meeting those blokes in Wales and just chumming it up ... never change!
Sad little illegal number plate spoils a nice car😢
Ok, this video cracks me up given my experience with my father-in-law's Mercedea...he chose the European delivery option and invited my wife (his daughter) and me to come along. Great experience...BUT...we decided to go to Belgium (I have relatives there) and to France. The break-in mileage according to the manual was 750 miles. Around maybe 650 miles my father-in-law started getting sleepy so he asked me to drive...all good. So I was driving as he was sleeping as we approached the 750-mile mark. We were literally within 5 miles of that when he woke up and announced that he had read on the internet that it was advised that the break-in period should be extended to 1000 to err on the side of caution. I wanted to kill him. Luckily for me, our roadtrip lasted long enough where I was driving at the 1000-mile mark and he was again asleep. As we had a picnic lunch he asked me how the car was and I fully admitted that when we passed the 1000 mile mark that I took it up to 130mph and it was great 😂. Luckily he's a great guy and just laughed and asked how the handling was...breaking cars in requires incredible patience. 🤣
Treearrrrs
Does Mat have a Porsche? I can't tell.
I swear the more the mileage went up on your Porsche the stronger your Brumie accent got? 😂
I understand... if you work hard and finally after lots of waiting and weighing, you can get your dream...sooo much better than just getting out your gold card and paying for it...🎉🎉❤
its a tough job mate, but someone has to do it!
Mat, i think you should do more of this, this is so fun!! i absolutely loved it, find yourself a spot not too far away and bring the cars over there and give it a go...the sound of the R8 is just awesome. Thanks for sharing this.
Am I the only one who thinks carwow should mix it up with some myth-busting videos or behind-the-scenes of car manufacturing? 🤔 Imagine Matt taking us through the secrets of car design or debunking the biggest car myths with his usual flair. It could be a refreshing break from the norm and a chance to dive deeper into what makes our favorite cars so special. Plus, who wouldn't want to see some unexpected challenges thrown in?
I'm with you, Matt. You absolutely did the right thing!
Matt mice too drive all these cars 🚗 do you actually own a car dude or car company give you free 🤔 nice little job.
Machine and it's happy slave! 😂
So  I would prefer the r8
Be interesting to see oil after 1000 miles
Wow, nice IWC Ceramic Pilot Chronograph!
which watch are you wearing?
I'm on your side, this is a once in a lifetime and you plan to keep this baby forever, and like you said, down the road you don't want that nagging what if voice in your head, good choice sir!
I love your 996 .İts is the real beauty dude.
Nice video , great cars , for that journey R8 it's better , enjoy Mat.
I think the comparison between the two cars isn't truly valid. Comparing a GT3RS to a R8 V10 is two supercars for two very different purposes. The R8 will of course be a better roadtrip car as the GT3RS is a track toy primarily.
Back to basics, GT means not for road !!!
Does he wear an anorak 😂😂
Great video and would love to see more like this on the channel. Those door to front quarter gaps (5.15) need sorting though 😊
Automotive Edging
Honestly you get a lot of ugly plastic coming with the new rs 🤣
How come you got an allocation for a GT3 R/S 😣
Long road trip😂, we do long road trips in Australia, about 8000km
0:07 he touches the glass §:
Great car Mat, you did the best thing waiting before giving it full gas, you don't want something to break as it would be silly expensive if its engine related.
You poor soul living with them problems when everyone around me can barely afford to live
Mat Armstrong thinks there's nothing wrong with that Audi !
Not a fan of the cheap mouse click sound for the flappy paddled.... Still, wouldn't say no to one!
real world problems stones in my gt3 rs  HAHA
Slight click-baity title Mat! :D From what I watched, there is absolutely nothing wrong about your RS. I admire your restraint in running it in properly.
Please! How many videos can you make about "your GT3 RS" ;) I unsubsribed from this cringe long time ago
I would feel older for about 30 years by owning that car and worry about every chip... just great!
I give you a competing car 2024 The Mb gt 63 amg 2 door ❤
Not sure the Uk road are best for this kind of cars 😢
Porsche engineers have done testing after testing and I would just stick to their manual.
If you squint, Matt's number plate says Mat Shit...
@MatWatsonCars why u selling the R8?
The gt3rs is just such a beauty, truly a dream car.
You did not just grab it on the glass, matt why bruh
This is the reason a car loses 35% of its MSRP value the moment it leaves the dealership. The more miles you put in, the lower the car value gets. It's all about having fun, such a stunning car, I'd drive and never come back. 😂
I prefer the 911 Turbo S
The back end of that audi is starting to look old.
The bedding is really a thing of the past. What porshe is doing is getting you to gradually get to know the power of the car. They know if you dont do this most peolpe will end up wrapped around a tree.
Mat, don't mock people in a Golf R. You are one of the fortunate few who can swan around in high performance vehicles as part of your job. To go on a road trip in a GT3 and take your R8 spider along just for comparison is rather rubbing other less fortunate mortals noses in it!! Many people nowadays have to manage with just one car, I know it's unbelievable!!!
0:07 NOT THE GLASSSSS
no he probably meant miles tons of engines need roughly 3k miles to break in
"really experiencing all the downforce now" 🤣
is this Matts personal car? didn't realises he was that rich. brand new, they go for starting at 190k
that Mark mccann bloke cant get a GT3 RS, howd you get this one Mat? Doesnt a bloke have to have owned 30000 Porches from a single dealership before hand to be possibly allocated a slot?  Swoit ride tho!
The editors working hard in this video to keep the speedometer out of the shot 🤣
We really don't care
When I built a new motor for my Porsche racecar, I'd run it for 1/2 an hour in the shop, then putt around the street for 1/2 an hour (on and off the throttle to seat the rings) and change the oil. Give it another 5 minutes to check for leaks and then I was off to the track. Full throttle all the way to the red line for it's whole life. It lasted for several years until I sold the car. That's about what I've done with every engine I've built for myself. I wouldn't tell a client to do the same, but I'd do it to my own.
Get in max it out, see if it breaks.....
Milking the RS a bit ain’t we- slightly weak content for this video
✋🏿👀... American here, so I buy a car and can't fully drive it... to its fullest until 1k miles in... also, i have to run it a certain way b4 1k miles... oh yeh,  that's all for the price.   👀...This gotta be for ppl who race these cars because if it's only for road trips...😐hmmm
Porsche Gold tech here. Youre good. Run it.
GT3 RS is not a road car, and less for long journeys 🙄
Matt, what watch is that? Looks pretty cool!
Enjoy mat .. Happy to see you happy
Ahhh, that Audi induction sound and load sound is so similar to when I drive my friends Diablo, just higher pitch. So so beautiful!
Should have had a small wind blower to blow those small stones off every now and then
did you use a mini 3 drone as a front camera for taking rollers? that's a first one
@21:35 Ahh, the dreaded nice car paranoia! Every little sound "Oh no, what is that?"
Good car but it belongs with the dinosaurs 🦕.  We should stop burning fossil fuels asap.  Seriously. By a Tesla Plaid and lead the way Mat. 🎉
😂🎉 You sir are my newest Richie HOMO...... sapien of cars. 🚗 Thank you for the update and content. ROLL TIDE 🌊
At a glance the "MAT 911T" license plate kinda looks like it says "MAT SHIT".
Why dose this guy insist of just opening the doors like a Doyle, touching the body the windows etc ffs man stop touching lol honestly😅
Bro I watched this entire video and wasn’t able to skip a single ad.
I rather have the R8, but i'm a loser
This guy is soooo enjoyful to watchh 🫠🫠🫠🤩🤩
One of your very best videos. Thanks Matt
Mat, I love your videos 🤩 they are great. I also love it to see u while enjoying the GT3RS🎉
if i get suepr worried everytime i here a tiny noise on my a class 250e i CANT imagine how would be to have a noise ina gt3 Rs i would die
I would've loved to watch a roadtrip with Yianni as well
Did it similar with the GT3 Touring. But in one weekend after getting it! ;) But I'm living no 80 miles away from the Nurburgring, in the middle of nowhere with all twisty roads.... So nothing hard to achieve! ;)  But we did an oil change after the first 1.500km before I used all the revs.
Might be an odd comment but Matt certainly an IWC guy 😊
Well done, fun sharing the cool part of owning a kickass brandnew car with an extreme rev limit.
I would advice you to get some "normal" wheels for daily driving and save these mag wheels for track driving and less stress while driving
Mat needs to go back and let Vallis drive the cars! 😍
Come on Mat do a fellow youtuber a favour an tell Mark Mccann how you managed to buy a GT3 RS "from Porsche" because he can't!!!
Does Car Vertical show how many drag races a car has been in?!? 🤔
Only 1 thing wrong with that Porsche and it aint the car
With every 250 miles you can increase the revs by 500 and on the flip side with every 250 miles the car depreciates by 5 grand 😂😂 3000 miles is classed as high mileage
Audi😍🚀
Every time you change gear it sounds just like my mouse button on my desk. 🤣
Matt, I would put an Air Duster Can in the car so you can air blast the stones out. Flicking them out with your finger might scratch the paint/weave as you push it. I am a bit finiky about that sorta stuff.
The most frustrating blue balling ever!
Change oil in engine and gearbox after the run in time. under run-in time i change oil often. expensive YES, but your engine and gearbox will love it. flush the gearbox and change all oil filters in engine and gearbox.
Did he just open the car and touched the glas :/ 0:08
Just imagine how fast that Porsche would be without the weigth of the PPF!
Put a legal plate on the front of it please 👮
YOU LITLLE SQUREL CAN T DRIVE AND YOU DONT UNDERSTAND SHT ABOUT YOUR CAR
Your devaluing the car running it in
Mat is - as the Brits would say - a really good bloke.  And I’m thrilled that such a talented (and clearly a genuine car nerd) has his dream car…..but I think there’s a problem with a car so precious that you have to be preoccupied with its welfare on a granular level.  This could be solved by being filthy rich (potentially but not guaranteed), but I’d rather get cars I enjoy driving and do two things:  1.  Maintain them sensibly and 2.  Drive them without hypersensitivity.  Look up Chris Harris’ old video on his old M5.  His relationship with that car is exactly what I mean.    For my part, if this sum of money was gonna go to a car vs education for my kids (ouch), I’d probably spend some quality time behind the wheel of a gt3 touring and a 911T and decide which suited me better.
Man your hand on the glass pane at the start 😭
OOOOO LOOOKS AT THIS ONE IT LOOKS LIKE A BOULDER!!!! THE SQUREL IS BACK AND STUPID
🤦
i would smash the back window in the r8, no use for that.
Ugliest 911 ever! Just as ugly as a track car it is made to look & be like, no charm at all!
first world problems... hell jealous.  congrats on wicked new toy
Mat is doing much math calculation for the rpm but then he went off his supposed rpm range and said "who cares" -.- @5:40
As a r8 spyder owner with 992gt3 experience i can say r8 would be just better for everything. But you have to keep gt3rs just because its more flex, more special, will make more money 😌
Too stressful to own 😵‍💫🤣
Agree but you have just made up a number, you’re not following manual or what Andreas suggested. Best get driving
Delayed Gratification 🎉
Higher load and lower revs is best for for running-in.
Controversial opinion but if you own a car like that especially fact these are like hens teeth drive the bloody thing, don’t get people who own such beautiful cars and have so little mileage I would be in it all the time
I personally think some stone chips and minor scratches look good on a racing car like the GT3. It's like battle scars on a veteran warrior.
The effective running in of a car is it's make or break for the rest of it's life. Food for thought for whoever's going to buy a used one for sure.  If I was going to spend this kind of money, I'd only settle for a brand new one.
i was going to buy a GT3 RS but didn't want the stones building up, so have stuck with my Fiesta which doesn't have this problem
My f type 5 litre cold start beats both hands down , the Porsche looks like it only belongs on a track, interesting about the seating and leg room in the R8
The problem with the GT3 RS is……. Absolutely nothing. 😂😂
Pains me everytime I see him grab a door by the window
Number plate looks like Mat Shit 😐
Smiling all the way watching this video) So happy for you, Mat!
what about the Dacia Duster run in procedure?
Matt Needs HELP ME CAR WOW! 😂
Great car just not a fan of that rear wing, that just ruins a great looking car.
At 1000 miles take it to 9000 once.  Then back the the careful run in.  But work the engine through the range al the time.  A lot of people get on the motorway and stack the miles up at only one speed.  I have always done the 500 rpm step from 1963 with my Lotus Cortina Mk1 and all the other car since then.  Even my family cars too.
You bought that package for the "click" shifter. My god it's annoying. Bye bye and enjoy! 😂
Not easy to buy it even if you have unlimited money. The "list" has many names on it. You have to be super lucky to own it.
That’s true as soon as you cross the border in England to North Wales you know they take care of their roads. They also keep the grass and weeds down, not compared to here in Cheshire where in summer time it’s a pain trying to get around a roundabout because you can’t see what is coming around. There rant over😒
With all the electronics manufacturers put in their cars these days, still, they can't bother to put an electronic rpm limiter so the car can properly run in!
Totally agree Matt!
The manufacturer's extended running in period is highly questionable in my view ... look up the Motoman method and reasoning behind short run ins!
Mat running this 500RPM over every time he unlocks another 500RPM.... gold but also can ya blame him?
What a great spec you did.  The wheels really make it special.
Your supposed to break it in? lol. I was doing 110 in my gt4, 5 minutes after I left the dealership.
What kind of watch is Matt wearing?
Thanks for having us feel your pain of not being able to see redline.
How many other porches did you have to buy to get an allotment?
I hate the plastic looking front lower grill area.  One thing bad about modern sports cars is the collection of stones and rock chips all over.  You have to PDF cars today with all the areo and vents.
It's absolutely beautiful there 😊
Those roads in the Elan valley are brilliant, when someone isn't going 40 in a 60.
That 992 is nuts!
Hi im Matt Watson 👁👄👁
Ohhh thank god that you are running in the engine properly and really you can wait even longer to rev it harder.
This is why I love mat...very relatable and exactly something I'd do.
After watching Mark McCann's latest couple of videos about trying to get the GT3RS, did I miss something or did Mat explain how he managed to get his?
Mine is orange and a bit older now. It's also stored at my place in Virginia (I live in Maine).  I miss it. I need one for up here. They're excellent cars.
Good on you Matt, if it were my car, I too would savour the experience and make every mile of running in a once in a lifetime memory 👏👏👏
*car makes strange noise* *blows on wheels*
Get out of my way people in old Toyotas. 😢 unsubscribe
Matt is so confident saying 'they are dying' 😅
Enjoy the process Watson. Once in a life time.
A case of the car owning the owner and not the owner owning the car.
I’ve a Peugeot partner tepee, it’s a weapon- do you want to swap?
I think you did the right thing running it in. 🤘
Used Car Dealer: "Well, Matt, you've got a hit for miles, and the color is not popular. It has aftermarket parts, and the steering is on the wrong side of the dash. " Matt: "Really? I am curious how much you would appraise my car for?" Used Car Dealer: "I tell ya what, them Porsches are sold around these parts for $140k*, but that ain't the price we would buy from you. $75k* as is, take it or leave it." *USD Matt: 😂🤣....and then a Car Wow ad/MWC ad continues the skit.👍👍
Nice trip porsche tipec club do many trips around here love the motor
Very nice Big Pilot Chrono!
well to each their own but when i bed in a car i get everything warm take it gradually to max rpms for about 100-200 miles then i run it like hell for about 400 miles at a time, works like a charm and give me the most power out my engines, did this with my 720s and sf90 and they put out the best numbers of any other.
I know what you mean about the V10 sounds Matt, when I drive my huracan on a motorway, if you are doing 70 and in 5th/6th, then floor it, you get a wonderful orchestral pipes sound from the engine that only happens at higher speeds and gears, the Lamborghini / Audi V10 is a magical engine, with real soul
How did you manage to get an allocation for your gt3 rs ? It’s well documented that you need to have a massive buying portfolio with a Porsche dealership to get an allocation for such a car.
lol this man over here whining about taking too long to get to 1000miles on his Porsche. While I already put 6800 miles on my brand new TRD Tundra I purchased only 4 months prior 💀💀💀
Awesome cars.  Weird dude.
I love that the recommended break-in RPM limit for the GT3 RS is higher than my cars redline 😂
It's the same for a new motorcycle
I mean the GT3RS but for what I’d use the car for I’d take the R8 every day
Matt - just wait until you have 3000 miles plus on that 911 GT3 RS - it will be covered in dings, chips, scratches and possible cracks in that fabulous carbon fibre trim, conveniently located directly in the debris blast zones of the wheels... You shouldn't ever be dropping the far side wheels off the tarmac in the turns... if you get too aggressive, pebbles can even get between the wheel rims and the brake calipers... I have seen this damage so many times here where I work, in the midst of a bunch of exotic car dealerships here in Vancouver, Canada. The wheel repair guys cannot fix Magnesium wheels like aluminum or carbon fibre wheels... We have more exotic cars in this city, than practically anywhere in the world. There are literally thousands of exotic cars being daily driven here, and they do get marked up constantly. You will just have to learn to live with it.
The key here is same as Formula 1. Your enemy is "engine harmonics". To avoid this you quickly change the RPM in order to get past any particular engine RPM that will induce a "resonant frequency" in a specific engine component like the piston or crank or engine block or whatever. This is why maintaining the same RPM is particularly bad and it's why going through the rev range is what you want to be doing all the time.
Maybe the 500 rpm interval is just for the driver to get used to the car and not kill himself :)
You are worried about a stone I am worried about how my family are going to eat this week pal
We've certainly come a long way from the channel about a guy with cars like a fiat 126, an mx5 and a 996.
Good for you Mat, I also did the same thing breaking in my new C8. Better safe than sorry!
Hi Matt I enjoyed watching this video.  Can you tell me what make of cube camera you used for your in car dash shots please  I look forward to your next road trip.
Did he buy the r8 or did Audi give for review
Did you do the launch yet with the car?
Why are you selling the R8?
Bro has an Audi r8 spider too 💀bro is doing pretty good in life 😅
Loving it Matt ! I am going to do the same with my Cayanne Coupe S ehybrid (ha ha ha ha)
oh my god you dont half woffie on just do what you got two do ?? how much this and that
Bloody awful car
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
That rear wing of GT3 RS in a roadcar is just stupid. Like pantomine of comic car Of course it works but still. German engineers: What do you mean. :) But have to say that the car channels that I follow, Britain is perhaps the worst country in the world to shoot car content. It rains 32 days on a month.
What watch is he wearing??
do a drag race and donuts ... instead with other people's gt3rs
I'm a Porsche fan but....that R8!! So beautiful!
Watch out for Gastapo police in Wales Boyo
legends rewinding to see the 790 duke
Did you use the DJI Pocket to film the rolling shots
Is it any idea to do all this if you don't change oil before revving max? I bought a new M2 and was as anal as you about breaking it in. Then it was time for oil change, before I could unleash the power. Had it for a year and then sold it 😂
how did you even manage to get one of these new? Arnt they really exclusive or something?
Run it in. Enjoy and take care of the GT3 ❤
I thought you were so supposed to heat cycle the engine and gearbox.
Well done Matt- you have done the right thing.
8:25 could have been the end of the GT3 RS then! 😂
What mat your is teinn❤
Fully agree...
You are right. This car is a dream. The best driver in the world says that “ the GT3 RS” is the car I would drive if I have to drive a car for the last time in life…. You got it! And as a dream use “ her” as you think is better with all the cautions you think are right. When it will arrive the”moment” the car will be ready to reach 9000 rpm will be an orgasm!
#runningitin
I think we should put this to a viewers vote to see how many people agree to let yianni loose in this GT3 RS
I think yianni should be allowed to drive it just like you did with his urus 🤣
Could a manufacturer put an electronic limiter on new cars that's gradually eased of with miles travelled?
Matt is that the 41mm or 44mm IWC watch ?
I put a Cosworth VQ35 engine in a 350Z years ago in Singapore, and drove round and round the island for 5 days before the tuner would work with it, was sooo boring, could not rev above 3k RPMs!
Really enjoyed this video :)
Do you not have to change the oil after the 1000 miles ? All the cars I've ever had proper engine work done to I've always had to change the oil before bouncing it off the rev limiter.
dont sell it and plz gift to me
932 miles and blew my 9k load!   https://youtube.com/shorts/4zRtT3Mo4So?si=xC2LmtnYi0orEsZN
looks cool and reminds me  the Fifth generation E60/E61
This porsche is stunning .......give us a lift, anywhere I don't care, just give us a lift 🙏🙏🙏😂
Not quite the ZDX it used to be, the original one was unique.😢😢😢
Lool, I actually thought the plates on the Porsche said MAT SIIT (mat shit)
This whole video is watching matt edging 👀😂
911s now are just ridiculous how big they are it’s pathetic
Cool story bro
I think Mat might be the only human being in history to savour opening Christmas presents until the afternoon when he was a child. Anyone else do that? Bless him.
Definitely agree with Caution over Regret, Loving the content Mat :)
What will really happen if you rev it up to 7k RPM when it’s new???
9:47 that reservoir seems very familiar wasn’t that in forza horizon 4?
Extraordinary that when paying the premiums required for these super cars and hyper cars, that you still have to run them in yourself. Some people might not even drive a car like this for more than 1000km per year, so (when factoring in dormant periods such as winter), it might be 18mths from delivery to 'run-in' if you take delivery in January. Utterly bonkers.   So, given the low unit numbers of something like a GT3RS and it's price tag, why hasn't it been run-in by professionals at the factory, before having a full oil/fluid change in anticipation of delivery to the new owner? Box fresh, out of the crate, ready to go? So they can enjoy it from day one and not spending every weekend they do get the chance to drive it, doing so at 3/4 revs whilst tip-toeing around the countryside?
whenever i read your license plate it says "eat $hit"
Not the best choice of plate.  At a quick glance  it looks like 'MAT SHIT'
Sucks to be Mat Watson eh?
Be cautious with rocks getting in between your brake and your brake shield which will cause loud scratching noises
I don’t understand the clickbait title. People would still watch the video without it.
The R8's at mid rev's and through the intake sound way better than its full bore out of the exhaust.
A sin to open the door by the glass
what a trip ! and that r8 sound is just *chefs kiss* 🤌
Sf90 and 765lt standing back there casually
22:00 That is how you know when you are too poor to own the car you are driving.
Keep saying “the cars I own” but if u own the r8 then why u giving “it back” and after 1 year are you “giving back “ the 992 ?  You don’t actually own car on pcp until you pay the final lump . It’s sounds to me like you rent a few cars at the same time 😮
The 992 GT3 RS is still an incredible car! If you want to get even more out of it, we make it possible 🙌🏻
Pinch yourself Matt! You are indeed one lucky bugger. Savor it, we’ll deserved. Best car, best engine. Nothing comes close!
I would do the exact same Mat
Really Nice IWC!
Who else skipped the Audi part?
That porsche is happy to have such a owner who takes a good care of it
I don't think he's very intelligent.
I agree with you doing a complete gradual run-in procedure all the way to 9500 RPM.  That's what I've always done with my cars.  Long term ownership usually benefitted from less oil usage and (possibly) slightly better MPG - not that you're likely to be concerned about that.  Apart from "just because you can" there's little need to max the car out for overtakes etc.  Those last couple of hundred miles will literally 'fly by'.  Then get an oil change and you can really start to enjoy the full dynamics of the car.
HE OPENED THE DOOR USING THE WINDOW! NO!
Just love seeing you drive your dream car.
😮😮
As a supercar owner myself, when I watch these videos I wonder - how does he manage width restriction barriers? Waze screws us all in the end 😂
who cares just drive the car
500,000 pounds for one of these in Australia. Insane.
You should never blip a cold engine ffs
great video Matt! I love to see more of your Porsche! I definitely agree with you, if you want to keep this car for a long time you should take care of it and properly run it in, don't do silly mistakes.
RIP to all the repair shops out there after watching the AD in this video 🤣😂💀☠ Sometimes you think Mat might be spoiled with his work perks, but then you watch then end of this video and see how humble and like "one of us" car guys he actually is
You should change the oil. It will have metal in it by default. Thats what running in is doing
And don’t ever  free rev it like you do normally. You’re an engineers nightmare
Nice watch matt. what model?
Did you pay your porsche tax (ie buying tons of porsches) to get your GT3 or did they give you a pass because Content?
I will buy the Audi, if the damaged is fixed by Matt Armstrong
Great video. I think you did right. I probably would have stayed below 5500 myself just because it's enough, a great pull and a high rpm. There are plenty of people out there that have different opinions! I myself would probably rarely go above 8000 on it here and there, only when I need to do the old Italian tune up, I mean German tune up. I know it's made for it but that is still alot of pressure on the engine and once again 7 to 8 is enough.
I get the same reaction from passers by in my C8 Corvette in Canada, even in the winter, for a quarter the price. Not a benchmark like the GT3 RS, but it doesn't have to be to have a blast.
Running in the engine should also say not to put much strain on it. That is to NOT go full trottle, and at the same time keep it under certain rpm's.
I hope your enjoying your car 👍
I don't mean to be mean... but... every time I see your number plate at a glance, all I read is 'MAT SHIT'.. 🙄
It will be fun to watch Matt go to Nurburgring with these treasures😄
100% doing the right thing👍. I’m not sure if my anxiety would let me enjoy a car like that, I’d be paranoid about everything. I’m willing to give it a go though!!
I’m sorry Matt. That Porsche sounds better than the Audi to me. It’s a screamer
That golf r which you disconsidering about his "310hp" could have a simple remap which would give him MORE POWER than YOUR GT3RS have at 5500rpm and have LESS drag than your EXPENSIVE porsche. Yes, still remains a poor fwd platform with that garbage haldex on the axle which should be the main one (but isn't), BUT about the power.. you are pretty ignorant.
That clicky gear change is beautiful. 🎶
Carwow sucks with the drag racing g crap
Nothing like YouTube going to a Sudafed advert just as you ticked over to 932 miles 😂
Collab with throttle house 🤲🏽
Way to practice “edging” with your car 😂😂
I’d just jack the rear wheels up, set the cruise control at 70 and let it spin until it runs out of fuel, come back, top it with fuel and do it again. At 70mph you could run it in in around 14 hours
It’s a joke you have to drive a thousand miles before you can use it properly. They should sell it run in
Matt practicing tantric run in…
British roads have gotta be the best for super cars, the slightly curved roads and clear views would be amazing, im jelly
This is such a geek behavior
conspicuous with that rear spolier....
And I was upset about the stones in my turbo intake ducts. Yours are much worse in the gt3rs.
Explain how you got allocation for this car.
I thought I was the only nut-case about cars (Porsches). I totally agree with your break-in technique! I love your GT-3 and the video.
When you were in the R8 you looked like you were enjoying the drive relaxed faf about with the roof and rear window. When in the GT3 YOU were hanging onto that wheel as if yer life depended on it. You needed a Taxi to get from the car to the pavement when you parked. R8 for me all the way.
I think you are doing it the right way for 2 reasons. #1 because the Porsche guy told you too. #2 because that’s what you feel comfortable doing. You’ll get to that 9,000 soon enough.
No one show Mat his engine being bench tested at the factory. These run-ins are all about heat cycling.
Don't the stones attest to the aero working?  Coriolis eddies in action depositing those rocks! Or, truthfully, they're non-functional, so Porsche has little Elves* following GT owners around and depositing rocks in there while the owner isn't looking!  * Famously known as the "Nine Elves," aka "Neun Elfers!"   😁
The ideal Porsche 911 GT3-RS break in program: 1)  First 10 miles, just idle around the parking lot. 2)  Change the oil. 3)  For miles 11-100, don't go over 1,000 rpm. 4)  Change the oil. 5)  Miles 101-200, don't go over 1,500 rpm. 6)  Change the oil. 7)  For miles 201-300 miles, don't go over 2,000 rpm. 8)  Change the oil. 9)  For miles 301-400, don't go over 2,500 rpm. 10)  Change the oil. 11)  Miles 401-500, don't go over 3,000 rpm. 12)  Change the oil. 13)  For miles 501-600 miles, don't go over 3,500 rpm. 14)  Change the oil. 15)  For miles 601-700, don't go over 4,000 rpm. 16)  Change the oil. 17)  Miles 701-800, don't go over 4,500 rpm. 18)  Change the oil. 19)  For miles 801-900 miles, don't go over 5,000 rpm. 20)  Change the oil. 21)  For miles 901-1,000, don't go over 5,500 rpm. 22)  Change the oil. 23)  For miles 1,001 onward, don't go over 9,000 rpm. 24)  Change the oil every 10,000 miles if a garage queen, every 5k miles if beaten mercilessly!
Just rip that thing who cares lol you're gonna sell it under 10k miles anyway
So how are people wrong about your GT3 RS ?
I’m not hating but this is one of the worst spec gt3 rs I’ve seen. The Matt gt silver with yellow decals ( especially on the rear wing) makes the car look cheap. This car doesn’t need any aftermarket touches it’s absolutely nuts from the factory. Remove all off it and get normal paint protection
Just rev it man
i definelty agree and respect Matt more for playing it safe especially with a car of such value
The dude is so annoying and anal to the point he becomes super irritating. I guess he is not flipping his GT3 RS after all. Maybe he will, because... it is Mat
1st world problems - geta grip...........................  GT3 RS = overpaid dweeb..........
i wonder if an r8 is a better car for road trips
The camera you use for CarWow is 10x better than whatever camera you used here
Just short shift and imagine your car has no torque at all. That will be enough to constantly changing gears.
Honestly just enjoy the car, the run in is fairly conservative as it is and there for all components not just the engine.  The key is getting the rings well bedded and that can be achieved by running down hill with foot off the gas pedal.  If you start doing regular track days don't forget to increase oil changes to every 5,000km or so.  They're very robust, what hurts them more than anything is not being used and run up to temperature.  From a maintenance longevity perspective the garage queens tend to come with a lot more problems.
Sorry 750s! Will last longer than that vw
Just get a 650s
Very little discernible difference in character between the engine in the 991.2 GT3, 991.2 GT3 RS, 992 GT3 and 992 GT3 RS.  The 991.2 GT3 RS makes the most torque.
I would rather be cautious with a car like that than take a risk, its worth waiting the extra 400 miles to be 100% certain
Stop putting your hands on your windows!!!!
how did you get a gt3 rs allocation
Nothing wrong with wrecked cars if there fix correct! Stop being so Booosey Matt! 🤣 4:45
It would be a shame not to take care of the engine or the car. I think you made the wright call
“I’m going to keep this car for ever” said every petrolhead in the world. Three years later they are browsing configuratiors… 🤣
You need to carry a small brush for the stones off your car 😂😂😂
Nice vid. Total car nerd geek out session. I remember doing the same thing with my 991 3RS.  Porsche GT cars. The best of the best
You're porsche's little advertisement boy aren't you. It's so embarassing.
https://youtu.be/fsYNfaB5om8?si=fWB6LZVQSnvWO1N2
https://youtu.be/gN7nkMVNR5E?si=JszKisJFQvYZf_of
As a Porsche tech here in Australia I advise changing the oil every 5000kms or so for purity and proper protection, that's every 3200 miles in your language. God speed.
Reviewing a new car that you have a snowballs chance in hell buying regardless of your budget.... ffs
Do the 1000 miles then charge the oil. Get all the break bits out of the oil 🛢 that's why it's called breaking it in. BREAK!!!!
Oh no stones? You know  you're gonna sell it for more than you paid...  you talk more shit than ten arseholes
And be honest... you know you acn sell it for more than retail ffs.
I've always heard so many different things from dealers and "experts" about run in protocols... The most consistent thing was make sure to vary your RPMs during the first 1K miles (ie no cruise control on long journeys).
I laughed so hard when the road was only big enough for 1 car. And you was like let that guy with his cheap car go over the rocks. lol
So developed, but stones stay in the aero and the wheels... really!!!
Ah man it sounded so good when he gunned it up to 5k... Sa-weet!!
change the oil at 1000 miles then drive it like you stole it.
These types of videos are amazing mat keep it up !
That gt3 rs is like a video game, leveling up and getting more upgrades as you play 😅
Porches attitude towards people buying rs's you would think they would bed the engine in.... did you spend over a half million before being eligible to buy one?
Thought you were going to explain how you got to buy one these given it's almost impossible 😅
Unlocking RPMs is like like unlocking a new level in a video game
not lame
I enjoy every second of you trip . The GT3 RS and the R8 V10 are gifted cars . I try to imagine the sensations when ou drive the GT3 RS . Thank you for the trip .
I've read tens of opinions about engine run-in processes- including opinions of professional engine builders - and the conclusion seems to be the following: doing it for the first 1500 km doesn't make any sense. The first 200 - 300 km is crucial and after that any break-in is no longer taking a place. After the first 300 km your engine is ready. Period. Doing this for another 1000 km or so could only be beneficial for other parts, like gearbox and other drivetrain components. These also need some gentle handling before they bed-in.
Seriously, after 26 minutes of waiting!!!
Floor it. It's just a car and You should not wait even a second. Live is to short. Have fan, Mat Watson.
I agree with you on running it in and taking your time.  Well done Matt.
This video Matt do yours self a uppercut go speak to some race car engineers engines  built & flogged nxt min on track Porsche & Matt wokenes 😮
if one day you dont need more this porsche if you want give me to me is a dream car i never have one in my life
It takes balls to run it in properly like you are doing. I unfortunately would run it in the same way🤨
do you own it outright mate....if you dont it aint ur car...
mat, you love cars, and i truly love that about you! thank you for giving us these beautiful videos!
Saying it’s not too stiff 😂 clearly kidding himself considering every other car reviewer has said it’s terrible. And the traffic on those Welsh roads and his sheer terror in using it with potholes, traffic etc etc showed how pointless these cars are.
13:20 Was this a pasta queen reference???
Car vertical the raid shadow legend of cars
Sell the R8 on Carwow😂
Why does mat use that piece of shit phone with the line down it?
Definitely need to do the Elan Valley to Aberystwyth road (via Cymwystwyth) when you reach that golden figure. And hopefully make the carwow main channel, could do a handling comparison
The stones 🤦‍♂️ What a car. Its enjoyable to experience every bit of it with you mate.
You're a "Lucky Bugger" indeed.  Great job on the video. Can you please tell me the make and model of the watch you're wearing? Much appreciated. Cheers
A lot of this is filmed very locally to me. Some of my favourite roads are in this video. I'd love to drive them in one of these cars!
17:18 did you hit a bird?
Mat, tell us how you got an allocation for the GT3 RS without buying lots of Porsches, while others have spent millions of pounds and have not been invited?  Did you take someone's allocation?  If not maybe you can share some tips?  It will be interesting to know.
It is unbelievable how nobody is talking about the gorgeous IWC he's wearing 🤷‍♂️
Not even 10 seconds in and already used the window to open the door
Love it.  Your car, your rules!  Its exciting to watch how giddy you are, Mat.  Being the aficionado that you are, having experienced so many awesome cars and the GT3 RS is the one that makes you a boy once again!  Cheers!
Like the vid, car wow needs to do more reviews on cars and less drag races
What kid goes "im going to save these presents untill later" on Christmas day 😂 the answer is zero! 😂
Stop touching the glass to open and close the door Matt!😱
off course many would agree of pro-longing the break-in period. ease of mind. and satisfying feeling of taking care of your own favourite car in the world. good job mat.
How do you race an AMG GTR to an A-Class then afterwards the A-Class dissapears with the prize😂😂
Completely understand - this is your car, not some "loaner".  Its a gorgeous car and it looks like you enjoy it!
Why does you number plate look like MAT SHIT ? just me ?
German engineering. Your welcome.
Just wanted to tell you about those little rock's you talked about and how they get in between those aerodynamic holes, mudflaps might help if they even fit onto it.
The clicks while shifting is music to my ears 😁
That YELLOW man😂 Why YELLOW ?
Why don't you just change the stock exhaust out if you want a better sound. Would probably improve the performance a bit as well.
I followed a GT3 RS recently. Every bump was seen and felt.  Still jel 😂
Matt don’t sell it you’ll lose money😂😂😂 NOT!
I agree with listening to Andreas. I read the same suggestion by him on a forum & I followed it to run my gt3. The engine turned out to pull harder than other gt3’s & gt3rs’s that didn’t run the car in properly
Spoiler alert  it's not really Mat Watsons Porsche  GT3 RS  for entertainment purposes only.
I imagine this is the only time you get to goofy smile as another 100 miles ticks over on your GT3 RS. Beautiful monster you have there Mat. Cheers
Matt has a new Timepiece on his wrist. He let the Galaxy watch at home and opted for an IWC Top Gun Pilot Chrono~IW389401
I love that porker and it's my dream car so I appreciate you looking after my dream car 😊
Can you get the inside of a wheel ppf?
Not sure if this is correct but I’m assuming thrashing it from 0 miles will only cause long term damage and I’m sure this a type of car you wouldnt keep long term and would swap it within a few years. (Seeing a lot of them in Tom Hartleys vids with only a few thousand miles on)  I might be wrong but why not thrash it and enjoy it from new knowing the only damage that’ll be done will appear long after you sold it? Anyone enlighten me lol! Cheers
Love the prolonging the process. It's a one time event with this car. Enjoy it Matt.  ps, I think you got the best colour car too.
agree
stop putting your hands on the window glass mat :/
Part 2 next
Totally agree with you Mat, it’s a very very expensive pride of joy. Plus in your line of work you can drive fast cars anyway so waiting to rev yours out will be worth the wait. Love the colour of the car and wheels. 😗👌🏻
Can we see a comparison with your 996 and the gt3, early 996 have some of the characteristics, if you know.. You know
what a tw4t of a number plate
My favorite car motoring journalist since the Jeremy, Richard and James honestly, you make up for their absence on our screens .
Great video! Watched it bell to bell. And I love the car and spec.
10:22 You can go over there in rubble, you're old  Probably should have edited that bit out!
Edging.......with cars.
@ 2:03 you went from 1st to 2nd gear over 5000rpm. You actually hit 5250rpm. Sorry Matt, engines toast & I'll take it off your hands right now!
Will that code work in south africa
5:16 is that panel gap normal? Looks uneven to me...
You should of just revved it out to 9000 rpm as it sounds like the big end has gone already
this video made me feel like the perfect daily would be a GT3 or a GT3 Touring lol all the complaints were fears of damaging the parts that makes it an RS around town
If the manual says 932 and you rev it to 9k and it blows up they'll give you another engine
You need some wire mesh/guard to cover the aero from stones... Bad design from Porsche.
Change the oil plieeeesssss
For the price the r8 gt is so underrated it’s got more power than the gt3 rs cheaper and a better engine and sounds better
Having a log book with mat watson as first registeed keeper is 🔥🔥🔥
When will we get content about yur Jimmny?
First world problems(not)
This car is so amazing ! I am talking about the Porsha of course !
Why do you keep holding the door from the glass!!!? That cringes me out in all of your RS videos
Omg : just run it in and crack on!
It's ok, ill drive it for you
6:39 "I'm really experiencing all the downforce now" Literally going 20mph 😂
This GT3 RS is impossible to get. You need to have bought many Porsches in the past to get on the “special customer” list to be able to buy a GT3 RS. Pretty crazy if you ask me.
Another you tuber with a GT3 blah, blah. Does get boring. At least you did yesterday a David Spring😂
I guess Matt skipped all the queues without buying other cars
whats the watch mattts wearin?
Is it just me or does Mat Watson look like Julius Caesar
Clickbate go away
Anyone suprised to see the dodge 3/4 ton around 8:30? I bet there aren’t a bunch of those around in Europe.
This was awesome. So much better than a boring drag race. Lets get content like this more often
Hey guys what’s the brand of those sweatshirts Mat is wearing ?
That phone is junk
Mat if anyone is mad at you for taking your time breaking in a very rare and hard to get car their lame. I bought a pp2 mustang brand new broke it it for 3000 miles changed oil twice and everything else before 5000 miles turbo that girl and she never missing a beat
Those smooth roads are all EU money. Wales was showered in EU cash, but they voted leave becuase they were lied to 😮 No huge investment in new infrastructure and roads for them anymore 😢
Just change the oil before you go to redline.
I will give a homeless person a DOLLAR for ervry like I get on this comment
How on earth did Mat get an allocation?
I use to get one Christmas present how much you use to get
need more vids like this
Running in procedures are nonsense with modern cars especially race ones, you should run it in by going up and down the gears at all different rpm, all you actually doing is debering the surfaces mainly the piston rings. You can actually smooth the bores by running at constant steady rpm.  One of my friends would run his engines in by thrashing them straight away then oil changing them, his bikes were always faster than normally bedded in one's 🤷‍♂️ the running in period is just manufacturers stopping people writing cars off until they are use to them and covering their own backs once you take it away.
Tantric Running In 😂
I wonder how many Taycans he had to buy ?
Is that car too good to actually use on normal roads
It’s your car deal with it the way will make you comfortable.  Side note “ be nice to the car so she will always be nice to you “ 😉
Good luck replacing that film over the carbon, the new 992 RS’s and 4RS’s are renowned for lifting all the lacquer off the carbon when removed 😅
Whats the point, you going to sell it after few years
Be cautious mate 👍
Anyone seen the google reviews for car vertical? Why would anyone accept this crappy company as a sponsor?
Loved the video Mat! The R8 is really a beast but the Porsche is an absolute monster.
Awww, poor guy in a mini van. 😂
I have never watched almost 30 minutes of a video without skipping 😐 lovely video Matt! Always looking forward to your uploads
Running in period is important stick to it
its such a twatty numberplate on the front.
maybe to change licence plate to 911 G,like GT3 RS or top G :D
Loved the video, totally agree with you on savouring the experience! What a cool car to do that road trip in!
The aero on the body of the GT3RS looks so cheap in that plastic get it to Yanni and have it all wrapped in carbon, cant believe Porsche didn't do it in carbon cheap skates.😀
I would have driven with an oil extractor and an oil change kit in the passenger seat, so I could do the change right as the number rolled over.
Great advert for Porsche 🤔
I bought a motorcycle and the dealer said I had to keep it under 3k Rpm for 650 miles to run it in. I lasted 4 and the had fun.
Any help or advice! Iv got my eye on a Audi R8 V10 for 80K about 45K on the clock (uk) say i had it for 4/5 months would i get my money back even if i only lost 2K max ? Just don’t fancy getting stuck with it
Obvs question, why the feck don't these cars get delivered run in from the factory.
Your GT3 RS looks like a million bucks. That Audi looks like it was painted “Tremclad Green” - with a brush. No comparison. And brown seats - don’t get me started…
Many here misunderstand that Mat owns Carwow and blame him for making too many drag races. I think Mat is just an employee of Carwow or he holds some shares of it, he actually could not make those decisions.
Very nice IWC Matt
I don't even need to finish watch this vlog. How can the Audi be anywhere close to the Porsche?
Sick car Matt and looks like so much fun!! Thanks for the entertainment and filling me with aspirations 👊
Matt, we can hear Hitler screaming, cursing, insulting at you in German direct from Hell.
Audi R8 looks 10 times better than GT3 RS😂
Anoing with thoose stone collectors on the gt3rs😂
Interesting fact that Matt said GT3 RS only 911 times
It’s under warranty so who cares 🤷🏻‍♂️. You only have to follow what Porsche says for the warranty to be valid.
Pin this
This type of car purchases is part of the car business.. about advertisement. Do you guys really believe he really paid it in his pocket.. lol
There’s no way I’d want to own that car. Because I can afford a gt3rs.  Not a bit jealous. More power to ya.
I'm thinking, can you have a 1000+ miles trip all in once, or you have to let it "rest" between 100 to an other?
Cars like that legit get spanked from brand new. People who can afford to buy cars like that can afford to fix things like that. I can't imagine they would have as much mechanical sympathy as somebody with their modest sports car
Although not the current RS, I will always regret selling mine - 5 years and 30k miles of great memories
You are a delayed gratification ninja! Well done!
You need an exhaust on that Gt3 RS, beautiful spec with that satin ppf!
I keep looking at Matt’s numberplate and now I think the numbers say something with the letter H that I can’t now unsee and certainly cant say 😂
Why aren’t you wearing your £10k Porsche GT3 RS watch Matt? Great video btw!
So...what happens if you exceed 3500k or 7000k rpm...LMAO
The "break in" period is a bunch of malarkey
Surely you can fix a mesh to the aero fronts.
he only needs an aventador and he'll have the ultimate volkswagen collection
Is it really a question as to which of these cars is the better road trier🤔😂
Weird I recognised the petrol station just outside Whitney on Wye 😂. Great vid
Those aero spots where stones collect … they are self-clearing. The self-clearing feature is automatically activated at speeds over 150mph. 😁
I'm edging to a video of Matt edging.
Mat is really like that kid who got his favourite toy. And he really deserves to enjoy it
Nice video, just a touch of smugness about owning an gt3rs, but then, I’d be smug too if I had one! 🤪😂
The CarVertical section is a bit rubbish to be honest. If a car was damaged and fully repaired properly, there should be no issue. Plenty of cars look worse than that Audi and insurers decide to repair them and there is absolutely no trace. Just because that one ended up being a write off, doesn’t mean a suitable donor car wasn’t used to repair back to perfection. Obviously, there are cowboys who try to bodge it together on the cheap but slating written off cars is a low blow
There is no engine in the world that takes 1000 miles to break in. Sometimes I wonder what the motive is to recommend such a conservative break-in.
Its all about cylinder pressure and getting the rings bedded in to the freshly honed bore, varied engine speed and load being key to good future  Dyno figures
** Spoiler alert ** - He never revs the car out to 9k. Don’t bother watching
i think Mat has the best looking  GT3 RS spec I have ever seen. The matt silver paint with the orange accent and the carbon looks amazing!
I don’t want to alarm you.. but in the first part on the way there your going the wrong direction 🤣
Gintani has recently done an exhaust for the GT3rs and it sounds amazing, like an F1 car, check it out Mat.
Hey Matt, this was kinda like engine forplay :P
Change your oil every 500 miles max!
I redlined mine right off the lot. Oops.
how is the ground clerance of your 992 gt3rs?
run in is BS... Just drive it
Matt not wanting to break his half $1 million sports car   … we get it.. 😅
PPF ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
The real question is, how did you manage to secure an allocation on this Porsche? From watching Mark McCanns videos, its extremely difficult to get one
I make the alloy that produces those wheels.
its funny how people with lots of money will find minor issues with expensive cars and watches.others will not even be aware,just happy to own it
Love Matt, but the reg would have been spot on if it was EAT 9IIT, rather than what looks like MAT SHIT.
Lost interest when he stuck to 7000! Not the typical Matt, only goes to town on other people's cars! Screw this!
straight snobbery, not about cars anymore
How did you cut the Short way too get a brand New GT3 RS. And a Nice video btw
I think you could hit it to 9000rpm but not with the full throttle!
Hey all...what's up with Philip Ireland? I take on the Australian racetrack?
What was everyone wrong about?
I love Mat, but hear him complain about his 992 GT3 RS is slightly repulsive 😂
Matt wasn't the R8 nicked while being delivered to you I still remember the video
the front hood is really terrible
I think you did the right think Mat. After all you did talk to the man who knows more about the car than anybody 😁 Enjoy it man, future icon !!!
Love it😊
Kudos. You own one of the best drivers cars out there. Enjoy! Cheers PORSCHE. Kicking ass with tiny flat sixes for over 60 years! Beeindruckend.
Wait, you have a NEW GT3 RS?
Love the gt3rs, but c’mon: Break in period, limiting rpm’s, oil changes = dinosaur problems 🦖
Matt, how did you skip the list to buy one?..... Mark did a video showing how he couldn't get one even though he has a load of Porsches and Supercars 🤔
Bro must be sitting good on Porsches client list.
You should PPF it if you haven’t already. What a beast of a car! Would love to own one one day!
I think running in an engine is overrated. Coming out of the motorcycle racing. Just gave it 2 or 3 decent heat cycles change, the oil, let it heat up slowly the next few rides at first but when it's hot just give it the beans.
Always thrashed my brand new cars from new and I've always felt it makes them faster! If it goes bang, thats what a warranty is for 🤷‍♂️ never had a problem in 8 brand new sports cars over the years 🤷‍♂️
Car edging LOL
I’ve enjoyed this video so much. Keep making these!
You went on about the PPf saving the carbon fiber, but the CF wouldn’t have chipped in the first place. So it makes no difference.
cool vid
Clickbait title: check  Overuse of CAPS in title: check  Picture of oneself in a staged “ohhh” expression: check   Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the effed up YT algorithm.
100% agree with you
To be honest i would rather have the R8 and i really dont like the mk2 i much prefer the mk1 its so much prettier.
Mats wheels cost more than my car🥲
That's a bit wild saying you'll never own a car like that again because it's only 2024 when are the last petrol cars before they have to be hybrid 2035 so 11 years that's a long time and I'm sure their will be many special versions from now till then
Both the Porsche and Audi R8 like all sports cars are simply pointless. And this is coming from someone who previously owned two Porsche 911's in his life.
So jealous! Lol. You've got to give it a launch for us when it's finally run in. You feel the way about the GT3 as I do about my stinger. Never sell! Different world, granted but I know how you feel.
Solution is to give that lemon to me.
This sounds like a nightmare
Mat is living his inner Top Gun with his IWC watch and amazing GT3RS. Hands up who’s jealous?!
This is the most beautiful car I've ever seen.
Wait til you get the tires up to temp on a track with gravel around.  Here in CO we have rocks in our soil at the tracks.  All the well used on track GT cars are peppered with rock chips on the paint and wheels.   Wheel stripes inside from gravel getting caught by the calipers.
Dang, that R8 spider looks fine in green. Sorry not a big Porsche fan. But your vids are always cool.
Mat, I'm lucky to spend my days driving most of these roads, unfortunately for me it is in a vw van. You're so lucky to have these cars to use
starting to think Matt has a watch collection he hasnt shared yet.... a future episode perhaps Matt???? 🤔
Way too stressful owning a gt3 rs
Is Matt sponsored by IWC now?
Ill volunteer to drive 450 miles like a granny for you no problem Matt <3
That oil change after break in is very important from what i read been wrong before tho
Better safe than sorry. I would have loved to hear that beauty red-line at 9,000 rpm, but I would hate so see something go wrong with it. So I say you made the right call!
Do a few drag races with it 😂
Congrats to your lovely car! First time watching your own channel. I always thought your name was Emma (as heard the carwow intro), but now I know it’s Mat.
Car vertical??????!!!!!!!!! Maaaan where's carwow😂😂
Enjoyed the video.    What timepiece are you wearing?❤❤❤❤❤
Definitely prolong the run in process Mat! Tease yourself! Never listen to the manual either 😅
You Big Wooooos, I went to 9000 rpm as soon as I could. Then 4 month later sold the card.....LOL
Good work, not sure I would have the self control not to rev it out. I agree though your doing the "right" way keep it up.
I think you right to run it in the way your doing surely the guy that helped design and build the car knows best?👍
Matt's worried about stones making the car look bad while he has that terrible gold lettering. I'd rather have stones.
There are many different theories on breaking in a car, but it sounds reasonable to me 👍 In my GR86 I started at 3.500rpm raising 500rpm each 250km. That means it took me 2.000km before getting to 7.500rpm redline. But many people even take a lot longer.
wow, you are driving a car. One would think a car is supposed to be driven... Oh, I forgot its an investment asset, nvm
Regarding the running in of the engine by Porsche rules or that other guys (can’t remember the name). I say “you paid for it so YOU decide” it’s not a cheap car so I’d air on the side of caution too. Correct decision as it’s not a press car and the bill comes out of your purse.
572........   i would have done that the first day.....      LOL
What camera do you use ? @Matwatsoncars
I think most GT3 RS owners would have ran in in the first 24-48 hours
I was really disappointed with my car vertical checking!!!! There were anomalies on the mileage report and I couldn’t get hold of anyone on the phone to speak to had to send an email in and wait for a reply very dissatisfied and disappointed as I wanted to purchase a vehicle and couldn’t get a resolve on the issue
So many hot cars.  Iam sure you could sell that little boxster to me; could you? :)
Edging 😂
The R8 cold start is not better! Just different. They both sound amazing.
.Matt  how many porsche you had to purchase to get an allocation for the RS?
And it’s Rhayader not the way u spelt it in the video 😡
Matt edging himself with the RPMs increase is almost as hilarious as saving Christmas presents to spread out. I think the spirit of the GTRS is to let er eat
What a shitebag
Rather the r8 so sexy
I used my mates r8 spider and it was far to small  A proper shame as it’s a beast esp when you bolt a supercharger to it to😊
I like your IWC Top Gun! I’m wearing my AMG Petronas today…
Unnecessary Clickbait title, for what was a great video.
In almost all of your videos you seems to really love the cars from Tesla. Why not sell your fleet and replace it with Teslas?
I did the same thing with my 2019 991.2 GT3.  Have it a little extra time and gradually increased the max revs.  Definitely a test of patience but I too want to keep it forever.   😊
Alternative title: Mat edges himself and his GT3 RS in the depths of Wales
This video gave me blue balls.
Break-in for 930mi. I love German thinking and approach. It's my siblings from another mother.  So the GT3-RS has P-Tech and the GT3 doesn't?
do people who buy cars on lease deals run in the engine
can you please upload a video where you take your driving test please. It’ll be Fun
Yawn
Police in Wales may have you for that small plate.  I got stopped one morning and ended up with £100 fine.   They’re bored over there mate so these things give them something to do!
From one side it’s wired to see how a man are doing stops complaining he cant release whole rpm but the same time the feeling is very close to me as i failed to not high rev my macan before 3000km ten times or so 😂
I have never heard a dealership or employees of corporate Porsche pronouncing other than Por-sha !
you can rename this video to "how to Edge your Porsche".
Well, it is not a PORSH..... So it does not matter at all.
These absurd run in procedures are just another perfect example of why EV powertrains are superior.
I completely agree Mat!! Good for you for being patient!
i dont understand how you even got one allocated. Greased some palms no doubt
Love thisntype of content, please do more Mathew
You should know that it is a stunt from automakers to say you have to  first run in a car as it already do like a few hundred in testing. And 1000km is the guide not 1000miles so on 650miles you can push it in the red already
After years of watching you I've only just realised how well you would do as Bez in a happy Mondays tribute band.
Any one criticising the O/T at 7.07. The view opened up nicely before he committed. No issues that I saw.
Well...i would'nt redline it until i change the oil first.
It’s your own car so yes better safe than sorry especially if you intend to keep it. 👍🏾
Matt was edging so hard in this video 🤣
Love this type of road trip Vlog video
How dare you say BALD Man! Racist!! He may have Chosen to be a Man with limited Hair follicles!That's his Right. Bald Men's Lives MATTER!!😢🤣
It is a bit shame that nobody can have it but very nice GT3RS..
Love the update but also ❤️ the look of your watch! What is it I want one, but I don't I think I could afford it...🤣🤣🤣
I can’t wait to see someone twin turbo a 992 gt3rs
Before watching the video I'd bet on the Audi being the better car for a roadtrip. The GT3 would be too extreme
Bro i drive a toyota corolla 2005 and it's 130 hp i sometimes wonder what is it's like to drive like a 600 hp car
Sorry but "Car vertical" is literally a pure scam for the rest of Europe. A Complete waste of money and you shouldn't advertise them cause of that!
Looking how Marc McCann got his GT3, how did you just waltz into a dealership and buy one for cash? something dodgy going on with this dude
Clearly, you should ignore all advice from Porsche since they don’t even know how to run in their own engines… allegedly 😂
The Audi is a great colour / interior combo. Sounds incredible as well.
What watch is Matt rocking on his wrist? 7:36
You should come do the woodhead/snake pass loop up in south Yorkshire and north west Derbyshire.
26 minutes of watching Mat edging was not what I thought I needed and yet here I am
What the actual f**k! It's nice not like we are in 1963 and cars need to be handled like this....
if only WomanVertical existed
Wait…. Is this his private garage ?
Love the video and the car but please stop grabbing the glass when you open the door.
Its of my dream cars  and my favorite ia the porsche carrera gt
So I'm guessing I was misinformed all these years about Porsche.  I was told the engines were broken in at the factory.That the engines had 1000 miles put on the engines at the factory pre installation and that you could just get right in them upon delivery and beat the snot out of them.
Mat you are a car guy i dont know are you touching the window glass when opennig the door
Great video enjoy your beautiful car❤
Matt love the car rlly but could u try the r8 gt I am not sure but seems like a cheaper 911 gt3 rs but I think it's a good car
You rich mofo 🤣 Love it mate
Mat it's really 1000 km not miles I know this for a fact so 600 miles and you good to go. My father is a Mac my stepfather is a Mac and my grandfather also. Here in South Africa 👍
Bung it into Porsche as as soon as run in, for an oil change. Sometimes old skool ways remain the best...most motorcycles still have an oil change when run in
Good on you Matt. What a car!
I want to know how much Matt paid over the sticker for this. Or who he sucky sucked
i don't know what it is about the r8 but in my opinion it's such a bland car... understated super car, yes, yes... but still. it might have a great engine (at least the older ones?) but apart from that... cool looking from the front but really boring overall.
Everyone Is WRONG About My humble bragging!  ^__-
Mat, there's a solution for you - don't sell R8, so you won't miss it 😜
8:26 that was not a safe pass at all.
Porsche missed an opportunity to come up with a GT3RS branded brush, made from the hair of some exotic animal, to brush out the stones.
The Welsh (the original English) have bowed down to the Welsh government and allowed them to reduce the speed limit to the number associated with their government's collective IQ. Cowards much?
u just touched 6000!!
I really enjoyed this video. I like almost all of the videos, this one though is very good. Thank you Matt. 😊
Love the video Mat
Does automatic obey the reduced red line?
Awesome sound this 992 GT3 RS’s engine
It would be awesome if you plan a race with the RS against Mat Armstrong's GT3. Mat vs Mat, GT3 vs GT3,
What is everyone wrong about exactly?
I think Porsche know better than that guy you were talking to...
Do u think someone will take your headlights on your Porsche
Excellent job , I did 932 on my gt3 and did 9k ones, than only few 9k til 1500mi , I know the feeling 😂 , the main think is , you can replace gt3 and not really RS 💪🏻
How have you left the exhaust on the R8 stock?   So much more glorious sound there just waiting to be unleashed.
The fastest car is a hire car ragged from day 1 ;)
GT3RS sucks big time dude?. Porsches allowing dealers to add massive Dealer markups and ask buyers to purchase multiple unpopular massively depreciating crap form Porsche to be considered for a GT3RS. The dealers can keep them👎
It's there no break down lane on British roads? So if someone gets a flat one side of the road gets stopped?
Not gonna sell it forever means until the contract ends always. Heard that too many times
1st world problems .
License plate is badass. G status
Why would the manual say one thing but Andreas say different 🤔
Mate, this mat finish is so horrendous… pls remove asap 😢
Could have asked it again to be sure
that is one beautiful car
The matte wrap and yellow sticker were terrible choices. Such a beautiful car made dull
1000 mile run ins are absolute nonsense, no idea which manufacturer started that. A few hundred miles of getting it up to temp and gradually increasing the load till you do half a dozen full throttle full rev range, you are bedding in the piston rings and that's it
@21:50 are the brakes meant to have all that cracking? looks excessive but i don't know
bro istg last time i checked matt was driving a 20y/o porsche now he's BALLING holy shit good for him
If I had neither and had to only buy one, I’d buy the R8. But if I had both, then it’s the GT3, obvs 🎉
I’m embarrassed for you. That car owns you. You don’t own that car. It was meant to be driven. You treated it like a golden unicorn from the moment you ordered it.
why dont porsche just build in a rev limiter on the break in period which increase the revs to distance covered, surely that would take the myther out of looking at your gauge for the run in period
My bro here is edging himself to rpms😂😂
There's no bed in period 😂  . The components are as fresh and tight fitting as they'll ever be.  a ''bed in period'' is them admitting parts aren't 100% to tolerances and will machine themselves .   " Max its a new engine so dont go past 6krpm in Q1  '' <<<< see how derrrrr that sounds 😐
Nobody cares.
drive it like you stole it 🤣
If you need to get some miles on it let me know 😂😂
Looks like they lent Matt the R8 that no one wanted. Horrible colour inside and out.
Too bad you dont have any interesting well modified classics in your collection just the usual boring cars anyone can get. I mean some 190E with 5.0 v8 manual or e30 with m3 3.2 engine etc
I feel like engine load is much more important than the revs while running in an engine
The GT3RS just seems an exercise in hype. Slower in the real world than a Turbo S. Okay it looks nice. But they are selling for £350-400k and they won't hold their money. Look at the prices of a 10 year old one.
Not much room for a baby seat and the Mrs though lol
Hi Mat, What watch are you wearing?
New cars have roller everything so they don't need running in. It's only the cylinder rings. You want to vary the load for a while and no wot. But I'm not sure I have heard of rings causing an issue. Old cars would destroy camshafts before they hardened and bedded in but new cars are roller. Old cars were also built to bad tolerance.
I don't understand who in clear mind chooses a roadster over coupe when they buy a R8 😐
If you squint really hard the registration plate says "MAT SH*T"
Great to see you enjoying the local Welsh roads. Fab tour to run in the GT3 RS😊
Brilliant matt and i think your rite doing the run in like your doing ❤
Mat ... tell us how you got that GT3 RS allocation.
You should do a 1st service or atleast an oil change after the break in period , it is greatly recommended! before hammering the engine down to its fullest!!
so many people make regrettable decisions in the name of content. I'm glad you were smart enough to just do what you please with this car. Such a monster, enjoy it.
Good points about driving the R8 vs GT3RS. The R8 is the more livable and comfortable super car experience. The GT3 RS is the more exhilarating and connected “Motorsport” experience. Both are awesome with what they offer, it comes down to what you want. They are certainly different enough to make the argument to keep both!
Just talked my son through running in a new engine slowly. He now rips it with full confidence 😎 best way in my unimportant opinion 👍 Got to say,  tis a beautiful thing 👊
Gathering grit and stones... Is that not just bad aero, creating low pressure pockets and creating drag?
Straight pipe the RS.
Crossgates to Newtown Road is the one 👍
These are ridiculous specs. The factory runs the engine in before installing in the car…
I’m a millionaire who’s got rich from YouTube while real people work there ass off for 25k a year and am showing off how poor you guys are and how smug I am and then I get fellow millionaires to drag race me down a strip , aw my life is so bad guys …
You'd think that with all the tech the car would slowly release the revs over the course of the first 1000 miles, they could optimize it based on the distance, amount of time spent in various gears etc. Each time you start the car it should pop up a notice that it's in the bedding in period and revs will be limited to optimize the long-term performance of the car. If you override this bedding in process it will put a black mark against the car for the life of the engine for any following owner to know the procedure wasn't followed.
new watch ?
Definitely change the oil and filter after running in.  Patience!
So why didn't you take a trip all the way up to the north of Scotland   around trip up and down  would have given u a lot more miles  🤔   do u not like the roads up here in Scotland  or is there another reason  🤔 😐
Ohhh no My areo catching stones !!!
You're only allowed to rev this car when the earth is in direct juxtaposition to Jupiter, and Venus is retrograde.....
Before you’ve even started we know the answer. Two different cars.
I buy a car not to practice mathematics and arithmetic. I buy a car to just get in and drive.
Matt be edging himself
At wow has become so bad. Drag race the washing machine and vacuum cleaner etc. No regular car reviews for we the normal folks
“Im a lucky bugger” understatement of the year Matty.
car going through the different levels of super Saiyan
Wow!!!!
After watching some other YT vids on the process of getting a GTS...how did you get your GTS.  Did you have to buy a pile of other Porches first?
Hello Mat, I agree with the caution. I’m going through the same angst with my 992 Gt3 RS. I went to Oulton Park, and suffered all day. However, the same thinking, up and down the box, gradual breaking in of the tyres and brakes also etc. Too expensive and too long on the wait list for allocation to screw it up for the sake of a few miles… Enjoy. Btw Carrera Silver, Satin Black Wheels, WP, Black Callipers ;)
Guys, was this video uploaded or shot in a very low bitrate?
I still can’t stand the terrible yellow gold lettering
What ever happened to bringing an engine up to temperature then just drive it!  Anyone ever do a scientific study on this comparison?  (1000 mile break-in procedure vs. just drive it after engine reaches operating temperature) I’d be curious and interested in seeing this.
The 911 is fooooking awesome looking from the back on those little roads, I hate been poor 😢
Mat really knows how to do his thing   That joy you get when you finally buy your favorite car
GT3 RS is a track tool, we all know you bought it as an investment or for its agressive looks.
Carwow has turned into an EV sausage fest of late. Also has Matt ever said too avoid a car once?
A483 up past Llandovery. Drive a truck up and down there all the time
Thought his number plate said mat sh*t when I first read it 🤣🤣
Matt, you want to see my BAC Mono after a road drive. You practically need a broom to sweep the splitter and floor panels of stones, I'm afraid it's an inevitable consequence of these sorts of cars!
The best car for the job will be the 765lt on the top!
Too cautious! It won’t hurt. But it’s not necessary.
In my RS, I waited to 932 miles (exactly) then nailed it to the red line. Lovely feeling!
You cant drive with potholes? 😂 so take it out of uk 🇬🇧 😂
This video is the equivalent to edging
Mat the R8, how is it a 23 plate from 2021? The car you have was registered in April 2023, so how does the car vertical say 2021?
I think Mat might be the only human being in history to savour opening Christmas presents until the afternoon when he was a child. Anyone else do that? Bless him.
All this to show the Audi for sale
I laugh at how you are like “it’s my favorite car in the whole world” but it’s a brand new model, not something that has been around for years.  But also, I wish I could be you.
Come on! One is a track car and the other is essentially a GT car by the standards of a modern of new sports cars especially given it’s a convertible.
Andreas said 50 miles and you changed it to 100 miles for 500 rpm. Why Mat? You know better?
Plz ensure Sam stays when Yanni is back
I would say drive it how you will drive it. What I mean is that if you're going to drive it hard the piston rings have to seat that way - or it will burn excessive oil when you do drive it that way. I'd slowly get it there but breaking it in like a normal car will not be the way - perhaps better for a road car and how it will *ACTUALLY* be driven 98 percent of the time but less than ideal for a track car.
Don't like gt3 ...audi better
didn't even notice that almost half an hour has passed since I clicked non this video. love these kind of videos mat
I love the spec on the R8 spider, green and tan alwaya works so well
Whats wrong is that it isn't my gt3
take it to the Nürburgring with misha
Are you going to race the Porsche? How are you going to use the horsepower and all the race goodies?
R8 in that color combo looks better, also it sounds better. It all depends on other things form then
Nice licence plate bro🙌👍
Wow, you read the brochure
I still can’t get on board with the gold decals they just look washed out against the silver. Other than that it’s the mutt’s nuts!
In Andreas we trust (he’s the expert!)
Brilliant aren’t they Matt - they get better & better😀 Next - get a JCR valves exhaust fitted. So much better sounding.
Looks like a really exciting car to drive, but it doesn't look that great.. and that humongous fixed rear wing on a road card just looks completely ridiculous, but it is great to see your boyhood enthusiasm for it.
22:15 I know exactly how Matt feels.  I bought a 2023 Mustang GT a year ago and any time I hear just the tiniest noise that I think shouldn't be there I start sweating.
Pretty much all engines what you should do in run in is: 1 don't put pedal to the floor, max half throttle or so. 2 for the first thousand miles don't go past half the max rpms of the car. 3 don't go to highway at constant rpms, make the engine happily go through the revs (respecting the previous limit i said). After that, change the oil and filters and it's good to go full performance!!!
Good fun bumping into some CarWow fans on a country drive, because you know they're going to be car guys.
pretty sure he was referring to KM.  Why would a German be referring to miles?
The induction sounds made on the high gear low speed load pulls in the R8 V10 reminds me of the 2.5T Volvo engined products like a pulled Mk2 ST or V60R, also gives air induction of an old 1600 Alfa Giulia Sprint
Matt, this breaking the engine in is such a load of bollocks… you are taking it beyond religiously 😂😂
Elan Valley is beautiful, really nice journey there from the Midlands too.
I understand he's a Journalists but having seen Mark Mccann vid but im curious how he got an allocation
Mat your advent calendar analogy is genius. It’s spot on !
Maybe you'll can use or top gear strategy. Touring
I got a stone stuck between the calliper and wheel in mine, nasty grinding sound and scored the wheels not nice.
You have the best number plate!
Nothing like edging your new Porsche!
After watching Mark McCann Porsche video. We want to know how you got the gt3rs 😅
I think you shouldn't do continuous pulls all the time during the break in period at any RPM range, believe it or not it does more damage than revving above the advised range once or twice  during break in.
All we want to know is, how did you get on the Porsche list for the GT3 RS without wasting tons of money at the Porsche dealership, meanwhile others struggle to get one
I'm still wondering how Mat got an allocation for a gt3 rs without buying countless new non gt products 1st? like everyone else.
I wish to ask, which is your opinion about the Porsche Dealers, are not selling this car 911 GT3 RS to any one( which is having the more then 260 000 GBP), only after the buyer have buy it from the same sealer of that dealer other 3-4 other cars and even then is not 100% sure is going to get it!? I am not against some one to get 100 000 GBP more on the top of the new car price, but I am against if I have the money to not get it from the dealer if I am crazy enough to pay this kind of cash in this way! Maybe I do not know how the things are going in the world but personally I think is just stupid !
Personally I just love the content where Mat goes on road trips etc instead of the usual boring drag races or standard car reviews! Some memorable old videos are for example the Jaguar F Type road trip, or the offroad tests. More stuff like that please Mat!
Your stone in the wheel noise I had the same on my new 992 GT3 I was like🫨wtf I reversed the noise went away a small stone in the caliper I think 🤷‍♂️ then I stopped at traffic lights and had steam out of the front grill my heart ❤️ sunk I thought 😫 burst radiators utter water press. good I called a friend at Porsche he said its fine just water falling onto the hot radiator pipes 🤦 😂😂😂
You got GT3 for free anyway
Finally a decent watch IWC
How to reduce the value from 385,000 to 300,000 lol
You can't blame mat for being careful running it in. It's a mega expensive car that 99% of people watching this will never be able to afford and if he wants to keep it forever its a good thing. 👍
I’d follow the manual.  😢
In theory you should just beat it Your thinking waaaay to much about it
No one cares
4 ads in 5minutes? Stopped watching…
Gutted I’ve got long legs. Good job I can’t afford a r8 😂
Mat saying 'GOODBYE' with his RS in the thumbnail(nice), then covers those boring(ish) running in miles with a payed video whilst giving us the lowdown on his soon to be sold Audi(insert Car Vertical 20%). Talk about drawing us in and getting paid to kill two birds with one YouTube stone.😮
If it was me I would he never want to sell this car, please keep it forever..!!
Fair play! If your keeping it forever it’s all about longevity. Bit different if you’re kicking the can down the road every 3 to 5 years. Epic motor so drag out that excitement for as long as possible. With electrification on the distant horizon who knows if there will be another car like it.
So.... Germany is a decimal country, that being said, it makes absolutely no sense that the car would need a 1600Km (1000 miles) run in. Im tipping that the run in period is 1000 Kilometres, which is 620 miles, usually rounded up to 650. You said that Andres was speaking in terms of Kilometres. 932 miles is 1490 Kilometres. I believe that's your 1000Ks run in period + the extra 500 Ks to safely use launch control.
That constant clicking of the Weissach pack gearbox would do my absolute nut in. 😂
Just wanted to say I havent been able to take you serious since your review of the Jimny, Jeep, and G Wagon. That was the most uneducated and watered down, and most biased review ever.
I had to do the same thing to my C8 z06. Keep RPM's under 5500 for the first 500 miles. Some people said 4500 but then again some people didn't care and went to redline the first day they picked up the car. It was hard though not exceeding 5500 as this car wants to rev, just like the GT3RS.
8:55 is that Doldowlod Mat? I spent many caravan holidays there, beautiful place. I'm sure that building in the background used to be the Vulcan Inn. The hill in the background is called Drum Du, and we used to have races to the top. My record was 14 minutes 😂
The main thing with running in an engine is while keeping the revs low, apply plenty of power and acceleration within those constraints.  Do not let the engine labour.
Matt for god sake drive that car to 9k rpm 😁
your doing the right thing matt, after all its your baby.
Oh my god.  You trashed all other's cars and you baby your GT3 RS!!!!!  Not fair!!!!!!!!!  haha
floor it
Can we haev a 20% off voucher for a GT3 RS. Maybe we can then club together and get one? 😦
I assume that you are driving a convertible with the windows up because of recording and you aren't really one of those people who drive with the roof down and the windows up like it's your time of the month. 🤔🤞
Recognizing those roads from JayEmm on Cars' videos
That was so malicious to let us wait till the end and then NOT REVVING IT UP TO 9000rpm!! Fat dislike!
Nice IWC Pilots Top Gun 41 mm black ceramic 😮
If you take off all the dumb decals, you only need to run them into 500 miles.
As tempting as it is, you are doing the right thing
We do understand Mat, and we are happy with You :)
PPF on the rear bumper seems a bit lacking around the edges
As long as I would need to worry about stone chips and rattling noises and scratching expensive wheels I stay with my ford tourneo courier 😂 No honestly, owning a fast car I would like to thrash it and at the same time i understand it is an expensive thing you need to care about. So this is probably not my cup of tea
Its still crazy that you got an allocation for an RS
Matt, b honest. What buying history do u have ? Or is it coz your matt
Break in period? In Detroit (and snow states) all the new cars parked in a dealership lot get cold started, immediately moved a few feet, then off. Then, once the SNOW is cleared, they're started again & moved back...In the dead of winter, every single time it snows.
Good video, a proper driver's video and it's good to see how you are living with the new GT3. It was also really interesting to see the comparison to the r8.
good to see Matt running into the new British migrants down to earth with the people while promoting a German brand for the EU
Mat just convinced me to buy a gt3 rs at 15 y/o with a total of 15$ to my name
Think I'll tell Porsche give me my RS at 1000 km's. The break in period sounds brutal lol
Millionaires problems! 🤷🏻‍♂️
Isn’t the R8 a long term loan?😅
Drink every time Matt says GT3RS 😂
So what is everyone WRONG about?
First world problems lol
running in is so stupid. For 300k they should run it in for you :)
Running car in = gay
Matt , how much petrol did you use on your Wales trip .. How many miles ??
We understand matt what a car everything it worth it for gt3rs❤
I was never interested in the R8... Did Audi ever have any ambitions for a fast lap on the Nordschleife?
Great to see the fun you have running your favorite car GT3 RS in! Enjoy it as much as you can!!! It would be my favorite car aswell I'd guess. I loved owning my Porsche GT4! 🤩🤩🤩
You simply cannot enjoy these cars without actually tracking them in a safe environment. The limits cant be tested anywhere except on track.  Those passing maneuvers could have been complete disasters anywhere in the world.
loved it
He said best you flip it for for money before it goes down in value after 100 miles ?
So bored, eating a ham toastie,.i turned off. Lastest 5.minutes
Great to see your love of the car, really genuine, puts a smile on my face!
I'd trust the engineers and people who designed it, hence the manual, for break in over a driver. Plus car expert proved you don't even need to stick to thr manual for break in and you'll be absolutely fine.
Ultimate form of edging
Brilliant video Matt 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 good to see more of your gt3 RS
What a life
26:34 no Mat, i think myself and many other petrolheads would probably do the same - like you said its a once in a lifetime experience!
You made the right decision! I`ve had the same experience with girlfriends if you catch my drift? I always used to regret getting `nudge, nudge, wink, wink, say no more` to soon haha!
Mat is edging his RPM limit
20 mph in Wales!!
Just a quick question, Mat. In your videos, I usually see you driving on the road with eyeglasses/spectacles, but on this video, you are not. When do you drive with eyeglasses/spectacles?
Who knew Mat was an edge lord?
22:25 you cant help but be anxious when you have wheels which cost as much as an entire E39 M5
It’s more like ‘hey baby, just the tip’.
Brother don't get me wrong. Your car is fantastic, but this number plate is wrong. T in MAT is too far away from A. The II's are so close to each other. There's a general problem with letter spacing. Why I'm saying this? Everything looks so perfect with the car, but that number plate..
Damn it, would have run it in if you just told me😅 for free
Am a bit undecided by this one .....  goes along the lines of what the americans say , If you can´t afford to break it , don´t buy it . Where i live in germany we have fantastic windy country roads , and with 100 kph ( 62 mph ) speed limits , great for fluid driving UNTIL ....  someone with an expensive toy thats way more capable ... almost does an emergency stop at every twig or micro pothole on the road  Oh and about running in process , thought that was common knowledge with all cars and motorbikes ?
Pleasantly surprised to not see the usual "wrong!! Proper break-in is to drive it like you stole it!". Yes, definitely gonna believe you over all the top auto engineers in the world 🙄
Dont trash it. Preserve it and have it make some moneeeey.
Mat you are a wonderful person. Throughout the whole years I've never seen u getting such an emotional with any car. I can feel it. Bless on u borth you and ur gt3rs.❤ I cant wait to put my hands on my own 911 one day. Hope it will come in near future :-)
That’s why bought Bmw XM
How did you get your allocation?  Did you end up buying the 3 Tayxans?
If I owned one I would do exactly the same. I remember when my mum bought me my only new thing a Yamaha DT125LC trail bike back in the summer of 1985 and remember still running in that thing that I loved and then doing the 1000 miles and revving over 3000 and the feeling was awesome on my midnight rides home along the Cornish coast from Perranporth to Portreath. BTW I would never sell the GT3RS either Matt. Why the Mag wheels though?? A lot of worry and cost. Great Vid 👍
I bet Watsons  2year old TV still has plastic around it😂
RS is too much for the road R8 is far more special as a road car
Andreas way instead manual yeah!
Loved the video. I really respect your decision on making the car last for as long as possible 😄
My favortie Carwow video so far 🔥
30 to 50 mph, is it a speed limit in UK nobody beats?😂
It was about time that we finally see you actually drive the thing
I think it would be be possible to fit a mesh insert just behind those wheels,just to keep out those stones on standard road days  Then maybe on track days just remove them
What a dream mate...! Need to hook with Luke for Swiss Alps together
I never have a problem with stone chip with my car...  now you have a 250\300 K car and every little stone  will give you a heart attack and costs a couple of hundred pound to fix....   My DS3 doesn't go 200 mls/hour .  but i drive much more relaxed...
That is great Matt, I'm sorry I was sure you were just going to flip the car and make a profit, but seeing you enjoy the car like that is really heartwarming. That's passion and i'm looking forward to watch you pushing this beast on the track. Cheers from Japan mate
Can't he just use both, don't return it
Me: my problem is that I exaggerate  Matt: 5:24 hold my beer
I’m sure that is superb to drive but by god it’s hideous. That rear wing is ludicrous, it would have to be the ‘normal’ gt3  touring for me .
How did you manage to get one Still can't understand😅😅😅 What ever enjoy it to the max 👍👍👍
Baby it
mat doesnt deserve the gt3
words smallest violin for mat
i agree to the wait
Mat knows what he doing. Taking NA petrol cars on road-trip for maximum joy.
Playing it safe is proper 👌 well done as it's easy to get carried away n not care but love how u appreciate what u have and the care u put like the ppf was a brilliant one as that stone chip would have been a pain. Must have a non abrasive brush to get those stones out. Loved the R8 sound was glorious but that gt3 rs and the spec 😮 n the seats
This is how I would run it in…… When I was a kid at Christmas my presents were all opened within 2 minutes of getting downstairs……
A lot of new motorbikes will limit the revs until you have completed the miles. some allows it to rise with the odometer gradually. After a certain milage, they need a service, and after the motorbike have had that service, you can rev it freely. I guess it's very different in motorbikes though, since they have extremely small engines compared to cars and most likely revs way past 10.000 rpm, so there a lot of small fast moving parts.
just enjoy your car mate, have fun
Put a Gintani F1 exhaust on the 3RS surely
First world problems
Jesus, you went full Welsh at 13:18 "Just Gorrrr-jus"! 🤣
If you are going to sell the car in a few years time then running in beyond 500 miles is a bit pointless.
It’s a stunner Mat. How hard was it to get an allocation?
Mat's into edging. that's what this video is about.
I think best thing to do is just to rolling road the first 800 miles of this car, 8 hours with 100 miles per hour should do it. No stones, no bad weather, no suspension wear.
I don't even watch the drag race anymore, n these types of videos are fun.
The best thing you will do by running it in correctly !!!!
Agree bout the runnin in
You riding the roads I go biking on as I'm not far from brecon,  there's so many better roads you've missed with better views
6:41 "Really experiencing all the downforse now"💀
Snap! I've had my GR86 since late last year, it's a weekend car so I've only managed 600 miles so far with this terrible weather, but need 1000 to pass the break in period before I can thrash. Bloody frustrating!
Love the GT3 RS but it would be a nightmare here in Sheffield, it’s a city riddled with potholes and broken roads, speed bumps everywhere and a car hating council.   Not that Porsche would let me have one anyway, I’ve only had one car off them.
In ways although easier to live with than many would lead you to believe the constant worry about scraping, kerbing and strange noise would dampen the experience for me
Good call on the run in. Play it safe and enjoy it for longer.
i thought his number plate read mat sh1t at first glance.
I understand
Does the Welsh government sort out pot holes sooner and better than in England?
Speaking to engine builders and oil manufacturers ....  This procedure is entirely unnecessary.   Anything metal that needs to "wear in" will have done so within the first start up.  The 1st heat cycle will expand anything needing expansion, and the engine running will impregnate any plastic items with oil.  Theres nothing else to "bed in" if its built correctly, and im certain it is.  Just rag it.
Excellent post Mat, thanks.
Great video Mat when you have two cars like this to choose from for a road trip,no wonder you don’t understand that some people can afford a Dacia Spring!
Any for what it’s worth imo Audi looks better n sounds better looks better made n less stressful. So money aside I’d have that
if it aint mat watson i aint belivin the race
Imagine if you crashed and killed it before getting to the 9000😮
Hi Matt, great video, loving the Porsche, those stones are a pain getting stuck, would it help to have a soft brush like a paint brush with you, so you could flick the stones out at the end of the day 👌👍🏻
That huge wing on the back...so ugly.. Take it of!
Edging that rev counter…
Mat, you have an R8 also xD what do you mean you are never going to buy a car like this? you already have two :D
All I can see on your number plate is "MAT SHIT"
Note to self: have a portable air gun when owning a GT3 RS
R8 sounds good at start up, the GT3 just to messy, bits of aero everywhere, rear wing just wrong on a road car, naff, sorry Mat.
At cold start, The R8 wins hands down of course
Should have had Sam as the other driver on this trip. Always wanted a Porsche however watching this video hands down i would have the R8 for the driving i do.
I was wondering when Audi would be taking that R8 back, you’ve had it a while now.
For the cost of these cars they really should be run in by the factory, expecting the customer to have to do all this is a bit backwards
A4120. You drove right by my house. I’m lucky enough to live on that road and drive it whenever I like... Shame I don’t have a GT3RS or an R8 😂👍
Can never choose between my R8 or GT3 RS either, thanks for clearing this up Mat 👍🏼
More road tripping on CarWow please!
Demo us with the 4 buttons set up
👍
Only 5k rpm - crying in a diesel
Although I like this guys content.  There’s something really smug and privileged about him  Presume he’s just another rich guy acting rough like other car tubers
I've never really taken the R8 seriously as a daily use car and haven't owned a convertible for donks. But I think I'm going to give the R8 Spyder a serious look after this review. And I agree with all of the above we love drag races Mat but much prefer more varied content.
Vote for Andreas advice 👍
Car vertical for women, would be one heck of a product.
Run in my touring properly now reaping the benefits,well worth taking care .Enjoy the RS for many years it’s a keeper as is my gt3 touring
In Aust we're told not to rev the motor to 9k until 1500km which is around 937miiles
Apple V Bananas
Clickbait titles are getting out off hand
the porsche GT3 RS is the most ugly of all Porsches, its so harsk design, its sucks really.. its a pretty ugly car. so ugly i kill all online video with this GT3RS in.
how to keep a GT3 under 3500rpm? can one even do 25mi/hr? 😂😂😂😂
Mat needs to do more car reviews on Carwow, drag races are not that important for most of us who drive on pot holed speed cameras infested roads, also a bit boring 🥱 he’s good a reviewing.
Sleepless nights thinking about the red line 😬
You should do track days or nurburgring trips with that track gt3rs
Please Mat Re Review The GT3 RS  Please 🙏 🙏🙏 also 0-60 🙏
Its all about cylinder pressure and getting the rings bedded in to the freshly honed bore, varied engine speed and load being key to good future  Dyno figures
wtf I was just thinking about this comparison  and dude drops the video 1h ago xD
are you filming in 1080p and upscaling it to 4k because its looks really bad
I agree with your running in progress😮 enjoy every mile. I do and I only have a £43,450 electric car that you also like.❤
What’s wrong is you took out a loan with Charles & Dean & you’re paying over £78K in interest on your loan!! What an absolute 🔔 end!
As others have said, change your oil at the end of the run in, then give it a proper thrash. Love the car Mat
Enjoy the car mat
Porsche engineers "we magically made it handle better with much maths.. *whispers* and 2" wider" amazing guys don't know how you keep improving
Terribly embarrassing Matt!!!. You work too much and it is interfering with the time to drive your Porsche LoL
Mat please review the bmw alpina B8 and xb7 2024 in carwow😢
Big IWC fan aye?
carwow stick of truth getting back at Matt's car😂 8:51
Quality Matt 👍
The roads are so bad and narrow in the UK. I rather have fun and not cringe every time I see gravel or sticks on the road driving a GR Yaris or a tuned MX5
Run in and ready to flip! Matt will NOT keep this car forever, he will flip it when he gets an invitation to buy the 992.2 GT3RS
1st world problems eh Mat...Ha!!
R8 isn't a supercar
If it was mine I would not take it past 7 grand until 1200 miles drop the oil then go for it
If i had the cash for a gt3 rs.. I'd run it in quicker, but in 1000miles I'd change the oil a few times. The first 100 miles is where most of the swarf would accumulate. Plus, I'm sure this engine is dyno'd before installing?! In which case has it been to the moon already?!
I thought they rev the engines to 9000rpm in the factory before they put it in the car?
The truth Is all those car geeks trying to market expensive fast cars that can't be driven like they should In public roads and making It harder to enjoy normal cars because you think there's a faster car. But unless you have a race track near you that does not matter.
i,ve got something embarrassing to say, a very nice profit thank you very much.
Did Matt come from money? No way Carwow pay a salary for his garage collection..
I do 💯
Beautiful GT3
Targa top is the best version of 911😤
Beautiful GT3
I want this strugle in life 😢❤😂
My guy Mat's got r8 v10 and gt3rs like how can a man love two wives equally?
Getting a new car and bedding it in is 💩 Do you need to do it in a Tesla?
Hey Mat, Nice video. After breaking in the engine and before reving all the way up, i think you should have changed the oil. Since the first oil has all the manufacturer "left overs" in it.  That R8 is a great car. But the GT3 RS is the car everyone wants to drive. You lucky basterd!! :D
Must be nice to kind of have the same money as Matt
Mats videos are by far the best on cars out there.
I know somebody wanting to buy a new gt3 rs, whos willing to pay overs🙏
Dream car.  Audi no too shabby either.
The yr is 2030 and Matt’s still doing run in vids for his RS. 😂
Honestly watching this 26 minute video I was more entertained than carwow videos, kudos Mat
I’m mat Watson and you’re watching …mat watson cars
@aleclivesley4 Run in my 718 Spyder on a European road trip last year and will have the pleasure of doing it again in my incoming Spyder RS later this year.
The gear change clicks ❤
How many revs were you going when you hit tbe 20mph limit in Wales lol
hello
Mat enjoying his Vw Beetle
Car vertical like Mat Armstrong
Glad you chose to go with Andreas's suggestion. Enjoy it!
nice watch. is it a IWC?
Nice IWC Top Gun Mat 👀
Will you ever sell that gt3 rs
Send it to me, ill drive it how it should be driven, not a garage queen !
That's one hell-of-a spec GT3 RS..  My guess is Mat's ownership will be long term. .. For me ordering & specing a Porsche had that effect;  an ordered/spec'ed 1998 Carrera S (993) is in the garage 25 years now. .. Ordered Porsche's are special. .. Cheers
You should not be blaming the car for getting constantly "stoned" 😂😂😂
so in conclusion owning a new porsche is all about stress and anxiety... stone chipping, bedding in, rev monitoring, car  verticalling, pot hole and road debris scarez... seems like you should only take it to a prepd track and keep it there...
New IWC for Mat?
Nobody thought you were going to floor it at 932ml 😂your too predictable matt😅
Hope you do a collaboration with hammond soon 😂
Audi sounds far better .
Great wristwatch! Iwc pilot❤
What a drive!
just flip it for a $150,000 profit.   best spec r8 ive ever seen.
24:14 Matt you absolutely tease
Nice watch Matt. What brand is it ?
Bloody freeloaders, stoned and hitching a free ride. Little buggers. Im with you re increments… enjoy the process.
I think I could live with the stones 😂😂😂
Damn the Audi R8 sounds so good🔥🔥
Me and 2 friends are thinking of doing this road trip. Is there plenty of places for stops coffee etc? great car
Enjoy every single minute of that run in. I've done it with all my motorcycles. So much satisfaction 😊
21:37 ruining in period 😂
We got clickbaited!
I'd 💯 get an oil change done after the bedding in period. In most oil samples that are analysed will contain a high value of iron particles from the piston rings bedding in. You do not want that swirling around until its actual first service
Catfished.
Matt edging himself with the rpms
Loved the video and absolutely agree with the prolongment ❤️
Whats with the title you f wrongun
Manual all day every day!
Mat driving around in neighbourhoods worth less than 1/5 of his car, sensible
is 9:14 that one bridge full of water in FH4? since the game is based on the UK and all
Evo gave the GT3 RS car of the year, purely based on testing on mixed roads.
Love the R8 but the pre 18 reg cars sound so much better 🔊👍
Honestly i dont wanna be mean, but i prefer the R8 spyder. But both are amazing, cheers Mat!
Your R8 sounds absolutely superb!
What’s the point. You have warranty and  won’t keep it longer than 3 years. Just drive the bloody thing
how much over sticker did you pay for it?
0:38 haha I love you accent “on a longK roadtrip”😂
You are living the dream Mat! Hopefully i too can buy my dream car and take it on road trips
Yup clickbait
These types of videos should be done on carwow too, there’s far too many drag races that they get boring now because it’s the same video pretty much every video just with different cars
British people use miles?
let’s gooooo
I’m sure Marc McCann will buy it from it you lol
