Who’s here in 2025
The top 5 vids of sidemenreacts are all jj solo btw 😅
2:40 not sidemen x netflix collab being annonced now
With The What - Simon "Miniminter" Minter
Hey Yo. A Goalkeeper That's Better Than Tobi - Olajide Olayinka Williams JJ "KSI" Olatunji
looking at this now, this is a normal occurence. Even Harry went solo
shouldve put this on sidemenreacts
That's just jjs 3rd channel at this point
React to the most satisfying one
Does this count as sidemen reacts. Is Simon stat padding by doing this? 😂😂
You did a solo react to Ksi solo react lol
❤❤
There should b a sidesolo reacts when one of sidemen reacts each vid like tobi then Simon and so on
"How many ads would you like?" "Yes."
3 montes
Me Reacting to Simon reacting to JJ reacting to videos
now THAT is how you milk videos 🤣
Reacting to reacts for 16 minutes
Rate the sidemen Ksi  miniminter harry Ethan Vik josh
that petrol filling clip is actually world record for most drift time a car has ever done achieved by BMW
Ngl these were the best sidemen reacts
03:34 this is actually sick🤣🤣
Agreed
New banging sidemen channel sideman reacts
And hes still doing it lol
Reactception
Dog goalie !!
sidemen reacts to miniminter reacting to ksi solo sidemenreacts next
Bro. People just watch because of jj. Shut up.
10 billion likes and the rest of the sidemen have to react to this
lit ep.
Jj is the only one that can do solo react to be honest. I wouldn’t watch any other of the sidemen if they did a solo.
i hate how sidemen reacts is practically just ksiolijidebtv4 like it’s sidemen reacts i don’t wanna watch jj’s fourth channel
Simon can’t hit a free throw and this man gonna say dribbling 6 basketballs is easy lmao.
Harry being in more reacts than Josh is big boy plays
I think KSI should do a react video, but with 3 more of him. As in record himself 3 separate times, and make it like he's reacting with clones. Would be more entertaining than with guests (shouldn't be overdone though)
Hes done A sidemen reacts? My guy hes done 3 out of the last 5 or 6 lmfao.
Should be sideman reacts
yess collab with yes theory!!!
The thing is, idk why i watch this, its a racingspill to reacting
This was just a second channel video for jj
The feet backwards record, I legit did that for a whole day, sooooo…
Making a reaction of a reaction.... Really?!
When the sidemen realise that JW solo reacts get more views xd
simon are you seriously that dry on content  come on now just make some orignal stuff
Knew this was coming 😂
The fact jj said mermans implies he thinks plural of man is mans
This KSI guy could be a youtuber
What’s the song in the background???
LESS GOOOOO MY COMMENT ABOUT SIDEMEN REACTS TO SIDEMAN REACTS MADE THE VIDEO, I KNOW IT DOESNT SEEM LIKE MUCH BUT THAT HAS GENUINELY MADE MY DAY!!! (Sorry for the all caps I was really exited about this)
JJ should do reacts with special guests/celebs since he's so big time, would help awareness having new big faces, would help him catch up and would be good content too (Edit: Wrote this before he kinda mentioned it at the end)
JJ should definitely do more of these tbh
Nxt jj reacting reacting to miniminter reacting to jj reacting to sidemenreacts
This is probs the stupidest video ever
Simon definitely has cracked the reacts code in this video. He is reacting to Ksi reacting to stuff. Ksi in title. 2 videos with not a lot of effort on 2 different channels, many views. Smart.
jj said she has put every woman to shame, simon says " i feel personally attacked" lol
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
How does this guy get away with reacting to a sidemen reacts video and then posting it to yt. Like just change the channel to miniminter reacts
Does this one count?
wanna see harry on his own, can't make a vid on his main so it should be a good challenge for him
Bruh what with the clowns in the comment
Anyone can set a record that’s the cool thing. Like I could probably make a record for most spoons flipped in 30 seconds. It’s really easy to make any kind of record
I’ve tried subbing to side plus twice now and it took my money both times with no refund. So I’ve given up on that shit.
Put vods back up
Sideman reacting to sideman reacting
Reacting to a reaction channel,the grind never stops
So this is now just a more normal sidemen reacts
Bruh simon predicted every move of jj ..
This video is top 10 for gamin in trending how there isint even a game get your shit together youtube
Can we get a jj reacts to Simon reacting to jj’s solo reacts and then from you Simon can we get a Simon reacts to jj reacting to Simon reacting to jj’s reacts
What a kontent been reacting to own channel 🥴🙃😂😂
Vik has most but is the worst on reacts
I really enjoyed this vid, and the one with just him and Tobi - nice to mix things up every now and again!
SimonReacts
Is this the Reactception? Reacting of a react of a react of a react? When does this end?
So he could react ksi reacting but not join join him
ITS A WW
Bring cal, freezy, and randy back!!!!
this is a ksimon react
The title is the holy grail of titles it’s has: KSI, MINIMINTER, SIDMEN and REACTS fucking hell 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 3M views incoming
Solo reacts is like jj reacting to reddit ..soo if it is others it would be sick 🔥
JJ cant run 20m in under 5 seconds? most people get between 2.9 and 3.7
i rate that JJ holds himself back from jokes because he doesnt have Vik and Simon to do it for him
these JJ solo reacts are basically JJ’s second channel content, but with better videos to react to
That so funny
Simon That so funny 😂
It just felt like a normal reacts from his own channel, except that JJ was more self aware of his weirdness 🤣
@miniminter why dont you react to your own video again?  Dude you out of ideas.....buckle up
They should do worlds best dogs
no not frnds as guests like other youtubers.
For all the boiz, skip 13:25 too painful to watch
He’s the only one that matters. without him the group is dead lbh
Simon: “it ain’t a competition though” Me: “but what if the last one to hit 400 has to buy the rest Nobu?”
The first record was the longest burnout in a circle I think and halfway through he was running out of petrol so that's how he got refueled
Jj should do sidemen react with his characters (Folabi, Babatunde and Sir Theodore)
The jj and toe b episode had me crying cuz it's probably gonna take years for sidemen sides to hit small towns in New Jersey💀
Alternate title: Gf reacting to bf
I could totally imagine jj doing one of these and then falling asleep halfway through the video.
Man. This guy. His reaction to SidemenReacts gets 300K views. Dayum.
hi
1st video is longest drift, he needed to refill which is what yall saw
I think i know where his intro sound is frim but i forgot can someone tell me
6:00 SquidNugget776 in the chat thought he did something lmao
Imagine a solo Josh one. It’d be sooo boring 😂😂
11:53 its a record for the tallest living dog cus the past record holder died im pretty sure
The basketball one would be extremely difficult
Personally don't think there should be solo reacts on "Sidemen reacts". The very minimum is 2 people. If only one sideman can make it - that's fine, but then at least get a guest or something, so it wouldn't feel like a video from someone's personal channel
why is my man simon blushing in in the thumbnail
So i just watched Simon that likes to stop videos a lot, react to a video of JJ (which also btw likes to stop the video a lot)  Great combo hahahah
In fairness jj is in the 2 hundreds
12:48 hello @suuuuuuuuuuuuurio. how are you doing
179426th
yes
Josh had covid while yall were recording sidemen reacts so he fell behind
Wow.😂
simon:*puts ksi in the title*  instant 7th trending for gaming XD proof ksi's name carries weight XD
Soon he will have he’s own intro ahah another ksi channel
This video was just a proof of ksimon  Their reaction were so similar
291 and still not in a thumbnail
Simon deff watched this before he posted this.just read his body language
at this point, Simon be like, fuck all, I got my JJ makin content for me to react. . .
JJ can carry a sidemen react video I don't know why you would doubt him, he's basically done the same thing every video but just with reddit or try not to laugh lol
Young miniminter and young vikram need to get a life
I have a question where do these streams go because before I used to find them and watch them later because I work now i can’t find them can someone tell me what happened
i subscribed to miniminter on twitch and i still cant watch him live or the videos he streamed last or even the schedule..anyone knows why?
Jj forgot about karius while he saw the dog keeping. The keeper would have done a better job than karius in the ucl final 😂😂
So being evolved means being complete devoid of sexual attraction?
Simon: whens it gonna stop being ksi and be ks-us
what song is this?
I was involved with a GWB Of Records a *long* time ago. I helped make "the world's longest naked hug", in Ann Arbor, Michigan. We all got naked, stood on the longest street, held hands and then slowly closed ourselves together in to create it being (technically) a hug! 🫂
jj is genuinely still entertaining on his own
Bruh his chat is so dumb asking how that sheet worked
W
6:45 See, that one could be done a lot faster. The fastest feet solve is somewhere around 17 seconds and the current fastest one-handed single is 6.82 seconds. So I reckon it could be done in less than 45 seconds. I don't know if you get inspection time, but even if you don't I don't think it'd change the time that much.
That bending woman made me like Asians even more!
The Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy!
World's tallest dog
BANGER
It was so mid for a sidemen video.
See you ruined all the channels at once
WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!! now don't forget to react to this on sidemen reacts "great content"
I think jj on his own should count as 3 or 4
Simon carrying the channel
Day 69420 of asking simon to bring the globe back
Dribbling 6 basketballs not that hard
He defo watched this before the reaction
Bring back randy, Lux and cal. Elite combo
Simon hating
When JJ does reacts with the others he tries to be funny and it end up being awkward and they stop him. When he’s alone he’s himself and it’s funny af
the editor is in the lead
JJ is so weird. Like, having a strong sex drive and not being asexual is for evil White supremacist Nazis.  And you might think "But he's Black," and you may be right (jury's still out on JJ's Blackness), but Twitter people have called Jewish people Nazis, so it's no that odd.  I'm obviously being sarcastic and making fun of the whiny asexuals, virgins, and prudes who want to control what literally everyone on the planet does with their lives including their YouTube channels.
I didn't watch the actual video so now I'm watching it through this one. I did click on the video, but I don't think the watch time helps.  It's like a Sidemen Reacts with JJ & Simon. And no communication between them.  That's exactly what it is.
does jj have channel of his own?
Who is on that poster in the background O.o?
Duo reacts ?
The happy chappy on to something here
"I am not a sexual person." -JJ
"Normally he'll go weird."  You mean funny. You mean him not being an oversensitive, whiny prude with no sense of humour who's offended by every little thing.
Inb4 all the other Sidemen react to JJ's solo Sidemen reacts.
i know they've had the channel for well over a year now but for some reason it surprises me how many videos they've already made
Tbh Jj is probably the only one who could do this and still be entertaining
SIMON first record was longest drift without stopping,they had to refuel mid drift so the driver can keep going idk why they didn't put that part in the video,just looks random as fuck
Now josh reacts to this and we have a normal sidemen reacts?!
Some ones salty
idk why all those "Indian" (generalising but just grouping them together) clips made it into the montage like they were all fake such as the 2 car one where the rope isnt even at full tension most of the time and the cars are still moving, or the sledge hammer one where the guy practically jumped up each even when they were not or barely hitting.
Okie
Ay Eid mubarak to saqip amin 😁  14:47
Kher Mubarak to my brother saying eid mubarak in the chat 🥳❤️
Simon has sitcom humor
Pussio fam
12:14  i guess you could say he skipped leg day
am I the only one that finds it weird that JJ is expected to be involved in so much content, like I understand that they are all equals, but also JJ does so much outside of the sidemen that helps out the sidemen brands and channels. Like if JJ wasnt doing his music, his boxing, and other projects, him and the sidemen wouldnt be as big. Idk feel like he out of anybody in the group deserves to have some room to work on his other work
You reacts with pewds 100 thieves Logan etc would be sick
Can't wait for you to react to the new *BETA SQUAD* video....was epic!
The one guy in chat who called the man without legs a "COD zombies crawler" is a legend.
Everyone hates vim he’s so annoying how much he tries to fit in everything thing they do is cringe when he’s involved
More among us!
The first one the longest drift ever and it was so long they had to refuel
Sidemen reacting to sidemen reacts. The infinite monetization loop😁
This new miniminter intro is sooooo dead. Bring the fukcing globe back
Universal intro still the best
You know KSI is hustling 6-7 SidemenReacts videos solo, while his bank account slowly grows again for his next ‘Try Not To Laugh.’
The mutual telepathy between jj and Simon is amazing ngl
I think JJ should start doing reacts with his other characters like folabi and babatunde that would be jokes ngl.
We went from YouTubers making content, to YouTubers reacting to content other YouTubers made, to now YouTubers reacting to YouTubers reacting to content other YouTubers made.... Where will it end😂
When r u gonne make anothe FIFA 22 career mode vid plz make the vid ive been waiting for it since 13 days
He could do a couple with the other troops. Their ep was funny so he could catch up with them so it’s not just JJ
i would do it if safe and attached
The basketballs were also losing momentum so I feel like it was mainly the balls doing the work. If they kept bouncing up I feel like it would be fine.
I just love JJ more ✌️🔥🔥 This vdo was funny 😂😂
I really want this reaction from you but didn't expect, omg thank you so much❤😊
I'll be honest, I didn't really like it, the thing I love most about Sidemen Reacts is the bants between you, heck one of my fave vids is the April Fools one where it's JJ, Cal, Cal and Randy, so if JJ brings in other guests it'll still be great, just, solo isn't for me
SidemenReacts would bang more if they would include Famous people do to tue reacts with, or other Youtubers
Yo Simon you have 9k views to the 19 minutes ago video I have post mine it's been 2 weeks still 100 views
It would have been funny if the thumbnail on that video was all the sidemen except ksi
wassup bud big fan
Solo reacts are good, could get lux freezy Randolph ect here and there
still going, team cats
JJ should do reacts with special guests/celebs since he's so big time, would help awareness having new big faces, would help him catch up and would be good content too (Edit: Wrote this before he kinda mentioned it at the end)
Bro this isn't even uploaded is it
Anime podcast?
JJ is just tryna catch up innit?
it took me a minute when i watched it 🤣
it was really good tbh
I was ok...i mean it's not JJs channel and is SIDEMEN reacts but still it's still fun
Love minter
KSI is just built different
W intro
Ngl, The Solo reacts really had me invested in! Can't wait to see the Boys doing one each soon 🤷🏽‍♂️👀
Simon never fails to milk content out of fellow sidemen's vids
🔥 vid
This JJ guy should make his own channel, wow!
HEY! BELIEVE IN YOURSELF AND YOU WILL BE UNSTOPPABLE😤. The moment you want to quit is the moment you need to keep pushing. You got this !❤️‍🔥💯
KSI actually the best Sidemen
Simon never fails to milk content out of fellow sidemen's vids
