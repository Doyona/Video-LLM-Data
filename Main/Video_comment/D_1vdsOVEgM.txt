amazing currycane.... go for d win guys.....
Damn. Sacramentos arena is always so empty compared to lakers or warriors
Stephen is a good player by himself but when Thompson is back, it's over.
God damn! Some of the passes from Steph had me thinking I was watching the Harlem instead of Golden State
Green doesn't get enough credit. He's a beast.
Swheewh
How do I find unbiased Warriors footage?…. It’s like you guys never grew up from high school. So clickish
Last week was "The Battle of California" between the Golden State Warriors and the Sacramento Kings.
I wanted to see khawai leonard and stephen curry on the same team
Warriors doing GREAT so far!
Kings looking very good this year
The fact you deadass have to guard this man at half court make me wanna play off the bench 😂😂
Yah this isn’t good I feel like there gonna get the championship or at least contest for it
lol i remember the first time i saw jordan poole i thought he was female like it was the pre season and i thought maybe it was some scrimmage against the WNBA thats why i call jim jordanna, jordanna poole
Both teams played great ball movement
My fav team gs and kings..
IF CURRY SHOOTS LIGHTS OUT IT'S MORE LIKELY TO BE A W FOR THE WARRIORS. I HOPE THAT KLAY MAKES IT TO THE SEASON EVEN JUST FOR POST-SEASON! MAN, I WOULD LOVE TO SEE BARNES IN A WARRIORS UNIFORM AGAIN BRING BACK THAT 2015 WARRIORS!!!
Man kings is becoming the kangz again. I know it’s just been 3 games but I hope they turn it around
Nah nah don't start sucking us now, yall was just bashing us.
Solid bench for warriors! Anyone can even shoot 3!
I  love  the attitude of  all  the players in  Golden State Warriors they  are  all  eager  to  win! and  everybody id  communicating very  well , very  focus!! until  the  last  last  quarter the  energy  is  still  there! ❤️❤️very  well  done👍💙
Andrew Wiggins is fucking doodoo. I was rooting for him but yeah trade him.
always dangerous in late game
Gsw basically rebuilt their 2013- 2014 team with Wiggins role of Barnes
He got the jab
Kings should trade fox for ben Simmons
Daveon Mitchell lighting it up
Mitchell look like dev in the lab
This commentator is using ever word in his bag lol
Definitely a tight and entertaining game!
Look at curry man so inspirational
Go Warriors!!!
This time GSW has no excuse.
GSW is yet again a contender.
Good game queens.. dubnation 👐
I'm really enjoying this nba season so far, all the top teams are doing poorly except for a couple and the unsuccessful teams are playing great ball
Sacramento almost won that until the end. Wow
In the words of urinating tree, “here comes that high end talent!”
Everyone's talking about the warriors here, the real story is that the Kings look pretty nice despite all the turnovers. Glad to see it looks like they are starting to get something going on up there in sac town because it's been a long time
I love golden state because their records are incredible keep it up warriors I'm your fan specially Steph your my idol the shooter of all time Keep it up Steph
8:27 dude says Davis on Wiggins 💀
Luke 10:19 Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.
6:44 🥶🥶
Is it me or was Barnes making a case to rejoin the warriors?
Go Dubs. WHOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!
this feels like the strength in numbers warriors again.... they got away from who they are when kd got there.  But if Klay can come back even 75% they have a shot at number 4
Why isn't Klay playing?
This mans commentating its A1 SAUCE. Woulda thought he was hooper back in da day
No, that's what you call the baby-faced assassin making a calculated shot. It just looks impulsive because most people can't make it like that...The man's built different 😎💦
First 3 wins all in California.
Go go go warriors for the win...
Idk why kings drafted Mitchell he should be starting somewhere they need a veteran back up pg for deaaron not competition
Kings feel like Teenage spirit....love the energy they bring ....
sactown fans straight dead. they need to move to washington. half the fans there are GSW fans. I know that Frisco is only about two hours a part. but damn half of sacramento kings fan jumped ship already.
Amoy champion hahahaha  Hindi nyo magetz noh..hahaha
I just love watching the Warriors play and th steph is getting better these past years just hoping he and everyone can stay healthy
I’m not even banking on klay coming back. He’s earned his stripes and he may contribute, but they need to keep this current squad developing. They look good and Poole is growing into a legit scorer, they may be good regardless!
Kings would’ve won if not for the stupid amount of turnovers
Not suppose to be watching but damn this was a good game.
Kings sure played good man
Jordan Poole going in this year
Ref seem to favor kings..... but warriors still won.
POOLE lookin real nice
I hope the kings deal bagley soon and good another solid player to add to what they got
Chicago vs golden state  nice match
2:52 In the words of Ron Simmons aka Farooq from WWE = DAMN!!!
Steph Curry = "Is he mad at somebody?" (after hitting a 3). How about the lob to GP2? (GP are you with me?)
What a game! Kings played very well but Warriors closed the game better!!
so Mark Jones is a Sac commentator now? nice
Wow
Stop playing with my dubs!!!!! We coming for the finals! Just wait till klay and Wiseman come back.
Some Hall of Famers out there tonight.
The best thing the Warriors could have hoped for is win these tough games while Curry is still somewhat off from 3, rather than him going ballistic everytime. Gives the bench much needed test, which could pay off during the playoffs. If Klay comes back right, and a more mature Wiseman gets to play + Kuminga, we could be going back to an approximation of the GSW that gave everyone trauma the past few years. Still have to see how they perform though versus all the playoff teams from last year at least to gauge championship chances this year.
Why Klay’s still not playing guys?
Draymond is so underrated. His basketball IQ is sharp as can be. He’s definitely gotten better as well.
the warriors are playing very fast its hard to keep up with them. I love that gsw basket ball is back this season. God is good all the time.
And Klay ain't even back yet....Dubbs lookin like they could bring another chip home to The Bay.
Poole plays outta control just like Russell Westbrook smdh
BLACKS WE ARE GOD CHOSEN PEOPLE THE REAL HEBREW ISRAELITES ISRAELITES OF THE BIBLE RESEARCH ....
Yessir warriors!!!
More more GSW!!!
2016 Dre 💪🏾🔥
Draymond is now more aggressive offensively unlike last season where he just mainly looks to pass.
Don’t sleep on Mitchell!!
I watched the last half of the game and noticed allot of poor ball handling. Honestly it looked like a circus. Curry came back in to close out. Fox was placed on the bench shortly after. Jordan Poole spazzed and gave them a comfortable lead. Kings give up a home game.
Decent 3-0 so far.
Warriors all the way!!! 💪💪💪
Davion Mitchell pretty solid.
keep that phase golden state next is to create more efficient assist with the same efficiency of your oreb,stl, and turnover reduction..a game you showed against the kings... i like to see that without steph against the okc...beli, dray, jp, kevon and one pg will do
Just wait till Klay comes back and starts dropping 50 every other game
Kings defense is terrible
Curry got shit on by a rookie! Mitchell is the real deal.. Looking forward to seeing these guys go at it this year.
The Warriors bench has really improved from last year and it shows. They’re a lot better without 20 turnovers a night too!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💪
Can’t stand the corn ball announcer. What a mockery. 🌽🏀
Idk why it sounds like 55% of the crowd were warriors fans 😂 😂
"oh Steph, IS HE MAD AT SOMEBODY??" 🤣
My worriors are back💪 lovin it.
Even though Wiggins not super big numbers, his every contribution was crucial to the win.
Wiggins looking like a two way shot creator out there🤔
"He gave him work" lol
This why kings need a superstar or a closer. They always struggled with closing games since Peja Stockavich and thats 😥 sad.
Curry did what?
Is it just me or is curry not goin as hard as he used too?
I’m ngl…. Warriors lookin like a playoff contending team. They need to keep this energy threw The Whole season
6:46 Welcome to the NBA Davion Mitchell🤦‍♂️😂
What was the King's starting 5?
glad to see the mitten on board
People will overlook Wiggins performance all the time and still wants to trade him. SMH
Much love to Mark Jones who's the new play-by-play TV guy for the Kings. "Took some ankles from Mitchell..." I dig that he's down for roasting his own guys when deserved, lol.
You can tell steph has become a better defender
19 turnovers come on, and where was buddy 😂
Draymond wants his AND 1 bad....
Holmes is a monster
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSBiBZTRdPCxEjVk60MiWTQ
Without curry this team is in shambles
Dubs goin for that 74-8 record.
My fav part about Dubs highlights this season so far is watching the reactions from Kuminga and Moody whenever Steph scores, they just look at each other like wtf 😂
Bro what was that travel at 7:37??? Dude took like 3 steps before dribbling and took another 4 after gathering the ball.
Fox does look like he put on some weight, but he looks noticeably slower and less agile. I wonder if Kings were incorporated in his training plan.  #legday
LeBron thinking “I should’ve gone to the Warriors.”
Can’t win on 19 TO 😩
🗣All this without my favorite shooting guard if all time Uncle Klay Thompson 🗣
I really wanna see the Warrior s smoke these other teams so Curry can sit the 4th quarter just like 2016. I think the Kings got a pretty good team tho.
🙏🙏🙏
Payton getting some tick yes sir!!!
Steph curry is a synthetic robot
I miss the Draymund all-star .
which warriors team is better 2021-22 warriors or 2017-18 warriors?
WARRIOR CHAMPION 2022:)
That move on mitchell 😅😅😅
Davion Mitchell is better than Fox. I’d trade Fox for Simmons.
It’s funny how a lot of warriors fans were confused and upset during the off-season with the front office but so far they proved once again they know what they are doing when they build a team
Pool is like shaun livingston!!
Davion Mitchell playing with a lot of confidence. I love it. Kings better pay that man.
you see this yet 😂 😯 https://youtu.be/tfqebVyYpC0
Just need a proper big man to provide some real rim protection against the legit centers of the league and this team is set.  Oh, and a more consistent 3pt shooter would be nice.
Bro did Jordan Poole even make a 3 like he fr was driving like a all star to the rim the whole game also curry gets no love I saw him get fouled like 3 times and he did get calls
Kings played super well, but Warriors' bench is a problem now!
Dubs nation let's go
WE'RE WINNING AT LEAST 50 BABY!
Jordan Poole.................
Davion learned its a lil diff guarding Curry at 6:44
travels
I MENT WESTERN
see, teamwork is the way to go, not only in basketball but everything in life
WARRIORS VS LAKERS IN EASTERN CONFERENCE FINALS
Good game SAC frfr. Once they figure it out they will be dangerous WATCH!
Is it me or does the Kings look for real? Or do they do this every year?
refs not callin NOTHIN this year lmao
Lol this looks like a Curry mixtape
this gives me 2013-2016 warriors vibes all over again !!
INSANE CROSSOVER AT 6:49 WTF
0:55 is this a foul or no?
Sacs's lineup is loooking good. but still good for 10-12 spot in the west
The title says “full game highlights” not “condensed highlights” can y’all show everything please
Curry practicing clutch shots is scary... haters are silent.
that is what you call AUDACIOUS IMPULSE @2:55 🤯🤯🤯🤯
Why is it the WORRIORS had hard time in Sacramento  than the LA Lakers, when the Lakers has the A team this season. What is it mean??
Give Curry mvp already
What’s going on with Steph’s shooting this year we lucky to have 2 wins where Curry had another horrible shooting night I guess he starts off seasons slow then he really heats up and blows up the league but im just glad we 3-0 we got a tough team in the grizzlies after okc we’ll prob need all of Steph’s shooting in that game.
I like that Wiggins guy. 0-3 on 3s and he hits 2 giant 3s in the 4th, leading the pack in plus minus.
as i was watching the game, i really thought the warriors will lose given the consistency and aggresiveness of the sac, but in the last minutes, the champ spirit of the warriors rule over the sac team 🤔
We going back n that trophy 🏆 is ours
Looking at one of my favorite rookies in Mitchell, I feel like the rookies Kuminga and Moody should get more playing time. Give them a chance to at least compete for ROY
Just Imagine when Klay comes back even 75% of what he use to be..#WCF #NBAFinals
This announcer is hurting my brain with all the stupid things he has to say.
I love how when curry plays, it's either a scoring devastation or a triple/double double. The team be looking good this game
Great entertaining game. Both teams shined with offensive improvements
Already 3-0 and they don’t have klay, wiseman, or Jonathan
Warriors won’t lose a game this season.
Bro the kings really gave GSW a scare though shouts to SAC town for this game
waiting for this Line Up Klay + Steph + Iggy + Draymond + Wiseman :))))) Championship warriors is back ?
Honestly big respect to the Kings because I thought it was going to be a blow out. But they kept up with golden state and put on a show.
It's just sad to see young players deteriorate year after year. I hope Fox won't be just a regular player. And I hope for Hield's performance too damn
I did not know fox rocking a low cut now Ian know who tf he was 😂🤣😂
Ayo refs apparently didn’t want to call shit that game. That went both ways.
Klay, Wiseman, kaminga... joining this squad soon.... sounds like trouble for the NBA 🤪💯
Sacramento played tough and they gone be something serious sooner than later
Looney has no lift in those legs
I totally forgot bout that maybe next time dang
So we gone act like we don't see how davion Mitchell makes the king's better when he's in fox was struggling
Kings of California baby!
We are back!!!!
Wow Curry is GOAT
CURRY IS ON 🔥🔥🔥
Steph..your so great..
The warriors said fuck it were done playing now win the game
Wow, nice
Steph was getting beat up, he looked pissed! haha Glad they are keeping the whistles in their pocket.
GO GSW
Stephen isn't even fair!!
Everytime the Warriors score the Kings coaches over there mad asl Lol
hell of a game honestly, have to love GSW being able to turn it on in the end and pull away.
GP2 MY MAAAAAN!!!!
The bearded lady's pretty good.
Gg La!
Oakland and San Francisco isn’t that far I guess  Dude it’s the next city over….
We don’t even have Klay back yet! This is going to be a fun season!
as an avid fan of basketball, i really appreciate davion's defense and plays. he's a threat for everyone in the near future.
Fox needs a CP3/Lowry/Rubio type of teammate. He's being wasted in Sacramento
Warriors need to trade Moody. Theres no reason the 14th overall pick should be playing less than double digit minutes. Or in this games case, not at all. He deserves to be somewhere where the team is actually willing to develop him. Edit* Kuminga needs to go as well. Both of these kids can be special elsewhere.
Shout out for Stephen Curry a great leader!! Btw JORDAN POOLE YOU LOOK SO GOOD🥳❤
These guys eerily  similar to the 2015 Warriors..A hungry team with a pack mentality ..Their ball movement demoralizes  opposing  Defenses .And if they don' t turn over the ball they usually win the game ..Scary thing is they will be even better when Klay returns....Weird seeing Harrison Barnes guarding Steph Curry .I still remember how good he was with the 2015  Dubs..
Dub national all the way! Can’t wait Klay to be back
Mitchell and Fox are dangerous. Good game though.
😀😀😀😀😀
Davion Mitchell might end up a future star one day. Man the Kings have bright future the only thing they did to do to have a bright future is to fire Luke Walton.
Wiggins playing well with vaccine
“Off Night” allowed 27 and a near triple double 🤣
Dont sleep on gsw
Lets go Warriors!!!
The Golden State Warriors are 3-0 🌁Stephen Curry became the first Warriors player in Franchise History to record 5,000 assists since being drafted 7th overall by the Warriors in 2009
How would you guard steph 🤣 if he hits , he hits
where is Sonya Adams Johnson( former mrs. Curry) the mother of steph Curry is she in the venue of the game like before?
Once klay get back I’m sorry but Wiggins goin 4 bc Poole still would b good as a starter he proven himself he can ball with steph himself them 3 together would b trouble
Kingz actually played well judging from the highlights, but turnovers killed down the stretch. This Warriors team is playing at a high level, if Poole play continues to be productive and the team as a whole stays healthy we gone have to start talm bout the Warriors being contenders
Dray!!!!mond!!!!!
Barnes like "Remember me?"  I also wonder which point guard Sac's going to trade.
I see jordan clarkson the way jordan pool moves
I only ask two things from Warriors: 1) Toscano-Anderson, step it up.  He's regressed instead of progressed like Poole.  2) They have got to learn to play with only 2-3 turnovers a game not 15+ every outing.  Dammit.
Wait til wiseman and Thompson come back 💪💪🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Warriors let’s gooo
GSW on Fire Hot Hands and keep on the W! #strengthinnumbers
Let’s go Warriors! Off to a great start! Let’s keep it going and get Klay back soon!
The first 3 games  He’s been good  Don’t complain  About the“Dre train”
Nice♥️♥️💪💪💪
Curry I know wasn’t happy with his shooting
Kings looked very good - playing Warriors-type offense. Ws are just a bit too deep for Kings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1NFYM13_qo you shouldn't miss this nft game guys. It's a promising project! its going to the moon pretty sure!
Chemistry and depth is really working in warriors favor they build this team ground up
Oh curry can’t win a chip without kd yeah now they quiet Yh exactly stfu curry is the real king in the league
5:16 "Oh! It's wet. Harrison Barnes" 🤣🤣
Curry, Dramond, and Clay are basically trash by themselves as we have seen the last couple of years….but when you put them back together they are unstoppable.
This might sound weird but could we be on the verge off seeing a good andrew Wiggins again
this is kings sick attiude.. after winning 5 consecutive W. theyll lose 10 games after
NBA!👌👌👌
Great job GSW
Can't wait for thompson , wiseman and kumingga back
Is bogut not part of the team anymore?
That 5 title run of warriors their bench is so great. after that their bench got so weak. Now they have a great bench again. Great to see gsw back. 3-0 baby.
Bro wtf is Halliburton doing man. He’s too pass first. Guy has opportunities to score and passes out of them smh
we 3-0! Warrior Nation!!
1000
kings are actually decent now?
Warriors defeated all California teams so far.  way to go Warriors.
This warriors team is different than the one from last year we are definitely finals contender
Si davion Mitchell is related to donavan?
The placid freighter gully tempt because olive evidently wreck qua a thoughtless boy. smelly, mundane tennis
The arena seemed like they were rooting for GSW
Let's go warriors 💪💪💪
The warriors look great but don’t sleep on the kings, look at how they made golden state WORK for this win, they were never out of the game for a second. They reminded me of the 04 pistons for a minute there.
Looks like the 2014-2016 warriors again. The pre-Durant warriors. One of the best teams ever. Can’t wait for klay
Golden State WARRIORS 119 vs 107 Sacramento KINGS
Best thing about Steph his confidence he doesn't care how many time he missed the shots he will continue taking shots untill he make big shots to help the team to win
Whoever would have thought that we would see a player that shot the three ball better than Ray Allen...Larry Bird & Reggie Miller....STEPH CURRY is definitely the GREATEST in the history of the league 🏀🎖🏆🏅🥇
NBA is good and more fun when Warriors are good.
Looks like Curry is gonna be MVP again this year
How did Davion do defensively??
Mvp stephen
Steph with the +10 Aura of Talent. AoE.
Congrats Warriors!
Kings - 112 Warrior - 119  For three Qts and most of the 4th, this game was very much in doubt. The kings scored 62 points in the first half to take a 2 point lead at intermission with Wiggins (17 pts/4 reb/0 ast) missing an uncontested layup to end the half. Davion Mitchell (22/1/4) did not disappoint, scoring 17 points in the 1st half while showcasing his defensive skills. Mitchell, despite being taken 9th in the most recent draft, has made his case to be included in the ROTY conversation.   Green (14/6/6) quickly tied the score at the beginning of the 3rd with a fake dribble-handoff and a flush at the rim. Kings and Warriors continued to trade leads throughout the game until the Warriors went on a (12- 2) run at 4:47 left in the 4th. Poole (22/3/4/4 stl/1 blk), Lee (11/4/0), and Curry (27/7/10/3 stl/1 blk) provided the bulk of the scoring, with both Payton II (10/1/0/1stl) and Lee providing solid defense complementing their offensive contributions. The western division-leading Warriors (3-0) now head to OKC (2-1) before returning home to face Memphis Grizzlies on Thursday night for a much-anticipated game.  flawlessintime.com (Post Game Review)
Swishes for Curry
Love the crowds not bias
70 plus more games to go..
Kings doubled team curry without the ball in the backcourt https://youtu.be/G8SSl3AcNxI
Kings did better than the Lakers
2:39 curry was like, so you wanted 3s huh.
Bro the refs was on all bs 😑
I keep saying it; this team is so much fucking fun to watch!!!
Poole is a substitute for klay while he is not arround the splash brothers is still goin
Wait til wiseman and klay come back..holy shit they dangerous
Buti nalang nagpa vaccine ka pare wiggins
curry looks like his 2016 look but with a beard
Loving the more aggressive play from curry frfr, and I'll say it again I hate my boy KD left but, still a fan of this team cause they show how u should ball... the unselfish play and ball movement always on point... still a fan can't lie wish them all the best and can't wait until Mr. Thompson is back  🔥 🔥 🔥
That's my Steph curry 💪😊
Need to take all in hole fouls away shot is weak they almost lost to kings 😂
why thompson still not playing?
This game is really great for both teams. Golden State is very inspirational this season. 😍😍
whos crowd was it. gsw or kings? im confused 😂
We Found our younger Leandro Barbosa on Jordan Poole
3-0 💙💛
It seems like Warriors gonna bring the bacon this season.
Lee x pool🔥🔥
Warriors should have kept barnes. He’s way better than Wiggins
Steph for mvp
The warriors killed the whole California in these three games 🤦🤣
Is it just me or is there more gsw fans in that building 🤣
First seed warriors 👀👀👀
Get this commentator outta here
Steph Curry, Go Warriors!!!
KNIGHT DAVION MITCHELL!
Everyone is talking about Warriors but how about the Kings? They’re finally looking like a complete team too! These two teams will be really fun to watch this season.
Let's go strength and numbers u know the motto LOL can't wait until klay and Wiseman gets back.
Nice standing by Warriors 3-0 keep it up. Warriors is Back!!
7:21 bro on the Sacramento bench knew it was going in lol
Sacramento homes but the crowd is into gs
I'm not loving how the Warriors are looking at all!😏 #LakerNation
Please try to edit so that we don't get weird partial sentences from the commentators.  The MLB does it, I know you can.
golden state parin panalo🥰
Why is everything an And 1 with Draymond. He so trash
*I often hear how Steph makes it look so effortless. If you pay attention to his face you can see how hard he's work on each and every play.*  *The harder you work when the lights are off play the more effortless it's going to look when they cut back on.*
nice warriors 3-0
Where's bagley?
Ones the games starts, gsw starts their play not the best but later on will destroy the opposing team
The longer I look at the DLO trade to Wiggins, the more I realize how genius the Warriors’ front office are. They have great picks to add to their already deep lineup and Wigs seem to revamp his career on this warriors team.
The kings actually put up a pretty good fight, looks pretty good, wonder how the season will turn out
What do you know…Kings didn’t show up in the 4th quarter
How do you have a quiet 27 point game?
Warrior's new players just needs playoff experience then they're ready to go.
They should made Play offs this year   If Ja and the Grizz made it last year, Warriors should made it this year considering that Warriors Improve and they have better players than Grizz
Even when Kings lose they look like a much improved team from last season
The commentator was like '  let me see how many big words I can fit into the commentary'
The new rules didnt affect curry that much
3 in a row keep it up warriors .
Curry did not have an "Off-Night"
GO, WARRIORS, GO!!!
Kings really need to work on the turnovers and defense
steve kerr adjusted curry's minutes. he usually gets in at the 7 min mark of the 2nd and 4th. now he comes at 6.
John 3:16   For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.     REPENT! ACCEPT JESUS CHRIST AS YOUR LORD AND SAVIOR!!
Poole's game smooooth
Davion Mitchell and Jalen green are my favorite rookies
Curry going for that MVP trophy this year 🏆
Where is Klay
Your Warriors are back, bro...
STEPH CURRY,THE REAL MVP & GOAT💪👊💪
Is SC 30 range 💪💪, 3 in a row I see a winning streak already 79 more let's go dubs........
if u watched the whole game. Curry built a stadium with all those bricks
Ngl, as a warriors fan. Kings do have potential and stop sleepin on them.
Homes looks like M harrel little brother 🤣🤣🤣🤣
This announcer is calling this shit out this game..
Getting 15-16 warriors vibe 😬😬
Jesus loves you loves you
Warriors are now 3-0!!! 🔥🔥
12 wins in a row b4 they get there 1st lost
Warriors crowd🥰🥰
everyone still bringing their A game against Warriors.  Wow what a struggle each game.  Hats off to whole Warriors team to fight collectively to bring these games home, especially at 4th qtr
That Devon m. Was trying to get his game on with the warriors lol becuz we did not "PICK HIM IN THE DRAFT"but,he tried.WE ON MAP GOLDEN STATE,SO GET YOUR HATS GOING THIS YEAR.
Bench of GSW now is so great.
It just so happens my 3 favorite team is going undefeated. The ball brothers and the golden state warrrrriorrrrr
Gsw way too fast
I love how damion lee trying to prove he's not just a "Brother In-law" but a great role player aswell.
I like Jordan bell but he doesn’t have the work ethic that these rookies and veterans have. I respect everyone that went to the g league to get that extra help. Looney grew on me, always wanted a big center like Tyson Chandler but not gonna trade Klay for that.
1 triple double and 2 double double. MVP Curry
I’m glad the refs aren’t calling ticky-tacky fouls anymore, but it’s almost like they made a pact to only call super egregious fouls (at least for the beginning of the season) to send a message. So many clear fouls in this game (and all the other early games this season) with no whistle.  Hopefully the refs recalibrate to somewhere in between soon or there will be some serious injuries this year with unchecked fouling like this getting out of hand.
Comments flooding with Warriors feed but I mean Damn, Sacramento actually looks interesting. Mitchell is a nice pickup. Solid rookie, for sure. He's decent. Like what they got going on over there.
YEE! gg Kings. Curry w the quiet double-double struggled from 3pt line (4 for 15) again but a solid shooting night from everyone else on the dubs
Please dear god let us see a healthy Klay and Steph on the floor at the same time this year. Amen.
Team wprk makes dream work🎉🤗 love you warriors
I see Kerr’s strategy here.  He’s going to play the bench guys a LOT this year and rest his vets Iggy, Klay, curry.  This is perfect because it builds confidence and speeds the development process along.  This is also what Popovich did with San Antonio
Steph off night = Double Double The next day, trying to make a career high points
I really like Poole
Wiggins on fire from 3 🔥🤣🎯👌🏾 would love to see his aggressive mentally step in and starting posterizing people again
Congrats warriors♥️😊
Mr off night huh? Yeah okay welcome to league. Curry different! @6:43
Fun fact warriors still undefeated this season
Where’s Bagley????
Close game 🙌🏻🙌🏻
Team lookin solid. Wait for klay and wiseman should be contenders
Depth. Warriors are deeeeep son, like the ocean deep
Jordan Poole and Gary Payton jr is indeed a bench player on fire...
thank god wiggins decided to woke up and PLAY
What a great the beginning of the season!
The warriors bench is pretty amazing!💪
Poole gonna get expensive next year. They better win this year.
Good shit😎
oh man. wait until Klay comes back. hopefully Klay is healthy for the remainder of his career, and when Wiseman comes back. he needs to step it up. ALL STAR CENTER TIME!!!!
Warriors is going for flawless victory their going 82 wins - 0 loss. 😱🥶🤯
*Gsw really 8-0 including pre season.. that's good*
Giving up 111 points a game is concerning.
Harrison Barnes did everything but still not enough to beat the warriors
They shot Terrible in the 3 point line and still manage to win
Good win, jta needa step it up though seems a step slower so far
Can’t wait to see this lineup...Payton curry Poole klay and draymond...that’s gunna be scary
Imagine when Klay and wiseman come back it’s gonna be scary for the league like 2015 all over again
Curry is my chicken
the good thing is curry passing is back and even more emproving... green is contributing right now in offense that's nice
First game, Triple double Second game, Double Double Third game, Double double again like wtf?
"...pejorative turnover..."??  Come on, man, you talk for a living...
This is Jamarcus Boyd's best highlights  https://youtu.be/n0deILAcmkk
Big 🧢 if you think warriors arent dangerous right now
Gsw 3-0👌🏻🔥🔥 Jordan Poole playing like Curry✨ The chemistry of this team🏆
Poole's offensive emergence is a huge weight off Klay's shoulders. The man had two of the worst injuries possible,  It's not realistic to think he's coming back the same.   Klay is going to have to reinvent himself like Shaun Livingston did.
GSW 3-0.looks food so far.
LET'S GO WARRIORS!!!!!!!!!!!!
warrior's offense is so smooth
It's confirmed a team who can defeat the  warriors is considered lucky 💪💪
Steph jas a rough game, still gets 27 pts and a double double, and the guys rally around and they feed offf each other selflessly! The energy, chemistry, vision and culture as a unit os amazing! The bench depth is so there that there is no hiccups in the rotation!  The scary thing, they have a squad who appears to be all in as one, knowing their roles and everyone shouldering each other, they all believe in each other and the team as a whole, it shows! they can tear threw the league in a nasty fashion if they stay like this! They may be hell on the league this year yo
6:45 Curry in video game mode
Welcone back GSW
People complaining about Wiggins scoring and I understand but dudes he locking down on the defensive end and I’ll take that any day!
6:07 Curry swiftness and quickness's is insane leaving three defender unable to stop him... the Guy is insane..
Go warriors
No Iguodala, Klay, Kuminga, and Wiseman. Great win champs
Draymond is shutting up the haters about being an offensive liability. Hope he carries this momentum on forward
.
Great fight by the kings.
Just saw JJ's podcast; good job boys
I like the worriers but damn D.Mitchell is a beast already in his 1st year?
Awesome
so many swishhhhhhhhes
Barnes stopped scoring 3s when guarded by Wiggins
🗣Buuuutttt how u turn the ball over 19 times🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤣🤣🤣🤣 weird watching nba games nowadays
Please klay / wiseman / kuminga come back at full strength
Congrats Curry and GSW team for another win this time against Sacramento Kings. Likewise I congratulate Steph Curry for another milestone in his career by amassing 5000 assist points, first in Warriors' player history. GOD bless u Steph C and GSW.
Those passing ang cutting is remenicent of the 2016 Warrior.  Curry is contagious.
Wiggins please keep what you did tonight uo also 🥺
This season the warriors is online😁
Curry is the best
@6:45 or @8:17
1:18 curry that's doble dribble?
Yes, keep winning Warriors!
wow! the bench players are impressive
And clowns saying fox is better than morant 🤣🤣
I mean am I the only one noticing, since last year I've been adoring Wiggins game, his mid range and fadeaways
I only watched the highlights but Payton seems to be a mad dog chasing the ball.Hope he has extended minutes.
See guys like Mitchell won’t do that to the warriors if klay comes back w the same energy defensively
Imagine Klay joining this lit GSW 🔥
Cant wait when the warriors dominate the PHOENIX PUNKS
SC IS GIVING A +DEFICIENCY ON HIS FIRST GAME I WILL JUST SHOWCASE MORE OF MY MOVING THE BALL ABILITY SECOND GAME I WILL SHOWCASE MY 3PT NORMAL DAY NO + DEFFICIENCY. BUT THIRD GAME + DEFFICIENCY AGAIN I WILL SHOWCASE ME DOING 2s DRIVING TO THE LANE ABILITY SAME AS GAME 1 NOT THE USUAL NORMAL 3 BALL FOR THE REAL BEST PLAYER OF THIS ERA SMH HE CAN DO IT ALL PROOF SMH AND WIN MOST IMPORTANTLY HE CAN WIN AND LEAD HIS TEAM CONSISTENTLY UNLIKE SOMEBODY DEMANDS SEMI ALL STAR STACK TEAM AND STILL LOSES _😂🤣 HE SEEMS BORED TO DO SUCH 😂🤣
Technically, that 4th three from steph was a miss since it hit the back rim. 🤔
GSW bound for play off
Warriors looking back good ..just wait to klay return
Not quite the Warriors Dynasty level yet but looking extremely dangerous when Klay comes back
Draymond the Key
Not even a dubs fan but I'm excited for them this season.
No Klay Thompson but still win
Look at curry man so inspirational
SAC played GSW very good but its hard to win against any team when you have that many turnovers.
Man this is the first time i heard draymond say "And One!" in a while 😂😭
The stardom of jordan poole really puts a smile on a warriors fan's face right now
Apparently the warriors are best California team Sweeping my Lakers, smh clips and kings
another "bad game" for steph
Curry,Poole,Green, Wiggins,Igoudala big 5
Why I got a feeling the warriors if they get klay back soon can make a push for the finals 🔥
I know it was an away game, but man these commentators were straight bias 😂
Da move by curry tho
The coaching staff of Warriors really did a good job, especially in the 4th quarter! Meanwhile, Curry is Curry! the man is hard to stop!!!
WiN STREAK! What if they set new record 73-9 win
Gott love Mitchell defense he’s def gonna be a good player moving forward 👌🏼
I'm a longtime Lakers fan, but I was rooting for the Kings - they have a good young team.
LETS GO
Holy shit imagine when klay comes back
Ugh, Ws could have LaMelo in the rotation right now.
GO GO GO WARRIORS
Draymond is so damn valuable.
Tristan play wih em
Warriors bench 🔥
I'm not a fan of Sacramento Kings but there Rokie D.Mitchell in good at playing Defense 👏 continue to learn.
This GS Warrior Team is very Dangerous not to mention when Klay comes back 💯💪
I watch Kings highlights only to see Davion Mitchell
Dis game was neck Nd neck a whole lot but we came out wih da dub🥳🥳
Can't wait till klay comes back
warriors going 82-0
This year GSW reminds me old GSW team that won 79 games. Very good chemistry n unselfish. Let’s go GSW all the way…
Late for held.
Pre-Season: 6-0 Regular S. : 3-0 = UNDEFEATED!! Let's GO WARRIORS!! all support from the Philippines! 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
Damn gs looking good
Steph is playing some serious defense this year. Example 0:28 against someone faster, but he stayed in front the whole time.
3-0 yessir
6:50 Steph Curry woke up and chose violence
This kind of Barnes is what we needed back then!
🤺 VS 🤴
Draymond looking revitalized
This kind of Barnes is what we needed back then!
Let's GO WARRIORS!!
Kings play the best basketball
Barns need to me come back
Warriors 2022 NBA Champions. I said it.
I hope they will pass their best win in 2016 73-9
You can tell Steph had it in his mind like none of that off night shit tonight young boy. Love it.
The Kings look pretty impressive they just might sneak into a playoff spot of they learn to close out a little better
Davion is really nice
Man that’s crazy curry makes like 90% of his shots
poole, green,wiggins is a good combo for defense and offense
Good to see the warrior fans come back alive lol, it's been boring since y'all jumped ships lol
Where is Diaren Fox ???
Warriors already looking scary without the 77th best player in NBA history
I love how every things going for us but I think we should play belicia way more than just 10 mins
They're not calling fouls on Steph come on. Not with those shots but with him driving for a lay like come on do he have to get injured before having a foul call?
3-0💪🏻  #DubNation
Parang mga latang Walang Laman ung Kings ang iingay lang eh hahahahaha
3-0
Congrats gsw .wow amazing
Wiggins really need to stepup against them, because what wiggins position has , that position was from barnes
Good to see Harrison Barnes again. Cool dude . Lots of warriors with double figures tonight. 😜
i think curry is like akashi from kuroko basketball, because he can make his teammates go zone just by assisting or passing
Deadpoole got 22 :000
Warriors starting to pick it up again. Now when I see a warriors game I expect to see them be the winners.
As a kings & warriors fan, im super impressed by both teams & I knew this was gonna be a good game. I can see both going to the postseason no problem
I hope Golden State do good this year
Imagine if, klay,wiseman,kuminga and moody is back on the floor!
ez
Steph getting way to much attention on D wew
Look at me and my teammates man so inspirational
What a great W by warriors but that sacramento squad got a hell of a faster players.
I scored 27 points and got the dub
Draymond 'And 1' green
6:45 is that not a travel?
Maybe I'm wrong, but it feels like Jordan Poole is starting to become a legit scoring threat.
Everyone is saying the warriors played well, they shot 45% on the worst defensive team in the league and were at 39%~ at one point. The real cause was the collapse of Luke Walton not knowing how to coach.
Curry is passing Ray this season.
did mitchell slow down curry from scoring?
Undefeated preseason, 3-0 start 🔥
4:10 Poole vs poole
I have to say that these commentators killed a few of my brain cells.
Im starting to love GSW
It seems like the Kings fans are also rooting for  da Dub nation! 👏🏻👏🏻
Lots of no-calls, referees blind or something
get rekt rookies
Was this a Warriors home game?
Go warriors
Incredible shot 😯😯
Mitchell looks good. I didn't know about him till this game. Barnes still producing was good to see as well. GG
The warriors has started this season off quite nicely. It’s great to see them playing at a high level again. I’d like to see them back as contenders in the west.  Curry is becoming one of my favorite players
man, if only this was the Barnes that showed up in 2016
How many points does curry have
Shout out to JP3 nice bounce back game. Keep it up bro. You're doing great.  Props to Draymond.
A very promising young Sacto team.
And the dubs still have Kuminga,Wiseman and Klay waiting to come back. Talk about being loaded with talent
Basis how effective curry is, they'll rate his performance poor if he scores below 30.. because we know, he can easily get 30plus points most of his games. I can't wait to see  KT11 AND JW33 on court. Let's Go WARRIORS!
This warriors team is better than all the current super teams today
When Curry have the ball, so exciting to watch!
Steph you are not leFlop who gets all the calls if you slightly bump him on a drive. The refs are paid to tale care of the flopper. No one is gonna get that special care from the refs.
meanwhile lebom and weestbrick 🕺💃
Go Warriors from L.A..
This is the only Payton (python) that is venomous 🖤 hahaha
Curry MVP
Jesus is your free gift to heaven when you believe in his death, burial and resurrection you are immediately saved
Jesus is your free gift to heaven when you believe in his death, burial and resurrection you are immediately saved
Steph,klay,wiggins,GP...2nd generation nba players gang!
at this point just trade buddy hield and mbagley III. buddy taking shots that could’ve gotten sac higher. i’m pissed and idk why-
NO ONE CAN REALLY STOP STEPH EVEN DAVION MITCHELL BUT THE KID HAS ENORMOUS POTENTIAL TO BE ONE OF THE BEST DEFENDERS IN THE LEAGUE.
Why was curry so mad this game? Dude was pissed the entire time
Stephen Curry is making a MVP run this year for sure
When is Thompson coming back?
Bruh I'm glad when got the win, but davion was beastin tonight he was 7/8 at one point, but then he got cold and went 2/8
MVP CURRY STRIKES AGAIN 🔥
Aww the Kardashian ex lover now plays in Sacramento
Change referees dude
Another day closer until Klay gets back on the floor. Scary hours
GSW haters are so jealous of these 3 wins.  Their own team can hardly win a game while the Warriors are still on a streak with 4 players in the injury list. Ouch! Time to look for another sport LOSER HATERS.
Draymond should keep scoring like this in every game like how he used to
Curry for MVP already in the bag!!
The kings need an identity these guys have 3 point guards that can all start on different teams makes some trades change the coach fire the GM these guys what are they doing over there?
Proud to be  GSW fan 🥰
I don't know about anyone else, but I just want to celebrate the extremely low turn over for GSW!
Ever thought of that the warriors are only using 65% of their strength
Beat LA Lakers Then Beat LA Clippers Then Beat Sacramento Kings  We Just Conquered California 🥇
Go GSW!♥️
WARRIORS BACK BABYYYY!!!
Stephen Curry really impress me every time 🔥🔥
I think the only way to fouls someone right now is to punch him
Great start for GSW..looks like they could hold their own even with Steph not going for 40 every game
CURRRRRRRYYYY WARRIORS !!!!!
Jordan Poole reminded me of Harrison Barnes on their first ring. Reliable and can get the job done.
2:16 Curry  dunk combo was awesome..
Lfg, 3-0 as a warriors fan couldnt have asked for a better start
3 down more to go .and now the warriors had a 9straight win games
3-0 !!!!
I can’t wait to see what we’ll look like once Klay comes back.
wow great game
That ain't given curry any of his fouls
solid gsw fans🔥💖💯
Man I prefer the Wiggins this season than last year his decision making become really great, and Curry is strong
Kings Young core is gonna be a problem in the future
My Warriors look soooooooo good. We are still waiting for the big guy.
Not the best shooting night for the Warriors but the active defense and everyone scoring apiece got it done
Guys imagine if Harrison Barnes comes back to warriors - - -  (If my grammar is wrong, sorry for that)
Warriors and Kings had some really good ball movement in stark contrast to the absymal offense in Lakers Memphis game .
9ers lost tonight, but at least GS start the season 3-0! Can't complain...........
Stephen Curry.
Curry and Klay aside from Magic,Bird and Isaiha most unselfish players I witnessed
GSW looking really strong .. And they have a guy that can go for 30 pts in a quarter still on the bench
Warriors 🔥3-0😍
This kings team has so much young talented guys, hopefully the front office won't blow this away ever again☝🏿
Curry had a bad night on 3's. Guess we bout to see another 35+ points from him next game😤
Refs  Wasn't  Calling  Any of YOUR FOULS. AN WE STILL WON
I just noticed that nba uploads highlights on 1080p now!
GP2 💯
Warriors are on 🔥🔥🔥3 0 LETS GO!!!!!
You here first from me d Steph Curry will win the most valuable player this season
Golden State gonna win a championship again, yeah boi.
You gotta love the fact that Draymond is becoming more aggressive again   Hopefully we'll get that 2015-2016 Version of him
The Warriors bench looking pretty solid this season.
Wiggins you did yo Thang man good job 👏👌👍
WARIOOOORRSSSS
this is the draymond that i want, not just focusing on making plays and defense but also participating on offense hope he continues to play like this, win or lose i want him to be agressive and confident on his offensive capabilities.
Go GSW !..Strength in Numbers..! Steph is GOAT !..Fun to watch. 👏🎊🎊
Oh, no "off-night" for SC30 vs SAC?
Good job warriors
Davion.. the guy the Warriors should've picked.
D. Green attacking some offense will be a bad day for the warriors opponents… Go GSW.. Keep it rolling…
no more triple team for steph so watchout nba the the true league's ruler is back in action..
the thing about this team that’s scary is last year they were double teaming curry on every possession & he was still putting up insane numbers. this year they can’t because everyone on the floor is dangerous. i don’t see a scenario in any team surviving a 7 game series w these dawgs.
Davion is looking like a stud.
The Warrior look really good, I don’t even want to imagine how good they’ll be when Klay will  come back.
FOX please ask to be traded you wasting your talent on the kings mannn get outta there !!! People forget bout you wit the under 25 club cause you on the kings !!!
The GSW have such a great bench, then what I really love is that when Curry goes crazy, they all go along with him and get buckets as well 💪💙💛🏆
“That is what you call audacious impulse” bruh wtf😂
D Lee is improving man
The best player on the planet race is between curry, giannis, or Kevin Durant. And this is coming from a LeBron fan
You know it's only 3 games, but combined with the preseason, the dubs are looking pretty effing good. When Rocco's owner get's healthy...
Good job GSW
bring back Harrison  barnes. trade wiggins.
That's 3-0
aye that davion mitchell kid is the truth! fearless!
Good starting for The warriors... Congrats Ka Dubs...
Gp2 saves non-curry minutes
Warriors depth for the win. Even though they were off from 3s their depth came through with nearly 7 guys in double digits including Curry, Poole, Dray, Wiggins, GP2, Lee.   Curry with nearly another triple double in points, assists, rebounds. Poole, after an off night against the Clippers, bounced back with 22 points, 3 steals, 3 assists, 3 rebounds, 1 block. GP2 was solid last season, got signed recently, and came through with his solid defense and 2 3s
That was a good performance from the Warriors. Keep it up Warriors!
Gsw Just Beat The Whole State Of California in A Row 😂😂😂🔥🚶
Curry every other day -25 points in quarter Curry on off day - let me get double 👀
Go go go gsw
curry for the most improved mvp of the year, 3 consecutive double doubles
Sac's home court but fans cheers Warriors LMAO
Sac's home court but fans cheers Warriors LMAO
Marvin bagley to warriors
GP ll is the happiest warrior, in and out and finally in , clutch 3 and I think he's an elite defender ..79 more win for perfect record baby
They beat all the Cali teams🔥
I feel bad for the remaining like 17 kings fans
When klay gets back o boy...
davion was such a good pick for the kings 💯
What happened to Grant napier?
youtube: taylor made holiday special   funny as sh!& 4 real
Gsw solid
WOWOWOWEE...another awesome game...DUBS CAN ONLY GET BETTER...many errors, and even cold shooting ...but still together enough to pull it off...2nd unit...wowowowee too
Stephen Curry assist to Payton Dunk should be Top 10 play of the game 🎯💪🔥
I was at the game and had a great time (even though we lost)
strength in numbers yall 6 almost 7 dubs in double digits !
The dynasty didn't end, it just took a break
haha all the team have homecourt advantage didnt win today
I been saying I hoped GP2 got that last spot. And he's making me look like a genius amongst my friends who were all mad they didn't keep Bradley. 2/2 at the 3,  generated a steal, wins the jump ball, gets good transition buckets around the rim, passes well, great awareness. Perfect for the Dubs
This game shows why Curry is the best guard in the league (coming from a kings fan)
27 pts 10 assist 7 reb 3 stsl, and some people still said he played trash or like westbricks. Damn
Is it me or does Steph and damn near the whole team look more locked in this year sheesh
Kings should sign a couple vets to help things run a little smoother, don't havta be all-stars just some guys to keep the younger players heads up/in the game.
Jordan Poole, play like  Shaun livingston
Without Curry I don't think G Warriors will get through.
Warriors Always Makes Fans Smile!
GS is runnin like a young team, witta few great vets
MVP contention this year is tough, but I hope Curry will win it.
fox needs to step it up🤦
Giving payton a contract is good idea, nice warriors!
Warriors so much fun to watch this year! Dubs is back
broo curry gomna average 30points, 10 rebs and 7 ast mark my words
Look at lillards son, so inspirational.
Warriors looking nice 👌
Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.  John 3:36  For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.  Romans‬ ‭6‬:‭23 Jesus Christ is the only way, seek Him while He may be found, before it’s too late, tomorrow is never promised..
Is Klay Thompson trying to set the record for longest time to recover? Probably already has it
I told people this warriors were going to be a problem! Since last year and people just laughed it off. Who's laughing now??????
Is that mitchell says he guard curry all night?? Hmmm its just a imagination
Warriors pull it out at 4th quarter - when it counts!  💙💛🏀
The only thing missing now is Klay Thompson, once he returns. Warriors will be right back where they started🔥🙌🏾
Damn warriors was just chill in 2020 to 2021, now they serious again
3-0! Next!
https://youtu.be/vOGQtNQXTiE  is a recap of Heat v Pacers, Mavs v Raptors, Grizzlies v Clippers.
the warriors chemistry is looking good together!!!
Curry 27/7/10 probs gonna call this again a "trash" shooting night.....  Worried for the next team they're playing cause Curry gonna explode again 😂  Shoutout to Poole, Green, Wiggins and GP2... Green finally trying hard to score again
sc30 👍👍👍👍😎
Now we got a bench! Curry is now resting with peace of mind
2-0 what a good start for the Dubs
warriors basketball
#GSW #WIN 119-107 https://youtu.be/ud9pHXIkUdY
Morant vs Curry for MVP
Warriors playing sweet music basketball.
What the heck were the refs doing??? Bro Curry and dubs got fouled on so mang plays and no calls
"WARRIORS FOR  EVER" 🔥🔥🔥
@7:23 they always use this moving screen😂 fuck the refs.
yeah DUBS just keep the game like that and we can bring back the title again
Harrison Barnes had more points and rebounds than Davion so he should be the thumbnail instead.
Is it just me or has Draymond been making clutch shots through contact at the basket this season?
Hi Barnes
Warriors lookin good, their main is turnovers but when Klay gets back n the playoffs come around, sheesh look at.
Steph is a walking cheat code, despite being 9-23 from FG and 4-15 from 3PT and still got 27 pts...
Steph Curry  27 points, 7 rebounds, 10 assists, 3 steals   39%Field goal  9-23
Curry had a meh shooting night tonight. Still had 10 assists and 7 rebounds. If his percentages get in range of what they usually are, he's a lock for MVP.
Steph was struggling but thats not much of a problem anymore like last year because warriors Depth is as deep as The Mariana Trench
Another bad shooting game for curry and he has 27 points , 4 threes , 6 assists , and 10 rebounds
MAN I CANT WAIT TO SEE KLAY,  KUMINGA AND WISEMAN BACK ON THIS WARRIORS TEAM !!!!!!!
💙💛💙💛
Draymond really stepped up offensively this last games So proud of gsw right now. "STRENGTH IN NUMBERS" is back baby
Curry averaging a lot of rebounds and assist this season another double double
This team can win 70 games for sure 💯
Curry is such a good leader on the court . He has everyone playing unselfish ball 🖤
Bro I want the Kings to do well so badly.   I don’t want them to be the bay areas bitch again
I love the way that GSW is back like in year 2015-2019 where the team were so strong
Curry  mvp
Curry's off-game but he still managed to get 27 pts, 7 boards, 10 assists and 3 steals😳 he had double double, wow.
Gsw congratulations.
With Klay Thompson coming soon, GSW might be the deadliest, scariest team this year. They'll be shooting 3's outta nowhere once again. #SCARY
Steph coming for that 3rd MVP.
I observed that Curry in this season becomes more like a team player rather than a scorer. His assist and rebounds increase a lot
Wiggins has been good so far. He finally understands he just need to score like 17 - 20 pts per night and play some good defense.
Curry's old self is back. That's dangerous indeed.
Warriors at 10-0
Draymond scoring 14 points it's so rare this year
It took the Warriors 34 games last year to win 3 in a row. It took them 3 games this season.
Another w!
Steph is filling up these stat sheets
Flight is so happy rn
"Don't wanna see us next year"
The win streak continues...
Everytime Curry goes off, the rest of the team contributes and keeps on grinding. Teamwork makes the dream work INDEED! 💪
lol all  draymond do is run around with ball look what he does everytime he has the ball
Curry is so underrated defensively it's crazy
Woooohoooooo
And they was trying to call GSW out of contention Curry got a bone to pick with the league after last year when they was double and triple teaming him and now so does Klay for that 75th greatest player snub I feel bad for the west real spill🤕 #StrengthInNumbers
As a warriors fan gg for the kings and their fans yall have a bright future good luck kings
Warriors only have 6 turnovers all game
Yo where Lebozo?
Dubs is on with a great start!! Alright 😎💪
let's go 10-0 run as all the matchups are winnable
*Steph had a 27 point double-double, but still gonna say he play like trash again lol*
Warriors is good
Warriors are hot!!!
warrios basketball is backkk
klay get all the rest u want,  otw to be completely healthy! warriors got this
3-0 baby
If we can get stats like that from draymond every night and ofc curry and Poole gonna do there thing, but this team is gonna be very dangerous
Great team win. Props to GP2 and JTA❤
This rookie class has been hella fun to watch so far
i just want to say that i hate the lakers and they suck so bad
Keep it up gsw
Did yall thought this was gonna be a close game and see a game winner?
Where the haters at?
Finals team right here
Our bench looking good Curry came in at the 5 minute mark in the 4th and we got the win, shoutout to Poole man got 22
Curry had Davion out of the picture
Great win for the dubs, let's just hope if they could win against the OKC Thunder
Ako lang ba pinoy dto?
Last time we went 3-0 we went 24-0 we holding it down without klay we gotta legit elite offense dub nation
JP3 and Iggins of Andrew on the house helping our baby face assasin
