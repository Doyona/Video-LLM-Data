I HAD TO COME ON HERE TO SEE WHAT FUHAD WAS ON AB
Fuck, the two in black are insufferable.   Other two can come for a meal ANYTIME.
Ghana JOLLOF IS BETTER I said it!!! I SAID IT!!
Dancing Jason: “It looks dry 😆😁” LMAOOO tf. Also I thought jollof was more red than these dishes but maybe it’s a little different Nigerian style? I’ve only had it a couple times. Now I want to make it. I love tomato-y rice.
I came back to watch this video and apparently already liked all the top comments but don’t remember seeing this at all. Yay Covid brain it’s like I’m watching for the first time 😂
None of them cooked the dush they presented.  I bet
''If you enjoy it in your house, you'll enjoy it in your house'' 😂 I'm not Nigerian, but this sounds like such a Nigerian thing to say
>OK >8
Damm Jason cooked in both senses 😂
"Arrest whoever made this thing" - hahaha
I love that they're all chill, nice guys.
Bro got a 4 total. 😭😭
They need a Scottish guy who's never had jollof rice to try and Google a recipe and make it as a control.  I also love how these guys living in England made them unable to cook.
To be fair, all the dishes looked pretty crap. I've never cooked this dish in my life but I guarantee i would easily beat these 4 .
Nahhh sorry but Nigerians version ain’t it😭 Liberia!!!💕
So where the accent them just some black man in where ever they at
I love Jason, I would love to cook jollof with Jason
This episode was hilarious 😂
Looks tasty
Men tasting other men's dishes is so boring. So much bitterness and weak egos. Every video is the same. Everyone trashing each other in the hopes to come across as a professional. Boring
WAIT OH!😮 0:59 🍖🍖🍖🍖 ORDER! ORDER, I SAID! Can we observe some proper DECORUM in HERE?😮 This man SAID, KETCHUP?! In PROPER JOLLOF RICE?!😳🫢 This style I saw (or heard, I’m so confused right now which one is even functioning, whether 👁️ or 👂), I never EVER tried on this earth..it EXISTS? It’s giving real😏😒energy, like where this guy sabi this kind go vex my mouth & sour my belly, sure! Someone, please come & collect him from kitchen, sef, wey go concoct poisonous one thing or another!🤢 Sir, that’s an “F” on your day…please, 🫵🏾👉🏾just 🪑 SOMEWHERE!
why do they talk as if they're raised in london?
Tl:dr  None of these guys can cook 😂  The real winner here is Ghana lol
African are cursed by God Himself, “The Curse of Ham”
another confirmation that brits can't cook lmao
Please do another episode with these four gentlemen, they are hilarious 😅😅😅
Basmati is a long grain rice lol.
"If you enjoy it in your house, you enjoy it in your house" is so funny to me. He doing his best to be polite but it ain't easy 😂
So in the end, it was really "4 people who don't know how to make jollof rice try each other's jollof rice"
Ke- whattttt Ketchup??? I know I didn't hear well😂😂
Please, make videos that helps Africa towards development but not these "rice food videos" !
Bring these guys back
But jollof rice is from Senegal
The intro was killing me bruh lmfao
Buzzfeed "UK" btw
Kanaan is giving Damson Idris😆
Probably wasn’t even that bad
Bruhhhhh you know the second one was bad when all three of them went in on it 😭😭😭
This is a brilliant idea. Philippines's BINI Tries Filipino Food was just plain dumb, this approach would have been the appropriate thing to do.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 thank you for making my day!!!!
what if you gave them their own jollof rice to test whether they are lying or not
All I learned from this video was Nigerian men  can’t cook😂😂 and judgmental asf
Over seasoning? I’m not black but over seasoning? Tf don’t yall like good seasoned ?
Jason is a little....zesty
I once had a friend from Botswana who gave me some of her red rice dish with chicken , damn it was tasty ❤
This is literally the perfect group 😂
man i felt bad for chidi but kanaan really did it
Jason is fruity u can't tell me
Take a normal bite ffs.
“If you enjoy it in your house, then you enjoy it in your house” 😂
these guys are trying too hard
Nigerian's hold nothing back bruh. That bredda say "You dont feed this to people"😂😂😂
Oh I love them all - hilarious! 😂
It would be fun, just once if they gave them their own dish, or their mama's. That could go either of 2 ways 😂
This video proves Ghanaian jollof is the best 😂
They have all so differently funny characters
😂😂their facialxpr.
They are so funny
5:16😭💀💀
Jason just came to eat that day 😂😂😂😂 No matter how crap it was, bruv was PLEASED AS PUNCH!!
The intro 😂😂
mufasa and scar was actually not a beautiful match lol!!!
Love they accent 👌🏾
I wish am here to cook you will know am the best cook
Why are they so diva I’m cryingggg
'Hi guys, I'm Jason. I'm trying other Nigerian men.... Jollof rice'
POV: Ur watching this while eating Jollof Rice.
I live Jason he’s such a vibe.
Smell wise, very oily 😂😂😂
Why do they act so gay
They should’ve gave them there own just to see there reaction
Im not really onboard with this one 🤣🤣🤣
And u blame the colonizers for the African crisis😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Loves Jason energy!!!!😂😂😂
Absolutely loveeeee Jolloff rice!!!!
Jason busy dancing 😂and the other two just looking at the plate bewildered 😅
Jason flaming chill out
i've not even gotten far into the video and i can hear somebody saying ketchup. gerrarahia
Jason is the exact kinda person I could hang out with 😂 great energy haha
Please bring them back! These are one of my favorite videos and sets of personalities. That yelp after he called the dish rice pudding gets me every time! 🤣🤣
7:16 telescope to see the moisture?! 😅 this dude is hilarious! 😂
There's no control in this house
“you need to be able to cook properly if you want to find a wife“      💀💀💀💀💀
My man got so into the ketchup  He had to remind himself to behave  🤣😂🤣
They don’t hold back their opinions.
No control in this house rotfl 🤣
I once made some flop jollof at someone else's house. It was still better than Nigerian jollof I've had.
The guy on white acts.........🤮🤢🤢🤢 Gay
“This brudda can’t cook” 😂
Ketchup?!?
Chidi doesn’t have a sense of taste 🤣🤣🤣 at this rate he’ll give cat food an 8 🤣🤣🤣
Bro got a 4 😂
I couldn’t quit laughing! Those insults were hilarious! Please do more of these guys! 😂. I am laughing so hard while I am layed up in the hospital and people are rushing in to check on me! 😂😂
I liked how the guy who was the most positive and polite actually was the best 😌
Man said too much seasoning cant taste the jollof news flash iddiooooooot the seasoning is the jollof coz without it its just plane rice 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️😄😄😄
kanaan is Beautiful
I just LOVE Jason. 😅💞 May HE keep you Jason.
"I want to attack this chicken" 😂 😂
Nobody knows nothing 🤔🤔😞😂😂😂
I just love Jason energy❤❤❤
I’ve watched every single one of these from Cocoa butter so I guess ill watch these now
No control in this house 😂😂😂😂😂😂
It's the Nigerian 'Ah' for me at 7:56😂😂😂
Jason guy clearly aint worried about cooking Jollof to get a wife, guy is as fruity as it comes.
Who put KETCHUP ON  JOLLOF  frice
1st dish, he didn't hear the ancestors say stop, so he over added seasoning 😂
Why are they inspecting the food like it's a scientific specimen? Somebody should get them a microscope
Jason is my spirit animal xD
Dude looks like damson idris lol
Please check on Chidi’s taste buds
Not chidi eating everything because he didn’t eat before this 😂
Jollof rice is our typical nigerian food😁
4 IS OUTRAGEOUS 🤣🤣
I'm sure that Jollof is Ghanaian.
😭😭😭😭
Bro, all these other countries who are trying to beat my country to making lab are you trying to lose or what? What the fuck is that disgusting
This is the funniest food swap I’ve seen by far 😂😂😂😂
I died😂😂😂😂..Chidi has just committed unforgivable sin  Kanaan with the "Gordon Ramsay"vibez and and the jollof rice was 👎 Jason 👌👍
😂😂😂😂😂
They’re as messy as the women
Such over reactions!
as a ghanaian our jollof is better
"This brudda cant cook" Literally ten seconds after breakdancing 💀
Chidi guy probably just swallows🤣🤣🤣
No ketchup in Jollof rice
These guys are British not Nigerian...
Chidi just participated in the challenge to eat
Nigerian men, why y’all so dramatic??? 😂
Jason THE VIBEEE
Chidi is cute 🥰 let me taste his rice we can create a recipe together in the kitchen 😊
Jason is hilarious
Blindfold them NEXT TIME!!!
"I probably nailed it" Nailed it to the cross of cavalry? Yeah man. you did.
😂😂got me cracked up
that "it's okay" had me on the floor 😅
6:27 Somehow the 4 slowly appearing next to Chidis Face was so funny after they all just straight up ROASTED Him 😂
kanaan toooooooooo fine😫
"Please arrest whoever made this thing"😂😂😂
I'm convinced none of them know what jolly rice taste like.
The only good person here is Chidi😂
Kanaan’s expression >>>>>😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
the only genuine reaction is chidi the others just trying to mock each other mother recipe
8:57 LOOKS DRY 😃  10:25 god might think it’s amazing but not me😅
Jason the main character
lmaooo jason is BRUTAL 😭😭
"Jollof" isn't a flavor. Jollof rice is a combination of all the goat seasonings, peppers both bell and scotch b's, followed by curry powder and black pepper.
The haters couldn’t admit the first guy’s is good.
I love Kanaan
still a goated video to this day
Lateef called jollof rice j cole lmao
A good plot twist would of been cool. They should of served each man his own dish he cooked without him knowing
I like how Jollif rice is going viral these days. I would like to try it.
No ketchup in Jollef tice. This guy is chatting rubbish 😂
Proof no one knows what they talking about.
Basmati rice in jollo 💀 that's new ive only seen them being used in biryanis or pualos
Overseasoning ? Never heard that before
Jason ah vibe on every video‼️🤣🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣
Ketchupp??!!
Can you tag them all😅😅❤
Chidi just dey dash point anyhow
Ketchup in the jollof is actually crazy. I’m shocked
Folks are too extra now. They wouldn't go to the restaurant with this criticism..
rice pudding jollof😂😂😭 i’m on the floor😭😭😭
so the takeaway here is 4 men who complain and none of them can actually cook the dish well?
The out-of-focus camera work is making me sooo angryyyy...I've literally never seen a video on youtube with such glaring technical errors so I had to comment. just use autofocus if you don't know how to work your camera, bra.
Kanaan reminds me of Jamie from Top Boy
not KANAAN being so critical 🤣
You can literally feel the 🇳🇬 naija language from their mouths..💯
which one be basmati, which one be long grain again? 😏😏 No be local & foreign rice again?? 🤷🙄😂🇳🇬
Get these guys rating other food...
Overlooking the comment competitiveness IMO Maggi is the winner...
5:39
Proof Nigerian Jollof is trash.
Ofc chidi rates them all good. Bros was the worst
Going from Jason's 20.5 to Chidi's 4 scores was such a quick turnaround lol.
Jason made me laugh all through 😂😂
It's horrible to see men act that way ish doesn't suit them 😬
Wh would've guessed that the dude who looked older than the rest and booming with charisma won?
Liberian Jollof is way better den that tomato flavor bs 😭
There's three guys, and then there's Jason.
So funny, that they all give critique more than they can cook
Why are they all zesty 💀
That was so funny! 😂 I loved it! Thanks for that!
They should do this, but feed them their own rice, and tell them it’s somebody else’s
"It tastes like instant noodles" Bruh.
If you enjoy it in your house, you enjoy it in your house 🤣
Lmaoooooo
I’m a white British male and I made jollof rice after hearing nonstop about it from African members of staff in the hospital which I unfortunately was in for a while  The rice is so good and there’s so many recipes on YouTube I really recommend you try it  Just take a list when you go shopping coz you’re likely to use lots of spices that i for one didn’t have in the house!  I actually brought in the rice to hospital and they were all too quick to tell me how theirs is better! But mine was good! Definitely a pride thing.  Jollof is a big W
I wanna see northerners try eachothers bacon sarnies
If Chidi gives high mark for poorly cooked food, its obviously a sign that he can't cook😭😂.
i feel bad that they didn't get to eat the rice right after it was cooked- give 'em a fighting chance and don't let it dry out, you know
"there is no control in this house" tough
camera was out of focus the WHOLE time
why are they so hateful of one another
Jason zesty asf
Nah they need to do another jollof rice episode because this was not it. It was hilarious but we need to see some good good, good good jollof rice presented!
I love chidi . No to much expectation and very generous with his critics
Jason's meal looked the best honestly ❤
how does a massive channel like buzzfeed fuck up the focusing for that one guy lol???
How bad is it that they give you a 1 😂😂😂😂😂
The little ingredient that nobody knows about is ( ketchup sir ) 😂😂😂
Ketchup 😢 God please
As a Australian this is the funniest thing to watch it's like your discussing football and cussing each other. I hope your all married because you all need practise 😂😂😂😂😂 funniest funny guys
they're jsut busting each other other asses, neither of this dumbass can cook
You guys cracked me up.😂 The comments were brilliant😅😅 I'd never heard of you guys until I saw this Title   You have won me over. I have subscribed. Love from a Nigerian, British Aunty.  This was hilarious. Love you guys so much. Great personalities. I'll be following this Channel from here on in. God bless ❤️  🇬🇧🇳🇬
I tried making Jollof recently.. i used too much tomato paste, but I feel like I will always be unsure of it's goodness unless i have a true Nigerian approval. My Little 40%  Nigerian isn't enough to be sure lol
5:17 HAD ME DYINGGG
Film a show about Jollof. Don't invite Ghanaians onto the show. Why is Buzzfeed like this?
Arrest whoever made this😂😂. Gotta love nigerians yo
Nigerians have such an interesting way of insulting you, it's usually so polite that you dont realize how BADLY they dissed you until hours later when you are by yourself and now you're sitting in bed crying after processing what they actually meant lmaooo
" If you dont cook you no find wife!"
Are we just going to leave it when the guy said to add ketchup
Please incase of next time for a more African or Nigerian taste get someone that stays in Nigeria to do it not bunch of Nigerians staying in England thanks 😊
Chidi overrating all the low scoring ones is kinda super telling lol
Yoloff rice XD
If you enjoy in your house, you enjoy in your house💀💀
Who puts ketchup in jollof rice !!!!!!??
He said ketchup in the jellof….jail.
See that they can eat with utensils just fine, when i see them eating soupy things with their hands... thats so disgusting.
My conclusion after watching this video: All Jollof rice sucks unless you make it.... then it still sucks, but at least it's your own.
😂😂😂oh my God this is probably the most hilarious video I’ve seen on YouTube. Omooo, naija guys ehn
Isn't long grain and basmati the same?
This one is so classic Yo😂😂😂
fake af. not a single clip of them preparing it???
I got a bone to pick with u Jason. What possessed you to put ketchup in that rice
Jason need his ass beat for putting ketchup in that shit
Imagine the first reaction someone has trying your food is uncontrollable laughter
Been here a million times now lmaoo
I love Jason but him saying plan-tin irritated me😭
Lol   Magi  is made of  " monosodium glutamate " ............" IT CAUSES CANCER "
My man said “Looks dry” mid dance 😭
Man said ketchup in it
5:52 he said that while I was eating rice pudding
I have never laughed so much lmaoooooo
I hope these guys come back for another series because I come back to watch this video daily…. It is tooo funnny !
Why are these British people acting Nigerian
half these guys didnt even know how to make plain white rice much less any sort of complex rice dish
😂😂😂
This video had me hollering
leave it to buzzfeed to be incapable of focusing their camera's properly
I've come across quite a few nigerians in college. They seem to always be a pleasure, and this video had me in stitches.
Chidi is definitely a husband material lol. We don’t want anyone criticizing our cooking please. Girl, don’t need stress….
Chidi is low maintenance
The way chidi said “ you don’t feed this to people had me dying “
First of,ketchup doesn't belong in jollof.Ibegi
Chidi is so calm and seems kind too❤
Chidi did you say you are A Chef?
The fact that they’re talking about cooking for their wife and family is impressive. 😂
"The good news is God loves you" is such a burn
It makes sense that Chidi only gives high ratings since he got a four.
My neighbor is a widowed Nigerian woman and she offered me and my fiance to come over for her birthday and celebrate in her backyard with her kids. I've always wanted to try Nigerian food and I was excited for all the things she brought out.. and the jollof rice was the grand slam of the night. Never tasted rice. So good in my life, it was literally the best part of the meal and that's saying a lot because of how good everything else was. She sent us home with a lasagna tray full of jollof rice. I wish she could have been on this video, I bet she would have knocked these guys down with her family recipe.
i was wondering why half the nigerian men in the video were gay and then i saw the buzzfeed
I love Jason 😂. I wanna see him more. Actually i like all the guys. Their reactions are funny
Kétchup???
They are horrible at each other, as always the problems of Africans are africans themselves, not an ounce of respect of education.
I didn’t know there was a Nigerian version of “if you like it I love it” 😭😭😭😭 best line
'If you enjoy it in your house, you enjoy it in your house' 😂😂😂😂
What is the music at the end cause it is fire🔥🔥🔥
Damn Chidi😂😂😂 they said u can't get a wife or provide for your family off that cooking 😂😂
Their reaction to Chidis jollof, I’ve been laughing for the past 5 minutes 😂😂😂😂
Chidi's a chill dude. Sure, the brother CANNOT cook, but he kept it calm without doing all that unnecessary hating
why do they always find the most judgemental pieces of shit for there videos?
why are they all gay
Jason jarring af
All of them are British.
Tittle sounds like a porno or wife swap 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Damn they did not hold back 😂
kanaan is so fineeeee
They have beautiful skin ❤
I wish they did a react to comments and blinded folded test
“For God made Christ, who never sinned, to be the offering for our sin, so that we could be made right with God through Christ.” 2 Corinthians 5:21 NLT  We are sinners, we all deserve to be punished for our sins but Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, paid our punishment for us on the cross in full. He did this for us so that whoever believes in Him and repents, should not be punished, but have eternal life with Him in heaven!   We have to get right with God. Please turn to him today. :)
cool, why is this on buzzfeed UK though?
Ok the one that said ketchup cannot win or we riot
Kanaan’s good looking 😌
love how they keep making videos of guys cooking food from countries where the women only cook
Basmati is long grain you wolly.
"Its the rice that go gets a platinum without no features." Lateef, Great compliment 😄
Basically let only momma or auntie cook otherwise it won't be a pleasant surprise.
😂😂
Why aren't there an unbiased  afrikan tasting the food?
Jason legit looks like a live version of the beagle boys from Disney (German: Panzerknacker) 😱😱😁 You can't unsee that^^
They actually looks like men from different nationalities not from one country.
Screaminggggg
Everyone of them didnt cook it well 💀 exept the first dude
i'm DYING LOL!!!!!!
theyre british not nigerian
they cool with gays in nigeria ???
There's no control in this house 🤣
Mr Jason obviously loves his food
Kanaan man Jesus Christ. That’s the family recipe from generations??? Omo I hope your parents don’t see this. 😂😂😂😂
The moment the 2nd guy gave the 1st guy’s jollof an 8 i new he can’t cook
The way they all stared at the second plate😂😂
"I don't even wanna see thus by my site, by the time I open my eyes"
The guy with the letter "B" on his jacket should have an "H" for HOTTIE! 🔥😏
U guys are funnyyyy😂😂😂😂😂
I love Jason's demeanor.  He seems to be a funny guy in real life
Chidi made prison jollof 😂😂
Kwasia
I think i have watched this like 7times 😂😂😂😂😂😂 watching for the 5th time in 2025 😂
Can't believe Kanaan's rice was whack😂 cos he was really mouthed
These men be critiquing like they Michelin star chefs lol
"This brotha can not cook!" 🤣
Kanaan is absolutely gorgeous
People don’t know good things… lateef please 🙏🏾 😂😂
Chidi will eat anything 😭😭
If u enjoy it in ur house  U enjoy it in ur house 🤣
Hm this is new 😂
The worst cook liked pretty much everything. Either he was the most fair judge or he doesn't know how to cook so even bad cooking tastes good to him. LOL
“Kannan he’s so extra … Like it can’t be that nasty if everybody else can swallow it
Bro chidi is literally my cousin the others don’t know real Nigerian rice I live in Nigeria 😂
Concoction rice
Why does this Kanaan guy smell food? We don't smell food in Nigeria, Bra.
came back to watch this & Jason is sending me again 😂😂😂
Anyone know their social media handles😭😂??? They're so funny
I hate to say this but they don’t care what rice they use then they’ve completely neglected the traditional dish .
The contrast in energy from Jason to Kanaan and the other guy when Chidi’s dish came out.
First of all... why rhey gotta throw the plates down like that?! 😂 And Jason is hilarious so even if his food aint good his humor will capture his true love
smell wise very oily😂
Has to be basmati rice ngl
They did chidi bad if that was me  my friends and family will not touch this Video
“This show has to be rigged!” My brother Chidi, three man giving you 1,1 and 2 only screams to me u never had a chance 😂😂😂
Nah, got to love Chidi man. Anything goes 😂😭
Because the chicken wasnt seasoned 👉Bruh said he has "No control of his house"😭
Bahahahah! 🤣😂
LMAO @ God love you, feed it to God 😭
They should honestly have them taste their own dishes at the end so that we can know if they truly think they did a good job or if they agree that they messed up 😅
I am in tears this is hilarious
"It's the rice that goes platinum with no features" - That's a bar!
So you guys also can't agree?
Ngl that rice looks crunchy ASF and over spiced 😂😂
Watching them all shit on each others rice is hilarious
Get 4 guys who can actually cook next time.
"you know how Mufasa and Scar...?" Shit got political
Arrest whoever made this😂😂
this has to be the funniest video
Alright here we go.  I have nooooo clue what this is supposed to look like or taste like  So glad a fellow Jason is on this show
What my boy Mikal Bridges doin here?
That was a disrespectful comment  about God. God's Love and Blessings ✝️ 💜.
lmaooooo
Buzzfeed Nigeria
Bro didn’t care if he was on camera for Chidi’s dish. “This broda can’t cook”😭😭😭
knew jason would win 🤣
So what actually is it then 😅
This is why we say Ghana jollof is the best lol all their food seems to suck
The silence
Kanaan: how will you provide for your family  Kanaan jollof rice also not provide for the family:👁👄👁
I am like chidi with food , nice to more of  someone like that honestly
JUST PICTURE DA BABY BUT NIGERIAN = JASON😅🥰
Jollof rice isn’t a dish. It is a religion. 🤤
I’m confused, isn’t basmati rice long grain? Why they calling it short grain
I feel sorry for chidi
"You don't feed this to people"... Who be this guy?🤣🤣
Kaanan was violating on chidis plate🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The look of concern when Chidi’s late came out
Chidi is just happy to be there. All their Jollof looked mid though
How they gon give mikal bridges a 4 😂
is that the same as Latvians call it "Plovs"?
I prefer to use long grained rice to make jollof rice
Jason started dancing cuz he knew he won
Moral of the story Nigerians can’t make jollof :/
Jason energy is making things better
😂
Kanaan said arrest them 😂😂😂😂
Tbh, how do you make basmati rice mushy? He achieved the impossible
chidi got the best reactions lol, brother can't cook
Omg what have I got myself into here lol 😆 fam♡ily
Everyone when they saw Chidi’s rice: THIS IS THE SCENE!😩
As an African I will never , and I mean never claim jollof rice and ketchup.
Wtf am I watching
LMAOOOO
i come back to this video simply for the "If you enjoy in your house, you enjoy in your house".
The confidence relative to the reaction - how will we ever know what good jollof is!
Oooh... I don't think I would want to cook for a Nigerian man. These guys are brutal!
Tomato sauce??? Please take this man off the panel
GHANAIAN Jollof or NIGERIAN which reigns suppreme?
Not even from Nigeria yet I can cook jollof rice better than any of them all of these look like wall paper paste
“theres no control in this house”😭
lol you have no control in this house
This is how you judge men. This is the best and only way to judge men.
All sound British to me?
Only decemt dish they have 😂
Why are they forming accent when  they r from naija, typical nigerians
They were really shitting on Chidi 4:47 😂😂😂😂😂
I think Chidi has damaged taste buds.
so funnyyyy!!!!
😂
Recipe for man with the chicken?  Or is this a family secret thing?
‘I’ll give you 1 coz it almost looks orange’ lol 😂
Poor chidi 😢
Jason was hilarious😂😂 go Jason
Ketchup in Jollof rice, Nigerians can't be serious 😂😂😂
Bro with the black Jean jackets reaction is HILARIOUS 😂😭
Omgg I totally get what he means by it tasting like instant noodles 🤮 I recently tried 2 separate Nigerian restaurants n they both had that weird noodley taste . It just tasted wrong. I think that’s what happens if the pepper isn’t allowed to cook well
Pray before you eat
Lyings is a sin
"Dis brudda can't cook" got me 😂
I really want one of those plates right now. I also want jason as my mate, hes hilarious
5:15 all that enthusiasm turned into this brotha can't cook 😂
BROOOOOOOOO this too funny
“This brotha can’t cook” 😭😭😭😭😭😭😂😂😂
Chidi got 4 damn 😭
Is it a Nigerean thing to be hating and condescending? Literally watched multiple videos and they always dislike the food.
Hi Modesta. Very good vlog.. Good stuff.
Congrats but, my Husband's Jolof rice would have easily won!  He definitely don't come to play!!! LOL
Kanaan got humbled, pompous douche
“Please arrest whoever made this” 😂😂😂😂
“There’s no control in this house…” so Naija 🤣
these men are hilarious omg 😂😂😂
He said it smells oily 😂😂😂😂
Lmaooo
This is when they just fucked with the guys and gave them Ghanaian jollof rice
Jason took his chance to act like a cooking show judge and milked it🤣🤣
😂😂 🇳🇬 Jollof is🤮💩💩💩 the best is? https://youtu.be/rqs9FNJ7qsU
Whenever someone in one of these videos makes something everyone agrees is trash, I can never take their words or ratings seriously lmao
We knew Chidi couldn't cook cause he liked everybody stuff
Ketchup?!?!
I'm always so surprised by how much they love their own dish but hate everyone else's like if it's good it should be good
Nothing better than watching the nature channel on youtube
Alright. As a recent binge-watcher of Bob Hearts Abishola/burgeoning Nigeria-boo, I can definitely say this about my understanding of the stereotypically portrayed Nigerians. Their public opinions surrounding their expectations of others resonate deeply with my own inner self-worth dialogues. It's like their society stopped hiding how judgemental they were. And instead, treated each other with the same self-loathing and criticism that they honor themselves with.
What if they say it’s someone else’s and give them their own and see what their reaction is 😂
Moral of the story.....                                   Dont cook joloff rice
Chidi's rice looks like porridge beans 😢😂😂😂
I was kinda hoping that they would share the winner's recipe
You should be ashamed if you as a nigerian cant cooka proper national dish
If you take hat guy's votes out of the competition things get pretty close. Guy inflated the scores a bit. (Corrected hat guy's score by substracting the average of the 3)  12.5 - 2.7 - 6 - 10
All nigerian food is inedible
Jason is hilarious omg
I love Nigerian people man 😂😂 ❤
Apparently none of these people can cook Jollof Rice 😂
Chidi must be a good husband because he seems to eat whatever he's served, and finds everything good, no matter if the other guys trash it  lol
They say no, but the type of rice really makes a difference. My landlord makes a yellow rice that we eat with different dishes in the house and he always uses Jasmin rice, and it tastes very good all the time. He has the recipe honed to always come exactly the same. One day I went cheap in the supermarket because I complained that the rice was expensive (it was my turn to pay for it), so I got some other long rice, not Jasmine. Man... even I complained about how that rice came off. Flavor, texture, yuck! Nothing was good. Will never make that mistake. Buy the right thing.
At this point chidi just there to eat 😂
Great show, guys! Very creative and original. Kudos
Its not really fair bc when one is generous with points or on the other hand only give low grades there's a gap once its their turn. They should add one more person or 2 who don’t present anything but still try each dish and give a grade.
These guys can't even cook
The two that critique the hardest is trash so sad
why they so gay and british
English food 🤮
Kanaan, if you're out there, I will eat whatever you feed me.
Dang Chidi 😂
wooooow arrest whoever made this😂🤣😂
The dude in white wanted that win bad
Jollof rice isn't even Nigerian 🙄
guy 1: "so this is my mom's recipe you guys will love it." guy  2: "this here is my mom's recipe, if you hate it, i will hate you for free" guy 3: "my mom taught me this recipe, if you disagree, ok" guy 4: "this recipe has been passed down through generations gifted to me by my mother"
Lmaoo Jason
“It’s Look dry” meanwhile Jason 🕺🕺🕺🕺
Or find a husband
they should add a 5th person who has never eaten it. they won't know authentic jollof rice, but it would be fun to see how someone new to the dish rates them.
Lol he said i aint eating that peasant food 😂. Looks bad honestly
Lateef is goals😂😂😂😂
Highlight and Take away - Lateef "Is okay"😂 - Chidi doesn't have taste buds though  Nigerian men will not kill me😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ah man I can make this this is the grandaddy of Jambalaya rice.
Are they just haters, is this a culture thing lol
why is half of this out of focus
You need to feed them their same dish. If they can't accept their own bad cooking how can they judge others?
They all are Funny as Hell
IT LOOKS DRY😂😂😂😂
Jason😂😂😂😂😂 Kanaan and his bad mouth "how Will you provide for your family"😂😂😂
If i were Chidi i would be practicing how to make some good jolof rice if Chidi wanna find a nice wife later in life.
Do this one again but blindfolded!
“There is no control in this house” is the BEST insult I have heard all year!
Boy was like "please, Arrest whoever made this thing"🤣🤣😂🤧
🤣
Quite good quite good when you can’t cook 😂😂😂😂😂  Chidi is so funny
Lateef is hilarious 😂
Jason was too hyped for chidis jollof 😂😂 it looked like refried beans no mam
go back to africa
This is very entertaining. They're all so scathing! So dramatic! Love it. Reminds me of all my West African colleagues. Of course, Ghanaan jollof is superior to Nigerian jollof...*runs and hides*
Smell wise.....very oily.   WHAT
Well ain't this a tough crowd lol
"How will you provide for your family?"  We see here a case of Precision Orbital Bombardment..
Plot twist: All the dishes were exactly the same.
Did bro just say ketchup on Jollof? You sure you’re Nigerian😭😭
What I've learnt is that Nigerians don't like each other's Jollof rice 🤣
the only time I see kind try-me-sheets is when Aussies do it, we are blessed ♥👼✝
I love Jason so much I cant even describe it lmao
“If you enjoy it in your house, you enjoy it in your house 😬”
Ghanaians use Basmati rice to make Jollof. Note: this grain of rice is not even indigenous to Africa. You cannot make good food with the inherent inferiority complex. Ghanaians 🇬🇭 are just weird & IRRELEVANT + there is nothing wrong in hurting their feelings, SO THEY IMPROVE & use authentic African products for the production or food. 🦅
None of the brothers can cook Jollof rice lol Chidi will eat anything
Camera was out of focus for the entire shoot and you guys still posted this? WTF
Kanaan must stop lying to us that he got help from his mum because how do you get help mommy and still cook rubbish 😂😂😂
As a Good Place fan, i love that there's a Jason and a Chidi
"there's no control in this house" lmaoooo
7:51 its orange.... got me laughing and not being Able to breathe 😂😂
Why are y'all scooping with a fork!?
Niggas loook the same
Kennan is gorgeous
these videos are always passive-aggressive and condescending lmao. that's buzzfeed though!
I don't know why people are so rude in this video series. Like damn, someone put their all into that - at least make neutral comments.
God loves you you can feed it to god
My guy really said “COSLAW” in his jollof rice. That’s a disgrace
I get the "basmati felt like you eating less", I guess because basmati is just not as dense as usual rice
i knew jason was gonna win his vibes were impeccable and obviously so was the jollof
Why Jason look like da baby lol
Jason is a vine
Funny!!
Damn Kanaan is hot!!
The second guy doesn’t have a clue .. he is saying he like best using basmati rice and right after saying he doesn’t like long grain rice 🤦🏻‍♀️
“If you enjoy it in your house, enjoy it in your house. “ 💀💀
"You don't do this to people"🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😩
bro said ketchup
Chidi was so kind to everyone, he looked as if he really didn't mind anything that he was given.
These dudes be HATING
Hence it shows…. That we humans can judge really well but can’t actually do things on our own but they can judge. Judging that part they got it under covered.
'By the time I open my eyes' 😂😂😂He was raised by good parents!
Did this man say ketchup on jollof?? Also the rice you use is parboiled! Fight me!
Bruh the way they both was silent then the one man just hyping it up🤣
everybodys food was bad bc jollof rice is proper trash. one of those things that tastes good prob bc you grew up on it like Micky Ds as a child, but when you develop a palate, uh uh.
Haha, these idlers have never made jollof rice in their lives!
that one guy look like annoying tv
Just because you know the ingredients that are in your favorite dish , it does not mean you can make that dish yourself 😢chidi ahah 😵🤣🤣
Basmati rice is long grain rice..
7:34 the look of confusion 😂😂
En algún momento cocinar se vuelve un asunto de ego 0.o
"Ah" 😹😹😹😹
Chile this is asinine. They gonna complain about every dish cause it’s not theirs 😂😂😂
Add Chapters fellas
They be so critical about everyone else’s dish but speaks so highly of theirs 😂
Not Jason saying let me taste it again and takes a big ass spoon after saying he can’t cook😂
why are they serving rice with a fork
*whispers" Men can't cook jollof..
0:44 for a split second dude looked liked preach. if you know you know
Not the Aunties Arms
Nigerian men cant cook confirmed?💀
title should say britissh nigerian
😂 none of you can cook.
3:34 no control in this house 😂
Man i love Jason. Brings all that energy and is funny. Gives good criticism while cooking good himself
isn't basmati a long grain rice though?
naawwwwwwwwwwwww the way he just laughed after tasting his food i cantttttttttttttttt
When he said "if you enjoy in your house enjoy in you house."
06:35 HE MY HUSBAND
Chidi can eat shit and still say delicious
kanaan kinda cute tho
Only Jason eating with a spoon. An adult.
hahaha Maggi... damn, guarantee you white ppl don't know what Maggi is..
i mean, of they can't tell you with 100% certainty which type of rice they use to cook it, you better believe they probably almost never cooked it before. Their mom cooked it for them up untill now.
I loved this panel they were all funny. I've never had jollof but I know the ingredients and it's similar to stewed tomatoes rice dish we have in the south.
God loves you. You can feed it to Him. Weak
They lit each other up
The silence on Chidi's dish 😭
This was hilarious!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Poor Chidi, bless his heart 😮
Why are yall eating rice with a fork ? Like how how can you really taste the rice you didnt get a full scoop lol
This has to be the funniest 😂😂
How you gonna find a wife  huh! How CHIDI!!! tell me what sustenance you gonna provide for your family.
“Arrest whoever made this thing” had me holleringggggg😂😂
"Grab the leftovers from an ice-cream container in the fridge two days later". Talk about keepin it real, yo. 😆💯💯
Nigeria = Drama! 😂
All four gentleman were very entertaining
if only they put as much effort actually cooking the darned thing as they roasted eachother.
0:44 what did this man say. What business does a Nigerian have saying plan-TIN
These people are eating some fucking basmati with down syndrome istg cos basmati is like the long grain rice
The only time I've ever been able to cook nice Jolof rice was when I was drunk 1 Christmas.😂
So basically none of them could make this 🤣 !
I enjoyed this episode..rice is my favorite food
E nor good to too make mouth o😂😂
You don't have any control in your house 😂😂
For reall😭😭💀
Chidi 😂😂
I can watch these guys all day 😂
Jason an kanaans expressions kill me . The way I cackled like never before 😂wooh chille
😂😂😂I need a telescope to see that moisture
He said lock this man up 😂😂😂
They cracking me up talking bout and u tryna to find a wife? How will you provide for your family with dis food? Lmaooo hilarious 😂😂😂
Chidi, bless him.
Lol "there's no control in the house" 😀🤣
everyone’s at different party’s yoh
Omgg...Jason😂😂😂
lmfao
jason's too loud and overenthusiastic!😒🙄
“He has no control in his house” 😂😂
I thought that was Franklin for a sec 🤣
Nigerians are too funny https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKxj8WJouIA
“And then you are going to go and find wife, how are you going to provide”😂😂😂😂😂
Shot of Kanaan is not in focus. Are you hiring camera people, Buzzfeed?
WHO LET HIM COOK🔥🔥
Man Jason is so funny 😹😹😹😹😹😹
They should be eating Ghana jollof, the best in the world >>> https://youtu.be/-pP3-fiG4A8
that proves how you can get humbled real quick if other people tasted your food 😂
I’m just sad they don’t have that funny strong Nigerian accent
It's wild that this is these are the MEN chosen to represent Nigerian MEN! The internet is undefeated
My moms name is Chidi😂
im white and i can do much better jollof then all off them, no cap
Imagine if all of them were from a fine dine restaurant.
without the jollof rice : 😮😮
did lateef do a cross for prayer before eating then say bismillah or am i tripping
mandem ruthless yanno
Wait, are these the guys that Juicy Smulié hired?
It would be more interesting if they took an Nigerian mom which they don't know off and let them taste test also her rice. To see their reaction also then.
I can watch Jason whole day long
Where are the white men on here?
The attitude is unbearable. 🤬
My lovely Ghanian and Nigerian family, something big happened regarding our jollof rice and who does it better. First let me say i love good food, i experiment and i love both Nigerian and Ghanian dishes.   However, in a cultural event we had at work in London the feud started all over again. so there was a large crowd on the said day and non Africans and non Ghanian and Nigerians were the umpires. so guess what the outcome was, it appeared that everyone endorsed the Nigerian Jollof rice as the bees knees. Now i have said, i trust this beautiful feud between these beautiful nations is over.  personally i love both, i also strongly believe that a good dish is not about the nation that  prepped the dish but the individual chef and ingredients available to them. The Nigerian Jollof was simple but ouch it was sweet Oo. I love you all, now lets focus on developing Africa.
I love how these videos are edited 😂
How can something smell oily
This is why Ghanaian J rice is better
"YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO COOK JOLLOF RICE PROPERLY IF YOU WANT TO FIND A WIFE" took me outttt 😭😭
I wager a bet not one of them were born in Nigeria but sure
You don't do this to people  🤣🤣🤣
Why are black ppl so rude and bitter about everything
I want to try this rice so bad.
Eating chicken and judging... supposed to be judging the rice lol
Nigerian Scammers at my restaurant are killers, lol. They will do anything they can to get upscale food for free.
Ok I am not Nigerian but what tf was this. The bro who won has ketchup in his rice. I just cant😂
Chidi doesn’t know the taste  of  good food and that slim boy on hoodie I’m so glad he didn’t even come second and I’m so glad the Eddie Murphy looking guy won I love his vibe
by timestamp 0:55 I already knew who fucked up the jollof, I have not finished the video yet but I would not trust this man in my kitchen. KEtchUP with my Jollof? what jolly need condiments
I just know Jollof rice is for Nigerians what Biryani is for Indians....really enjoyed watching this video🤌
Kanaan’s jollof tastes like noodles😂😂 and his here making faces while trying other peoples food. I thought his jollof would win based on his overly critical attitude😑🙄
Lateef man talking shit but then he come with great jallof rice but only in his own mind😂
God forbid someone serve me Chidi's Jollof.
Chidi hyping it up and everything. He’s being suuuuuuuuper generous with those numbers and then there’s his plate😂. Jason had that energy until Chidi’s plate came along. I’m sorry though I can’t take Jason serious with that hair tho
Toight it was a nigerian media No its a british one British cuisine did change
Some strong London accents there. Have any of them ever actually been to Nigeria? 😂
This Kanaan guy is fine 😍
The commentary 🤣🤣🤣
Ketchup?????
i was with the guy in the white untill he mentioned coleslaw and ketchup 💀
The one with the glasses is the only one that actually cooked or got an Auntie to cook. Everyone else got instant rice with food coloring or bad take out lol. They play too much loo.
Why are things randomly out of focus in some videos? Especially the food...sometimes there are closeup shots that are very weak.
Kanaan's facial expressions killed me and chidi just being a yes man😭😭😭
"I give it a 2. No intact a 1, actually" GOD THAT MIND CHANGED SO FAST
Bring all of them back pleaseee! They’re all too funny 😂😂
Omg a 4 out of 40. Crazy  I feel like some of them found out they couldn't cook
Bruh these videos are just extremely fortunate people complaining about good looking food
Buzzfeed uk vids are never focused . Why is this not fixed
Jason will eat anything. Smh. 😂ketchup in jollof?? Why??
2nd guy is batts
“This brother can’t cook” has to be the funniest thing ever 😂😂😂😂
These dudes act like females. Wow. Just taste the dish HomeBwooooooaaa & rate it afterwards. 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️ I like the Brutha in the white w the hijaz’s energy 🙌🏾😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂🥹
“The ice cream container “ 😂😂😂
nigeria has such good food
Anybody with a British accent is a perplexing human being...
I neeeeeed this group back. PLEASE BRING THEM AGAIN.
I think people can get so used to bad J rice that they start enjoying it. I used to get J rice after sports and it was nasty at first but after a month it tasted like actual j rice to me. When I brought it home though my mum thought it was a concoction that deserved to be used for rat poisoning
Looks like btec biryani 😂😂
what the fuck is wrong with the focus on this video my god!!!
News flash, all of your Rice suck. My mom’s is the best. That last guy’s rice looked like Mac and Cheese 💀
Chidi is a kind hill of rice
I’m crying at Chidi he likes everything no fuss at all
We all know when a plate of jollof is in our face we will eat it
Ofc he gon win. Who eats bare jollof? My friend add some meat! 😭😭😂
Kanaan 😂that made mouth😂😭😭 Jollof rice tastes like noodles
This brother can’t COOK!! 😂
These guys are hilarious!!!!!
I always feel like children of immigrants got some identity problems. lol. overcompensating by acting like arbiters of what is and isn't the correct way to cook food. There's probably thousands of different recipes for jollof rice, none of them are the right way.  Its like a common theme I've seen in videos like this.
Jason is EVERYTHING 🥰
"I don't feel like you made it with love and that's prolly why it's dry" 🤣🤣 Love Jason's personality. He's so funny
Jason and Kanaan carried the humour on their backs
This needs a part two or a retake haha
none of these people can cook one is talking about ketchup the other is saying bbq
That was fun. I’m the cook in my family. Cooked Thanksgiving dinner for my my girlfriend. It worked married 27 years. Lol.
JASON IS HILARIOUS!!!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
firstly ketchup WHAT!!!!,  but basmati rice is the best it lighter, cleaner and fluffier
They are all such sore hilarious losers. But they all kinda cute
There Shouldn't Be Ketchup Inside Jollof Rice.
Kanaan looks literally like Yakub without bigass forehead wtf
The one guy who said what you like in your own house, has it right and that's what every single person on this panel has to realize. You all sound like a bunch of arrogant pricks.
as someone who is fasting for a week watching them bitchh about food is pissing me off just eat it and be happy
😆
My African brothers and sisters, whose taking the crown for best Jollof rice ? 🇬🇭 or 🇳🇬 ?👀👀
i like jason lol his personality is lovely
Y’all need to drop theses men’s ig links tho the rice is hot and these men are too lol
i like me some ghanaian jellof
This video proved that Nigerians can b light skinned.
Man's criticizing the shit out of their food but HE CAN'T COOK
Animal fat makes a huge difference in any kind of party rice . I tested with vegetable oil & animal fat . The fat tastes a lot better & also add some meat paste not minced meat & you'll get all sorts of flavors going on inside your mouth 😋.
Chidi is a VIBE!!
yummy
When Jason went in for the second taste 😂😂😂 the mouth pop and look up took me out 😂😂😂
Jason is everything!
bla...bla...bla
Wow you guys are soo supporting if another
Did he just say "add some ketchup" ??? 🫤
“He has no control in his house” 🤣
"But, you know what? God loves you, so that's good. You can feed it to God and He'll say it's amazing... But not me." 💀
Jason: As the first one introduced his ego is attracting us all Lateef: Can we already tell he is picky? Kanaan: Its the young one. We all believe the young one has less experience Chidi: So chill and a chef? Oh yeah def losing
These guys need Oscars, they are so dramatic...lol.
Such black people antics
Is it just me or does Jason look like he has on a prison fit?
my guy in white is on sum disgusting lgbt stuff
I just knew chidi couldn’t cook when he ate and started praising Jason’s food that everyone else was complaining had  too much Maggie 😂😂😂
Jason is so zesty with that head snap and click that I'm not watching anything title "Nigerian men" ever again.
I wanna see the aunties do it now
Y’all I can’t breathe 😂😂😂😂😂😂
All i see is over confident men
Nigerians are all in a competition to be the most Nigerian.
4:07 why was bro so zesty wit it
I feel bad for chidi he was the least judgmental but got the most judgment
Is it like jambalaya
kanaan looking fine af
and thats why its rice & peas hahaha execute yourself breddas
Yeah I’m not really onboard with this one.......
Is no one commenting on the damage done to jollof rice with ketchup?
Why are all these men gay 😂
Chidi gave more points to each of the others than he got in total
Damn, when the second one was put on the table, I just had Uncle Roger's "Sooo wet..." in my head XD
Never in my life have i seen a nigirian pronounce plantain as plantin
This might the funniest episode I’ve watched 😂😂😂😂😂😂
It’s orange.                                      “ah”
Basically, if they didn't make it, it sucks. I've seen several of these videos and it's always the same BS. We get it bruh, it's your way or the highway😒Ever considered all of them suck? Lmaoooooo
Jollof rice is senegambian thing. It got nothing to do with Nigeria.. We all know Nigerian cooking really smells bad.. We got 7 different varieties of jollof.
Yow Jason hilarious, such a good lad. Vibes man
The shade in the room is real lol
Burning at the bottom is a big middle eastern thing when they cook in the big pot check out the Persians cooking
There’s no control in this house 😂
Has the whole of the BuzzFeed UK shit gone mad?
kanaan dish look like kraft mac n cheese
SENEGAL HAS THE BEST JOLLOF NO DEBATE.
I loveeeeeeeedddddddddddddddddd this video wry hilarious men, they should bring them all back for something else🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Y’all gotta try Liberians, trust me we don’t disappoint
JASON IS SO FUNNY I CANT 🤣😂😂
Jason is a vibe 🤣😂
my friend oladami olajide thinks ur cooking skiilz are poo
“This brotha can’t cook” 😭😭😭
You need to be able to cook jollof rice properly if you want to find a wife😂😂😂. How will you provide for your family with this food?😂😂😂😂 Jason & kanaan 2022.
Jason: it’s dry *dances eagerly*
4:20 THE SILENCE 😭😭😭
Why won’t you love Nigerians 🇳🇬🍫😂😂😂😂
*I'm Sorry Y'all Dissin Each Other Is Not Cool*
"since you wanna be funny and feed me noodles, you get a 3" 🤣🤣🤣
Everyone’s skin is so clear
This reminds me of my homeboy who is a Nigerian albino. His family abandoned him cuz he white. It was probably for the best because he got adopted by a family with 💵
Bro…. It’s rice. It makes no sense that some of them are gagging like they’re about to throw up. I’m sure they’ve had Mexican, Asian, and other types of rice too. Like calm down.
Jason is hilarious
May God be with you all throughout your day❤️
"You can feed it to God" and not me. Jason! You don't insult God like that.
I like how Kanaan switched from British to Pidgin....Lets learn to stop forcing shit!!!😏....He is hot AF though😉
Jason 😂😂😂😂💕
AM SORRY but KETCHUP I am offended because I’m Nigerian
why are so many of these shots out of focus
I’ve tried this type of rice before but homemade from somebody from nigeria and it was so good and I like how they also have plantains on the side cause I love plantains
Did I hear PLANTIN🌚😔
Can Jamaican cook jolof rice 🍚
A real Nigerian thinks all good is a 10.
"You can feed it to God, he'll find it amazing."
The way he said ice cream container and we all immediately understood
Men that  can cook 😍😻
This is gonna upset your belly Please, arrest whoever made this thing hahahahhahaa
Kanaan’s commentary is the funniest 😂  but he couldn’t back it up w/ his own cooking 🥴🥴 I thought his Jollof was gone hit
Jason’s energy!!✨✨more of him PLEASE!!
Never had it but now I want some.
But who makes the best zebra?
Nah the way these man are analysing the thing is finishing me😂😂😂😂
Bruh said “if you enjoy it in your house you enjoy it in your house 😂😂😂😂”
5:21 mans is hilarious
In trinidad we call it "paleau" it consists of meat(most common chicken)but other meats like beef,pork,smoked meats,salt beef,turkey can be used or a mixture of different meats in one with rice that is properly cooked with pigeon peas, coconut milk and lots of seasoning including powdered and fresh.When its done the paleau is supposed to be brown in colour and rice well cooked.We serve with lettus,water cress,plantains,macaroni salad,potato salad,cucumbers or coleslaw.We in the Caribbean love fresh seasoning and spices (salt and pepper is not seasoning to us)and our food is always well done.The way food is supposed to be.Love from trinidad.#Arima,Trinidad.
I love Jason's positive attitude
Omg, the first reactions to the second dish! 😭 🤣
“It’s the rice that goes platinum with no features!” is my new favorite line! 😂
Listen the power of your jollof lies in your stew. If you can’t make stew I can’t eat your jollof.
Jason is actually so funny OMG 💀😂😂😂
Everyone who gasses there food up ends up deeeeD
all of their voices are so cuteee
You wanted to be funny and give me noodles 😂
Add ketchup???????
Lollllll.  So shadey.
Kanaan' plate came out and Lateef said WHAT? THIS IS NOT JOLLOF RICE.   IT'S ORANGE AHH. He was so disappointed 🤣🤣🤣🤣
5:14 😂😂😂 was honest
This is probably the funniest food rating I've seen yet. The editing, and reactions are so good. It started of so well with Jason and it went downhill from there 💀💀💀
KETCHUP?! Sir stop! 🗣️🗣️🗣️
"You people are rude"
Kanaah why na  So u can’t cook u come dey judge😂😂😂
Accent plenty o😂😂😂 Make una calm down
You gotta dive in to see the moisture............😂
*"If you enjoy it in your house, you enjoy it in your house"* 🤣🤣🤣
I love how this show makes us see that one cultural dish can differ greatly from house to house
3:30 😂  “You have no control in this house”
lol
I don’t have to watch any of this to realise this is just going to be a battle of egos. You lot need to grow up
Kanaan can feed me anything tbh. 😍
Who else here loves the vibe of jason😆😆
This is because it’s Nigerian jolof, not ghanaian 😂
I’m trying to ketchup with the idea of ketchup in jollof rice.
Damn, I’m watching this as I’m eating my jollof rice after making it for the first time and I feel like they’re talking about me🤣🤣🤣🤣 my jollof rice is definitely orange. It definitely doesn’t look dry like these guys😬 I did overcook my rice a bit but the flavors are on point🤷🏽‍♀️ and with a great taste of tomato and the spice level is perfect. You can feel the heat of the spice while eating it but it doesn’t linger. Now I have to find someone to try it😂😂😂
Chidi is just hungry😂everything is good
Jason laughing at Kanaan’s rice had me on the floor
Chidi can eat anything 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I've eaten lots of different African countries jollof rice .Nigerian is the worse .I ate it .I was in the hospital for  three weeks from Food        posing . I thought maybe the person don't know how to cook .I tried another from a different nigerian person ..this time .me and the toilet was best of friends .never again in my life .I eat Nigerian jollof rice . I love their  fufu  and Egusi.
" this is new " LMFAO
That man Chidi had to audacity to say it was rigged🤣🤣
Black people literally dont like anything but their shitty cook
Wow this is the most accurate baboon documentary ever.
3:33 My Life
These shows are weird.  Do they all just hate the others because of the show? Dumb.  A lot of these episodes are like that.  Hard to watch.
Dis ninja sweet as cane sugar
The snippet told me these mf hate each other’s cooking.
It's Jason for me!!! Hollering!
5:24 best line the whole video 😂🤞
Other People: talking about Jason, Chidi and Kaanan  Me : Lateef?
*You need to be able to cook your Jollof Rice properly if you want to find a wife 😩🤣👌🏾❤️✨*
These guys are so funny 😂
Sarcasm 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. I cannot count again
This episode had me rolling off the bed. 😂😂😂 There’s so many banging one liners.
Kanaan is so handsome to me but honestly I think I’d eat all of their jollof rice😭 I’m not really too picky
Is it really that serious when it comes to this meal in Nigeria???
get into it oooh the others................
Ketch what !!!!
All chidi had to say about every dish was " The sauce to rice ratio was not balanced "
None of them liked each other’s food 😂
Pls arrest whoever made this 💀💀
Ultimate Nigerian Litmus test Jollof rice is my dish ever
I love how that one guy gets excited and the other wants to disapear 🤣 shows you how much food is all about preferences
Who the hell puts ketchup in jollof?
Lmaooooo Jason is really a whole vibe 😂🫶🏼
I was in the middle of a fight between my Ghanian and Nigerian friend regarding jollof rice in High School, so every time i hear something about it I think about them lol
Nigerians are dramatic, I love it
He has no control looool
Kanaan is absolutely gorgeous and his voiceee
It seems there is just something different about when the men critique that's different from when the women do it.  When the women do it it seems malicious.  There was no specific person here who "played the villain."  They all seed genuine in their responses and it wasn't a turn off.  I remember watching an episode where one of the women seemed to give a low score to everyone in order to benefit herself but I don't think it worked.  When these men said something negative about a dish they did not appear to be spiteful.  They gave credit where credit was due.
Culture vultures.
BRING JASON BACK !!
My guy said ketchup and I screamed into the night
Who would have guessed the most flamboyant guy would make the best food? Lol
I hate all of these "people try other people's X dish" because everyone is mean.
*doesn’t like the others guys Nigerian rice.. asks him* “Why ah you gei?”
Kanaan is a picky eater 100%  Likes Instant noodle flavour, thinks everything else bad
They all just need to get a rice cooker. You can't cook, embrace it. It comes out perfectly, with the right ratios, with smart technology.
The issue was none of these are Liberian jollof.
"You don't feed this to people."
I wish you had them try their own too haha
It’s always the guys who can’t cook who are the most judgemental of other people’s food
Lateefs gentle choice of words are so funny to me😂😂😂😂😂😂 I love him lol
*silence*  *Silence*  THIS IS PARTY JOLLOF🎉🎉🎉🥳🥳🥳🕺🕺🕺💃🕺💃💃
Those men are sour 😂😂😂😂😂
I like this channel, but I feel like the food is served cold. It should be served fresh and hot or warm to get an honest score.
hilarious!
the fork USE THE DAMM SPOON
Chidi isn’t Nigerian hahah
They’re not Nigerian are they, they’re English. Casual racism, Buzzfeed UK. Such uneducated behaviour.
We are still calling black men Niger? Very inappropriate Buzzfeed.
Jason: “ you don’t feed people this”
So none of these guys can actually cook…???
Why were none of them tagged???
“There’s no control in this house” 😅
jason & lateef  comedy 🤣🤣
Lmfaoooo This was a funny one
Jason is a whole vibe.
The thing is if your jollof  will be rubbish, it starts from the beginning. If onions are not caramelised well (not undercooked/burnt) you will get the stew(tomato sauce) right.
Maybe have a control plate where someone not trying to win makes the rice the way it is supposed to taste and then compare the other plates to it. Watching these men of Nigerian ancestry try this dish and all make it a different way and swear it is good but they disagree with each other confuses me.
The way they talked about the second dish 😭😭😭
Yo the men move savage about the food in these videos than the Nigerian women.  It’s funny as heck
I watch this all the time we need them to come back
It tastes shit
i'm sorry but no ketchup and no coleslaw
Good Jollof is one that you can put in a freezer and it still taste good when you take it out later.
Like everyone who judged others got judged literally, Chidi was the only one satisfied with whatever he was having 😂😂
Who added Chidi in the competition🤣🤣🤣
thanks! i have no knowledge of jollof rice, but their reactions have me cackling! hahaha
we need a british mums try other british mum's quiches 🤣
jason is funny lol 😂😂😂
The crickets while jason is partyin' lol.
The servers smack down the plates with such attitude.... omg
Kanaan looks like Damon idris
If I can nail jollof rice can I attract a wife ?
Is basmati not long grain in Nigeria?
LOL, none of them can cook it.
Not this obviously gay man talking about how to find a wife. We can all tell Jason is gay.
Makes sense the guy with the worst rice scored everyone else's high. He's used to shitty tasting rice!
I mean, all their rice looks the same....LAWL
I laugh every time when i see black people eat chicken, they have so funny face then))
anyone else think that guy was ehiz
As a Liberian this is so funny.  Nigerians are jokes
*googles how make jollof rice*
Now do Ghana vs. Nigeria jollof haha
So none of them can cook rice? They need wives or they're gonna starve...
I’m screaming at how critical Kaanan was yet his dish was piss poor 😭😭
Nigerians and roasting each other🤞🤞🤞
Nigerian men try other Nigerian men...
Lateef kills me 😂😂😂
Lateef think he's one of them food network judges 🤣😂😂 his facial expressions
What does finding a wife have to do with jollof rice? I don't get it
This rice will give people spots. lol lol
"Rice pudding" 5:53 his expressions , i can't 😭😭😭😭
Nobody's going to talk , about the "it's okay" with that Nigerian accent 😂🤣😭😭
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Kansan killing me with his dramatics
To God it’s probably amazing 🤦🏾‍♀️🤣🤣🤣🤣
Chidi: I’ve tasted worse Ase na him cook worse🤣
0:44 It made my heart happy to hear him pronounce plantain correctly
I feel so embarrassed for chidi 😂😂
6:23 by the time I open my eyes, I want this food off the table 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This was very entertaining! Good job gentlemen.
Love seeing all these men at least trying to cook, I would LOVE to PARTY with Jason and Kanaan just funny
Yes his food was bad, but Kanaan still cute dou. And his personality funny 😂
‘Igbos cook better than Yorubas but Calabars cook better than Igbos.’ (In-general, not so much when it comes to jollof rice.)  I’d be wanting to see more testing if that hypothesis with these videos but it’s harder to find Ididiongs and Uduaks in the UK.
I can watch them all day 😂😂
where are you now?
These kids sounds like they are from London they’re not the cool Nigerians that are tough as fuck and play with hyenas and yell “I want peace always”!
Most of them are not even Nigerian they English 🤦 this is not how Africans eat or taste food
Jollof with ketchup
Jollof rice is bot easy to cook. You have to develop this skill over time for years...and regardless of hoe much you learn... yours will never be as good as your mom's are the ladies that cook it for parties in a big pot. I've said my piece.
“How can you provide for your family with this food?”😂😂
Congratulation 😂
kanaan looks like jamie from top boy fr
Senegal has the  the best Wolof or Jolof  rice
They should feed them their own ones aswell hahaha
Kanaan you’ve disgraced your mommy ooh after all the my mommas recipe 😂😂
Chidi why nhhh 😂😂
I love them eh 😂😂
Lol why they just drop their plates on the table like a Mom who was disappointed in your behavior at school but know she still gotta take care of your hard headed ass?
I think you mispelled British
Arrested for bad jallof rice is CRAZY💀
Kanaan After all that talk..hehehe damn
Chidi I believe you "it was rigged"!
Ketchup?!?! My guy
Ahaha chidiiii 😂
Best video ever! I laughed so hard 🤣
It’s ok it’s ok they tried lmfaooooo
Jollof rice has soooooo many variations depending on who's cooking it and their personal taste. I mean my jollof taste a little different every time I make it.
Ketchup I’m sorry what
Chidi has the right idea, you need food for sustenance, you need a wife for flavour
You need to tell the contest that there are 5 of them so you can serve each of them their own dishes anonymously, bc these reactions are rude af lol see them violate the same plate they’ve been hyping sha 😂
Should have thrown a Ghanaian brother in the mix to really get things going 🤣
I swear not being racist but blacks are always shitting on others in these try others' videos.
chidi truly came to eat and go
Jason the dude who won looks zesty as hell, Seems to be a gay guy no Surprise that his food was the best...
Chiding knew he wasn't going to win. his reactions was void of any surprise loll🤣🤣🤣
I think this series is based on just entertainment. Everyone just acts disgusted and berates the other one's dish to win. Eventually people from other cultures get confused what the dishes are supposed to be like. I'm getting more and more averse to trying these dishes because of the format of programming watching these clips. Not watching it anymore coz i want to try and make my own. Saw 3 clips, ended up losing excitement for the dish and im big on trying foods from different cultures. I get that everyone has different taste but plz find real people who can cook and critique on the food of their culture and are not here for just cattiness and competitive tactics, so that viewers want to try and make that food and pay more respect to that culture/food palate. Btw not triggered coz im not from any of the regions i saw videos of. Just a sponge for cultures and colours of all flavours and people
This is the funny food testing I’ve seen😂😂😂😂 these guys reactions are very funny😂😂😂
I'm just glad to see men cook!!!!
kanaan is so fine
LATEEF “people don’t know good things” 😂😂😂😂😂😂
That 4 took me out...daaaaang 😂. Not even a 5
Guy with the black jacket is fineess
Not Kanaan talking all that mess just to make Ghanaian jollof chai
“There’s no control in this house” 😂😂
none looked like jollof
The look when Chidi’s food was served though 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😭
Jason is a lovable teddy bear lol..He's so passionate about cooking.. And he's giving constructive criticism...
Man said plantin
The shade at 4:00 is too much 🤣🤣 Why are us Nigerians like this, taste it first before judgement
Do Liberian men instead
so is buzzfeed saying nigerian men are fruity or?
i see Jason on Tiktok all the time 😂😂😂 he’s so hilarious❤
Why does jason look like a priest who should not be around children? 😂
Anyone saw Jason on tiktok?
0:47 WHO PUTS KETCHUP IN THERE JOLOF RICEEEE I THINK I'M GOING TO HAVE A HEART ATTACK SEND HELP!!!!!!!!!!😫😱😤😭
Jason called it plantin
They just hating on the other because they want to win 🤦🏽‍♂️
I just saw a cute guy on the thumbnail and clicked it 😂🥲. Kanaan has my heart just like jollof rice has his. 🫶🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾
Chidi’s Dish and there FACES 😂😂😂😂
Kanaans dish 😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣 I had a feeling his wasn’t going to be good
These are so great!
This is the funniest episode no cap, with the way chidi is just eating everything with joy😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Yo, this video was hilarious! Had me rolling the entire time. 🤣
This brother can not cook lol
“You know what God loves you” I’m gonna cry lmaoooo
Kanaan has beautiful skin
Jason is funny i like him😭
Oooh they read Chidi to filth 😂
No way a Nigerian man said plantin
Jason's, Lateef & Kanaan's commentary & Lateef & Kanaan's faces when chidi's plate came out had me laughing so hard I had to pause the video 🤣🤣🤣
"smell wise very oily" LMAOAA
Gambians next ? Or Senegalese ?
Gambians next ? Or Senegalese ?
“Because you wanted to be funny and come here and feed me noodles I give it a 3.” Lol. Okay! 😅
If I made a dish and somebody just straight up asked "How will you provide for your family?" after tasting it, I'd never recover
It's hilarious how confidently Chidi says 'As a man who knows his food', 'as a chef' and his dish always turns out be the worst 🤣🤣🤣 "This brother can't cook" 🤣 4/30 for the dish but 30/30 for his confidence
Daaaaaang they are worst then the aunties.
I PROLLY NAILED IT LMAO
“If you enjoy it in your house you enjoy it in your house”😬😂😂😂😂😂
Black hoodie is beautiful
Kanaan is so funny
Their eyes are so expressive, just looking straight at me through the camera I burst out laughing
Chidi's comment at the beginning had me laughing on the floor😭
Chidi only came to eat
This man said ketchup lol
Chidi judges no one. Everything is good. 😂😂
Nigerians are the Italians of africa
Jason 😂😂😂😂😂
I HAVE GOT A GREAT IDEA HERE‼...😁🧑‍🎓🎓💡⚡🤯😁/😁🥰😍🤩🥳 ...AND... THIS COULD BE A BRAND NEW SERIES FOR BUZZFEED UK‼...👁👁📹😁🥰😍🤩🥳 AS I WAS WATCHING THIS VID‼...👁👁📹😁🥰😍🤩🥳 ...AND... I WAS THINKING THAT MAYBE SOMEHOW AS THE NIGERIAN MEN WERE RATING EACH OTHER'S JOLLOF RICE‼...🍚🍅 THAT BUZZFEED UK COULD TAKE THEIR CAMERAS INTO THE HOMES OF PEOPLE THAT ARE ON THE SHOW‼...👁👁📹😁🥰😍🤩🥳 ...AND... THEY COULD ACTUALLY SHOW THE VIEWERS JUST HOW THEY MAKE THE DISHES THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY RATING ON THE SERIES ITSELF HERE‼...😁🧑‍🎓🎓💡⚡🤯😁/😁🥰😍🤩🥳
Kanaan all mouth but his food is nothing to write home about.

This is one of the best episodes 😭😂I love Jason's reaction after tasting Chidi's dish
I laughed so hard my stomach hurt 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
“If you enjoy it in your house” 😂😂😂 I want to meet his mother I bet she reads dooooooown
"If you enjoy in your house you enjoy it in your house" 😭💀😭
You can tell the guy that guy a 4 just thinks anything is good. Dude hasn’t gave a bad score or review yet. He just eats anything😂😂😂
Why is kanaan so fine though, hes defo the most delicious looking thing in this video and if you dont agree then u blind period♥️
My son loves jollof rice as a Nigerian brazilian I had to learn how to make it. He loves it spicy.
"cause you wanna be funny and serve me noodles"  rofl
Ketchup??? Violation!
Kanaan looks good asf 😩
We Nigerians love our jollof
Put me in the competition I’ll win😮‍💨
Not the icecream container in the fridge 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Gathering ahaha
I was dating a Nigerian girl from the Bronx at one point and she told me she was making this. 👍🏾
I am hollering 😂😂😂😂😂😂
KANAAN SO FOINEEEEE
Kanaan 😍😍😍😍
They was all TRIPPIN 😂
Yooooo Jason is a whole vibe 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is like my favorite video of this king they are hilarious. And I feel they were the most genuine of all the videos like this I have seen.
"Take it, take it, congratulation" honestly killed me 😭😭😭
They are hilarious!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
and now I have evidence that Nigerian jollof is completely ass.😭
Jason…. What Nigerian says “Plantin” 😢
“If you enjoy it in your house…then you enjoy it in your house” 🤣🤣🤣
Lmatfo it’s Jason dancing “ it looks dry “
“It tastes like instant noodles, that nasty noodles”  As I’m making instant ramen 🫠
The melanin babyyy😊
All they do is bitch
I thought it was supposed to be crispy on the bottom though?
Lol man! I love this episode!!♥️♥️ I feel like hanging with these fellas would be a friggin' blast, especially my man Jason!🤣🤣🤣
i loved Jason man 🤣🤣
ketchup??
The first guy is funny af 😂😂😂
I feel like Jamaicans and jolof rice is the same as Texans trying to hype up whataburger
"How will you be able to provide for a family with this food?"  "Well! If you enjoy in your house, you enjoy in your house "  "..You can feed it to God, he'd probably say it's amazing. Not me"  God abeg 🤣🤣 This guys are hilarious! Why was Chidi eating everything without complaining?
Chidi a real one for jus enjoying the food
Kanaan is so cuuuttee❤️!
Guys, all of you are so charismatic! 😂 Love your vibe!  I'm  from Russia❄️, Siberia, tasted Jollof rice at a Heritage festival in Canada❄️ and cooked it myself at home with peppered chicken! Seems like I made it close in taste. I wish I could actually taste each of your Jollof rice and you could rate mine also! 😅
4:04 him dancing over his food😂😂
kanaan so handsomeee
Jason is hilarious
Lol Jason was giving ALL the energy and then when he tasted Chidi's rice was just calmly like "this brother can't cook." 🤣
This video had me rolling on the floor 🤣
Second generation Nigerian men. 😊
This has me dying laughing. Not he can’t provide for his family with that plate 😂
It's delicious, but now I'm allergic to chili peppers, so, I have to pass. You won't wife me up making a spicy food.
😂😂😂Jasonn when he tasted Chidi’s rice. 😂😂🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣🤣 Jasonnn when Chidi’s came out 🚬😩
blurry camera making me feel drunk 😅
Did Kanaan just say he doesn’t like his jollof burnt a bit?! The rice that hits the pot is the besttt! When it hits the pot it hits the spot!! No doubt about it. This man does not know what he’s talking about plssss
But really Yu going to be  chowin down 2 plates at  each otha house when visitin riiiiiite. 😆😁
“This is not jellof rice" 😂😂😂😂
They ALL need a good 'how to cook jollof' session 😅
😂😂Lmaoo this is why Nigerians can't touch us Ghanaians when it comes to Jolof. We are simply on a different stratosphere than u lot so just accept it calmly.
Kanaan is so handsome, all I gotta say.
This video was too funny😆😆😆😁😁🥳🤗
Well if you enjoy in your house , you enjoy in your house 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bring in a random person to judge the dishes !!!! These guys are hating on each other like some females, except Chidi the rest of them are some hating emotional women !!!!
Pleaaaaase no ketchup  and coleslaw in african food... tchaaaiiiii  are u trying to kill people? My ancestors are crying 😢
jason is whole vibe here
I kept waiting for one of them to kill it 🤣. Now bring all of their mothers or aunts on and let's see who messed up lol
he said "you know what god loves you so that's good you can feed it to god" lol
Chidi and Kanaan did not learn from the best.
British Nigerian Men Try Other British Nigerian Men's Jollof Rice*
I wanna try all there jollof😎😉
All hype men about their OWN rice.  All dramatic tasting others rice 😅
Jason came out here like a hotep outta prison my boy can cook
Party jollof is my favorite especially when it’s slightly burnt
The men are worst than the woman in these videos🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love you and miss you Dad so much!!! You made the best Jollof Rice and made it non spicy just for me and my sister xoxoxo
Chidi is so easy going / not hard to please at all 😂
the crickets for chidis dish got me crying
I'm Jamaican and I love love love it🇯🇲🇳🇬🇯🇲🇳🇬🇯🇲😋😋
I love chidi hes so funny and cool
Good lord🤣🤣😅😅
Its always the thickest person who takes his food the most serious lol.
I Wang more of Jason. Pleeeaaase. He is so entertaining ❤️
Lateef can GET IT
I love these videos 😂😂😂😂
Jason & Kanaan had me dead the entire video 🤣🤣💀
Why do they always slam the plate down
I find so much joy watching these videos 😂😂😂
Please bring Jason back every episode. I love his vibe
Jason 😂😂😂😂
This episode had me dying laughing 😆😂Jason had me rollin I swear 😆❤️
Not "Give you the spots"🤣🤣🤣
the othere to is too dramatic jus eat that shyt
This is the funniest one I’ve seen 😂😂
Fucking hilarious 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Arrest who ever made this thing 😭😭
Halfway through all these guys confidence that you believed in Then just looks like arrogance. Basically they all suck except for the first dude lol
what would have been funny is if they gave them there own Jollof rice and said someone else cooked it and see their reactions
Another win for Jason 💪🏾🤣
Jason is a real one for going for that second bite of Chidi’s dish just so he could give us a proper critique 💯
Lmfaooooo they had me dying!!! 😂🤣😂
Conclusion? Neither of them can cook and all of them are harsh critics
Am I the only person that thinks kanaan is HANDSOME? 🥰☺️
They have to try chicken byrani
Chidi just wants to eat and the food can be anything
I thought that wife was supposed to make Jollof
DIS BRUDDAH CAN NOT COOK! .........wait lemme take another huge bite to tell you why this is nasty......
3:51 I watched this part 6 times 😂😂
Most of these are British lol probably never been to Nigeria
"Welp if you enjoy it in your house, you enjoy it in your house" got me dying 😂😂
https://youtu.be/4_cN4I6SmsI
now we need nigerians trying ghanian jollof rice
These man never seen a Nigerian flag. This channel is lost, pure laughing stock
Funny how they were very critical but they cant cook for shit themselves
I’m not Nigerian but I LOVE my Jollof spicy, when my chicken, and  platine !
'I wouldn't be mad if I went to someone's house and they gave me this' what a prick
Chidi either has low standards or is a really nice guy LMAO
I thought Jason had a low score and then all the other scores came in and I am going wow these brothers can't cook! It also made something very clear about the jollof rice in Nigerian culture.....it varies from family recipe to family recipe and no two families will agree with what jollof rice should taste like.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
8:55  Producer: “How does it look to you?”  Jason: *Dances 🕺* “It’s looks dry 😁” *Continues to dance 🕺*
“Because you wanted to come here and be funny and feed me noodles covered as jollof rice 😐”  “Im gonna give you a 3 🤭”  *Pushes plate away*  (8:32)
7:52  “It’s orange..”  “ah 😫” *Intense thinking 🤔* *Has another bite* “Yeah this isn’t Jollof rice 😀” “This is not, this is not Jollof rice 😭”
They sound like British
Jason is that guy🤣🙌🏿
Where are the Nigerians? These men are pretending
My Godmother made jollof rice and fufu and egusy soup when I always came over and imo her shit was GOOD 😍😍😍😍😂
This was way more honest than the aunties. The aunties were way too judgmental and competitive. These men were more respectful.
These guys are as bad as the Indian women 😂
Lol Try this one next time West Africans try other West Africans Jollof Rice
Kanaan over hyping himself then he's food ends up tasting like dog s**t 🤣🤣
THESE NIGGAS PETTY ASL
They missed the opportunity to bring Sir Theodore the Third 😂
What I've learned is men can't cook and yet have such high expectations of others
I like Jason lmaooo
I have never eaten jollof...It looks so delicious!
These comments are killing me😂😂😂
If you can taste the tomatoes in jollof rice, that's a problem.  You shouldn't taste the TOMATOES!!!
Long grain rice for jollof rice should be a crime. Hands down!  I don't know why anyone hasn't been arrested for using long grain rice to make jollof.  The best type of rice for jollof is JASMINE RICE, people!!  Nigerian people, abeg ooo!!!
I want to try this stuff now.
Rice pudding Jollof 😂😂
funny how all of these videos there always this person that only complain thinking their cooking is perfect xD
When 3 other people say your food isn't good...it isn't good.
“It looks dry” 🕺🏽🕺🏽🕺🏽
I love when he says.."How are you going to get a wife if you cannot cook Jollof rice?!"  Kind of nice for a man to see that cooking skills are a quality for them to have that a woman would look for to  marry them.
The grannies and aunties--so nice.  These men--so harsh.
Rice that goes platinum without features.
What’s up Broski 🦋!
Never seen men judge some rice just by looking at it so hard🤣🤣
Looks like Southeast Asian fried rice to me.
'If you enjoy it in your house...enjoy it in your house'. 🤭
It is a Senegalese dish though ijs
these are always negative
they dont know how to act
Sounds like none of them agree on what the dish is supposed to be.
Try that again...Bunch of daftys from England who have blatant accents..from England.. but identify as Nigerian...Like every American is Irish... eat some shit rice that none of them know how to cook? piss off.
You should've shown he cooking process with each guy........
CHIDIDS DISH TOOK ME OUTTT🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
These Nigerian men sound strangely British...
In Norfolk Va there's a place called Yendidi, they have the best Jollof rice I've ever had. Literally addicted.
Bro one saying its mushy, the other saying its dry
Chidi is always going to eat
BuzzFeed UK... Nigerian Men... many such cases
this shit was so funny
This is soooo funny!!
Not what i expected of buzzfeed, excellent i dare say.
My guys buying backwoods and almost throw up because of rice
English people eat fish and chips
Jollof rice is one of those dishes that is with Nigeria  Ghanians: -_-
It's the how will you provide for your family and how will you find a wife comment that got me🤣🤣
Basmati is a long grain variety of rice ya fool
I think Lateef got a little sugar in his Jollof rice
"If you enjoy it in your house, you enjoy it in your house."   lol
Chidi for some reason reminds me of kawhi leonard a bit just the vibe
It’s always the one that boast the most that makes the worst the most 🙄🙄🙄🙄
martinique people try each other colombo 🫣
Why do i keep hearing "jello fries" 😂
Close your eyes and listen to this video, These are british gents, sure they might be of Nigerian descent But if a single one of them has even seen Nigeria it was for a day when they went on holiday to cape town 😂😂
that one dude who cannot cook be rating these dishes like a gourmet one lmao
If you enjoy in your house, you enjoy in your house
Buzzfeed is a waste of resources, production effort and just every resource in general.
Nigerian jollof......................😑 and did I hear my man say ketchup 😑..............
If you think you've eaten the worst jollof rice, you haven't tried the dish from Peace Media hotel in Abuja just behind the airport. Lord Almighty, that was atrocious! I immediately called my wife in the States and told her about it. They should have just done rice and stew and it would be much better than the silliness they pass off as jollof, it is a disgrace to Nigeria.
“This brother can’t cook” 🤣
hmmm seems like none of them agree on what Jollof rice is...
There are a variety of jollof rice recipes in West Africa but the true originator of the meal is in SENEGAL!! The word "jollof " is literally from  the national language Wolof
So basically it is a dish that is not made the same by anyone so gives a reason to judge on others.
I can listen to them speak all day lol
Love these videos so much, so funny & entertaining haha
Jason is a whole mood. Love his vibe and energy. Jason if you see this comment please start vlogging I would subscribe!!!
😭😭😭😭😭 this is hilarious
"if your cooking is rubbish, your rice will be rubbish" doesn't that go with any dish ? 😂
They all hate one anothers food XD
jason tho
These guys aren't even African lol they are Brits wtf
🤣I don't if Jason is unserious or he just can't be trusted. Which one is dancing untop even the tasteless meals 🤣
I bet none of them can cook it properly lol bring their moms or wives instead.
In conclusion....jollof rice is different in every household.
Either all these dudes are douches with opinions we cant trust, or none of them know how to make it and cant be trusted...
I love this group
Any white people
Kanaan:*eye roll*congratulations  ......
I found a jollof recipe online and I tried my hand at cooking it and I really enjoyed it. I’m sure it’s garbage compared to what these men have eaten but it’s a tasty dish. 😁
That man with the black hoody lookes just like my nephew who was a legendary rapper I love u an I miss you so much! Kid Of Rage Travion🤘🏼💯🥲I'm carrying on the legacy for you!
Jason: THIS IS PARTY JOLLOF!!!!!1!!1!1!1!1!🥳🥳  5 seconds later  Jason: MAN THIS BROTHER CANNOT COOK 💀💀
For some reason these nigerian men sound british
I love these videos so much I learn so much about the culture and the food
I need Jason and Joyce together in a video
Those mf whining flavors too low, flavors too high.. yet they never eat them together..  and then act as if they can do better
They definitely set Chidi up with this
love these men pls
Camera man dead ass terrible lol
*"Ah"*
Brooooo they are too funny as an American this is sending meeeeeeeeee
You mean to tell me my husband was supposed to woo me with jollof rice!?!?!?! I feel scammed. All he made me was beans. Refund please. (I'm kidding. I love my husband...even though he has never made me jollof)
bro said my family’s recipe passed down for generations only for it to not taste like anything that’s mad 😭😭😭
You can tell that they were told their score right after everybody had tried it because they either looked depressed afterwards or extremely happy 😂
My g with the glasses way too hype relax fam
This was so fun to watch😆 Jason's reaction when he saw Chidi's dish 🤣
This is not fair cause now I need to eat a plate of Jollof and I don't know how to make it.
Basmati is a long-grain rice.. lol
Why do the titles of these videos sound overly gay
This was sooo funny 😂😂
There is no control in this house” 😂😂
The ones that always talk trash are the ones with the worse dishes.
I have a theory that people who eat crap rate other people's food highly
I reported this video for crimes against humanity one man said ketchup another said basmati WTF?
Lmaoooooo
6:05 "Like you need to be able to cook your jollof rice properly if you want to find a wife.  You don't do this to people."  Oooh, yes!  That's my future husband right there with his generous chicken drumsticks.
Part of this show should be feeding them their own jollof aswell to see what they rate it 🤣( obviously not including it in the vote though)
Sooooo none of them can cook or agree on what it is the right way to make it lol
na ppl have different way of enjoying food thats it
KSI is missin..or Sir theodore the 3rd
Great men
Things I learned today: Nigerian men don't like Jollof 😂
Jason is the return of the Mack.
Nah my jollof is beating all this man’s jollof hands down
Aw, bless Chidi, husband material.
It seems like they can't cook, but know the taste. Sums up pretty much a lot of the home cooks of today
Why y’all do chidi like that 🤣💀💀 “this Brudda can’t cook” “how are you gong to provide for your family with this food”💀💀🤣🤣🤣
Jason is a comedian 🤣🤣🤣🤣
its that guy from sidemen the black one
how did you lots murder the colour of jollof rice?
Jollof rice is delicious but I am sorry your meats suck texture wise too dry and tough particularly the chicken.
When Nigerians say Nigerian jollof is the best, they mean “my mothers jollof is the best, everything else is bad”
😂
i like spicy jollof
This brother can’t cook 🗣🗣💀💀💀💀😂😂
Jason is a vibe
I'm not even Nigerian why am I watching this at 4am
What does jollof rice have to do with finding a wife.  That don't make any sence bro
"There's no control in this house" 😂😂😩😩😭
wtf is wrong with chidi lmfao that rice is pure fuckery
i feel like people have there opinions of what they like and not all of the stuff they eat can appeal to them
Is there a Liberian addition??
Ketchup in jollof rice?? With cole slaw? 🤢🤢
The facial expressions when the food is put infront of them😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂 l love these! Learn to cook Jollof rice properly to find a wife!
why is kanaan so fine oh em gee
Like the accents
“This is rice that will give you spot tomorrow” had me 🤣🤣
Haha 🤣 I laughed so much ! This is amazing!
“If you enjoy it in your house, you enjoy it in your house “ 😂
The commentary from this group of guys is hilarious 🤣 Arguably the best group of the "Try Each Other's..." series.
Real Nigerians know jollof rice is a B-TIER Nigerian meal. Abacha and Nkwobi is the real deal bruddah!!
all we learned from this is that these men can’t cook
It tastes like instant noodles 😭
These never get old 😭😭
Do these people just not like Jollof Rice? Lol. They literally dont like a single plate of rice
I can’t believe Nigeria appropriated jollof rice! I’TS SENEGALESE LMAO
Jason went from “yes gawd” to “hell naw” 😭
I want to hang out with Jason. He’s so much positive and full of joy. Plus, he can teach me how to make the jollof rice so I can find a wife.
Nigeria men na wahoo for una😂😂😂👍
Never heard of this rice or trued it.
Forget all the Antics all the rolling of the eyes and the throwing the head back in the weird look on your face just taste the s*** and then tell everybody after you taste it could be your own stuff you looking at.
Jason is such a vibe. Love his whole personality
An Indian aunties version of this would be crazy!
So after kanaan's mouth for chidi, his didn't taste nice either😭😭😭
This makes me miss my ex's moms food, they're from Enugu and the food is 😩🔥
seem like none of them can cook😭
Jason was zesty asf 😂
Senegal has the best j rice, someone needs to do some learning, matter of fact there is a city in Senegal called jollof 😑 the only reason is because it is a fraco country so the countries that speak English come here with bs that it belongs to them if you go to France it's a different story
Wait the Ketchup dude actually won? 😂😂
Lol
the way they all reacted to Chidi’s dish😭😭😭😭😭😭
This was hella funny 🤣
I’m disappointed in all of y’all jollof
I'm Cuban and I thought this was a Cuban recipe
Omgggg Jason is everything 😂😂😂
What I say is another man's food is another man's poison
They talk about everyone cooking and they can’t cook themselves Lmfaoo😂😂😂😂clowns
😂😂😂😂😂😂
chidis dish reaction is jokes
Jason: "Looks dry" dancing 🕺 😄 😁
My guy talking about other peoples dish but he uses his mom’s recipe he doesn’t even have his own taste
Jason is funny dab 🤣
Ketchup 🤣🤣
He really said basmati Rice 😂😂😂😂
The guy in the white is hilarious 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 lmfao this one was very entertaining I like the men ones. This my first I usually catch the ladies ones which are still entertaining BUT this one was good
this ep killed me.. "You can feed it to God"
9:41 Afta-lat-madam-sir.
Kaanaan is very handsome Jason is just a vibe
There is no control in this house. 🤣
I'll try Jason Nigerian food no one else 😂😂😂😂
Its just rice nothing special about it lol.
i have been trying different recipes of jollof rice till i saw this https://youtu.be/QF9LPEds01I the best. worked for me and came good
Idris Gueye is that you kanaan😂😂😂
They just murdered chidi's rice "and your out here trying to find wife" i died😭😭
I swear my mom's jollof rice is one of the best things I've ever had
Wait, so is Jollof rice basically Mexican rice? lol
I love these videos. I like seeing when the overly confident people get blown out the water by someone else’s dish.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
jason lmao
I love my naija brothers❤
"if you enjoy it in your house... you enjoy it in your house" PLS IM LITERALLY CRYING
"if you mess it up - people will crucify you for years"~ Bahahahaha. So true.   We got some Liberians and Sierra Leonian Mamas at Church that can seriously cook up some Nigerian Jolloff and also the Okra soup. .. and people know these Mama's by thier signature soup.(BTW My husbands cooking can top any in our state~MN/USA!~ and making traditional Naija food, soups and body care after having delivered our children seriously endeared him to my soul forever) Nice try .... this was fun to watch.
When Chidi’s jollof came out I actually truly laughed out loud.  This is what I needed today.
Jason is my type of person 🥰🥰 “How are you going to find a wife….you can’t do this to people 😂”
That are eating my boy Chidi up in every video and I’m dying 😂😂
Chidi’s tastebuds is transgender
I’m half Black American and really wanna try this dish now.
What is Chidi’s instagram? Asking for me 🙈lol
Why is JPEGMAFIA here ?
At first jason was so hyped up for chidi’s dish either to be nice since everyone looked disgusted or just pure happiness, when he tasted it, his smile DROPPED    LMAOAOAOA
Kanaan's jollof is too lighh skin 🤣
they’re hilarious.
What I've learned is: you only love the Jollof rice you make in your house, everyone else's is trash lmao
The brothers are more sassy...I was waiting for the last one ...
These fellows sound quite feminine.  Man up world!!!
Omg!  I had no idea Jollof Rice was a serious dish until I made some.  It came out good.   I read the history of it and Wow!!  Nigeria and Ghana have huge debates on whose is the best. These Black Kings were cute and all great cooks.
Why does Chidi look like the MarkofJ
I bet Africans look at these Americans like “ Diss Moda Forka “
I'm in tears!!! The Crickets!! 🤣🤣🤣
Chidi made them think twice😭😭
Lol
Omg - Im crying watching the tasting experiences 😂🤣😂
Chidi is my vibe man
Lmaooo this is the best one yet 🤣😭 🔥
I love that the guy who got 4 wasn't even trying to contest his loss he qas just like yeah no I can't cover a 16.5 point spread with arguing
Like if you want to be friends with chidi
kanaan you let me down man😭😭😭😭😭
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣!!! I love it
jollof rice yea yea yea, but their skin tho!
"You know Mufasa and Scar?" bro what?😭😭😭😭
Poor chidi
“You don’t do this to people”
😂🤣🤣🤣🤣 “ if you enjoy it in your house then you enjoy it in your house 😂
ketchup no ..basmati no whole grain yes
I'm tryna wife up jason. BOY what's up?
I love to eat rice with ketchup and pasta too 😂 it makes it taste so much better
These guys got depressed after seeing chidi's dish
Jason is delusional. When he said Ketchup I knew his would be trash lol. I am not Nigerian but Ketchup and Maggi? Nah I'm pretty sure that was not the original thought of Jollof Rice lol.
4:10 this could easily be a tiktok audio
lol Respect to Chidi, but I find the rest of those so called "Nigerian" ( African ) complaining about food really confusing since I was born in Sudan, but raised in Canada from age 14. I have experienced going without food back in Africa as a kid. We're build like beast because of generational hardships colonizers put our ancestors through while feeding us less. We don't discriminate against food, we discriminate those who don't finish their food or give it to us. I only acknowledge Chidi as the only real African here, the rest just painted themselves black.
Jason is a whole mood 😂😂
You know your food is bad if Jason Is not enjoying it, he normally praises everyone
I’m dead 😵 this cracked me up!! I love 💕 these Nigerian men!!!
I died when they mentioned the magi cube..also love seeing UK Nigerians and shoutout to my Nigerian Americans too 👑👑
The commentary is hilarious lmfaooo
Chidi out here thinkin he knows food and he got a 4😭😂
"TRYING JOLLOFF RICE?" I THOUGHT IT WAS THE ONLY THING THEY EVER ATE.
When i heard ketchup I already knew he lost im sorry... im not even nigerian and know this...
kanaan is so fine 😫
“It’s orange, aah” 😹😹😹
So random but I cant eat rice with a fork! It has to be a spoon lol
Chidi has terrible taste bud, maybe thats why his cooking is equally bad 😩
You should try my wife's jollof ❤️❤️🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭. Ghana jollof is the best 🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭
Are this Nigerians or British
"Let me behave," 😂
when i heard ketchup i was done
🤣
“You can feed it to god, he’ll probably say it’s amazing. Not me” 😭😭😭
Why do “Nigerians” talking with a united shitdom accent
"You dont do this to people"🤣🤣
omgg is that kanaan 😮
I'm surprised there are Nigerian men who can cook... genuinely. thank God for modernity! props
All I got from this is that none of them can cook
“There’s no control in this house.” I cackled with laugher. 😂🤣😂🤣😂
This brother can't cook"..🤣🤣😭😭😭..."the no wife part killed me"...Jason should have his own show..that man is hilarious and wow what a great personality!!..
“If you enjoy it in your house…you enjoy it in your house.” “This is new” I’M SCREAMING HAHAHA
I love theses videos!! Idk if they have tried it, but they should try to give them their own & have them rate it as if it was someone else’s
Do one with Trini men and Pelau
🤣🤣🤣🤣👏
jollof rice is so overrated. nigerian food in general.
Why I decide to watch this random stuff idk but what I co know us it's hilarious!🤣🤣
Are you really telling me there are a Chidi and a Jason in this video?! Where are my The Good Place lovers??
What costume is he wearing?  4:06
ghana jollof > nigerian jollof
Non of them got it right am sorry so not jolly for rice
Lol Nigerian man hate there self when it comes to competitions 😂😂😂😂 And they will become friends after
*Covers eyes*By the time I open my eyes i want this food out of this table😭😭😂

Jason deserved to win...he knows how to rate well
I'm sorry Ketchup?
Get Kanaan out already Fake Nigerian guy, I swear. Can't even cook
Bro mix your sounds better. One minute I can barely hear, then the next I'm going deaf
Just goes to show, "No accounting for taste".
Yoh
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
LMAOO THE EDITING IN THE BEGINNING IS FIRE FOR THIS ONE
did he say ketchup?
The way Kanaan was judging others i thought he was gonna present with a good dish 😂😂
Jason seems like a nice person 😂
0:53 DID HE SAY KETCHUP?? IN JOLLOF??
Craving Jollof rice now sadly where I am there are like only a few places that serve it.  Probably one of my favorite rice dishes.
So basically anyone in this world can cook this and call it as jollof rice !! I understood that it has to have lil moisture and should be orange.
the difference in reactions from initially seeing chidis rice LMFAOOO
I honestly lust after Kanaan’s pictures on IG regularly. I’m glad to see him in motion.
Nice guys always finish last
You know it's bad if Jason says something because he's always positive
Oga..
When the food is so bad it brings out the Nigerian in you😂
PlS who adds ketchup to jollof ewww
🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🫶🏽
lul solo rice is their national dish atleast malis got a banana with it yall need to level up
It’s the cut between Jason and the rest of them for me 4:02
Nigerians really trying real hard to make jollof rice their thing
I love Jason
How Jason going to be a full breed Nigerian and call plantain,plantin 0:44
,,,,,,,,,,,,,            2 Esdras 2: 32 -100              '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''' ;;;;;;;;;;;
Cole slaw with Jollof rice.. noooo!!!
Lateef running his mouth n he cnt cook it right either
I love Nigerian Jollof rice but shout out to my Ghanaian, Senegalese and Cameroonian peeps who have their own version.
Jason said plantin heyy wahalla dey oo
He made the good stuff for himself and sold you the not soo good.(411)
Y’all just shut up ,imagine guys who can’t cook making comments about peoples dishes tswwwwww 😂😂😂
Can you do Congolese fumbwa or pondu?
😎😎
THANK GOD IM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO USES KETCHUP
Ghana jollof on top
You should do::  north’s African women trying other north African womens couscous
Kanaan a hater😂😂
Jason is the only person that knows how to eat rice dishes. It's weird to see people eat rice with a fork.
"Plan-TIN- on the side" this brudda is not naija 🤮
cringe
“THIS BROTHER CANNOT COOK!” 😂😂😂😂😂 man shit alone sent me… Jason is funny asf please bring him back bro could be a comedian
As someone with low expectations and easily satisfied, I can relate to Chidi 🤣🤣🤣
3:51 this part killed me. The sound effect 😭
the takeaway from this video is that Jollof rice probably sucks. I mean nobody liked it lol
I love how Lateef is trying hard to be nice
I'm African American, never had this, have no idea what the ingredients are, but I still love this.
sorry the beginning ketchup?????
Jellof is so peng but Goats belly cows foot all that other shit should be illegal though 😂😂
judge people food but their food more worst hhahahaha
When kanaan tasted lateef's dish LOL
Jason & Kanaan had me cracking up the whole video they are too funny 😭
Danm.i though I saw damson Idris 😂😂😂😂🙏
A real Nigerian man would have consumed and condemned that chicken what are they doing
bro Indians and Nigerians gave so much common bro
Chidi legit giving points 💀
It’s orange… ah
cant tell where jason is from.  does so many accents so well lol. funny guy.  does he have content?
These dudes are too funny 🤣🤣🤣
0:44 Love that dream.
chidi does not know his rice lol
1:20  Basmati rice is a type of long grained rice idk what this brother is talking about
Chai, i'm actually saddened for you guys who put ketchup in your jollof rice, may God deliver you all lol!
And I'm here wishing I made Jollof for these lads. I make it top tieeerrrrr 🔥
Omg loveeeeeee jollof rice with chicken and colslaw
yessss basmati
U should have told them the scores
I know if I come on this show I'm getting coookkeed
I'm only 1:06min into this video and my man just said he puts ketchup in his Jollof. Like oga where, how, and why?
Jesus Christ is the only way to heaven, John 14:6 amen 🙏🏾✝️🙏🏾
Nigerian men try other Nigerian men..
is that one with the durag gay? He's body movements are extra sus and the way he talks
Plot twist : the best jollof rice is made in Ghana 🇬🇭🇬🇭
Everyone gave the same rating for each plate other than Chidi
6:23 this man is evil 😂😂
Chidi na go eat everythin, Kanaan dey go run de mouth, Lateef na arrogance no go work
I CLICKED IMMEDIATELY. I LOVE MY NIGERIAN MEN😭
So only one could cook??😂😂😂
The it looks dry with the dance took me out Lmfaooooo
Man said "arrest who ever cooked this" 😂😂😂
I bet black jacket has one of the worst, just off his personality and how much of a hater he seems like lol
Is chidi a different jellof to everybody else 😂
so heres a things, growing up had lots of nigerians kids in school with me growing up, and id hear jollof rice, but what i would hear is 'jelly fries' so for a good ten years or so, when my mates would talk about what we had for dinner etc, and they would say jollof rice id have images of jelly fries for dinner, proper threw me for a loop when i had dinner at theres for the first time!
Can you eat jellof rice with oxtails?
Chidi’s face at the last one 😂😂😂😂
Rice pudding jollof is insaaaane
Ketchup 🤢  am I watching epicurious
Feed it to God keh.
“What kind of rice do you use?” * awkward anticipatory crickets* I felt that tension…
“this brudda can’t cook” was a plot twist that SENT me 😭😭😭
I literally love Kanaan Pitan lmao, hes so fine and hes funny. Hes actually perfect.
LMAOOOO I am hollering
Jason reminds of Lydia Dinga. They have that hyped personality.
Nigerians love to violate
I lost it when Jason said ketchup. Wth yo talkin bout 'broda'?😭😭😭😭
this is just straight up roasting each other cooking💀
I have a feeling Chidi's was native jollof which is cooked mainly from palmoil, unlike the tomato base
Favorite Parts   3:54 - 4:04 THE SILENCE   4:04  Jason at just seeing the plate " This is party jollof!! "  * Happy Dance*   5:16  Jason after trying the Jollof " This brother can't cook. "   5:20 " Well, if you enjoy in your house, you enjoy in your house. "   5:32 " Please, arrest! Whoever made this thing. "   5:56 The " Ah "  Sound is so satisfying to hear.  6:02  " And then you'll go be out, trying to find wife? Like, you need to be able to cook the jollof rice properly, if you want to find a wife. You don't do this to people. "   6:10 How do you provide for  family with this food?  6:21 " Please, I don't even want to see this thing, in my sight. " 6:22 " By the time I open my eyes, I want this food Off. This. Table. "   7:08 The way he inspected the food, amused me.  7:30 The way he laughed. And the fact it reminded him of instant noodles 😭 10:57 " Please. The other people, they can go cry. "   Take and God Bless!
poor chidi xD
Make African woman do it next
Kanaan’s dish tho.😂😂😂
You dont get control in this house 😂😂😂
It’s orange… Ah.
These guys are clowns bruh lmao.
Now do Nigerian women rating each others rice, I'd love to see that.
Lateef acts like his cooking is amazing
😂😂😂😂😂 kanaan talks a big game but clearly could back it up
lol
Is no one going to mention that a Nigerian man said Plantin instead of PlanTAIN! Jason shame on you
Jason reminds me of Eric from Sex Education 😹
“It’s okay”😂
Jesus is coming back soon please repent before it is too late I can recommend the uckg church if you want to know more about this glorious event have a lovely blessed God filled day and dont forget that God loves you every second of everyday I support your journey with christ. Amen
Lateef here to fulfill quotas
"It's orange👁👄👁...😐" I'm dead, rendered speechless!
You can give this to God but not me LMFAO PLS
The guy almost threw up lol....
Ketchup????
“If you wanna find a wife”…I like this new generation
Jollof Rice is senegalese 🇸🇳🇸🇳🇸🇳 Jollof was precolonial kingdom, king’s names were Ndiaye.
I could watch these guys test food stuff all day
Are y’all hearing the seben
The second dish had them flabbergasted 💀
Jollof rice is sooo good, hopefully more people get to know about it and try it.  Unfortunately though Nigerians or rather West African‘s put maggi/knorr cubes in basically every dish, as if we didn’t have natural spices and flavours, truly a shame.
Getting rid of hsv 1 / 2 is like starting a new life and am glad I came across dr ekan on YouTube for a day like this . It wasn't easy but I came through .
3:07 🤣🤣😂
JOLOF RICE BELONGS TO SENEGAL AND GAMBIA! NOT  9JA nor Ghana
This is new 😭😭😭
I'm mad that the rice with the ketchup is the winner.  As an African American who just got into the jollof game,  I'm appalled.  Pssskkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
is this buzzfeed nigeria ?
“Goes platinum with no features” lol y’all Brits love biting American culture
"rICE PUT IN JELLOF" Had me rolling🤣🤣🤣
kanaan looking like carti
Dis brotha can not kuk 💀💀💀
Nigerians are so funny without trying😹
Lost me @ ketchup!!! 🤢
ffs they are not nigerian... if they are Nigerian i am scottish/irish.. they are english.
I love this 😊
LMAOOOOO CHIDI’S RICE REACTIONS
The way Chidi looked everywhere BUT the camera when saying he nailed his dish, I just KNEW it'd be garbage 😭
Jason cheated with that chicken piece I can feel it
That boy chidi is just like me, I'll eat anything a long as my belly is full. 😂😂
almost 300k and half the video is out of focus ???
Each guy is comparing the others dishes to their own.... I really doubt they are gonna rate another dish higher than their own
i saw kanaan i clicked i'm literally a fan😂💀
I loved watching this video lol 🤣.
I am hollering 🤣 🤣🤣
9:30 "A few days later you wanna just grab it from the container... the ice cream container in the fridge.." LMFAO!!!! As a Dominican I'm glad to see we aren't the only ones who reuse the ice cream/butter/whatever containers to store food in them! 🤣🤣🤣
God: it was amazing 😆
How will you provide for your family with this?😂😂😂😂
Why is Jason hilarious?
How are you going to get a wife 😂😂😂 I love it
Jason looks like Charlie mase
Jason knows about that ice cream container 😂😂😂yesss brotha
i know jason did not just say "plantin"
ghanaian and senegalese jollof>>>>
all of them are shit xD
He said this is new 🤣🤣🤣🤣 that maggi made it salty on the first dish
I know everything Jason said was true 😂
Please do with all proper Nigerians.
JASONS EGO IS EVERYTHINGGGGG
It's surprising how they can all describe the perfect jollof but it doesn't look close
So none of you can cook jollof 😂 it’s not easy though
If you use basmati rice you need to be careful it cooks quick
I'm watching for the U.S. 😂😂
Kanaan had so much chat for him to produce utter rubbish 🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭😭
Big up the chidi, can’t lie I don’t know if I would of been generous with the flavour
5:05 this is the rice...that'll give  you spots tommorow🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That guy that co-signed Basmati rice should be banned from Nigeria
To whoever is reading this Jesus loves you and he’s coming soon. All you need to do to be saved is believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross for your sins was buried and came back to life on the 3d day. Confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord and you’ll be saved! I hope to see you in the clouds! God bless!
“There’s no control in this house” 😂
I’m not making jollof rice. I don’t want anyone to curse me out.  I’ll wait for the graduations and weddings to collect party jollof lol
jollof rice is so good bro
so many red flags in the first two minutes
I think Chidi was just hungry cause everything was good to him
Bro Jason I’d the best lol
Nigerians do not know how to cook hollow rice. That was something that should have been known from the start. 😂
No lie Ghanaian jollof >>>>>>>
I'm now  very curious now if anyone is actually able to make a Jollof Rice that other people actually really like, hahaha
Jason 🤣🤣🤣
I doubt that it tastes that awful. The facial expressions are definitely exaggerated.
0:44 sorrrrayyyy what did you just call it? abeg do not claim Nigeria how can you use that same mouth you use to eat jollof and be saying plantin
Ghanian Jollof for the win all of these guys can't cook 🤣.
why are they so hateful?
The way lateef said it’s okay 😂2:40
Chidi a real one, real analyst no rush rush
The only thing i'm focusing on is why are they eating rice with a fork?
The rest are men only Jason is the woman
"You don't feed this to people" 🤣🤣🤣
Guessing too much pepper or not a good amount of curry. Actually the sauce doesn't make it jolly lol.
Kanaan acts like a proper Nigerian mom 😫🇳🇬
Ghana and Nigeria jollof are the best idc what anyone says
Loving Jason
Kanaan is 😍😍😍
"Jolloff is on of those foods u think of about nigeria" nah bruh i think i hear something less
who would put fries in their jello?
the fuck is this shit (Jk) I'm bored
first of all LOOK AT ALL THIS CHOCOLATE 🍫 🍫🍫🍫🍫♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
This is my favorite buzz feed reaction video
Your sound mix is so off, some parts are low volume some parts are really loud!! Then you have the camera in and out of focus every other frame.
Man ate that spoonful and analysed everything that was in the rice in a split second
WE NEED MORE VERSIONS OF THIS PLEASE
It would be cool if yall did surinam food
Repent and turn to God
Nobody Jason looking at Lateef's rice it's dry while dancing with a smile on his face 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Man's not nigerian jollof rice with ketchup and what's plantin😭
It’s funny 😂 I know Kanaan he is cool
I'd like to taste wine with Jason. I'm curious about that palate
Did he say ketchup!??? 🥲😂😂
No say Jason hit the renegade
its usually the one making the most faces and passing the most judgment who has the worst food.
smells.. oily? what lol
I love Nigerian men, they are so sweet but very bold and confident. Such a perfect balance.
"well,if you enjoy it in your house, enjoy it in your house"
i need that hoodie he has anyone know the brand name ??
5:04 "This the rice that will give you spots tomorrow" - the way I burst out laughing omg.
No Jollof will ever top party jollof
Jason said planting Wow I like the Nigerian
Coleslaw with Jollof Rice. See god. If I see any of my friends eating coleslaw with jollof, they will not hear the end of it.  1:03 I already knew off dome he was going to was Basmati Rice.
20 seconds in and im already blushing at Kanaan
They need to try to make fufu cause that would be a good one 😂😂😂
They all favorited the same dudes rice. The dude with the white sweater vest
I'm an American woman and I have from what my Nigerian husband says..perfected Jollof Rice...the sweat and heat and dedication to these dishes are unbelievably mind blowing..I have so much respect to the men and women of 🇳🇬
what is this focus man
I knew jason was gonna win, hes the most nigerian uncle ive ever seen 😂😂
since nb else said it … kanaan is as handsome as can be
I’m never taking chidi opinion based on any food being good he’ll just say it’s all a 8 or 7
I think if you come here talking shut your dish is the worst and you over compensate your horrible dish but talking smack about others
I think jolof is different for everyone
This is actually hilarious. Somebody needs to make a netflix show like this. Just black people critiquing each other's cultural foods.
I have eaten my lunch from a ice cream container at work . Did you have a cheap army dad too
Jason when he finally tried chidi's rice : I am sorry but this brother can't cook am sorry  😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😂😂 Abomination
id mix them all up in a huge bowl and eat it
Kanaan had all that talk for other people 💀
If you trust one of these mugs to cook for you that's on you lol. One is not above the rest
Food brings people together, except for here and other cooking competitions so it seems. Well duh. But that's another one of God's gifts is food I'd say, and not just that but thousands of them, different in many ways....Obviously but still, it's great, and if you're curious about more of God's gifts why not try Him? He's great and His Spirit is THE BEST there is, want to see less conflict and more peace, try Him. Amen and have a good day, don't wait till it's too late.
jason is funny af !!!
Big ups to the crew creating and editing this
Lateef we want a new skincare video now!! 🤣🤣
Jason made me hungry I want some now with plantain. 😂
Chidi is the man you want to marry - no expectations 😂😂😂😂😂
Nahhhhhh I lost is when Jason went from happy cheery positive to Yh this brother can't cook😂😂😂
I'm gonna say everyone's but Jason's and Chidi's Jollof Rice looked dry.. no offense 😂 The colour of their rice was also too light in my opinion.. for me, real Jollof Rice (but in my country it's called "Riz au gras") it's between moist and dry and the colour is really orange to almost a kind of dark orange.. and I'm lil bit like Jason, my rice sometimes ends up a bit too salty (I like maggi too) but I think that's better than tasting no seasoning..
Chidi is giving the best numbers
Chidi's Rice 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Chidi's low standards made me cry! xDDDD
0:52 if I go to a party and some one gives me hollow rice with ketchup in it I’m slapping them you got me fucked up chiken and plantain is the only other thing you need Maby some stew but ketchup fuck off
3:55 Everybody be looking violently at their surroundings and here we have Jason dancing lmfao
Why the new comment section box so FB ish
Jason's such a silly goober
The best one was only ok
Kanaan was the most confident one but everyone violated his jollof rice
2:41  "is okih"
"Disgusting".  Is that how we are starting? 😂😂😂
“Nah this is not jollof rice” 😂😂😂😂
Jason you got something you want to tell us buddy?
I was hoping Jason will win based on his personality his energy is top-tier
the ones that talk shit the least always got the high scores
why does jason look like a nigerian anthony fantano
Jason is sooo hilarious. He is on 10 🤣.
I love Jason's enthusiasm and wonder of the good aspects/characteristics of each plate of food. And I appreciated Kanaan's honesty and constructive criticism with each dish  🍽️- and despite the end he wasn't totally a sore loser - good sport 👍🏽!
liberian jollof rice>>>
Chidi what happened? You supposed to represent for Igboland
“You can feed it to god he’s probably say it’s amazing,but not me”
Am I the only one who thinks Kanaan is a cocky asshole?
Kanaan is gorg bro
In conclusion non of them can make  jollof rice
This is probably one of the greatest videos to exist on YouTube 😂❤️
Okay but Kanaan is literally beautiful 😍
Bro I haven't had jollof rice in a while I wanna get some right now
Bro lateef making fun off everyone’s dish, and his looking dryer then the Sahara desert…
Whoever is your camera man, fire him. Blurry ass video
I'm sure they'd hate my jollof rice with bison meat, but then again I'm american.
“If you enjoy this in your house… you enjoy this in your house.” 💀
The one with the earring as the most talk but food taste like shiiiiiiii
All I know is Jason better b good bc he talk too much 😂
dont know seems like none for em can cook jollof
😂😂😂😂 It must be bad if even Jason won’t eat it.
we want moreee!!! all of them are funny af esp jayyyyyson     chide lol
lol, it looks almost like cajuns judging jambalaya.  very similar dishes and you hear this kind of stuff. XD
This one took me out 🤣😂
'there is no control in da house' 😂😂😂
I love Kanaan🥺
Basmatic rice all the way
Heyyy, i know jason from tik tok!
Nigerians as a whole just leave this dish alone.
1:04 jasmine rice is the only way
Ketchup in jollof 😟🤮
Dancing talking about it taste dry crying
You should do Dominican women try other Dominican women’s Pollo Guisado or Mangú Tres Golpes 😍🇩🇴
Hey guys it’s Jason, today I’m trying other Nigerian men
Jasonnn 😂😂😂😘😘
This is too funny😂😂😂😂
A bunch of big egos trashing other peoples cooking lmao  What would make this more interesting, would be having a proper chef come in and rate the food as well.
Moral of the story- The person who cooks the worst food will appreciate it more.
Jollof Rice is from Senegal  Nigeria stole the dish from them
I’m guilty of eating Ghanaian jollof rice with ketchup instead of stew when I was a kid 🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫 no lie it was delicious 🤣🤣🤣
Is there any videos of indian moms trying each others biriyani or something..im really curious
"how do you provide for your family with this food?" 🤣🤣
From what i can understand is that; one man's jollof is not an other man's jollof.
“Please arrest whoever made this thing” LMAOOO💀💀💀😭
Bro I love jollof rice. I grew up on it. If you go to a party they would be serving this and fried rice and plantain and chicken and ghanian salad.
When he said "You need to be able to cook properly if you want to find a wife" love it 🤣😆
"You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." When a well packaged web of lies has been sold gradually through time to the masses over generations, the truth will seem utterly preposterous and its speaker a raving lunatic.  It’s easier to fool people than it is to convince them that they have been fooled.  No one is more hated than he who speaks the truth.      This truth will free you to seek for the Living God in the Spirit and to truly KNOW GOD instead of just knowing ABOUT HIM.      The GOSPEL is NOT written with ink, nor on tablets of stone, but on our hearts by the Spirit of the Living God.  The gentiles who have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, then they are a law unto themselves.  Under the New Covenant we are to be led by the Holy Spirit, not the bible.         I was searching for truth when Jesus told me, "The bible is an idol" which completely changed my direction.  After that I only sought for Him in the Spirit and He has taught me many things on life's journey.  The most important of which is that He died so we could be regenerated by the Holy Spirit into sons and daughters of God.  The gospel is simple, repent from living after the flesh, ask Jesus to fill you with the Holy Spirit and then be led and controlled by Him through the Spirit.  The bible is only history and has absolutely no authority from God to control us, the outward law was under the old covenant. Jesus died to redeem us from the curse of the written law because we were unable to keep it.  Have a great journey through life with the Living Christ guiding you. When Jesus words are written down and Satan is using them, then the bible becomes the word of Satan.      Constantine (1st) beast compiled 50 bibles, legalized Christianity and set up the false prophet (pope).  King James (2nd) beast, born 6/1566, 6th of Scotland, authorized a bible in 1611 that now has 66 books to control people with, an image of God's word they make to speak (the bible says).  By having faith in the bible which has been made into an idol, they break the new covenant of having faith in the Living Christ through the Holy Spirit, who is the true word of God.  THE BIBLE IS THE MARK OF THE BEAST Ask Jesus -Yeshua for the Holy Spirit. Link To Blog Site Book:  Book 1 THE BIBLE IS THE MARK OF THE BEAST http://bibleismarkofbeast.blogspot.co...  BOOK 2 THE BIBLE IS AN IDOL http://bibleismarkofbeast.blogspot.co... Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/BIBLEisMARKofBEAST/videos •🕊 💖•

You need to cook jollof properly if you want to find a wife 😂😂😂😂😂😂

Half of this video is out of focus. C’mon guys.
I'm happy he said plantain right
When he said "you need to be able to cook Jollof rice properly to have a wife" my boyfriend looked at me and said "OH you think you about to raise your standards again?" 😂He makes me some banging ass oatmeal every morning so I might let him be...for now lmao
Waiting on Caribbean people try each other’s pelau
Chidi looks so nervous and sketch when he explained his dish
Chidi literally looks so nervous and like sketch when he’s explaining his like 😭😭 why he moving his eyes so much
It’s not side side dish like Nando’s rice 😭😭😭
Ketchup in where?
Hold up...he said he didn't want long grain rice, but proceeded to say he used Basmati? Basmati is a type of long grain rice LOL
Loved this
One thing about Nigerian people is their charisma is always so high, I’ve met many funny, humble and just out right awesome Nigerians and Jollof Rice is one of the best tasting food I’ve had from another culture 🇵🇬x🇳🇬❤️
Are they al gay? Why are they talking like bitches
I love these 4💀💀💀 these 4 need to be on a game show or do challenges together at some point. I wanna see the interaction coz pls.
It’s the this brother can’t cook for me 😂😂😂😂
Jason looks like the purple doctor fish in spongebob 🗿

jason is talking about finding wife while giving the vibe like he doesnt want one lmao
3:56-4:02  Their facial expressions omds and Jason on the other hand is so happy😂😂
"please arrest whoever made this thing" 😭😂
I read the title and my first thought was “since when do Nigerian men cook?”😭  guess it’s just my household that’s archaic
They all had covid while trying jasons dish
I’m crying 😭
https://youtube.com/shorts/yAsnFSDcLHI?feature=share
If chidi talks about ratio on more time..😭
they all so critical except for dude that got the 4 he was NIce!- I think they should have given their own food to themselves and see if they still rate it LOW
Jason is a vibe!!! 😂😂😂
Massa, whaaaat🤯, why.do u need a 😏ketchup/coldslore😒 on your Jollof rice.. chaaii, I guess that's Nigerian jollof rive to Naija people.... Ghana 🇬🇭 Jollof ide bee naaaw..hahahahaha 😛😅☺️😃😋🤑🤗🤪😅

Jason is good vibes
I love how they all have strong opinions but it looks like all 4 can’t make a solid rice 😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂
Jason is a vibe 😂😂😂 just like on tiktok 🤣
If you add Ketchup to Jolof rice you ain’t right
Lmfao I love my Nigerian brothers
I wish I could be Jasons friend. He is so fun and has such a bright, beautiful personality. Really a unique special person.
Ik this sounds weird but when my auntie makes jollof rice I mix it with mayonnaise
That man said this is not jollof rice 😂😀😂😀🤪🤪
Listen I knew y’all were gonna make me laugh 😂😂😂😂 this brother can’t cook 😂😂😂dead
This is the GREATEST thing I have seen all my days
Jason should of been disqualified for what he said at 0:44😭
none of them liked eachother's rice 😭😭
😂😂😂😂😂 these Nigerians man😂😂 shout out to my Senegambino💯💯❤️❤️
“How will you provide for family with this food?” 😂😂😂😂
The silence on the 2nd rice was worth watching this one guess the glasses guy hust lives a gd party
Jason Nigerian and said plan tin. Big man ting yeah it's plan TAYNE
I just can’t with their accent. “Nuffin” “innit nice?” “Ham-bugguh” 🤣🤣
Jason: I'm sorry I'm just trying to get the flavor     XD yall everyone's reactions soooo funny
i guess none of them can cook jollof rice.
jason is too funny 😭😭😭😭
Lateef!
“If you enjoy it at your house, you enjoy it at your house” 😂😂😂
I hate mushy ass rice in general but jason is a mf vibe 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
They look like a offbudget RDCworld
I like how everyone’s eating their rice with a fork and then there’s Jason eating with a spoon. That’s how you’re supposed to do it!
The guy with the white lowkey looks like a Bernie mac relative
As a black person, yes
What's up with the camera work? Shocking focus
None of these guys are Nigerian though… they’re all British
They finna see the reactions n scrap it out with tears in they eyes
0:44 HE DIDNT SAY PLANTAIN PROPERLY
Nija men fine die esp if them come get sense ontop 🙆🏾🤩.. finish...bye..
Moral to the story. Nigerian jollof isn't good to their own ppl lol
their pride is so funny im cryingg😭😭😭
I love how they all know Maggi. Thought that was an all german thing 😂😂💪🏻
So Chidi just came to eat 😂😂😂😂
No body likes eny body's rice so far
Could the title sound anymore Gay ?
IMO This was so funny to watch Lmat
059 man got so caught up in the culinary moment he forgot his accent lol had a moment there for real
I need BuzzFeed to make an episode featuring Haitian black rice (Du Riz Djon Djon) and have me as a guest. Just saying lol
Polite insults! 😂🤣😂🤣❤️🇿🇦
Im dead when they saw kanaan’s rice and they kept turning the plate I knew I was gonna die laughing
“this will upset your belly.” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Jason the practical man - recycling the ice cream tubs to use as food containers 🤗 respect bro 👍
Kanaan OMG!!😂😂😭😭😭
As a New Yorker I never knew Nigerians were this funny 🤣
Whoever edited this video is hilarious!! 😆😂🤣
“It’s Orange”………….…………….”Ah.”  🤣🤣😂😂
Seems like none of them knew how to cook. 💀 or others are just trying to win by tearing the others down.
Ketchuppp 👀
Coleslaw and ketchup! If Jason doesn’t get TF out of here!
The biggest sin is giving a fork to eat rice
Can we get muslim’s try each other’s pork next?
pause
You guys had the wrong chef 😩
He was not lying when he said “when u mess up jollof people with crucify for years” 🤣🤣
Ketchup in jollof??? Not even shocked they’re nigerian
chidi just came to eat
the silence was real
Since i come london na manage i deh manage eat rice. I won't diss the rice a woman cooked.
None of the jollof rice here made sense. And, who told you jollof rice must be totally red.
hilarious...
respectfully the gentleman in the black hoodie is fine as hell shiiiiii im actually sweating over here
Knew Dizzee Rascal would make the best Jollof
Jason needs his own cooking show!! He is a VIBE
Bro Kanaan put his mum's recipe on it 😂
BuzzFeed, you guys got to do focus checks before recording. So much is out of focus.
KANAAN MY DARKSKINNED SEXY KING WHY ARE YOU ON BUZZFEED???
🤣🤣🤣
Nigerians know what Maggi is? I thought that was just an Indian thing 😂
As a half Nigerian, I find this very hilarious 😂 especially Jason
jason is the coolest one of them lol😂😂😂😂
Yemeni men/women react to haneeth
Omg 😳 I absolutely love rice 🍚 lol 😂 I think I will try any type of rice.. I’m half Colombian and we eat it with almost everything! 🥳 Aloha 🤙🏽 from Hawai’i 🧘🏽‍♀️
So what I learned is none of them are good.
lateef should critic food for real
This is the rice that will give you spots 😆 🤣
Chidi is all vibes honestly
7:52 - 7:57 Nuff said 😂
Jason drop the recipe!!!!
If it helps you guys feel any better all this s*** looks like pig slop
OMG y’all finally got Kanaan in one of these
Kanaan from TikTok??
Imagine criticizing every dish and you get the lowest points🤦🏻‍♂️🤣
First time I've heard a nigerian say planTIN love to see it
This was so fun and funny to watch 😩😂😂😂
Man said add ketchup he's sick in the head
Ketchup in Jollof?
Jason was super excited  And then boom!!!! This brother can’t cook😂😂😂😂😂😂
Chidi would eat anything
A good stew makes a good jollof
And they all have the same reaction and response😂
They find the softest Nigerian men they can get
So much hate in these types of content
😂😂 when the Nigerian accent over powers the British accent you know it's serious!!
Chidi is Igbo for “god exists”
ma nigga with the black shirt is gordon ramsey doin a blacc face while bein polite
Jollof rice= The most culturally overated dish of all time.. N I've had it nearly 10 times from 10 different places n its extremely overrated
I’ve never seen anyone critique rice so hard
"You can feed it to God. He'll probably say it's amazing, but not me" LMFAOO
This just teaches me taste is subjective. Cause I've never had jollof rice but I have no idea how it's supposed to taste cause everything seems to have some problem with it. Jason did the best and the others just thought it was just acceptable
This Brother can't Cook!!!! I'm crying bruh!
Damn, forgot Chidi's name in the intro
we need a few more of these videos.... This is hilarious!!!!
this why the statements on nigerian jollof be said
Fruity bunch of he-Karen's
"Oh please, arrest whoever made this thing."  nawwwwwwwwwww brooooooooooo 😭😭😭😂😂💀💀💀
“you need to be able to cook jollof rice properly if you want to find a wife”  so wholesome.
Don't tell me you guys became shit after being in the UK for a while
All Trash. Ghana jollof much better.
When I hear jollof, I get excited! When I hear it’s Nigerian, I become sad. 👀
"If you enjoy it in your house, you enjoy it in your house" Thats the nicest way i ever heard someone call someone elses cooking trash 😂🤣
I swear to God I genuinely need someone to explain "Nigerian Men" and I'm not hearing thorough Nigerian accents please help me understand Cocoa Butter   xx love<3
Can we get my Jamaican mandem cook Ackee and saltbush tho 😏
Why is this so entertaining 😂
Ayo Chidi out here giving good scores and gets terrible scores,he has no emotion in tasting tho
Nigerian men are so boujee I love it.
Jason is my favorite
i love how all of them randomly changed into Nigerian accents at different points in the video lol
The whole intro was all from chidi dish lmao
Senegal 🇸🇳 chepdjen is the best West African rice 🍚   Somalia 🇸🇴 has the trophy 🏆 for the East    Cheers from west Africa  🦅
Jason!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣
Their expressions gosh as a Nigerian this is hilarious
Laughing in Nigerian
10:23. 3:55
Man said ketchup naa thats not jollof
“No control in this house” 🤣🤣🤣🤣
They are so funny😭😭 ok yes send me a naija man🥰
What Nigerian men?
Lmao! Jason is a character 😅😂
If you can’t cook rice you probably just can’t cook in general.
man said ketchup  💀
Jason is a whole vibe! 🤣🤣
Ketchup!? That’s madness no?
I noticed a trend in this series , the more bitter you are , the lower the score. The more positive you are, the better the score.
Now you need to do Ghanians
These are the best reactions so far...the blank faces 🤣☠️
I'm sorry did I just hear Ketchup in jollof rice 😧 ehhh!!!!!!  Bro I'm sorry but you sure you Nigerian?
pHajahaha you should do this with ghanaians too
This series gets really shady, but hilarious. Some of these competitors be talking trash about everyone else’s cooking but end having the worst cooking. 😭
If Jason says it's bad, my brother, believe! 😂😂
This had me cracking up and rolling on the floor. My Naija brothers be doing the most. 🤣🤣🤣
Chidi…ah ah it dey look sooooo promising IM CRYINGGG😭😭
sooo basically none of them can cook lol
Lol ."God loves you. Am sure he'll say it's good " . Lol
Guy: my food is the best All the other guys: this tastes like shit🤣
You should do this but with women testing the mens jollof reis
This is some entertaining stuff.. never had jollof rice..
Chidi at the end: "This must be rigged because ah-ah" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
“The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.” ‭‭2 Peter‬ ‭3:9‬ ‭NIV‬  ROMANS 10:9-11 “If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. As Scripture says, “Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame”   Matthew 11:28-30  “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”  “For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.”” ‭‭Luke‬ ‭19:10‬ ‭  God wants us to believe in His One and Only Son, Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior, who died for our sins :D When we truly believe in our hearts that Jesus is the Son of God, who died for our sins so we could have eternal life with God, we are saved from the eternal fire and have eternal life in Christ Jesus!! 💖 May God bless you all!! 🤗❤️❤️
Jason is a whole vibe AND he makes good jollof, now that's what up!
"No control in this house." I'm dead!! 🤣
Kanaan always judges so harshly 😒🤣
how da hell was everyone on same boat except chidi😂😂😂
why do i feel like chidi's confidence kept droppin as he tasted the others 😂😂
chidi is a vibe bro I mess w his energy 😭
Yooo I'm so weak after Chidi rice review .I have real tears in my eyes LMAO
I’m convinced they murdered eachother after the shoot
Broo, Basmati rice for Jollof? NOOOO, please😭😂
Kanaan the Nigerian Jamie
eating rice with a fork when a spoon is available is madness.
Jason lost me at ketchup
When chidi’s dish came and they went silent I diedddd 😭
I mean I guess it wouldn’t be a video with views if they didn’t eat a quarter teaspoon and be extra for every bite
crazy how ppl r admired by what Jason said🤢 i mean everyone is supposed to think like that in the first place when they become a member of a family or couple but the fucked up world n most male beings still assume cooking is women/mom's job or smth, same as other chores n taking care of kids, n a male being does what women are forced to do everyday once he'll get praised like he saved a life but a woman doesn't do those once she'll get blamed like she killed someone
“Well. If you enjoy in your house, you enjoy in your house” has to be the most insane passive yet nice statement I've heard in a WHILE. Time Stamp: 5:20
5:40 HAS MEEE ROLLIINGGGGG *pop* yeah 😭😭💀
Kanaan is so cute 😍
I bet Chidi used uncle ben’s rice. That rice can’t absorb flavour. It instantly turns into mush
“you people are rigged” PLSSS 😭😭😭
Hahahaha is Basmati Rice actually a thing I thought it was just a nickname for Decline Rice
I came here for the pettiness and was not disappointed lmao 🤣
EXCUSE ME IM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO HEARD ONE OF THEM SAY KETCHUP IN JOLLOF RICE, GO TO 0:52-0:55 AND THIS MAN SAYS KETCHUP ABEG THIS IS A LIE RIGHT????
Chidi’s Dish got everyone quiet. Bro could make a whole family of 7 quiet with that food 💀💀💀💀😂😂😂🤣
The way he was like you can enjoy this in your house 💀
5:38 lmfaoooo yo
"You need to get control you have no control in this house" lmfao 🤣🤣🤣 3:32
The way they looked at Chidi’s rice 🤣
Lateef reminds me of Daniel Kaluuya in certain angles
Once again Jason has killed me, how was he dancing for Chidi's rice like that 😂😂
Jason needs his own show!
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Not you can feed it to god 😂🤣😂🤣
Lateef low key looks like Ehiz
Y’all should have put Ehiz and Victor in here
10:28 😭😭😭😭PLS JASON
He said it smells oily??? What does oily smells like? Lmbo
Jason is a foodie 😄
The way Kanaan was gassin his dish to serve them rice noodles 😭😭
0:33 Wholetime Chidi is one of them 😭😭😭 Mercyyy
what i learned from these videos is the nicest people are the best cooks the super critical ones be mid cooks usually
Chidi is liking everyones rice but everyone hates his joh
Nigga my jollof rice be orange
Jason is such a mood lol I love him
The “it’s orange” whenever they were trying Kanaan’s dish 😂 7:51
After you watch and learn, i'm foodie, I love food, watch me eat
wtf isn't basmati long grain? What is this conversation before the food?
The fact that I immediately recognized Jason because of his tiktok videos. He's too funny 😂
what’s kanaan’s instagram? wasn’t he in a movie?
0:46 WHAT DID HE SAYYYYYYYYY DID THIS DUDE SAY COLESLAW WHAT
DaBaby?
umm Ketchup?.....
So jollof rice is pretty much pasta sauce on rice instead of pasta?
Broo said no control in this house😂😂
How dare Jason call it Plarntin? Also Ketchup???? You’re not a Nigerian and I don’t care what you say!
Surprised Jason won because someone that said ketchup belongs in jollof rice didn't seem to know what they were doing so that was a major surprise on his part when his food turned out to be the best
Gosh i enjoyed this wayyy too much literally smiled all through
Jason just likes food
I like that Chidi just likes everything… lol…
So Jollof is just seasoned rice?
Jason saying “It looks dry” took me outtt 🤣
If you put ketchup in your jollof rice I will send you home to your mother for retraining
wow I was really rooting for Kanaan, mainly cause I thought he was cute, yall need to give him another chance, let me taste it lol
I love jello fries
“It’s a new flavour that I’ve already come across” huh?
Jason be having the munchies. I’m convinced lol 😂
so pressed about other peoples food for what😭😭
Jason is the nicest roaster! Protect him! 😂🤣
He lost me at ketchup 😒
We need a Ghanaian version
Yeah let's make a fuss out of rice with a few spices
Me a Ghanaian watching this 😬💀💀💀
"This is a set up" 😭😭🤣🤣🤣
Browskis I havent laughed this hard at a video in so long
as gay as he is why is he (jason) talking about getting a wife
LMFAOO “this brother can’t cook” I know it’s bad cause Jason be hyping everyone up Forreal 🤣🤣🤣 he a real food lover too
Some reactions are a tad bit ridiculous
not ketchup!
Man said kanaan is on buzzfeed
Video idea: pakistani moms try each others biryani
You cant go wrong with it  No I’m lying  Ghana went wrong with it
Listen! that putting of the whole arm in the pot and stirring it by the Aunty makes that party food taste better , it’s an African thing , its not food until the Aunty with a big arm cooks it 😌
Moral of the story everybody family makes dishes differently 😂😂
I think a good video idea is say there is 5 people instead of 4 and the 5th is a person from another race and see how well it does vs thiers. Example: 4 korens make the same dish but the 5th person is from Australia. They look up a recipe and try to make it and see how it fairs with the authentic ones.
I love Jason fr fr 😩😂❤️
Chidi too damn generous with those scores fr 🤣🤣🤣
You can tell the guy that scored 4 didn’t know how to Fr. 😭he was so nice with the score because he knew, but im pretty sure he eaten it plenty of times but never really cook it 😭these scores was fairest I’ve seen 🤣‼️❤️
Jason is my man🤣🤣🤣
7:06 DONE! I’m fucking DONE, Jason why are you like this LMAO 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Poor Chidi, got the lowest score in both videos. Brother really can’t cook 😩😩
So many quotables 😂🤣
You can feed it to God 😭😭
You don’t feed this to people
Tastes like BBQ Walkers crisps 😭😭😭
Jason went from excitement to “this brudda can’t cook.” 😂🤣
Chidi was just handing out free scores 😭
Funniest video ever
You shouldn't be mad if you go to someone's house and they gave you something to eat in the first place 😂😂😂😂
"there is no control in this house." bruh....😂😂😂😂
These dudes were brutal i don't know wtf jollof is supposed to taste like now ...Maybe Nigerian woman can only make it better? Are there any Nigerian women willing to make this for me im American and I stay in California
“You know what god loves you. You could feed it to god and he’ll prolly say it’s amazing but not me” 😂😂😂😂 this killed me.
Jason reaction are the best😆😆
Kanan & Lateef had so much to say about everybody else's rice & theirs was NO BETTER🤨, Jason is a hot mess that's Y he won💖 😜 & poor Chidi, is he really Nigerian?????🤔
What’s wrong with him? Who adds ketchup to Jollof???
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂 I love Nigerian men and their exaggeration with everything 😂. Chidi likes everything 😭.
"The other people, they can go cry"  😭😭😭
😂😂😂😂
Lol
That was jokes
Jason: It looks dry!  🕺🏾 😁🙃  God loves you !
Nigerians are like dead pool They can never keep quiet 🤣
“It’s orange” me: is it?
The instant “ this brother can’t cook”🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀😭😭 I’m deceased 🤣🤣🤣
Jason has pride in his food. You can tell he using his cooking skills to win the hearts or the women he really sees a future with.
GeT iNtO iT!!! 10 seconds later THIS BROTHA CANT COOK
Jollof, ketchup, coleslaw? Chai!!!😱 U don bastardize d ting finish 😭🤣😂
This is one of the funniest episodes I’ve ever seen! Jason the way he was dancing for Chidi’s meal then tasted it 😭 real tears.   this is one of the episode you can watch more then once and still laugh.
Chidi: if you mess up jolof you will get crucified Also chidi: *messes up jollof extremely badly
Their reaction to chidi’s dish 🤣🤣🤣🤣😭
Kanaan is too much!
Jason carried this whole show 😂😂😂
Welp i can only confirm this video is that Jason can cook the rest.... Lol good luck finding a wife XD
If you enjoy in your house you enjoy in your house 😭🤣🤣🤣
“It’s orange…. Ah🫤”🤣🤣🤣
Jason did my boy Kanaan wrong with that laugh!😂
Kanaan is perfect 😍❤️😂
Jason will chop rat food one day 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Jollof rice is actually a Senegambian dish not Nigerian the word jollof is Wollof
Jason is hilarious 😂😂😂😂
Jason is so funny love his energy
I feel like you rushed this, that’s why it’s dry - She Said
I’m crying 😂🤣
Chidi 😭🤣😂😩🤣 they did you dirty 😩😂😂🤣🤣
Chidi was the most lenient of the jollof rice than all the Nigerian men.
Instant noodles in the mud
Hands down the best “trying other people’s food” video on this channel, I’ve never laughed so much. Please bring them back again, the commentary is hilarious 🤣🤣🤣🤣
jasons tastebuds must be broken
Nigerian Jollof isnt good lol
The sauce to rice ratio, the high chance of burning it, the difficulty stirring it - are all the reasons why I make my jollof in the dutch pot in the oven. I know it's cheating but I don't care, it hits every time.
If Jason doesn't like it, it must be really bad.
It's so hilarious how they get so chef-y with their judgements when their rice is below edible 🤣
Shoutout to whoever edited this video, they made it more entertaining
ok but kanaan is fineee 😍😍😍
5:20 the way I'm gonna start using this!!!!!!😭😭😭😭😭
0:44 PLANT WHAT PLANTIN??!! As a Nigerian man PLANTIN it’s PLANTAIN and ketchup on jollof kaiiii😭😭😭
It would have been better if total strangers (Nigerian men) tasted the rice.   Strangers who had not participated in the cooking of samples for the competition.
this chidi guy!😭😂 he can eat anything because ahn ahn😭😂
Kanaan’s accent game came strong thanks to Chidi’s rice😂
Jason is that “sorrayyy” guy omg😭
This is cap for the best jolloff rice is made with BBQ sauce and not ketchup
Love the “you need to be able to cook your Jollof rice properly to find a wife”  I miss those standards
“You can feed it to God, he’d probably say it’s good but not me”.....Jason 😂😂😂
One month later 😅
Now make Senegal people trying Nigerian jollof 😂 🇸🇳
Jesus is comming soon repent from your sins God loves you all ✝️❤️
Remember God loves you♥️😊! John 3:16  For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. Please repent, change your life around and live for Him🙏🙏. He is coming back soon🎊🥳........
eating jollof rice without sauce should be criminal... just sayin
Imagine being this competitive over rice 💀
This would be so fun if there was a version with Thiéboudienne 😩
Damn I feel bad for Chidi’s dish lol
Jollof rice isn't actually from Nigeria it orginated from the Wolof tribe
If you enjoy in your HOUSE you enjoy in your house had me deadddddddd😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
They say na "ah" kanaan's Jollof.  Chai. O ma shey o
Basmati ke
The men evaluation are less critical compared to the auntie's 😂
Jason isn't Nigerian please ketchup ke😂😂
Great video but a lot of the shots are out of focus.
I trust nothin Chidi says
Hmm
The best part is when it cuts from one guy saying "sorry this brother can't cook" to the next guy "how are you supposed to provide with your family with this food?" hahah
"Sorry to that man" 😭
Kanaan is annoying. Reminds me of a 3 year old that will only eat peanut butter and jelly sandwhich while calling everything else disgusting.
Damn, they dragged Chidi’s 🍚.
I have no idea how to make jollof rice but a former co-worker made it for me and I would love for someone to teach me how to cook it!
Why is Chidi the Remi of jollof rice now
Jason is sooooo funny!!!! LOL!!
Lol 😂 😂🤣 the way they looked at the camera when they saw Chidi’s dish lol
It’s hilarious how they all gas their own cooking but none of them seem like they’re actually good 😂
I'm West Indian but I enjoyed watching this entire video. Lol the mens reaction are priceless, very animated and entertaining.The reactions to Chidi's dish had me rolling!
5.40 had me dying with laughter
"I want to attack this chicken but..."😂😂😂😂
*when Chidi's food was brought in Kanaan:👁👄👁 Lateef:👁👄👁 Jason: THIS IS PARTY JOLLOF🕺🕺🕺
I'M HERE FOR JASONNN!!!😂😂😂 Y'ALL NEED TO BRING HIM BACK!
🇳🇬💕
Kanaan is hella fine
“If you enjoying your house, then you enjoy in your house” 😂😂😂
Jason's rice is as orange as his personality is. Energetic 🔥
Basmati rice is the truth. Not too much oil. Let's go!
Poor Chidi
Iedi  CBThanks y
Chidi just disgraced igbo men😭😭 Chai!!
“We’ll if you enjoy in your house, you enjoy in your house”😂🤣🤣🤣  “Please arrest whoever made this”😭😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Jason’s energy is unmatched 😂😂
Some of the men look soo feminine
MOST ENTERTAINING GROUP BY FARRRRRRRR
This just shows me that Nigerian jollof is trash🤣🤣
🇬🇭 Ghana jollof > Nigerian Jollof 🇳🇬
Jason: “You don’t feed this too people.”
How you expect to find a wife but you can’t cook Jollof rice?? 😂😂
LMAOO
The way Jason was excited in the beginning when he didn’t like it I felt it was real lol
My man Chidi can eat anything and be happy abeg😂😂
I have the feeling that none of these men can make this dish right. They all thought each other's cooking was not very good
Jollof in the morning is a dangerous game
Parboiled long grain is the correct rice. Basmati makes it Ghanaian 🤦🏾‍♂️
Funny as hell
What is up with this janky camera focus? Was no one behind the camera for this? Comeon man respect the guests!!!
Did this man say KETCHUP IN HIS JOLLOF? Chineke! My frand, if you come near my pot with ketchup I will be delivering one DATY SLAP to you
I’m sorry, but coleslaw with Jollof?!??
Kanaan talking all that shit
Jason dancing while saying it looks dry lmfaooo 😭😭😭😭
I had high hopes for Kanaan dish😭😭
So everybody rice was trash?! 😫😂
Why did he take a bite and then burst into laughter 😂
Ghana people have the best jollof what was that
Thought I was watching young dolph and key Glock
Ketchup in jollof? Are you okay at all?????? I don’t think so
Did my man said he put ketchup in his jellof?...Kick him out of nigeria now. Despicable. How are we suppose to be best of jellof and he putting ketchup in his 🤣😡
Jason : This is not for people
“This brother cant cook” right after he tried the rice. Dayem. Lmfao
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗💋👍🏻💯🇺🇸
Get these guys to make more videos! They’re so funny.
I don't understand what's the point of this food is food, beggars cannot be choosers. If they were all in Nigeria and they were starving of hunger they will not be complaining of the food.
I feel like their Momma's were talking to me not the men.
The editor had too MUCH fun.
I'm fucking starving now. I need jollof rice and oxtail. Someone take me to Brixton.
If you feel bad about your dish being torn apart by Nigerians feel very lucky because from my experience on making Jollof rice and making my Senegalese and Gambian friends test taste it they are hardcore in their opinions of this dish especially because its one of the oldest in their history goes back to 1300s in the ancient wolof empire which was later was named Senegal, Gambia and Mauritania.  it personally took me 5 tries to perfect it as an experienced chef who worked Michelin level kitchens even though I'm Egyptian Pakistani so technically both African and Asian so believe me when I say I know spices this was on another level seems simple enough but it has to be made with passion lots of it the more you enjoy cooking the more you produce magic.
The jollof in the thumbnail looks EXQUISITE. I just know that if you eat that on your bed, it will stain with maximum capacity and duration
“this brudda can’t cook.”😭
If there are tomatoes in jollof rice…it’s a no 🇱🇷
Jason doing the little dance every time before tasting and then gets disappointed is me when I get to know a person well...
that kanaan guy should model
“There’s no control in this house” got me🤣🤣🤣
We need a video of Jason’s recipe.
Isnt that the Lateef FUCK YOUR NAP guy? 😂😂😂
Why gays act like  so gays wttfff
Jason >>>>
That title is a bit sus
should give them the dishes without knowinng whose it is cause they all praising their own 💀💀
Chidi, this show wasn't rigged but you just can't cook...
"Smell wise? Its really oily" 🤣🤣🤣  @5:02
Amen to the guy that said you need to cook your Jollof rice to find a wife 🤣.That being said my dad Cooks the best Jollof.
Ghana jollof rice is the best
😭😭😭
0:43 Jason is an imposter.
🤣😂🤣😂 "no control in this house" this just cracked me up
Imagine ketchup uno
You see from the moment Jason said “plantin on the side” I can never take him in
Omggggg this was hilarious 😂
This is one of the funniest episodes 😂😂❤️
Jason is my whole vibe
You could never impress a Nigerian 😂
I am cryinggg!!!
“Looks dry”  *dancey dance*😂😂😂😂😂
7:09 🤣🤣🤣look very fresh 😭
Ketchup in the Jollof is insanity 😂
I don’t know what jollof rice is supposed be like but I know damn well it ain’t no orange risotto.
Lol we all need a Jason in our life...and we also need what ever skin care Kanaan is using
This video is awesome 👏
It's Kanaan's confidence for mee😂
It's the "Ah" for me 😂😂
forget the rice I need everybody’s skin care routine!!!
Sound person... Do better. Those eating sounds... 🤮🤢
how are all these fake ass comments at the top, all of them basically hated each others rice
“How’s it look?” *dances* “lewwwks dry” 🤣🤣🤣
Jason personality reminds me so much of Eric from Sex education. Loveeee him
I’m screaming at the silence when Chidi’s rice came out. Lmaoooo
Chidi is just happy to be eating💀💀💀💀
WTF ketchup?????????? in jollof rice 😱😱😱🤮🤮🤮😤😤😤
Brothas effeminate
How you failed cooking rice 😭
As a Senegalese I’m offended when Nigerians act like jollof rice is theirs 😂😂
Did he just say Ketchup in jollof? 💀💀💀💀💀
Camera out of focus for most of the video messed with my OCD
Proof that the most genuine person always wins 😭😭 it never failed
I loved this!!!
When a man can cook 👌🏻❤️❤️❤️
What is Kanaan socials? 🥴🥴
Jason: 🕺🏾🕺🏾🕺🏾 It looks dry 😁😄😆🕺🏾
I want to be Jason's friend soooo bad
Jason always cracks me up. I am so happy they bought him back.
“It looks dry” Continues to dance 💃 🤣
Anybody know their IG??????
I love Jason! He’s extra af!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Nah cause dude in the black Jean jacket has me on the floor😭
0:17 This Nigga Kind Of Zesty?🤔
the way they give critiques but perform so poorly. men are so scary ah
these men are all so confident but most of them are terrible cooks lol
BuzzFeed for once bring Ghana people to Ur channel.
This show is rigged men 😕😕😕🤣🤣🤣
"By the time I open my eyes" lol. True African parent statement.
This was the funniest episode yet
You don't use basmati in jollof
Did he say add some ketchup??!! Please get some actual Nigerian participants!
Jason is so funny, it was so entertaining to watch😂😂
....allow the ketchup tho. 😂 #blasphemy
I love Jason 😂❤
Wish we could see a close up of the plate! 👀:D
he did not jut say ketchup
And Chidi is so kind 🤣
Kannan is so funny
classic african,you lose,its rigged
"aah! "
"If you enjoy in your house you enjoy in your house ."
These dudes are so fun to watch!
Lmaaaooo Chidi’s rice was giving “who made dis one oh!?”
Please give them their own food,  I want to see how hard they will cap to win.😂
I’m sorry, Kanaan is FOOOOINE!!
Here for kanaan 😍😍😍
Day old jollof rice in a tortilla with beans.
Nigerian men are always critical of other mens food.
Savage comments I love it.  Truth no mince words on the food haha
🤣🤣🤣
Ketchup?? Never have my mama put ketchup in Jollof rice. As if back home, they just have bottle ketchup In the house 🤦🏽‍♀️
Hahahahaha, That's whatsup! Everyone loves Jollof anything
If you enjoy it in your house, enjoy it in your house 😂😂😂
Glad Jason won!
Chidi might not be a good cook but he is my type of man. Good and polite and so handsome, like i’m melting
Hahaha hahaha Kanaan tho 🤣😅😅
Ayeeeee Jason is super lit he needs a food show because I'm over her cracking the hell up 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hey! That’s awesome! Shall we be friends?
When Jason tried Kanaan’s rice😭😭
Burning it makes it nice though just don’t serve the burnt part
The camera isn't focused properly.
JESUS LOVES YALL HE SAVES HE IS KING
who's gonna tell them that basmati is a long grain rice variety? 😭
Jason had me rollin😂😂😂😂😂😩💞
Lol as a Naija babe, I definitely enjoyed it. Chidi seems to like everything he is served lol.. no wonder he can’t cook 😂 Jason is a fun person .
Jason is just so happy to be there 😂
7:08 that zoom in killed me hahaha
If your cooking is rubbish your jollof will be rubbish. Uh obviously? lol
Is this a repost?
im dead 💀 its called nigerian
Jason eating everything if he says you can’t cook then you can’t cook loool
The guy with the black jacket is hilarious🤣, the way he smelled Chidi’s food & took a step back to assess why… lol
5:54 took me out 😂
Lol jason, ”you don’t feed this to people ” 😂
Chidi is easily impressed 😂😂😂 no wonder he got 4
Chidi: I have tasted worse me:uuh everyone:this brother can't cook
Jason can eat sand and be happy
That pause and then “It’s okay” 😂
When Jason said “you can feed it to God and he will probably say it’s amazing”, I just fell out!!!
Nobody  Me: “you don’t feed this to people”
You know Chidi's was terrible if even Jason gave it a 2.
Very handsome Nigerian men.
JASON!!! Yay! He is a gem. But all of these guys are golden. 🙃
Ksi gotta react to this 😂
I love them lol
Lolllll the reactions to Kanaans dish after he said his was top level 😂😂😂🤣 lol they are all funny!
My Nigerian brothers add some bananas 🍌 to your tomato rice an change your life
Lets get the Ghanaian Jollof guys, against Nigerian jollof guys
Chidi is the embodiment of Igbo men. Useless in the kitchen. Tufiakwa
Jason is a whole damn vibe
Haitian rice vs Nigerian Rice let’s do it 🇭🇹
these are hilarious
was anybody’s good? 😭
I keep rewinding the tasting of Chidi's plate LMAO "this brother can't cook" "How can you provide for family with this food". Poor Chidi, maybe the kitchen just isn't his place
Nice Catholic young men.  Well done.
I just think jollof rice is to Nigeria what Gumbo is to New Orleans. Lol! There are different variations to it and many often disagree on the one way to make the dish.
So pretty much none of them can cook but all of them think they can xD
The secret of a nice jollof rice is the tomatoes spices and the pot THE POT
Omo that Chidi's taste buds eh! Seems he doesn't know good food sha
I found the audio/video quality to be distracting in this particular video. The first 4 minutes has a lot of blur on their faces, and Chidi's video throughout the video is blurred. The audio is a bit overblown in parts, too. The audio distortion is most noticeable when Kanaan is speaking. I don't mean for this to be abrasive, so I apologize if it does! I just wanted to offer some feedback.  With all that being said, I love this group and want to see more! It makes me want to try making a Nigerian dish!
No way you got beat by a dude that had his dish called instant noodles
If Jason says something doesn't taste good, I believe him
when man disrespect your jollof rice. You have to fight till one can no longer stand.
Nobody’s mom forced them to cook with them in the kitchen and it shows
“ if you im enjoy it I your house, you enjoy it in your house” is a slow burn. Hahahaha
I love how none of them were good
For Jason to say the food is bad, then the food is bad😂😂😂. His comment on Kanaan’s food took me out🤣
Pretty sure my Nigerian husband from Igbo land can cook, when his friends are asking him for all the stews. Vegetarian wife here..😁
7:54 though lol
Chidi seems like one of those guys who's just happy to be eating 😂. You can't trust dinner recommendations from such people.  Jason, on the other hand, total foodie and proud of it. The kind who can appreciate the art and science of food. You can tell he knew what he was about when his plate was the only one with garnishing of any sort ☺️
It’s Jason dancing for me 😂 I love it
Anyone else thinks Lateef looks like Ehiz and Jason has Ehiz’s personality? Just me? Ok😭😂😂
Lmaooo poor Chidi🤣🤣  Also…heeey Kanaan😍😍
Not ketchup!
@ 3:36 he was not ok 😂
Ketchup?? My ancestors are crying
Love Jason 😂✨
Yooo😂 I love jacobs vibe! Dude makes me laugh like crazy
Kanaan is so over dramatic 😭💀
lmfaoooo
When Jason said I had to dive in to see the moisture 😂😂😂  Chidi so laid back and cool . Love him!!  I really enjoyed this , watching from Georgia USA .
Is this a re upload ?? 👀 Can someone confirm I'm not dreaming lol
Bro got 4/30😭💀
“Jollof flavor too high, chicken flavor too low. You gotta get control. There’s no control in this house” LMAOOO
Not me wanting to go on this as a non-Nigerian jollof lover 😂 they'd shred me to pieces or be pleasantly surprised 😭😂
Jason just loves food, chidi's food looks very scary 😂😂😂😂😂
The different reactions to Chidi’s plate IS SENDING ME 😭😭😭💀💀💀💀
"this is not jollof rice" 🤣
the way everyone was silent when they put Chidi’s dish down and Jason just dancing😂😂😂😂
Me thinkin 20.5 was low, here come chidi with 4 points 🤣🤣
The problem here is Nigerian jollof period 🫢 …..🇬🇭🫡
Isn’t this the guy who does the “what are you listening to” parody, he’s hilarious
Jason needs his own tv show. I’d watch the heck out of that!
“Wife”
Am so tired of this dumb ass convo about jollof . Just eat and rest
Ketchup ke
I like watching these videos so I can look at all this delectable chocolate 😍
If you enjoy it in your house you enjoy it in your house 🤣
Ketchup and basmati.....lost souls
Nigerian men taste other Nigerian men 😏
Ketchup ni to bawo
This is amazing, I love this. These men are so entertaining.
After all the hype Jason gave Chidi’s dish then to say ‘this brother can’t cook’ 💀🤣😂
"no one's stopping you" isn't a friendly way to encourage someone to do something, it is slightly negative sounding. I never noticed it until today.
Jason’s the spirit animal Fr 😭
The main truth is..... If you don't know the secret recipe to party jollof rice  You may never know how the outcome of your jollof rice will be   Rare times, Very good Most times, awkward
😂😂 they’re hilarious
My new line " how you gone feed this to people? " 😂😂😂😂
My mans said coleslaw. My Nigerian ancestors are rolling in thier gaves.
I'm OBSESSED with Jason. I love him so much! Please make him a regular. he is sooooooooooo funny!
No but did chidi taste his food first 😩😂
I love Jasoon loool!! He’s here for the food and food only 😩
Please 😭💀 what’s Jason’s TikTok I NEED to follow him 💀💀
I love how he says the word ketchup
As a Nigerian the first thing that came to mind was "what difference does it make? It's all the same😂💀"
I just love the vibe of Jason
i feel like i cannot trust any of these guy's opinions haha
People don't like the little burnt bits at the bottom of the pan?  When I make Puerta Rican rice, that is my favorite part.
Jason can’t be Nigerian… he pronounced plantain wrong 👀
Chidi loves everything because he has killed his taste buds with his cooking
Love Jason's energy and Chidi seems like a pretty cool guy. Doesn't seem like it takes a lot for him to be content
😂😂😂😂😂 chidis plate had me dying
Rice pudding jollof 😂😂😂
really wonder how these kinds of shows would go if they didn’t only staff them with the most pompous pricks they could possibly ever find. truly insufferable ass holes in every single one
BASMATI 😍😍😍
If Jason doesn’t like it then it’s not right.
Chidi is on a whole other planet 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ketchup?! Lol, someone pray for Jason.
Jason is vibes and I'm here for it!!
Kanaan just be on here disgracing his moms recipes omg lmaooooo
Kanaan is cute and funny lolll
Chidi! Chidi! Chidi! How many times did I call you eh, Chidi???  So you have come to embarassssss your modda in front of the whole world? You no dey get shame? Eh Chidi????
Poor Chidi. It happens.  Maybe he can do better next time haha
These guys are funny.  I like this group lolol.  And they seem fair too
😂Its mad because nigerian jollof taste like gone off porridge
Seems very inconsistent ? 😂 is there single jollof rice they can all agree upon on.
Some of these men are fineee
Chidi and Jason are a good sport
Not Jason saying “But ykw God loves you so that’s good you can feed it to God and he will probably say it’s amazing” 😭😭😂
Jason 😂
All this ajebutter talk on top jellof rice it's tiring
This is the rice that will give you spots tomorrow   What a SHADE😂😂😂😂
Chidi’s dish looked like jollof paella not rice 😭 then Kanaan’s dish “ it’s fighting for its life to be separated” 🤣
“That’s enough.” 😂😂😂
This was the most funniest, more!!!
Chidi is the only one that wasnt undercutting everyone scores lol
I need a friend like Jason cus what! 🤣🤣🤣❤️
The way they all was staring at Chidi dish was sending meeeee lmfao
These guys 😂😂😂
That guy that said ketchup is a cultist😭😭
Kannan so fine
Everyone’s reaction to Chidis dish has me crying 😭
“If you enjoy it in your house you enjoy it in your house “🤣🤣
I want to hang out with Jason lol
Jason...would you like a wife?
He wants to talk mushy rice with not enough tomato when his was apparently bbq sauce and food coloring
Jason seems like a nice guy but I find him so jarring, I actually feel guilty I feel like that but I do
Do people trying each other's spotted dick!!
Please get some Ghanaians up in here next, eh? Pretty please with jollof on the side? ☺️
I prefer Ghanaian and Senegalese Jolof than Nigerian. The Nigerian jolof that I tried was too tomatoey. I’m East African
Hey you, you’re not a mistake. God created you for a reason! Rest but don’t quit, keep pressing !
This entire crew is so funny 🤣facial expressions and everything
If Jason says no then it’s a no 😂😂
Like ASAP !!!
Yooo 😂😂😂😂😂 these guys need a show !! Sign them !!!
Chidi Falling Igbos men's hand. Why naaa. At least hes enjoying everyones food although I doubt if his tongue is even working.
Jason is a vibe!!!
“Feed it to God”?!
is it just me or Jason looks like MikeGLC but the dark skin version 😂🤷🏾‍♂️
Yes chef, most home cooks are better at criticising than cooking.
Once he said "disgoctin" it was all over.
UK people can’t cook let’s be real 😂
Why doesn't Chidi's name get mentioned in the I yro like the other guys?? They disrespected his rice and y'all disrespected his intro 😂😂😂 poor guy. So nice too lol
Nah jason was raised to eat any type of food no matter what for sure
My favourite line "this brother cannot cook" 😂 in the beginning "you need to cook to get a wife" I bet you that nut single still 😂💀
Please please do more with them specifically, 😂😂😂I'm crying
All these guys got great energy lmaoo. I love that they saw Chidi’s and it was dead silence because I saw the abomination as well. Then Jason pops up and he’s turnt until he taste the abomination lmaoo
Off topic but Lateef's one eye has a white/cloudy look to it. I hope this is something he has/had checked out ❤ Love all these episodes
As an ibo, chidi embarrassed the culture, na wah oh.
Can we just admire how sexy Kanaan is?! His skin is so smooth and shiny. If I wasn’t married I’d be emailing this channel like… who is? And how can I feed him 😂
Jason! That’s comment…Love him🤣🤣🤣
🤣my good the frustré guy funny « you need to cook properly to fine a wife » lol my little brother lady so hé may gonna be a no cooking man but mr restaurant ewooo
This is verbal confirmation that Nigerians use ketchup in their Jollof rice 🤢🤮...been saying this for years.  Im going to clip this video..
Respect for getting nigerian Dababy on this show
Jason is a WHOLE vibe!
‘Hmm this is new’ 😂😂😂
Who told Chidi he got a four?! 🤣
Ghanian jollof is better.
Dude looks like Aff from RDC
hahahahahahaha chidi failed terribly
i',m already laughing before they have tried the food! keep these videos up haha
Kanaan is just so attractive😭😭
Can I petition for more videos with Jason?  His vibe & energy is everything!!
Mix it all up and you get a dream 🤣🤣
Jason said Ketchup in jollof?! A Ghanaian would never 🤣🤣🤣 #GhanaJollof is still number 1   Please also give Jason his own show 😩🤣  Sincerely, A Ghanaian girl
Lmao i'm crying. I wonder how bad Chidi's rice actually is looool
Knaan says it smells oily 😂
The fact that Jason gave it a two! CUZ Jason eats anything!
Jason criticising food??? That dish must be that bad because that man eats anything!
If Jason says your food is bad, you know it's really bad.
They hating haha
"... jollof flavor is too high, chickens flavor is too low....YOU NEED TO GET CONTROL OF THIS HOUSE!" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm sorry. Ketchup? Ketchup in jollof rice?
I will like to be a part of this cooking and tasting with some females 🙂 my UK people 💃
I loved this! Jason bought everything to this episode 🙌🙌
Did Jason say, ketchup?????
“It’s ok” 🥹
I think this is my fav episode. I was cracking up the whole episode. Love my Naija!
So what I got from the video as a Mexican I need to learn to cook jollof rice or I can’t find a wife 👨‍🍳 Edit: nah Jason funny as hell 10:25 why he bring god into this LMFAO
If Jason says it’s dead, it’s dead 🤣🤣🤣
We need another evidence asap pls🤣
Ohhhhh chidi 😭😭
They’re so hilarious!! Love it ❤️🙏🏽
Kanaan talking bout Chidi’s rice being orange yet his looks low yellow 😭 Plus boy that’s your moms recipe. Be quiet.
“It doesn’t look fresh” 😭. It’s the fact that Kanaan said the other guy’s was barely orange and his is not giving colour
Man said there’s no control in dis house 😂😂
Him all bring di chicken
Buzzfeed UK yet these are Nigerian?
Egusi Soup next please
This shows you that Nigerian men can’t cook!! Lmaooo I’m not even surprised
This was refreshing to watch lol... Good going guys, would love to see more content similar to ti's. Challenge yourselves to the guys... Well done!
Is Maggie MSG?
Yes Jason that what I'm talking about. I love either a delicious coleslaw or Nigeria salad on the side or mixed with it! I must have a salad with my beans or my Jollof rice. The combination is so delightful. 🤤
“If you like it in your house, you like it in your house” SCREAMINGGG😭😂
The “Ah” from Kanaan and Lateef when they were disgusted 💀
This is amazing for some reason "If you enjoy it in your house you enjoy it in your house"
Please do this with Ghanaian men or women 🙏🏽
Is the front camera blurry and unclear ? I know my eyes are getting confused seeing different camera qualities in one video 😂
You should do a huge plot twist where they think they are judging other mens rice but really all their moms cooked the dish and they are rating each mom 👀 😂 😭 💀
Jason is just a mix of love 😂
When Jason wanted to explain what was going on 😂😂
You can’t go wrong with Jason 😂
Mufasa and Scar 😂
Please keep them coming 😩🤲🏽🤲🏽🤲🏽😂
There’s no control in this house 😂
KETCHUP ?!
They were hilarious 😂.
I love the accent of Nigerian people ♥
I adore Jason’s energy just always happy when there’s a plate of food in front of him honestly the best Jason needs a series of some sort.
If Jason says "you can't cook" then you can't cook cos that brother loves to eat any and everything that resembles food
I love Jason he said if you give it to god he will love it. I love these guys omg
Kanaan is too funny😂
Jason is deffo half Congolese. Ketchup in jollof😩
U can feed it to god took me out😁😭🤣
Basically if you want to find a wife learn to cook😂😂😂
Jason is my favorite person!!! ❤️ The way he was dancing for all the plates especially Chidi's. 😂😂
I love jollof rice with OHFADA RICE FROM NIGERIA 🇳🇬 😋 WELL SEASONED WITH AFRICAN SPICES.
Jellof rice should not have Maggie or ketchup, natural wholesome food. Homemade Maggie or ketchup. This is suppose to be a national dish with authenticity of motherland herbs and spice. What about guava ketchup and neeseberry. Come up my sisters you can do this.
The only thing to get a 10 is the guys black hoodie
lol we love to see it
“You need to be able to cook jollof rice properly if you want to find a wife!” I know that’s right!! 👏🏽👏🏽
"  Well, if you enjoy in you house, you enjoy in your house . "  Lol best answer ever!
Jason: "You have to like dive in to see the moisture"🤣🤣
Ive never known anyone to like anyone elses Jollof the competition is HARSH
Yes and the rest of us all get jobs at the call centre scam department sorry chicken nuggets
How can something SMELL oily loool Kanaan you lie like a true Nigerian
Ketchup in what jollof sorry
Chidi will eat anything 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
When Jason started laughing I bust out laughing with him 😂😂😂😂
Ghanaian Jollof is A+++
😂😂😂 this WHOLE video lol classic
Jason is Out Of Control and I am here for it 🤣🤣🤣🤣
When Jason got excited to eat Chidi’s dish and after tasting it said “this brotha can’t cook” 😂😂😂😂
Can we have Jason just rating dishes 😂 love him
Chidi liked all the ones that we’re the worst 🥹
Is Jason from Ghana? Cuz idk any Nigerians who mix coleslaw
Chidi why 😭😭😭😭
Personally I feel like the best jollof is made by women no cap.... Not all Women but majority of women yh
If Jason doesn't like it you can't cook 💀💀💀
Man said ketchup, bro get in the bin man
Can you do a Ghanaian men try each other’s jollof?🤣
how do you provide your family this food 🤣
Should have been Nigerian men try out Ghanaian mens jollof rice and find out it tastes better. 🤣🤣🤣
i want to see east african aunties trying each others chapatis please
Keep these 4 personalities together, ALWAYS!!  Jason is the perfect hype to the others laid back responses.  LOL.  But, when he says you can't cook...
Jason was so bubbly and energetic! I love how he broke down what was wrong with Chidi's food😂 But... the way Kanaan was criticizing I thought his food was going to be the best. Embarassinggg😭😭
When will you have GAMBIANS try the ORIGINAL jollof rice, namely benachin?! Eh?
If Jason says you can't cook, you need to reconsider your entire existence honestly
I can't be the only one who eats jollof rice with yogurt 😹
Chidi obviously eats anything, a terrible judge 😭😂😂 His wife won't have a problem
It's the way Kanaan always makes so much mouth only to present nonsense 😭😭😭😭😝 Who will marry you now bruv??
How can you get jollof so wrong?
Jason bribe them with a peace of chicken 🐔 🤣........
The way they violate Chidi’s jollof shows they are truly african 😭🤣
Rice pudding jollof🤣😆
Now this is the content I've been waiting for!😂😂😂 YES!
Lemme go find Jason, so I can husband him up right quick. 🤣
omg Kanaanb
I’m under the impression men can’t cook in general
I'm glad Jason won! Especially after I hear him pronounce plantain properly 😍😍😍
“It looks dry” -does a little fancy dance- 😁🕺
I’m crying in real tears
i love jason's vibes
Chidi is there for the food 😂😂😂😂
I’m crying Chile
So my question is can all the guys not cook...or are they all just haters 😂
I love the guy with the glasses He is always so happy 🤣
Jason is a huge vibe🤩
Jason had me rollin! 🤣🤣🤣
bruhhhh the two of them like 🧍‍♀️ and jason “get into itt🕺” lmfaoooo😂😂😂😂
Jason is so damn T’d man😂🔥🔥
These reactions are something else brooooo🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
hilarious and cute
Wow these men are BLUNT AF! 😜😂
This 👏🏽is 👏🏽why👏🏽we 👏🏽do👏🏽blind👏🏽 taste👏🏽tests 👏🏽
This was hilarious 😂😂😂
Nigerians are the coolest!! I love Nigerian vibes are the best!! Shout out to Burna boy. The king of Nigeria in my book!!🌟
further proof that Nigerian jollof is inferior to Ghanaian smh
“I probably nailed it” 😭😭😭😭😭
Omg the editing when Chidi's dish drops 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I am cackling at 12:42am 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂. My favorite line is "if you enjoy it in your house, you enjoy it in your house" 😂😂😂😂😂😂 omg 😂😂😂😂
So, Jason is the only one who can cook?
Blindfold them and have them taste all of them
How did my namesake make rubbish rice? 😭🤣🤣🤣🤣 this was so entertaining
Chidi gives high scores very generous man  Jason 🥇 deservingly and Kanaan and his dry humour is just charming
Jason though 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 he had me in stitches this entire video! I'm happy he won
Dude in the hoodie always have something bad to say
Jason is my imaginary bestie in my head.
I love them more videos please. Jason is hilarious I love his personality.
We need Kanaan’s IG. By we I mean me 😂
Jason was so excited lol 😭😂
Jollof Rice is really hard to cook just right. I can’t even cook it properly and I’m Nigerian. I’ve eaten so many disappointing Jollof rice including my own 😭 However when it is cooked well, it’s sooooooooo good.
Jason… did you say KETCHUP in JOLLOF????? Ye oooo🙆🏽‍♀️🙆🏽‍♀️🙆🏽‍♀️🙆🏽‍♀️🙆🏽‍♀️
Ketchup in jollof??? 🤢🤢
Jason probably a Gemini
Chidi just chilling. I don’t mind my husband like that, he will just complement everything I make. Even tho I’m a great cook lol but u know some days ain’t perfect lmao
Jason is a vibe
I feel like Jason should win just because of vibes🤷🏾‍♀️
I love Jason😂😂
I like the setup of men. Funny and nice personalities
Can someone write a scripted comedy series with these hilarious dudes as food critics and/or chefs who are starting a new business. They are hilarious and I would watch them in anything. I am dying LOFL Poor Chidi 🤣
If you enjoy it in your house, you enjoy it in your house 🤣  Love these guys!! They are so fun to watch. Can me & Mae (from Filipino Women Try vids) be guest judges!? 🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️ I would love to try their food, it can’t be that bad come on.
I love these videos! Taking the same dish and seeing how everyone can expect it differently there’s no one way to make them
Lateef and Kanaan's reaction at first sight vs Jason's reaction at first sight 💀😭...then Jason tastes it😂😭💔
The silence when Chidi's jollof was dropped killed me. The look Kanan gave had me howling. What the hell? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I had to watch again and Jason said God loves you..you can feed it to God not me😭😂😂
“If you enjoy it in your house, you enjoy it in your house” 😭😭😭😂
Ketchup in jollof😰
I was think they don't sound Nigerian haha and I heard  there is no flavour in this house. Chai 😄  those jollof is 🤤
I need Nigerian Friends 😫 so we can exchange meals 😋 lol
Once I heard ketchup in the jollof I almost fainted
I love these guys 😆 very entertaining. I like how they breakdown exactly what they don’t like about the ingredients.
Awwww chidi will get a wife to make him proper Jollof rice 😭 he is fine sha true Igbo man that is just laid back and chillin
If Jason says the food tastes bad, then it's bad.
Jason is such a mood I love it 🥹🥹🥹
For the second dish, why the 2 first guys (especiallythe 1st guy) look soooo offended and triggered 🤣🤣 I can't  This is funny as heck
Jason is a whole mood.
Not jollof and ketchup?! 😩😩😩  I'll admit it's not the worst-tasting combo but definitely still qualifies as HIGH TREASON idc idc
Bless Jason's soul!! Man has the best spirit of everyone. If he calls out your cooking, you need counseling
Jason is too funny. I love him😂😂😂❤️❤️❤️
I would like to highlight how Jason said PLANTIN🫶🏽
Wow I liked Chidi's vibe..
Kanaan kills me
Poor Chidi. He just came to embarrass himself. In Igbo households boys are over pampered. They are not encouraged to learn how to cook. And it shows 🙈
Jason is hilarious! 😂 I love his personality
i need Jason’s energy
Jason tell them oo how will you find a wife if you can't cook!!!,  tell'em!!!!!😂😂😂😂
Coleslaw and ketchup is MAD
Noone: Absolutely Nobody:  Jason: It looks dry😇💃🏿🕺
Jollof rice instant noodles😩😂😂😂
Arrest?! 😂😂
After my last experience… No Comments 🤐🤐
Noodles as jollof 💀💀💀💀
By the time I open my eyes I want this food off this table!! Bruh I’m so weak 💀 💀 💀
Chidi probably has the lowest score in the history of buzzfeed😑😂
Chidi's food has to be really really bad for Jason to complain. Embarrassing us igbos😂😂
O...K....
Jason is just so funny 😭🤣
JASONNN 😂😂😂
Jason: " happy music in the  background"  Everyone else: "crickets"
Jason is the best here.... kanaan thinks he's da ish.. and can't cook .. clown🤣
Idk mehnnnnn, ketchup in jollof…?!
Ketchup and coleslaw seriously my G
I would put cook you all. My jollof is 10/10 NO CAP!
When Jason said Ketchup in the jollof my mouth literally dropped and stayed open for 5mins straight - abomination!
I just love Jason! I just want to put a plate in front of him and get his opinion of my cooking!
“If you enjoy it in your house, you enjoy it in your house” is so damn shady 😂😂🤣
I feel like Jason is the most impartial judge, he is genuinely happy for everyone even when their dish is better than his and he's a generous scorer bless him
Jason: hyping up the food A few minutes later......  Jason: nahhh this brudda can't cook!  PHAHAHAHAAHAHAHHAHAHA
Jason and Kanaan need a show! What a riot!
These guys are my favorite group of tasters 😂😂😂😂 These dishes must have been really bad because Jason didn't really like any of them and what did y'all do to Kanaan he wasn't throwing shade like he did last episode LMAO! Can't wait to see these guys again!!!!
Nigga who said “ketchup” should retire his Nigerian passport
The reactions are hysterical in this one LMAO 😂
I'm not even Nigerian but wouldn't touch Jollof unless long grain rice is used.
Jason again with his good energetic vibes, while the rest ....😭😂
Kanaan is so handsome. 🥰
6:03 LMAOOOOOOOOO 😭😭😭😭
Women married yourselves Chidi because he will appreciate any dish you makes for him.
5:21 5:34  LMAO 😂
God forbid ketchup 😭
Lol this is gonna be mad and soon criticizing.... cos not all Nigerians cam cook😭😭
Loool I can't be the only one that screamed when the sorry 4 came up next to the 20. Jeesh they didn't hold back at all 😂😂😂
Jason is a man of taste. Ketchup 🤝 jollof! A dream combo
Chidi baby? Is that baby food? What was that 😂😂😂
Igbo jollof and Yoruba jollof are def different 💀….
I wanna try this so bad, it looks so good 😩
“You ppl are rude” xD as they all make stank face before tasting
You *seriously* can’t cook if JASON says it🤣🤣
Does someone want to tell the dude that is using basmati rice, and doesn't like long grain rice, that basmati rice IS a LONG GRAIN RICE LMAO
Jason is the only one excited to try the food😂😂😂😂 but if HE says it’s nasty then it’s nasty
Jason is such a vibe
This is the rice that will give you spots tomorrow looool
'By the time I open my eyes, I want this food off this table' lol Kanaan is too funny 🤣
👑🖤👍🏽🥰WE NEED MORE OF THESE GUYS AND MORE REVIEWS.. THEIR COMMENTS ARE HILARIOUS 😂 🤣🤣
Kanaan with the Gordon Ramsay critic but can’t cook🤣.
Chidi is so nice, and the other guys keep gunning for his food sha lol!!!!
I love Kanaan😭😭❤️ I watched the previous video just to see his reaction.
“If you enjoy it in your house, you enjoy it I. Your house!”  😂😂😂 I’m going to use this!
Jason, I know you didn't just mention ketchup with Jollof rice
Also it's funny to me how Chidi gave really high marks to everyone 😂
none of these mans can cook. throw them all out. 🤣
Chidi is just there chilling with his 4 lmao Meanwhile not Kanaan having strong opinions about everyone's food meanwhile the only good thing about his is that it's ORANGE 😂💀
Chidiiiiiii chai you don let igbo community down 😆
Nah, KETCHUP???? planTIN?? 🧐🧐😂
If Jason of all people says your dish is bad, just know you are finished 😂
Is Jason single? I’m married but I will find a nice woman for him. He deserves that. I love his energy.  Btw, if Jason doesn’t like your food, it’s total garbage. I will die on that hill!
Now you know if Jason gave a dish a 2 it for sure was terrible
10:26 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Kanaan is disrespectful ahaha and karma hit him boy 😂
Eh mufasa ka ? 🤣🤣🤣
If Jason’s says you can’t cook, then I don’t know what to tell you my friend 😂😂💀💀💀
Bring them back!! I love them all
5:39 when Jason smacked his lips LOOOOOOOL
Lmao I love this group. I’m literally crying lmao
omg jason “God loves you so you can feed it to him he’ll probably says it’s amazing….but not me” nahhh imma have to start using that when i don’t like shit 🤣😂
Jason is really here for henjoyment i love him 😭
Lateef is so handsome 😍😍
Jason is always so much fun, such a good spirit, love this guy🥰☺️😁
I love Jason loooool so fun
lmaoooo nah they all violated each other haha
Chidi enjoyed all of them😂😂
Random but I love how they all dip into their Naija accents when talking about food 😂
💎These are some classy brothas! Love to see it! 💎
I love Jason’s energy
The comments has me smh laughing lol lol and lol
Lateef's dish from the look and the texture look I gave it a 8 maybe a 8.75 overall.
LONDON MEN ARE SO FUNNY LMAOOOOOOOOO. I need uk friends to save me from this horrible country 😭 I love Jason and Kanaan lmaooo funny af!!! JASON SAID U CAN FEED THIS TO GOD AND HE WILL LOVE YOU BUT NOT ME LMAOOOOOOOOO. I’m so so so happy he won ❤️💋
Kanaan's dish I rated it a 6.5 too from the look of it and the texture of how the fork smoothly divides the rice and not stuck or sticks on the utensil
Jason gone always bring the vibes and his stomach ready to eat. 😂😂❤️
Kanaan talk big talks, but hope his flavors flavours are balanced and top shelf. Lets see. Big chat son, big talk   As the Islanders of the Caribbean would say,  "you better can cook, you're not here for your pretty looks" lollol lol
🥹🤣🤣
Kanaan would be talking anyhow, whereas his dish is not it also 🤣
I've been waiting for this onee 😭
Chidi's dish got a cricket sound, lol lol, a big setup lol  But from the look i rate his dish a 6, just from how it looks. But I rated it before hearing the comments,  lol lol
If Jason says you can’t cook then you can’t cook! 🤣
Jason's dish from the look is a 8.5/10 I would rate from the look and texture seen.
We all know these nigerians cannot cook jollof rice
The ratios has to be leveled out and balanced with flavours (flavors) and the herbs & seasonings has to be top notch for flavor town on a person's taste buds.  Jollof Rice is like Jamaica's  Seasoned Rice, similar ingredients but I agree wholeheartedly, each dishes can be eaten morning,  noon, evening, dinner, and in between time for that haughty comfort food  #ONE LOVE  #JOLLOF RICE  #IRIE #NO PROBLEM MAN #LOVE LOVE LOVE
Question for Nigerian people: is this how all Nigerian people act with food? If so, I feel you all on a spiritual level. Food is a very important part of culture and should not have any disrespect put on it when prepared.

Fantastic men, I want more of these
A man said plantin?
The ones that think they can cook, actually can’t cook.
I love these taste test competitions soooo much! Keep them coming 👏🏽👏🏽❤❤
Jason and Kansan killed me! Lateef tried to be respectful lol. while Chidi tried his best with his basmati rice& kept a positive attitude with everyone else’s dish. These men are solid 👌🏾
Kannaan cracks me up, all talk but can't throw down
Lmao “sorry to that man” 🤣🤣
They need their own channel reviewing any food other than their own, they’re hilarious! Jason is a born presenter 😂
I’m screaming at rice pudding jollof  💀💀💀🤣
I’m sorry but I find it extremely hard to believe that Kaanan is from Nigeria. I don’t know why but I just don’t buy it !!
Ohhh man this gone be good asf I love some jollof 🤣😂
Jason is always so positive
Jason sick 😭😭 turning up while everyone looking miserable, and always so nice about it until he tastes it 😂 hilarious
Jason😭
I shouldn't have watched this. I'm dealing with covid and so of course their faces while dish number 2 is in front of them just made me laughing and they me into a coughing rage..lol
Clearly this time Chidi was the one just happy to eat and rate all highly looool
🤣🤣🤣
“No control in this house” 💀
If you enjoy it in your house! You enjoy it in your house... 🤣
U know it ain't good when Jason said it ain't good Lol 😂
New title- Nigerian Queens try each other’s Jollof Rice. That one queen in the cardigan is doing the most. I see you sis.
I love how jasons the ony one with a spoon 😅
You know it’s bad when Jason doesn’t like it lol!
The editors for this episode are so childish 😂 That music during the opening and the crickets later on 😂😂
These men talk a lot.
The people who say you have to know how to cook a specific dish to find a mate are ridiculous, if your SO won’t eat anything else, leave.
The way Jason laughed at Kanaan’s rice😭😭
lol i wanna be jason’s friend he’s so funny
lmao as per usual, the one who be talkin all dat shiii…
This group is iconic💀😂
My boy chidi is one of them guys who can eat anything & he’s not complaining, true African man 😂
1Jason 2:5 You need to be able to cook jollof properly in order to find wife🤣🤣🤣
Ketch up inside jollof rice 🤢
Jason gives me lifeee
If Jason says you can't cook... Sir, you can't cook.  Rice pudding jollof 😭😭😭😭😭⚰️
Next time, they should be blindfolded! If they’re as critical without a blindfold, they’ll be EXTRA critical with it on!😉😉😉
”It’s orange…ah.” Lateef
Nah look at their faces  when Chidi’s rice landed 😂😂😂 then Jason siting there dancing only to end up saying “this brother can’t cook” 💀💀
Jason needs his own show lmao
PAUSE THE MINUTE MAN SAID ADD KETCHUP HE LOST ME NAHHH THATS GHANIAN JOLLOF 😭😭😭😭
We need more vids from this group of men😂❤😍
Golden Sella rice for excellent jollof every time. It’s a happy medium 🤞🏽
Jason is my favourite competitor in all the trying shows he's vibe is great lol but bring the group back for sure 💗
These lot are sooo picky 😭
Lateef “if you enjoy it in your house, you enjoy it in your house.” Lol
Walkers bbq crisp?!?! And my man said it’s his mum’s recipe 😂😂
Ketchup in Jollof rice, YOU ARE DONE. What kind of rubbish is that?
Congrats Jason!
I'm convinced Jason is happy as long as he can eat. You can tell he loves food. 🤣🤣🤣🤣 When he rejects a plate, you know it is really bad. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Need more Jason!! He is a vibeeeee
Anyone who marries Jason ain't got no problem at all.. He's not picky nor complains but kanaan is a handful, Lmao
Good morning people ☺️
1. Blindfold taste test  2. Make contestants TRY THEIR OWN FOOD 🤦‍♂️ I dont understand why you don't do that every single time .. 😮‍💨
Jason sees the plate: THIS IS IT!! This IS it!!!   Also Jason after trying the plate: This brother can’t cook.
Yess Jason! He needs to cook it properly if he wants a wife! Personally I like a man that will help me in the kitchen 💯👍🏽
Jason won...the earth is healing
Chidi was talking crap about Jason's chicken & all he got was a scrawly 4. Karma sure bit him real hard in the butt 🤣
Chidiiiiii why you embarrassing us Nigerians like this 😂
This was HILARIOUS,  I keep running 8:55 back🤣😂
I’m here for Jason😩😂. The guy is a whole vibe. And one thing he wont do is lie about your cooking. But idc basmati rice will never be accepted in being used for Jollof for me🥴
Lol Jason I love you abeg 😂😂😂
YAS JASON WON🥰😍😘
YAS JASON WON🥰😍😘
YAS JASON WON🥰😍😘
This was too funny😭
This was too funny😭
Do these guys not taste their own cooking? I am confused 😂
Ketchup? Gross!
How can one person say the rice is dry, and another say it’s mushy? They just hating at this point.
Chidi was so nice to everyone, too bad his jollof didn’t bang 💀😂
I like love these Nigerian men. They are oh so serious and honest about their food. Keep them coming!
"It's okay, they tried" is classic Nigerian way of saying it's good but don't want to admit it.
Interesting topic but PLEASE clean lens before shootings. Txs 😘
Omg 9:32 i can so relate wow this guy is funny
Chidi used Basmati which is forever at risk of getting soggy when making jollof. I am like him, wld rather basmati jollof than long grain.
Kansan’s….. mothers dish that taste like noodles…. Damn
I feel like if Jason doesn't like your food it really just isn't good cause he was too nice last video He said you can feed it to God though and he'll like it... not me though 😭 "Try Jesus, don't try me" -Jason probably
Jason is so funny could watch him for hours
I love Jason he never disappoints
Chidi steadily letting the Igbos down😂
Jason is so entertaining I love it lol
I think I need a zoom in of these plates so I can judge my self 😂
I haven't even watched the video yet but I know they bout to go IN 😭 I am not prepared
Jason is hilarious "how can you find a wife if you cant cook" 😭 i need a man who thinks like that. kanaan cnt cook but he seems to know how it should taste except for his own . i love wen they do that "ah" sound 😂 and jason usually likes everything wat happened 🤣
How do I apply to this show? I really want to do this 😂😂😂😂
Jason is just vibes🤣🤣😂😂 it's how he says "Sorry for that man" then dash the plate🤣🤣
It's official...Chidi has no taste! We need another man to rep for Igbos.
Love these videos 😂
Should do a Southern African men try each other's braai and pap... please🙏🏾😂... loved this!😂😂
Fun Fact: Jollof is actually from Senegal 🇸🇳
Jason just be so goddamn happy… I love himmmm. I want to hang with him.
Who raised these men o? 😂😂
Please get them to score their own.
all of them think that theirs is the best.... it was laughable how all of them reacted. 😂
Just WOW! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Jason dancing as if he’s loving the food on sight: I don’t like the looks of it. Looks dry😭
The looks to camera re Chidi's dish and they tore it to shreds! 😂😭 I just hope these guys don't start to get bitchy and judge disingenuously. Jason cracks me up
I love how 2 of them STARRED at the 2nd jollof rice😭😭😭pls-

This was funny 😄
OMG HE GOT A 4💀💀💀that’s embarrassing
Rice pudding jollof???💀💀💀💀
