Hey there, thank you for watching :) I've really missed making videos consistently so I'm very happy to be back. I'm sure this year has had so many ups and downs for all of you as well so I hope to share some positivity through these stories I've captured. This is the first one out of my trip and I've got plenty more coming your way. Let me know what you think in the comments and I'll see you again soon
How many slaves would I have to exploit for you to NOT come to my island? Is it 1 more than the Emirates or 1000 more?
Lives in Dubai for 3 yrs. I can say, they are amazing at building and planning their structures and the country is self sustainable
Absolutely Love everything you do, Seek Discomfort is something I've decided to do in my life, will be getting some of your merch when I can afford it to spread the love. Thank you for being amazing humans.
My project
This video is hypocrite af. Sad to find out yes theory has made a promotion gig like this to a very sad place on earth that does not give a s*** about human rights.
I come back to this video for comfort all the time
No comments on modern-day slavery that is practised here. The passports of construction workers are taken away, treating them like cattle. Here you are enjoying your trip on their blood money.
No women sending him off just kissy effeminate men *crinnnnge*
I love my progressive youtube channels... support BLM yet go to a country built by literal modern slaves.... awesome! also the process of making these islands was such an ecological disaster...
Hey man, love the video! I wanted to mention, though, that I think the music in your video compared to the actual audio is pretty loud, especially around 7:15. Might I suggest trying to equalize them a little better in the next video? Again, love your stuff, keep it up! 🤙🏻
Imagine being careful of your carbon footprint by using reusable cutlery and then witnessing ridiculousness like this of some multibillionaire building an entire set of islands with houses all over them and all of the carbon footprint it took to even bring it all over !
do you think they will move all the slaves the work to these pilles of sand
Remember – you are loved! Jesus loved you and gave his life so that you could be free because of Him! He died for our sins so that we can be reconnected with our Creator God. At His crucifixion Jesus took all our wrong thoughts words or deeds we ever did to the cross, paying for them. This is because our sins separated us from Him, and sin's punishment is death. While we could do nothing to get back to God, He sent His Son so that we could get back to Him. He rose again three days later proving His power over sin and death, and He is returning soon to bring all His believing children to Heaven when He returns, and let those who reject Him choose the only other destination (Hell).   He wants us to choose life. He gives us the choice to follow Him right now and have Heaven when He returns, and a true relationship with Him now. He wants us all to repent of our sins and receive a new life in Him!   A life of strength, faith, and the ability to truly love others as God has loved us. He wants us to follow Him, and let Him be the Lord of our lives. Why is that part important? Because through Christ we will be given the power to overcome sin in our lives today and to love like He does. Christ offers this blessing to all who choose to believe in Him, trust Him and follow Him xx He will never leave you nor forsake you xxx
Lowkey during the bare minimum for eco friendly updates on your brand
Buying one of these tiny islands, would be like throwing money in the garbage. We know sea levels are rising. So to keep your island above water, you'd have to keep adding more on top of it. Not to mention that if a big storm comes along, the island would be washed away.
If I was the government of Dubai, I would claim the entirety of the World islands, including the built area, then proceed to turn the islands into a eco system for birds. turtles and plants, turn them to a natural animal sanctuary, with plants and small animals....it would be amazing, then turn the built up area into a resort.....
Dumb islands.
Being on such an islet is nothing compared with being on a remote island in the middle of the ocean.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Do you realize, you never told us the name of the "Chairman"???
What’s with all the masks??
Watching Covid age videos now gives me ptsd
That's prefect plots for all landless refugees  And there would be another addition to island Little Paris in fulfillment of Isa.53:10,when messiah takes over as biggest builder
❤ we love 💕 your channel our friend 🎉❤ yes 🙌
Maybe Dubai needs to ‘seek discomfort’ with regards to LGBTQ+ issues. Yes Theory very rarely discuss this….if ever.
Lebanon Island is very much giving Fyre Festival vibes...
Hilarious!!! Nobody even mentions that nobody ever will go there if you go to prison for a year for touching an officers arm.
This looks like it'll be under water in my lifetime and looks like it would not survive a storm surge, much less anything larger.
I just started watching a few days ago and I've probably watched at least a dozen and I am hooked. I want to explore the world like yall ✌️&❤
This is the absolute worst most ignorant piece Yes Theory has done. Shame on you for this blatant segment of propaganda.
Incredible location and such creativity and imagination from the developers! Preliminary research says it should finally be complete in 2026 and I have added this to my bucket list. Thank you for sharing this with us!
How are these islands powered? fresh water? Sewage?
It's actually physically painful to listen to celebrities lecture you about human rights whilst promoting places with appalling human rights
Wtaf is he wearing a mask? Not as intelligent as you think!
Why?
An ecological nightmare. They should be demolished. You start your video saying you’re working at being more environmentally conscious and then cover this and while I haven’t finished the video it seems like you’re covering it positively. That’s disappointing. The palm islands or peninsulas or whatever are also not great.
I've heard of these islands and thought "classic billionaire stuff"  never thought to visit
Kind of crazy that the world islands falling apart currently emulates our actual world falling apart.
Insane 😵‍💫
Another Dubai sellout. Go figure.
Wow❤
what a waste of money and time :)
They ruined the sea environment and the ecosystem on the sea, and then they said they reduced carbon dioxide by recycling. Is this a joke?😂
Nobody appreciates when Dream City of Dubai earlier was only Desert, and now  made too many beautiful buildings in Dubai by the Respected Prime minister but when one project failed due to Shrinking land by natural way, public demotivation to Dubai Govt.  This is a real fact, that when you are growing in a good manner and way, the public appreciates you good qualities, but when one project fails due by natural theater, everybody criticizes, whenever Dubai Govt. bear losses of approximately US $ 13 billions, thereafter flats owner got his money return back.  This is the first time in history, when any Govt. returns his money to flats owner, that is a big question.  Dubai Govt. keep his faith honestly by returning his valuable money and bear losses himself. We all know that,  nobody can control natural things like floods, earthquakes, laws and sinking land underground.  Nature himself does many works without alarming anybody then he changes land and gives some good fruit, which nobody knows.  Bad time gives you a chance to get a good time after changing time. If we see and realise,  Why on earth, some areas are desert and some areas are more natural resources, because understanding titanium plates changes by natural, thereafter earthquakes come on land. Japan is the country, that bears too many earthquakes in money and nature  cannot help. The public never claims but even after the Japan Govt. immediately start work to clean his country. I like Japanese countries very much, because they work on time. His train is never a late one minute. If it's one minute late, all passengers get a certificate, which gives to his offices and even the Train Driver has given clarification to his head of the department.
Well done mofos, getting some free marketing for an abusive, corrupt state that as an add-on ruins the environment too.
I have a personal connection to these islands. In the middle of 00s I was a minor reality tv star in Sweden and a travel show that never happened planned to take me there to see which island would best suit another football star of this country - Zlatan
Weak!  Very, very weak!
It's so cool that in such an oil-rich country they are at the forefront of recyclable energy! Why don't we, in America, use desalination???🌻🌻🌻
Rich people doing what rich people do...wasting money on trivial things while the world burns around them.
Minute 5:06 seconds , people playing volleyball is Barcelo Palace Riviera Maya Mexico lol don’t know how you guys got that cut into Dubai clip 😂
Are you planning on going back and checking progress Thomas?
👍👌
Ever since I discovered what Dubai and all those oil rich cities/counties are I am fucking disgusted by anyone who willingly choose to visit those countries, disgusting
How are they powering all those properties?
I ve been in Dubai but wasnt convince than and now they wasted alot of money in such project   desert are nicest idea instead of dangerous mighty ocean
Nice propaganda bro
😂🎉❤
This is worse than a Johnny Harris video
A totally shameful video. It should be labelled, 'all that is wrong with the world.'
He is seriously worried about the environment? Beyond horrible.
What fool would want to live on those islands?
Seek discomfort?? Really?
now we know that this trip and vid is sponsored by Dubai and nakheel 😂
HOW AWESOME, I WISH I COULD’VE BEEN YR CAMERA GIRL, EVEN JUST CARRYING YR BAGS. WOW, I’M PRETTY ENVIOUS RIGHT ABOUT NOW.  HGREAT WORK DUDE. 🙂👍🏼 🇬🇧
Have you guys been to the island of Newfoundland Canada? If not then you should. The most friendliest people in all of Canada, if not in the entire world.
What a bunch of dickheads, advertising this environmental disaster.
Can’t get a ship or a boat close
Hate to be a little negative such a great channel but Dubai uses slave Labor and these islands are very bad for the environment.
i wonder what will happen if/when ocean levels rise
I wanted to to see u swimming between the islands
Now all of this is under water now ...what a waste of money it could have been used to help the none  citizen improve their life styles, to create better living conditions for the world that comes to think they will have a better life but instead their pretty much place themselves in a position of slavery in a sense... God will judge this selfish nation and mother nature will be the tool used to destroy everything they create until they contribute of saving humanity
What a terrible fluff piece on the Dubai fake Islands. I'm sure you had a blast but seriously no concern on the damage done to the environment, the spend on rich peeps villas versus greater good of UAE population, the abused migrant workers involved in much of the construction. Dude you are plugging a "ethical" clothing line WTF are you doing in this video? Just a wanabe playboy influencer uuuggghhhh.
I just watched the Tuvalu video... they were sinking while in dubai people destroyed marines habitat
weird af pro-Dubai propaganda
Disgraceful use of money for only the richest of rich. Needed to be used for the benefit of the total population.  Let's ruin the biodiversity til there is none. Guess they think that it is easy to BUY more. As I watch this, there is flooding in Dubai.
Gotta own one of those islands one day
can you do an update video pls
Fuck dubai
I'd convert them to mangroves.  They'll be ideal as fish-nurseries!
Get that island out the water  little fish have to deal with that nasty sand  did you move the fish out off the water know you people didn't
You never told us what the future holds for all the rest of the islands and the project
How much do ya wanna bet that "yes theory" will be exploring the abandoned "The Line" project in 2 or 3 years? Time stamp: March 24, 2024.
How come i have never heard of your channel before wtf this is awesome
If Survivor ever shoots a season here. Im in 😃
I usually love your guys' videos, but watching this knowing the conditions of the people working here as well as the environmental impact of this island project, this video leaves a SOUR taste in my mouth. 🫤
10:40 *the amount of air pollution is nauseating to look at* W/ the vehicular emissions, industrial + construction activity & dust storms; u can’t see the skyline 🤮
Disgusting
You are supporting a country built on slavery and still using slavery. You are supporting slavery.
... 👍
so a coincidence? I think whole trip was planned for the promotion of the hotel. Obviously a collab. Used to love your content :/
ad for slave owners
Sold your souls for this. I hope these decisions keep you awake at night
Matthew 7:26 "But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man 🤪who built his house on sand."  Matthew 7:27 "The rain 🌧came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash."
Hmm I'm glad you are enjoying the work of slaves and also the obliteration of an entire ecosystem. But hey at least you are making your merch more environmentally friendly!
I just love you guys. The future is in good hands.
Can UAE help out Yemen, Syria and their neighbouring brothers instead of wasting money doing ish like this? What happened to giving back to the ummah? SubhanaAllah this is incredibly disappointing
you are hypocrites to the first degree and noone likes you. have a bad day.
clearly has been payed to speak well of dubai and it's islands .
Amazingly cool ❤❤❤
This part of the world, specifically this country engages in human rights abuses and slavery. Just because they made you a guest at one of their islands and villa, doesnt change how horrible this country is. Some people can be easily bought and turn a blind eye, all the while remain blind to what ia going on around them. No apologies, I could not like this video or feel any happiness at all, knowing what is really going in this country.
You guys are doing amazing things!! Thank you so much for the GREAT content!
Boredom, lots of money, low iq and huge ego, such a bad combination.
12:34 I think my ancestors the Mexica beg to differ - Tenochitlan was built up by hand and it sustained us, unlike this blight that isn’t being used apart from “look what I can do!”
Vacuous
Nice jolly for free, banging on about how you want to be environmental whilst not pushing any difficult questions forwards regarding the wholly environmentally and ethically unfriendly construction of these islands. You lost a lot of respect from me for this video. You're a charlatan.
How are they powered?
Yeah you know something like the screwdriver thing happen, from the looks on their faces.
I just came here because of exposing whats happening there
After years of Frankfurter jokes, I'm not afraid to call people from Banan Island Bananas.
If you say you're going to be "environmentally correct," you need to learn to travel differently and not be another "life of the rich and famous," such as in this video. Your original videos were all about learning about the people, this couldn't be further from that.
I LOVE that developer dude! I could listen to him talk all day!
Bunch of grifters
as an arab fuck the emirati government and fuck the saudi government and shame on yes theory for always trying to preach against wrongdoings in the world like during BLM and being against slavery in the usa then condone a fake muslim nation like this and spread propaganda over these terrible, environmental disasters that have completely flopped just because you got paid off by some rich political oil emirati who probably has stocks in bin laden's family construction company that built 85% of the ugly ass buildings in dubai that is owned by the saudi prince and hires, underpays, and jails foreign workers by abusing them as using them as literal slaves, then taking their visas and passports so they cant leave, and in the meantime probably have 10 dubai porta potties (search up what that is but be warned).   im a fan kinda but shame on you yes theory for being like every other influencer and being extremely hypocritical
You should interview the low wage workers to see how awesome it is! Unless you're paid by the UAE of course !!! SHILLS
One would think that the people who literally live in a desert would know how volatile sand is can't stay in the sea forever
You are a sellout shill for a country who uses slaves
Why anyone supports this baffles me
The pure irony and lack of self awareness of Yes Theory amazes me. Claiming to support BLM, and then promoting the UAE which engages in slavery, of Nepalese and other immigrant groups and corruption on a daily basis. SHAME ON YOU
You're so concerned with environmental impact that you're producing useless plastic bracelets to ship out lmao
Maybe don’t promote a place built by slave labor.
2:59 WoW they even sell recycle product to protect the environment while inviting by the one who destroy the environment, I guess that equals it out. 😂
Yikes.
Er maybe cause it’s just wrong and destroys ecosystems?
Dubai Propaganda
my god how backwards and liberal are these guys? "positivity, love everyone, save the world, dont use oil." but yet they support islam every other video. the people who drill the most oil in the world. and the people that literally kill you if youre gay. dont believe me? well i got tons of footage for you. ( some recorded by myself when i was overseas. id never go to a middle eastern country again they love killing) also they want to kill everyone who isnt islam. if they cant convert you theyll kill you. and if you still dont believe, then go to the book store. buy a quran. and read it. its totally a peaceful religion 👍
Wow, you been used on this one
modern day slavery All Lives Matter
If it’s literally just sand—not any solid volcanic rock—then how is that foundation not going to crack and the Island disappear in x years?
One would think someone so concerned with the environment would know the impact a project like this has on it
this is such a money-grab jesus christ
This is a disgrace...
This is the worlds most expensive flooded sandbox.
This is just Dubai Propaganda
Humans who make homes in the sea can on Mars
Music's getting annoying thomas, this is for youtube, not for television
slavery
Despicable sell-outs. You should be ashamed.
how hypocritical to talk about being environmentally friendly and then going to dubai to some artificial islands thst destroyed the whole marina life. in a city that is built by literals slaves.
Respect for Yes Theory just went📉📉📉
paid shills
You lot should be up to 50 million subs by now! Very soon boys very very soon ❤
They preach environmentally friendly when it’s convenient and easy, but flash some dollar signs and a free vacation and suddenly they don’t care about the marine life destroyed from getting sand from the sea bed to build these islands . No one will openly say they support sl@v3ry, but they’ll absolutely promote a city built off the backs of unpaid immigrants with no passport, leaving them stranded and homeless in Dubai, continents away from their homes. Greed is a crazy disease.
Going out your comfort zone requires you to (1) suck on the titty of a rich dubai zaddy, (2) not pay attention to any human rights issues (3)  Flying over to dubai and enjoy wealth that has been sponsored by climate change.
y'all should be ashamed for this
Hypocrisy Theory, oh how Dubai claims to be the land of the free! Slavery doesn't exist in Dubai, they say, while their gleaming skyscrapers cast shadows over a hidden reality. How wonderful that you're graciously paying for carbon compensation for your flights, all while promoting this travesty of man-made environmental destruction! The irony is almost too much to bear.
You were just exposed by Geopold lmao
Virtue signals until he's offered  money from a country using slaves and destroying the environment
you should be ashamed of yourselves.   It's all about the money, isn't it?
so yes theory became UAE propaganda now. Enjoy that oil money, Don't ever think or speak about 6 months unpaid migrant worker from Nepal and Bangladesh or Pakistan in there okey? ;)
ahaha  belle propagande les mecs . il devait être bien gras le cheque j'espere ?
Disgusting.
Those island including the palm island, are made by Two Dutch companies, called. Van Oord, and Boskalis
How much money you took for this? Why you dont meation nepalese slaves who didnt got payed for half a year and got taken their documents, then their protest results in 4months of prison.. nice goverment you promoting..seek discofrot lol
big respect to him. He is very rich and he dont act like he is a god he just talking to you like a normal thing. massive respect
Not to build a character ,  Then love won't be real when u receive it. And love is the only thing that is worth being with.  Or else u'll be just like everyone else and copy the earth And make a copy agsin And just be a grain of sand.... And be so unloved just like a drop of sand not even a liquid drop of water.   They don't look happy at all.  That's why everyone looks the same. Trying look to be someone else. Have idols or role models.   Thet think they have 2 work for worth maybe  And it's not true and it is competition and evil so they don't look right.   Or maybe ppl who don't see their worth created those ppl in their minds, who took their keys of worth and created ant mounds.  Ain't nothing.   If u don't kno your worth u'll fall for anything.....
A waste of money... in a few years the islands will start sinking.. Happens with all man-made islands.
Sad knowing that they destroyed many reefs just to have those failed investments.
They’re waiting to use them during the apocalypse lol
Dubai built by slaves.. Its 90f in winter I'm sure it'll be unbearable in 20 years and sea rise bye bye sand islands
I know you went here a couple of years ago but you maybe watch a docu movie called 'Sand Wars', it will explain everything and probably the truth as to why they never built on all the man made islands off the coast in Dubai.
Great video thanks for marking/sharing it. Very surreal to see how many are still empty but I am sure they will finish them.
Love your humbleness great watch!
This whole Dubai story just feels like a bunch o rich arabs who just start things without having any idea what they're doing... There's such a huge lack of style and taste there... Dubai just keeps on being a sad story...
they created the most expensive  environmental mistake ...
Ever need a 50 year old as a part of your team... here I am. I've traveled and used to be a Yes sort of guy in my 20s and 30s then marriage and kids so now I want to be more.
The dutch tried and did way before this haha. Lelystad
This is absolutely fascinating. I live in Dubai.
❤❤❤❤❤
And mostly done with slave labour @o)
pool == livable
Its a giant Theme park. All fake. Not a real place.
You're literally doing the things I've dreamed of 😭😭
The people that built those islands are not on the Forbes Richest list. THIS IS FU MONEY!
How dare you hawk supposed environmentally friendly products yet ignore the fact that these islands and indeed all the other reclaimation projects have absolutely decimated the marine ecology in the area. Even the use of the name reclaimation is incorrect, these slands always belonged to the sea
Thomas living the best day of his life. well done . good pick.
On Social media after I saw so many people were attacked  and eaten by shark  , now am not a fan of beach and oceans
Who wants  to live with  the sharks
disappointing. thought i’d come here to see what kind of impact making these islands had on the environment or maybe what it was like for the construction workers that built this.  you guys are so fake
Paying an influencer is also corruption
Gyro is one of those weird words. Do you pronounce it as ji-ro (The way I think it's pronounced), but I have heard guy-ro.
وتكون للعراقييين والعرب حصرا ....مانريد فجور وفاجرات الغرب
نشتريها من حاكم دبي وين الكاظمي 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
نشتري جزر بدبي نبنيها منتجعات ومن الخليج بواخر السياح تروح هناك تابع للعراق اتصير ايراداتها ......مانحتاج اراضي إيران همه باكونه ماينطونه مقاطعه خضراء ....هذي الجزر كلها معروضة للبيع نسوي مالديف عراقي للشباب ....رجعنه اخوان ويه العرب
Propaganda
Very environmentally destructive.  Built with slave labor.  Not cool for you to celebrate it.
Incredible!
my guess is that they're going to be really empty when sea levels rise and engulf these little mounds of sand.
🤧🤧🤧😤😤🙈
👏🏻👏🏻
Dubai, is super wack now..
imagine meeting =the developer of the palm and the world island wow so amazing
If America did this, everyone would be glazing it. but because it's arabs doing it the racism starts spewing out of people.
Those islands dont even look like world. Just weird shape to me.
It’s empty because some douch with a lot of money throws it at things in the hope that something will stick.
Unnecessary
So I say no to Dubai 👎👎👎
I hate Dubai luxurious life ... all kinds of fakes there
Sometimes im amazed by the west hypocrisy yess reclamation is not good for the environment and if country like dubai doing it than its always, “how dare this country try to ruin the environment “but when netherlands doing it then they say “what a good innovations it is”
It's okay, it will not going anywhere, one day will fill up real estate and resorts and attractions
Where does the sewage go
The MOST INTERESTING thing about this video piece, is YOU. You are fun to look at! (The Dubai World Island project is WASTEFUL, EXCESSIVE, EXCLUSIONARY, UNNECESSARY, and IRRESPONSIBLE.
Wow. This is beautiful
لع\ن الله حكومة ال سلول العا£هر£ات عشاق الژ@ب
Love your content, please don't ever stop
I watched and enjoyed this video a few days ago, and enjoyed it very much.  I found myself looking up additional information on the subject, and viewed online many of the available accomodations in Dubai.  I've always been intrigued by the destination, and the World Islands in particular, wondering how they turned out.    Great video, I ended up in a Chat session with a representative at a residential site eventually, however I explained that I was "only looking", but that I had gotten the idea from Yes Theory, in case they were aware of your visit.  Great channel,  I've been following for a while now, learned about Yes Theory from another YouTuber, Xiaomanyc.  Terrific addition to my channel list.
Rust minicoptrr
Scam Theory strokes the chairman's dream. Beyond imagination.
Terrible idea even without global climate change. It will never be completed. Dubai is a sad joke. Everyone has their price as you know.
you guys need to come to rural Ireland <3
Hmmmm sorry it ain’t going to survive a bad storm from wind to water serges it’s going to be a mess and a lot of lives lost bad idea
AMAZING as usual !
Seek Discomfort! i like it! Wokies might not though
Its not difficult to build there at all.....because they have dirty money and tonnes of slave labour.
"No one has ever developed islands like this" The Dutch: Bruh.
Imagine when they finish all the island and a bunch of boats will travel around it with a good view and ppl. With boat party 🎉 especially at night with them lights around the island maybe some fireworks
There’s literally a Bible verse about not building your house on sand lol. Idk how this actually got to this point.
I love how the chef took a gamble on what an American would like to eat. And won.
Tom Scott's a million times better than yes theory... 13 minutes of his face and no context. This is meant to be educational stop highlighting your face. I don't care.
🤑🤢🤮
It’s not even islands, it’s just little sand patches dotted around that I imagine they sell for millions.  One big materialistic place.
OK Ill buy them all but, what it can it be used for? its climate and nature are too hot compared to maldives or other pacific/SE asian island🤔
Western human madness in its highest form - hopefully the sea will reclaim this insanity sooner rather than later
❤And meanwhile in Africa 😮 If you dig a wee deeper, you’ll see the truth behind the slaves that build places like this , mostly “ people from India “ who’ve been tricked into a dream that they can make money too send home, only to find , they are trapped there ( passports kept so stuck , it’s slave labour taking advantage of the most poorest people on earth. Sad 😔Cruel
Surprising lack of self awareness...
Beautiful
Just woke up on my day off! Now staying in bed and watch the whole day YES THEORY… life can’t be better!!! Greetz from Amsterdam XXX
I would love to be able to buy one of the islands, build a home there, and chill out the rest of my life.
Build it they will come -Bill and Ted
Not empty any more
Cuh didnt even realize he made history they bouta talk about his goofy ass 50 years from now. Dope
Where does all the sewage go??
It's as if a person with borderline created Dubai. There was no control of impulsion with the idea, and now the palm island is left completely unfinished with so many sky scrapers and tourist attractions on hold just like that, including a decent sewage system. It's a big red flag how the world islands and the other palm island are abandoned as well.
See, only private individuals can solve real world problems. NOT GOVERNMENT!
The dubai skyline in the backround looks fucking unreal
glorifying the demolition of marine environments ... YES YES YES...
Didn’t they steal the sand from Indonesia?
Any update on this Shit-Hole
U're so lucky to meet the owner and to stay at that villa alone in that island
They never mentioned how the sewer works on the islands wonder why ?
Cool
4:10 my man got the rust helicopter
12:35 this dude has not seen the netherlands. Even the palm islands were built by the dutch.
jättebra reklam
This video give me simcity vibes.
Why is everyone getting political. Yes theory is a channel about adventure and seeking discomfort and Going places you didnt think youd go before, its not some political bullshit Left or right wing channel that you can come to the comment section to just blow up about the places work etc. every place is different, every country has its own work laws and labor laws, BACK before civilization Adults and children all worked to survive, its pretty much the same thing just not hunting animals that could kill you in any second.
The Waffle House has found its new host
How did you manage to use the drone there?
I'm just coming across this video but aint your the same guys who found the hidden pyramid? I love that video  I'm subscribing now like your channel
I feel so bad for Ammar he didnt even get a goodbye hi five 1:18
I love how the Chairman lives. To be self sustaining and produce no waste but more fuel for other projects. I often travel alone but do not think a women can have the same doors open as a man.
💚
This is really impressive
why is grass shipped out? would that not make good compost
Well, my first disappointing Yes Theory. There is so much wrong with this idiotic place that you shouldn't have accepted this marketing job - makes the "greening" of your merch appear cynical as well
Stfu about your carbon footprint print as you fly on jets all around th3 world
Why Dubai's $12 Billion Dollar Islands are Sinking
yes as the others are sinking lol
look up dubi scammers on youtube
dubi scam city underground
it was one big scam lolol this was talked about few years ago
A lot of BS. 2 years later and most of the islands are still empty. it is an ecological catastrophy and since this video was posted you can learn all about how every of these projects failed. there's no demand. all they did was wasting money and destroy the environment
Dubai looks nice but it always seem to look empty there like it’s one of those good vacation spot during slow seasons.
Getting out of your comfort zone and he’s a masker! Idiot.!
Oh my god he’s a masker! Shame on you!
Great Ad.  What else will you do for money?  Seek Discomfort....Wow.  Did you ask old mate what happens to the shit from the toilets or did your "Discomfort Contract" not allow you.  And yes, they probably get some poor prick to swim back to get the screwdriver (send 4 so chances are one will make it without dying).
thank You!! WOW
I just saw you say you’re going to the airport and here I am seeing you at the airport…thats crazy! lol
All I can say Sad World we live in.
Dubai it’s self is a manmade island
friendly reminder that Dubai is a slave state and that this video supports slave labor.
Clearly their smart enough not to buy into the man made global warming pseudoscience or drastic sea level increases however at maybe 1 ft above sea level not real bright. It will have a front row seat at the 500+ ft tsunami when the polar flip occurs in approx 20 yrs or so!
i wanted to make my own country. and the hope and the solution of most of my problems doing that was been solved. these people gave the answers the i was need. they gave me a huge wave of hope. now i will manage to get more money so i can build my own islands
Ironic that u guys visited a place that was only made possible by destroying coral reefs and using slave labor and u guys did that environmentally conscious thing in the beginning, rlly like this channel please do more research before u propagate like this again
That man is a genius!!!!
So cool
Incredible! I understand that they were building a medical city.  I wanted to live there in 2008. They're very progressive.  Speaking of, you'll probably be very interested in the wall they're creating in Saudi. Love your vids & the connections made.
i have watched all of your videos so far, but this is such a bullshit
Never build on sand lol
the Netherlands did it firsth...
what if a big wave comes
It's been a total financial mistake
So his waste expense is minimized because it's put into construction of projects? Sounds ideal except the project will only add to the waste expense and you'll have to constantly find a new project.
A lot of environmentalist types spitting hate about these islands. I guess it's difficult recruiting new members to the church of climate change with people consistently providing evidence such as this that the oceans are not rising, the world is not ending and everything is fine.
its just a bunch of sand tho innit
Oi mate no swimming after eating
Damn !!! By far my most favourite YouTube channel is Yes theory , i Just Love this Island soooooo much , i wanna visit that Island 🏝️ once and make vlog so much of memories and nature 🤍🤍🇨🇵💕💕🔥🔥🔥🔥
The islands are for sale, who wants to buy one for 80 million AED? 🎉
unfortunately in building all that extra coastline they removed the sea turtle's egg laying beach.  Just by creating Dubai's island alone they upset the whole ecology of these turtles, so they're not that much working for ir with the environment. Same as for all that sand needed for the creation of all these islands..
These islands are slowly sinking and the sand that was dredged up is being taken back by the ocean. Only a fool builds his house on sand. We need to be building sustainable floating cities  for the future not faux-paradises for the over-rich.
Empty? What's anyone supposed to do on a pile of sand in the middle of nowhere?
I didn't dream of a private island when I was a kid. I dreamed of having a house and a dog. Haha
a stupid name for a clothing style. mightve well have named it zero hogs or blue U or maybe just a pic of a cartoon hand with the word JOB following the hand !
our state of Maine does BIG RECYCLING. i heard that not all states recycle. how does that happen or not happen in this day and age?
The islands, the water, the atmosphere.....it's lifeless and eerie.
Hey Muslims,   read the Bible!  You DONT build houses on top of SAND!!!
Maybe you should go on a sailboat to different places so you don't leave so much of a carbon footprint every time you travel, you say how into the environment you are and how environmental friendly and whatnot, but at the same time you fly in a fuel operated machine more than the average person does. Surely, that can't be good for the environment my friend?
The Dubai Sheikhs are disgraceful. If they'd be better helping poor starving children instead of wasting £15 Billion on a vanity project..
i love how UAE doesn't even finish the plan but just start projects. How the hell could they start construction if they don't even know how island will get water and electricity.
No Jews allowed. Yes, Muslims hate the Jews and do not want them in their territory, yet Jews allow them in their land. Muslims will kill Jews who enter Islamic middle-eastern lands. Jesus Christ, the thrill of hope, for a sick, hurting and weary world—Romans 10:9-10 from the Bible: “That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart man believes to righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made to salvation.”
Also seek discomfort richest bs I've ever heard js and I grew up in the Hamptons. Smfh
Wow this is amazing!!!!!
Ironic how you start the video stating YT is starting to be environmentally conscious, then the first place you visit is Dubai's Islands which are an environmental / ecological disaster in their creation.
What about the human waste?
I would’ve been the first person to have a wank on the island 😂
Need solar factories on some of the islands to make solar panels
This is environmentally friendly
It is a horrible place. Any natural place in south east asia or caribean its 1000 times better
Nature destruction for wealthy, so beautiful dystopian islands on poor people bones. Nice
Now we know that migrants died to make that :(
Sponsored video by Dubai.. bad choice Yes Theory
Aww the city that slaves built with their bloody worn down stumps for hands
Funny how, for the last 12 years,  "rising sea levels” caused by all the “melting ice” didn’t manage to submerge artificial islands that are just 10 inches above the sea level. Even more funny how ultra rich people keep investing in projects like this without being concerned about losing their money because of "climate change".
Empty and SINKING
Reminded me of the Fyre festival where they couldn't work out how to add sewerage system and all of that lol.
Wow I want my son to go work for this guy. It’s going to college next year for physics and engineering. This guy is brilliant
If that's the view of the world from the sky then the earth is flat...
Aruba also desalinates their water for the entire island. It’s an amazing process. Best tasting water from tap I’ve had.  California should consider it.
Great video
;;;;;;;;;;               2 Esdras2: 31-100    ''''''''''''''''''''''''''      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Dubai is a shithole
was herpes part of seeking discomfort? I was just curious during the pitch
World class travel
I knew u was going to meet some good people ❤
The answer is simple: sharks.
amazing! - what recession/global crisis are people talking about.........
Advertisment for rich developers and nature destruction. Congrats.
A desaster for nature.
Useless flights are not environmental friendly.
Lol
I'm guna orgainise the worlds biggest music festival here. Brb lol
I mean its just a big vulgar sand pit in the desert that hates human rights. Why even visit there??
Awesome
Idiots what a waste of money and resources they couldn’t find a better way to waste the money smh 🤦‍♂️
Awesome! You’re a great host 👍
Typical vapid Youtuber influencer crap. I admire the chairman's sense of development and design but that's the only interesting thing. The ironic thing is that those islands will be underwater thanks to the climate change they helped create.
2008 Obama FUUUUK the World now we have Joe Obiden he Really FUUUUK the World Up Bad  Demoncrats you are all Idiots / POS Losers
An extraordinary project.  If I could get to the area, I would be interested in the horse culture and archaeology. I wonder what kind of art scene they have?
Good thing sea levels are not climbing with these sort of developments. I am sure the planners must be taking all these things in to account so they can't possibly be. Looking at the elevations of the Saudi Kingdom Tower it looks like that will have its footings in the ocean soon if they do rise. I must say I would not really move in to any settlement less than 30 feet above current sea levels if I expected to live anywhere for 15 years or more and not have to write it off.   These places look like they will need a lot more sand if things go beyond the most optimistic projections. That is if anyone is actually looking more than 5 years ahead which is the normal corporate event horizon cut off time. Head in the clouds, feet in the Ocean seems to be the current outcome for much city planning.
They don't seem too concerned about rising sea levels🤔
Dude your videos are pretty awesome. It’s what most of us poor folk wish we could do but at least   we can see it through your eyes. You do a great job of making it very watchable. ✌🏻
And people wonder why the sea levels are rising. Land reclamation is never talked about.
those blokes solve problem after creating. they can't find out what to do with so much money.
Dubai is like that photo of homer posing for marge but behind him all his fat is tied up
The idea of having your own island is that you have no neighbours, what is the point if you are going to have neighbours that will call the police on you for noise if you try to throw a party? Not to mention that they are sand, it's just a matter of time untill the sea takes it again...
Amazing man. Wish the best for there project
Another great video!
Don't ever invest in anything in Dubai!
Bamboo house?? But what about the  pandas???
The islands are manmade with no culture or anything of interest.   Any natural sea life would have been dredged to build the Islands.
Hi can you please help tuvalu to rebuild there country much love🥰✌🇵🇭
Dubai.. a throw as much glitter and glam as you can sandy shitehole.
Really sad to see someone promoting this  environmental destruction and especially laughable at the beginning that you talk about being conscious about environmental impact. Horrible content
Someone isn’t worried about sea rise.
looks like the biggest flop known to humans
Dubai is just a huge mall in the desert only held up by that good ol' oil money. That and the literal slaves from poorer parts of the world, that they lure with dreams of a better life only to confiscate their pass ports and force them into crap labor jobs for pennies. Forever to be second class citizens unable to leave the country.
when the airport guy said " are you  Yes Theory" tat got my submission ;)
You guys keep glossing over the dark side behind everything you see. You make every place seem wonderful in your videos, but it completely lacks the depth of critical analysis. I would really appreciate an unbiased and well-rounded perspective. These islands are an environmental disaster, not to mention likely built on the backs of modern-day slaves. For anyone interested in knowing more watch "Dubai Is A Parody Of The 21st Century" by Adam Something here on YouTube.
Obviously don't believe in global warming then 🙄
A pristine manicured place no matter how stunning is nothing without culture and people doing their thing. It is not Portofino nor a village in the alps nor Hallstatt. It’s just a place with no heartbeat.
Are they sinking, is it because it’s so hot there, perhaps since the water is just that, water with no coral, no fish. Nah, I know, it’s because you need a boat to load and unload groceries, to go out in the evenings and then circumnavigate the islands to bet back must be a real pain for the wife when husband is not around despite water taxis. Living on an island is nice on a weekend only.
Love how they use everything and compost so much  .A really remarkable enterprise
Huge Yes theory miss. Very tone deaf.
Why so many gays?
I love how you just glossed over the part where he says they “just desalinate the water”. And then you act like this is some ecologically friendly bioreserve.   Like either this random developer dude just solved all global droughts forever  OR  He’s doing something that is massively wasteful.   Newsflash: it’s the second one. Desalination requires a huge amount of energy. Also you think that just building a massive set of islands locked in by rocks is good for the marine ecosystem there?   You should rename your channel “travel prostitution” because it’s pretty much just showing that you’ll do & say say anything for a free flight.
Forward thinking, totally Ecological, perfect way to holiday on a Private Island, off the coast of Dubai. Brilliant
FYI: NOW ITS OFFICIALLY ABANDONED!
bruh dubai just a minecraft server wtf
Nothing dumber than building on sandbars with rising sea levels. Ask Floridians how they feel in Ian's aftermath
Please add bigger sizes to your selection.  I am a 3XL and would love to wear, represent and support your brand.  Thank you.
One day I will buy one of those  islands  My daughter is a  Computer engineer
Looks like yet another world map that leaves out New Zealand. It's okay we're used to it.
Blessings of my invitation? Will arrive? When?
When lies appears as Truth u can only say my last words u will remember. Dude bye;) 🇺🇸 presidential seal 🦭 island 🏝 will will will live never hear dude bye 👋🏼 😘 ✌🏼
12:32 the Dutch would like to have a talk
Dam they got robbbed😂😂😂 scam
15:25 Mannn oh mannn I envy that night of sleep you had lol
...the Follies of Man...
Hello guys at yes theory I would like to start a cleaning the streets charity to help clean up the streets of the Bronx area and would like to hire the disenfranchised teens in my community,  how can I get funding and support to start the process...thank you for your time and  advice
Amazing 🤩
arabian countries just adore white people no wonder he is treated so special.. if he would have been Asian or African, he would have been treated differently. Thanks God i left UAE.. i was never happy there (8 years)
Go to swag like ohio
I love this show, it makes me ambitious for some day
Nice
It's easy when you've got infinite money to build whatever you want. But what about the slaves who actually build that stuff with their hands?
One of the island name is swag like Ohio not joking
Seek discomfort. .. You and I have very different definitions of 'discomfort '.
Is there no storms there don't they get flooded?
Greed and it's Environmental Impact deserves failures such as this.  Who in their right mind wants to be living on that level of water...Nature is not to be trifled with.  Madness to try to stay or live on little 'Islands' like that.  Not to mention some of those building the islands didn't think about how they would get water...water water everywhere and not a drop to drink.  Can't deny Man's determination to go where others have not...but sometimes there's a reason.
That developer is amazing!!!
Gyrocopter, Pronounced  Je, Je,  Jyrocopter. Our neighbor has one. Flies it out of his cow pasture. 😁😁😁 You should see the cows run!!
Built with slave labor, you didn't bother to mention that smh A real journalist is not a coward or a shill.
“Seeking discomfort…..” luxury travel, luxury cars, living in LA…….where’s the discomfort? What am I missing…or is this irony? Great video though
These man made lands are not stable, they sink a little each year.
Now, I came a year late but hear me out. Did you feel like Jason Brody (from Far Cry 3) at any point while being on the Island?
how did you fail to seek discomfort this hard . it's easy. Come to Красноя́рск in winter.
congratulations!!! awesome!!!
When are you going to do the story of how the ex-wife of the ruler of Dubai had to flee for her life 2 years ago?
Looking at this idiotic monstrosity I can now see the upside for sea level rise.
Why does the clock break when it gets hungry?   It goes back four seconds.
They look beautiful, I really enjoyed listening to the chairman and all that he's done. I love it
Dubai is an abomination built on and maintained on slavery. Not too mention the disgusting wealth. Yuk - hate it
Nice video but starting it off with preaching about being environmentally aware "on the merch you sell." When really if you did not sell Merch, then that would be 100% better for the world than just rebranding/packaging/materials. Then go into a video how you don't seem to give a toss about carbon footprint, is not really cool and pretty condescending on the audience .  Just be honest and you're really just saying that to try and sell merch
Why are they empty? Because it’s a stupid idea and nobody wants to live there.  Just like Neom it’s a complete joke.
so muts shoreline still doing nothing in this country why build a nature disaster :(
Would love to see you guys do something regarding the water in a first Nations community here in Canada I haven’t drink clean water on my reservation for 30 years
not really the best place to go if you want to promote your merch with natural friendliness and ethnic production, so much marine wildlife destroyed and workers rights abused. Sure it looks cool but this seems so much more like a promotional videos than any other travel locations you guys did
Environmentally aware? Mate you're flying business class! FFS.
Thanks for this
This is insane
Yes theroy :"our sponsor today is seek discomfort because we all need to get out of our comfort zone"   Also yes theroy: "this is the most luxurious thing ever"
way to ignore all the forced labor and environmental impacts these "islands" has made. this videos looks like a washed up ad of plastic trash. unsubscribed.
So interesting to have a pool right next to the ocean. Like I currently live less than 5 miles from the Pacific Ocean and I prefer my neighborhood pool, but that’s still 5 miles, not 5 steps. Lol 😅
One of the dumbest projects I've seen, no common sense used
Dubai is a fascinating conceit.
Seems like a lot of dudes blowing kisses at each other.
i think all have one island for personal project so wow
bisex geng partner
For anyone that doesn't know there is slavery and indentured servitude in Dubai. Disgusting country that needs to fall.
Hey what was the temperature like
Wow I want to vacation there
Nice
its literally Elysium
if the water level goes up and this will happen its unstoppable all these islands will become unusable and all the people who have poured money into them will lose their investment and they will not be helped by the government because they  already know this and the knew this when they where making them this was just a way for the country to create income
No Russian or Ukrainian oligarch investors ??
These Islands didn’t exist 15 years ago, according to climate change experts those Islands won’t exist 15 years from now either.
Organic , hey.   but how much energy was used to build out there islands
Not surprised New Zealand wasn't included in this map
what a surprise building this  got cancelled  like many other dubais plans. i think they have more money then sense
Couldn't have done less with so much effort,waste.
Where exactly is the discomfort here? I'll take some off that!
The ocean is rising the ocean is rising. LMAO, then why build these islands if it is.
Good job 👍
I love it! Wow what an awesome project
Arabs really know how to waste money that's for sure
the fukn mask lmao
Why he travel alone ?
Dubai is just somewhere a lot of idiots with money live.. they arent smart and they like to waste it.
"we've worked so hard on the designs" and the designs being a sweater or shirt that says seek discomfort with 3 lightning symbols somewhere else. i think It is very complicated too. but fr tho i want one ngl
The way the media talks today, Sea level rise and global warming will swamp these islands soon anyway..
Think this is one of those vanity projects that will end in a failure.
A year on I’d love a follow up video to see what it’s like now!
seek discomfort --> get catered to in the most luxurious way possible......
more time with the chairman
UAE treats their city as if they were playing sim city with unlimited resources.
"Nobody ever built or reclaimed islands ... Nobody even tried" ???  The Netherlands is master in Land reclamation.  In 1609 the Netherlands already started reclaiming land.  in matter fact, a Dutch (Netherlands) company got the contract to build these islands in Dubai 😆 And than say Nobody even tried??? 😂🤣 17% of the land is reclaimed in the Netherlands. But even China reclaimed much land.
This is everything the Fyre festively wanted but never had 😅
unreal video! loving it!
Tell me again about global warming? 🖕🫠🖕
It’s a solid gold dingy.. with a patina
When you click to know the answer but in reality you have to watch so much crap at start to get what you want.
Maybe because they are sinking?????
Dubai is like a bad parody of the 21st century
Funny how people are talking about how building these islands negatively affected marine wildlife but they probably eat fish and land animals >.>
I am glad you made it out of there alive. You could not pay me to go to Dubai, especially as a woman.
Matthew  7:26-27 , "The foolish man built his house upon the sand...
lots of very edgy cool new technology, but i'd rather see some actual evidence. hes telling you about desalination and other green initiatives, but did you see any of it?
You could live in a kame house and have neighbors.
taking a look at $13B empty islands dont seem to discomforting just kinda fun tbh js
Looks super dystopian.
Prime example of more money than brains
Come up to Vancouver Island I'll take you guys on some wild mountain adventures. I've filmed over 70 of them at this point, I know all the best spots.
My wealthy neighbour bought one of these islands as part of a syndicate. Went bust shortly after predictably enough!
Fuk Dubai, lol.   That emirate is nothing but a house of cards.
You never realy know what the place is like until you actualy visit... Thats the nr1 thing i learned from traveling.  So judging anything from what you have seen on tv just doesnt work...  People make things up for show. You cant feel how the people are from a picture... And you dont get the true scale from a picture... I personaly i think that pictures doesnt realy sell what you can see in Italy for example. Seeing it in life, the scale of it, it kind of just rings the the bell, ok thats why it is so well known...   And so on... So travel! :)
Great, you ruined your coastline to make some islands that are still mostly empty and unused.
Sewage?
This was a disappointing one
I just hate dubai, those islands are a environmental disaster.
Disclaimer: No Emirati Arabs were hurt in the making of these Islands. Just their deep pockets got a bit emptier. Just like the rest of Dubai, it was designed by Europeans and American engineers and built by the bare hands of Sri Lankans, Indians and poorer citizens of other nations.
but we don't want to invest in green energy while Saudi's build organic cities.
The Chairman: "Nobody ever built or reclaimed islands the way we did" China: "hold my chopsticks"
Been there when they first started.   Islands were empty and we would take the boats to jump in the beaches.  Good times but too bad they treat workers like slaves…you forgot to mention that Sadly.
Hoeveel zonnebrillen passen er in jullie scherm🥳🥳🥳🥳

Never thought about what small secluded islands do with their trash.
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
why you alone in dubai my friend ?
Send them engineer's to to the US so we they can show us how to Patch potholes, and fix bridges.
Yes theory : Visiting beautiful places and showing different culture.. At the same time   Me watching YouTube videos from corner of my room.. 🙁🙁
Are they done now? What are the hotell called?
What an amazing experience and that Gyrocopter was part terrifying, and part mindblowing! Seek Discomort to the enth.
Never cut your hair Thomas, it suits you so well 😘
I have so many issues with this video and it's subject.  Isn't Yes Theory now all environmentally conscious? Yet this video was the most blatant greenwashing on YouTube. Not a peep from them.  A good journalist would have called out that developer for destroying the marine environment.
I don't see any beauty in that at all.  The developer essentially went with a gimmick with no regard to environmental concerns. It's time to dismantle those fake sand mounds and restore the sea.
“Looks livable to me, look! There’s a pool.”
I wonder do they construct these islands in a deep ocean
The entire video is a joke
You guys are into sustainability, yet, visit this place that has fucked up the ocean.
Soo 2021
Ever leave any Chex cereal in liquid for a while...?
Very sustainable! I like it🤷🏾‍♀️
You are a lucky guy that you get and seek these possibilities. Your videos are very interesting and encouraging. Thank you and enjoy.
Probably the first video of yours that's disappointing. Great video in terms of marketing, terrible in terms of honesty!
What fyre should have been
how are these islands now? Are they on sale?
Only thing I do not like is that there are no trees really. Plant the TREE'S and all first on those islands while they just sit there, I say at least.
Dubai is the parody of 21. century.
13 Billion, and the Sea will devour those little sandy islands soon,  what a waste of money, those people could have educated EVERYONE in their country, so there is NO POVERTY, But NO, waste it on a bunch of SAND DUNES in the ocean
So... YouTube... You can't show the female breast in any context but you can show this? How? Pathetic. Especially America screams to this day how Europe wasn't more critical in the 1930s & 40s. On top of their lungs. How can the "very west", aka USA, so not live up to what they preach? Don't you see the lives and blood this is built on? By basically slaves? How is this not banned? How can this be shown, basically propaganda for Dubai?
It´s just outrageous that the riches are able to get away with things like this....
I have to say that these developments that have been built so far are in my opinion very unimpressive.  You have the environmental Impact your consider plus the sense that they're just literally throwing away money.   And if these islands each showcased the cultures of their credos tube parts of the world it might be worth it but I see no indication of that so what's the point?   I didn't like the villas and thought they were ugly.   Wasteful too.
Pls come to Pakistan 🥲
Haha this Guy talks about limiting ecological impact, then he goes to Dubaï to make some advertisment about some Fake Islands, where probably many slaves also died to build these. Cognitive dissonance at it's fullest
i know im late to the party and watching it very very late but what happens with the sea if it raises
I've always wanted to move to Dubai to bad im poor 😃
This is some insane advertisement for Dubai and these islands...
Enough of your   f$%cking mug shot! UNWATCHABLE!
They will fill up soon. World will rulled from these islands
I live thru your life vacations thank you
I didn't want this episode to end!
Drop h bomb
All there glass should be made into sand for the island. 1 less form for garbage
Those guys in Dubai really know how to spend their money. That's awesome and so beautiful
👍👍👍👍👍👍
Man yes theory, you're parents must be so proud!
Where's the criticism?  Come on, this might as well be an ad.
love you tommy
13:00. desalination will destroy. earth ...  THERE WILL BE WARS FOUGHT and  people killed...  its not out of HATE. that we must stop you BY ANY MEANS necessary ... its out of. LOVE for HUMANITY , that you MUST BE STOPPED.... NO DESALINATION ...  STOP THAT ... before Nukes drop
But what with environment? You had to destroy environments to bring all this sand to you!
Wow. Thx for sharing. Wish you had someone there with you.
i always see articles hating on these islands but it looks like they're actually making progress
It will be beautiful in the future when people fix it and make it beautiful
Hi
Yall are so lame, Nsync backstreet wanna bes. Pretty little pop boys.
sorry, i can't get it outta my head:  the G in gyro is said like the G in giraffe.  not guy-ro!
Liked all the info.  U said that your stuff u sell  is cotton.  I think u should really look in to hemp. It last long time. It doesn't deplete  the soil.
He seems very wise
Awesome to meet him
Is that the cinematic orchestra I hear 🤩
Utter Trashy.... Just trying to sell ya tacky merch..... disappointing
I'm suprised they didn't also take him to meet their locked-up, drugged princesses, so he could report on how great their lives are.
Think of the water that was displaced bc of the man made islands. Where did it go?... I guess when they dug the sand up from the ocean, the water went there. IDK  But you would think it would mess with the currents of the ocean.
The editing is sick!!!!!!!
I’m curious… when you went out to the beach on the island… does it like drop off or is there somewhat of a coast to walk out on? Looked almost like you stepped off lol
A reminder to NOT glorify dubai. It is a shit place that has many many slaves.
Only pizza with hamburger..?? I'd like to see they serve thomas with seafood or something else...

At 7:25  , the city 'Atlantis' , 'Stargate Atlantis' 😁
Is it true they smell bad?
These islands are the pinnacle of human stupidity. Spending billions on an unsustainable project.
Complete damage of the natural environment and a complete waste of time and money.  Total stupidity and pure ugliness. !
The person in charge of the islands really planned out EVERYTHING. He could one of the first pioneers who helps a TON on reducing green house gas.
Are you allowed drones in Dubai?
It is very luxurious and surreal but i am concerned about the nature and workers there.  The ocean has suffered a lot of damage and unfortunately the Arabic culture is not reflected either. Several homes of animals and plants has now been destroyed at the expense of power and money. Many workers from poor countries died there due to bad security. I am not feeling good about this.
This is just greenwashing of a project ya fools. But go ahead, welcome to buy tons of discomfort merchandise.
the builders vision make it
These cvid rules are so stupid its hilarious....
so much culture and yet keep looking for how they can copy the rest of the world, deep in my heart I miss the old Dubai, when the company De Nul started the project my grandfather had a great idea that I have been carrying for years now, but if you never get the nationality it is not much use to make it a life's work. very sad, would have preferred it differently. but that secret will go with me to my grave, you can't give everything away. but a thinker what the world really looks like, we have become empty souls, each on its own island and the cultures far away from each other.🤲🤲🤲
if I end up on such an island and I get pizza I would swim back to get tuna or dive behind my lobster myself, nice video. you enjoyed the most important thing
Freakin’ fascinating . That gyro-copter though …
Dubai has all the money in the world. But no class, no style at all.
it's not empty  it's for art sake
That's so cool your own island for the night dubi is such a crazy place I would love to visit one day myself
So impressive! Absolutely beautiful!❤
Why is this channel not yet over 10 million subs? Like it’s absurd.
How do I get involved in traveling like y'all?
I work now Dubai island ☺️
Dubai has a entire desert empty to build in.  lets throw that sand in the ocean for 100x the cost of just building it on land.
Have you guys been to China?
You catch jet planes everywhere and consume massive amounts of energy filming, editing, online. I like your content but please save us the environmental crap
Where does to pee and poop go?
In the future if these islands still exist and don't get destroyed by the sea. It would be cool if each individual island had its own cultural theme. Like one island being a Japanese themed island and the next being Indian. Especially being called the world islands
They using same recycling system than in Finland. Only bottles they do not recycle... here we get money when return bottles back to the store.
its all greenscreen lmao
www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OfbwhU5PQk proof
This is an ecologic catastrophe regarding to sand stealing and marine life
He loves a good pool lol
This is just wow💕
5:04 wonder how much she charges for her dignity?   Dubai basically is an upperclass whore house, the way they treat women there.  And white women usually fetch a very high price
Lifestyles of the rich and famous. Arab style
nice one :)
The reason the rich stop buying that island. They are more concerned about the rising sea levels. What happens when a million-dollar house gets flooded? would Dubai insurance pay for it? Nah....
Imagine being white and rich to be able to do stuff like this
They should use solar panels to bring electricity to the island
"It looks pretty livable to me, there's a pool!"  Love it 😄
Dubai is a joke: Adam Something’s takedown of its techno-hubris: https://youtu.be/tJuqe6sre2I
Why wouldn’t they be empty? What’s there?
man thats crazy how mother nature formed a series of islands that resembles the world
so title shall be Exploring Dubai’s not as full Empty as expected $13 Billion Man-Made Islands
I see people questioning on the environmental impact. I feel like the islands themselves won't cause too much of an issue. If anything, they would just make the waters calmer, which is no different than a break wall. The issue comes when the islands are developed. Also, with sea levels rising, how long are these islands even going to last? Aren't they in the same situation as Tuvalu and the Maldives?
Because the water doesnt refresch it self and starts to smell really bad After a while
Dubai boutta be copystriked by The Netherlands
I like all ur videos.thanks for showing us.amazing
They forgot new Zealand, inaccurate lol
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZLzvik4QOVOvgJqFxA7jNA
The type of infrastructure and architecture out there is just insane. I’m amazed by everything they build out there. What a beautiful country.
Seriously, why support an outdated system if wanting to be "mindful?" Use hemp; it's much better for the environment. It's a no-brainer or not🤔
Even a glimpse how the other half live is really something else !!! Wow, no limit to how much money can be spent on luxury ..
This is so hypocritical.
plot twist: the ocean is rising so in another 15 years there wont be an island, what comes always goes
Idk man Duabi just turns me off so much. It has no soul. Everything man-made and artificial, decadent shiny luxury stuff but nothing is "real" there. They don't give a shit about our planet. They also shit on human rights in the United Arab Emirates but they act like everything is so cool there - huge propaganda. Would not support that stuff.
That shit is just fucking crazy hahaha
Video editing is on the next level. excellent
Seeing someone in traditional white Arabian robes with airpods and almost no accent driving an ATV on an island is the most Dubai thing you can find.
They needed this positive PR
Dude if a zombie apocalypse happens then I would stay here
Dubai was built by slaves
This is an environmental hazard. I for one hope it doesn't come through. This is long lasting impact on the fishes and aquatic life
"Its pretty livable to me. Thers a pool!"  - Thomas
Don't get me wrong, I do appreciate your job. But this video is lacking the dark side of the story. You are filming what they want you to film.
This : is very much livable there is a pool 😂😂 dude
I was doing my benchmark for reading and one of the articles was about this and I became very interested.
people wonder why the middle east has problems with its economy its because they relentlessly try and westernize and it never goes well everytime almost its a waste of millions but they keep trying so tyhat westerners move to the middle east but they need to use their own culture to get people to come over
Well done Mr Chairman
Is this Ryan Gosling son? .. parents reveal
😂 seek discomfort in business class
Is it true you can’t be blonde in Dubai or have laws change since the expo ?
Omg it's still beautiful but it's kind of scarey...
They desalinate the water by using the process called Reverse osmosis! Which is the only way Dubai and its parts gets pure water from.
Thats the worlds islands if you search in google earth dubai you will find that they have south kore island and phillipines and also madcagasar and Indonesia islands
🥰❤️
You're Amazing Yes Theory! I love Thomas my favorite!🥰 Want to watch all videos 😍❤
Watch if you have no life.
lol, do y'all not know that only 1% of Dubai's GDP is spent on oil. so about this invention is ,all reusable energy, and no waste at all. You really try to take down the stuff that's above you. It's very eyesoring the fact that you criticize things, that you have not a bit of knowledge about. All you believe is propaganda and as well as falsehood.
Just like everything else in Dubai, pretty glamorous pretty fake..
wowooo the maintainance must be huge😲
Like China 🇨🇳, the UAE 🇦🇪 unsustainably overbuilt for a real estate market that didn't exist or was realized. China and UAE are excellent examples of what happens to a country that transitions from a Jewel of civilation to a Detroit style decline, i.e., Detroit 2.0 of the East and Middle East. The difference however, is that nearly a hundred years later the wellbuilt buildings of Detroit are still standing (although decayed and abandoned), while most of the buildings (poorly constructed using inferior steel and building materials) in Dubai and China have collapsed and or became derelict in less than a decade.
nope its more fun in the philippines tropical country.
As a 20 year old African American growing man coming from a small city with just a dirty river you learn to just fall in love with where you are from but this island just changed my view on life it be so little that I would ever expect to see but one day ill make it there.
Money might not buy you happiness but it can definitely build you islands in the middle of the sea.
The bamboo villa is nicer than any house i will live in ever....
Lucky you,awesome
The best part to me is that the Dubai government totally wants people like him to come so that they can become more popular, zo sure one would wonder iz he doing anything special or is Dubai using him for exactly what they want, which is more money and recognition; the more celebrity or travelers to come the more they gain ultimately, they literally need the rest of the world to be successful.
screw drive joke is works !
Thomas I want to swim and walk on these island's because these are drowning may be next month it disappear in sea 👍 good Trick with Arabic cows
Holy shit, mask on, off, on, off.  The mask thing has to end, jesus
whats the price of this bamboo villa :)
Load of rubbish.
This was really nice . Allahu Akbar
At 7.40 l realised you were saying LEBANON ISLAND, why dont you learn to speak correctly,
well I got a papercut
You are against it, but you make money from it. Sad thing is, the more people look at your shi*t the more you can do...
The hubris. An ecological disaster. A social justice disaster for the imported workers. An economic disaster.
Walks in the villa: "Omg they're like brand new!" Really? What made you think of that?
The villas do not look very nice at all. no, thank you.
They should film a zombie apocalypse movie there
PAID ADVERTISEMENT... PAID ADVERTISEMEN...
Is this where the Island Boys came from?
I need to put one of these on layaway
anyone who ever visits dubai is spitting in the face of human rights😒
worried about using recycled material for merchandise while traveling the world by plane, boat, car and helicopter to visit a fake man made island, living the life!
...Can Ya Get Ya Money Back?
er... if these islands were likely to be completely submerged within 20 years due to rising sea levels at the predicted rate, why would so much money and effort be put into building them..?
he figured he might as well let you in as the first guest befor ethe entire thing collapses and fails and there is no guests
You’re concept and themes for “seek discomfort” are pretty ironic considering you went to Dubai…. Human rights are constantly being violated just for the sake of growth… Rich white kid trying to talk a good game, doesn’t know much
Nice but your Web page in the link isn't working
Nobody wants to live in the Middle East, everywhere is dangerous and corrupt. Lipstick on a pig is Dubai
I think these kinds of projects are important for our future here on earth. To sustain a vision to complete something as unique and amazing as this would require an unmatched level of ambition and perseverance.  This is essentially the act of manifesting a dream into a reality. I am so impressed. Beautiful.
I'm confused. Environmentally Friendly on one hand. Building a bunch of random islands in the middle of nowhere on the other hand.
Beautiful marketing and advertisement, Great place for rich people.
That was very cool. Thank you
wow... i gotta admit that is sooo beautiful, much more than i thought it would be
Your money build n not you, its funny , just you watch the tall buildings,nect to the buildings just two kilometers away, is nothing ,
Taking up land is not enough we have to take up oceans and seas?!  We are some greedy ass MFS!!!
Herpes is FOREVER bro! 🙌
The guy that made them he’s an absolute genius and thank you for putting this up One day maybe Hey
What tremendous waste.. These people make so much money from oil that they just do.. stupid things, have flamboyant cars, jewelery... tremendous excess.. but with all that money, they still cannot change one thing...

5:49 this guys kinda rude ngl
If the Burj Khalifa has sewage problems, I wonder how that works in them small islands.??🤔🤔🤔
I can feel that this guy (vloger) is really enjoying😊
Seek discomfort? Sustainability? In Dubai?Really?
4:05  Cringe man-bun
The chef was like so where is this guy from? Oh OK he’s American so pizza and hamburgers
Wow I guess the rich dazzled you out of your idea of being more environmentally friendly!  They really put a little band aid of compost on top of the whole f'ed up islands situation... and this video just glorified the luxury.  ( I especially like how your long speech about being more earth conscious lead to totally ignoring any environmental issues with the construction of the islands and treatment of the workers) They should just go head and name it the Epstein Archipelago in honour of the rich banality it will attract. Yeah capitalism! I hate it here!
Is this what Cayo Perico is based off of?
❤️🤩❤️
Wow you are awesome i am going there too
What do you record with?
I would love to move into a plastic house. I would live in a Futuro house or a Hexacube house.
Thank the All Mother that the World Islands are sinking.
Dubai will give you many surprises which you never expected  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MwYTqXesnQ&list=PLYl6YSDg3_N0X6bqqWs8ZDBQ2KueZxhIQ
imagine if u just said 'so cool huh you idiot' and died lol
Great update,  is there any latest news on these islands
Here in Dubai now. Give me a shout if you want to head out to the islands in an upcoming weekend!
"seek discomfort... while I spend thousands of dollars living lavishly, and having fun".. makes sense, so profound.
Amazing!..Inspiring about garbage maintainance. If we implement we can keep our environment free from pollution and waste.
Enjoyed watching this & great video. Sad your channel is promoting/advertising anything in Dubai since there are no LGBTQ+ rights at all. It is illegal to be LGBTQ+ there.
I’m amazed!! I want to feel that feeling ✨
1 min in and im sucked in!!! Lol
"Nobody ever build a reclaimed island the way we did"  The dutch: are we a joke to you?
These islands are really bad for climate change
Biodegradable packaging as you fly across the world 🤣🤣🤣 Wake up you polluting narcissist
What a dork
I used to own an island on Second Life mainland. This is exactly like it.
How much American dollars a nite or week? Just curious! Had no clue it was that amazing!!
BRUH !!!! I would have DIED in this helicopter 🚁
Wow a man can dream......😲🤩
my throat has died because i screached the whole episode
Love or hate UAE, they know how to invent on a huge scale.
LMAO!.... I have this villa with no supervision. When he said that I was thinking about how innocent and child-like that was (in a good way not like he’s immature) so I laughed again when he said as a child he thought about being on his own private island
I heard of these islands BUT I didn’t know they looked like OUR WORLD. That’s actually really cool
I didn't realize a thread came loose on the embroidery till a got bricked from behind for sporting two lightning bolts. I'm sending you the hospital bill.
Cuz I'm an island boy 🏝
The Chairman was very kind and seemed smart (obviously)
What an amazing experience.
They should build some huts and let people go 'glamping'. Have some palm trees, a fire pit and some SeaDoos.
What is it they about houses built on sand
Yeah I'm not flying in that mini helicopter thing lol but I really want to go to Dubai one day its nice
The best thing is that those islands are made by Dutch people
Was this an advert?
amazing.   So cheap to have near clean energy
is that smog?  Haven't seen that in USA for decades.
17 minutes way too short a video for such a fascinating place 😁
They obviously dont believe in climate change. All that spent on a few islands barely above sea level.
I've an idea. Let's destroy entire ecosystems by dredging up sand from the sea floor, then pile it up into tiny islands with nothing there to stop erosion of said tiny islands, and then build houses on that piled up sand. I'm sure nothing will go wrong and there will be no problems at all with that.

Lebanon island 🤩✌🇱🇧
Dude Talking about environmental impact and how important it is for him while sitting in Dubai, where he flew to from LA, making content about a project which has a massive environmental impact without commenting so, all set in a country where they give a literat shit about environment and he doesn’t comment on that as well. I get a feeling his concerns about environmental impact are only cause you can sell shit better with a green label on it - disgusting.
Stupid idea destroyed coral reef in thr process for nothing, maybe you should speak on the reality of this extravagant useless project.
Disgusting rich people, wish a tsunami happens in this area... 👏
the island legit looks like a real life vrchat world
Still holding out for the Dubai Black Friday Island sale
what the…there’s no way the developer actually successfully does all of that sustainable stuff he was talking about. you can tell the dude is talking straight out of his butt.
BOOO ILLEGAL SAND MINING FROM DUBAI. DO NOT SUPPORT YES THEORY
Seek comfort*
Over-produced, under-edited, content-free.  Thanks anyway.
I thought you were cool Yes Theory. This is just pathetic
chairman is full of sh*t, not the first to build land from water the way they did ( look at the dutch). also that eco friendly recycling is not sustainable.
Obviously money laundering
Its so sad that you went there!
Turn them in Sand airport's
He should shave off his childish Robin Hood goatee, he'd look better without it.
If you want to be more eco conscious, then how about mention, what such a pointless, oil funded project, does do the local ecosystem and surrounding flora and fauna and how thousands of square meters of coral reef were devasted building all of dubai's artificial islands. Because saying that you want your brand to be eco friendly and then proceeding to glorify egocentric project of oil magnats, built for top 1% ain't such a cool hip eco look.
it will be interesting to see where it goes in the future... many look down on it due to all the potential issues that may arise, but if they manage to figure out all the problems it could be incredible
Well don't tell them about Flevoland
Dubai is a stage. It's shite. It's been empty even before covid. People go there to sleep and take a shit on the way to a better place.
The moment I heard bamboo villa,  it immediately reminded me of Russell Peters, saying..... Indians are the Mexicans of Middle East, all those fancy things out there, we fucking built it.
im confused, you started the video talking about being eco-friendly but then you get excited for one of the biggest waste of money and resources going on in a desert to date.  to get those island green is going to take so much fresh water it's going to be insane, and then to get even MORE water to hydrate actual human beings and flush all those toilets, etc...in a desert playground built for the super-rich to enjoy and for imported slave labor to build everything (thanks to India and the Phillipines for lying to its people to go work for pennies) in 125 degree heat.  you are aware of the human rights abuses going on in Dubai yes?  and lets get back to the fact that they are completely destroying their marine environment so that billionaires can have an island?  The Palm Jumeirah Island has become an ecological nightmare because of stagnant salt water that doesn't flow enough to take old water away and now green and white algae buildups are causing mass mosquito swarms and horrible odors for the Lamoborghini-driving residents dumb enough to live there in those huge McMansions.  Do Better, pay closer attention and good luck with your eco friendly clothing line.
Like Dubai just now islands look adorable small and just dot something that 😂
Environmentally friendly by selling for profit organic cotton clothes no one needs, when travel from LA to Dubai to make this video when can narrate it while staying home. The carbon footprint , people? The level of dishonesty and delusion is comparable with the CO2 levels.
Odd question, what is the sand like on those islands? It looks really rocky, like there isn't a lot of smooth grain beaches.
I like Yes Theory but it's a little disingenuous the way this is presented. These guys are smart people who no doubt know the reality behind what made Dubai what it is today.
Such a fake video.  Nothing about the environmental impact and sustainability.  Nothing about human rights in Dubai (luckily you are not gay).  Nothing about the human rights of the migrant workers in Dubai.  You have 7 million subscribers and this is the sort of influence you offer them; shame on you.
Wait... aren't islands going to disappear soon? How come they get investors for these projects?
lolol gotta buy this helicopter
What's the name of this backpack?
So... I guess sea level rise isn't a big deal everywhere.
Curious what the water temperature is. Like 82 degrees?
11:20 🤣🤣🤣
amazing... plan to be there a few days
oh!wowza! I'm kinda new n your channel and subscribed like 3 days ago and ohmyGod! i am so hooked ,i'm suppose to do something in that 3 days leave but as i watched one video just to check what this channel to offer, then i realized i am clicking and clicking from one video to another not noticing i have watched like alot already hahaha! these particular one got me coz i am here in UAE for along time specifically in Abudhabi, now these feature you filmed i just saw that on the news and google, you guys are so Lucky ...anyways i am so glad that i hit that button and i will continue hittn that thumbs up watchn your videos , continue to be an inspiration and fulfilling impossible dreams that is not really impossible if you kno what  i mean hahahah! coz you guys are really doing something great and amazing here and are so relevant to our life now.All my support , stay safe y'all. Godbless.
😍😍👌👌
It’s sad that a lot of these "documentaries" are paid commercials 😔
environmental conscious... what about the enormous carbon footprint of all your air travel??
So, the so-called "sea-level rise" around the world, is not an issue, or it's bullshit!?
It reminds me of my Goa a little bit..., 😅
Island boyyyyyyyy
This is so cool
Hahahahaa, organics use more resources. What a tool.
I want to know where they imported all the sand from. Yes, I know they are in the desert. I was just curious about the exact location.
I literally just can't even imagine what this must of been like.......bravo young man......you are definitely.....living a dream......!!
Thanks very much for reposting this - glad I caught it. I can’t wait to see it - brilliance.
Omgosh
Love u sooo much!
That was darn near unbelievable! What a trip!
organic cotton... what bullsh
I like your initial message about helping the environment. That made me continue to watch this.
Im defiantly renting one in Dubai
9:07  👨 : ... you know it’s under construction 🚧 it’s new, haven’t opened yet, you guys probably are the first people to stay on this island that is being constructed.   Thomas : WAW, THIS IS LIKE BRAND NEW... I DIDNT EZPETED IT..
ohh its for island environment  i thought its for exclusive economic zone :)
cool cool cool \m/
Should have met up with Mo vlogs
Ha ha ha ha ..   Dubai BS …. People tell me I worked in Qatar too long … I see Dubai for what it is ….
Did u plan ahead or got invited by the owners? To give it some publicity or positive exposure maybe?
Not for me tinny fake island far from land after two days ..must be borring if you not have personal boat to explore
This is just creepy
Thanks seeing this destruction of wealth and nature on a mega scale makes me feel less bad about denting my rental car the other day
Please visit the Philippines sometime next year!
Did you know that basically the whole of modern Dubai was built by slaves?  There's thousands of articles about it. But in order to give you a good impression without having to read too much, I recommend you this short Wikipedia paragraph: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Dubai#Foreign_workers_and_labour_rights
It's nice that they do think about how to make it sustainable, but I feel like the whole idea is flawed. With so many of those things vacant, it seems wasteful, and destructive, with all the building waste, pollution to get stuff out there, habitat changes for aquatic life...
You're very lucky!! Hehehe
Jeffrey Epstein’s dream!
So kool being only person staying ovetnite on island great video
Dreams do come true...
The parched timer regrettably start because locket theoretically amuse over a rude sunday. literate, scary icebreaker
I'm sure I'm in the minority here but what is the compulsion with adding music, not to mention a different music track every 5 seconds?  Your videos are amazing and don't need it.  Are you trying to convey reality or make a musical?  I want to experience this different part of the world, I want to hear what the people are saying.  I have no interest in listening to music while I do those things.  Again, I'm sure it's just me and I'm not trying to take away from what you're doing.
The unequal range nationally jump because duckling notably explain unto a fancy arm. frightened frightening full fumbling functional, flaky dedication
He is our great and down to earth Chairman of DP world❤❤❤
One is the lonlinest  number you need to bring friends
A place built off slaves and suffering, I just can’t support this video and I’m sorry. I’m not saying that I don’t buy products made by Chinese children (as tbh I wouldn’t be able to tell you) but I think Dubai represents everything wrong with the 21st century
This is the fakest and stupidest thing I've seen since 2003. Dubai is the biggest scam of this century. Sustainable my ass.
THAT LAST SONG BIT CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD WHATTTTT. never expected yes theory to put magdalena bay's music 😭😭😭
FLAT EARTH.. HAD TO.. ADMIRAL BYRD..MASONIC DECEPTION ROUND EARTH ... NASA STARVES PEOPLE ON EARTH TO FAKE MORE CGI.. YES TRUTH IS NOT NEGITIVE THE IGNORANCE OF TRUTH IS????
wonder who paid for this infomercial?
Did it destroy some marine environment? Yes. Did it create more "edge" effect for future marine environment expansion? Yes. Short term loss, long term possible large gain.  Was it worth it? Probably not. But you have to think about possible future positive effects, not just the immediate negatives.
I had a chance to view the islands from the shore as they were being built. Even before viewing them in person I never could understand why anyone would want to live in that location.
it's awesome to see people building somewhat self sustaining communities again.
That bamboo villa looks like sth from my country 🇮🇩
6:58 that sims type music 🙌🏻🙌🏻
Seeing the fire extinguishers on the wall, makes me wonder about a fire that's a little bit bigger.  Do they have fireboats, instead of firetrucks?  Or do they just not talk about that?
I want to see the people talking about the environmental impact of the islands  talking about the environmental impact the phones or computers you guys are typing on cause trust me it’s far worse than some islands most of you fake care about the environment
Seeing those comments praising the project and the chairman makes me want to barf so bad. Years delayed, billions wasted, local marine life ruined, thousands of slave labours used, and for what? Go to where the actual construction workers live next and prove to those people that what "seek discomfort" really means, Yes Theory.
New challenge for you guys: Go live for 72 hours with the labourers who've been building those islands next and tell us what you think.
Dude, this is just amazing. The chairman was so welcoming. Great visual storytelling. WOW.
Dubai, this place should be strongly boycotted, just a bunch of vanity projects but i like the bit of irony when he talk about eco-friendly things at the beginning of the video (sponsor ?) Which is in total contrast with Dubai. Where they import sand to build the islands from Australia. Oh i forgot there was superb coral reefs with rich ecosystems where those mini islands have been build. In general i like your video, but here i couldn't get past the first 2 minutes.
Should have NEVER been built like a slew of Chinese ghost cities.
Criminal hubs to protect the proceeds of crimes .,
The song sounds like that one song from JET
i think it would bring so much more character if each island was designed and decorated to be like the country it is named after
Anyone from kerala🥺
Rhondie Badcock  That was great view. Inventerous people on planet earth. Wisdoms from above. 🙏
This guy gets so many "firsts" it's uncanny haha, truly blessed and we're all fortunate to be able to enjoy your adventures vicariously.
Some plants have started to grow. Maybe palm trees could grow
The opening is a jojo reference
dont think anyone with however much money should not beable to move that much sand and earth and absolutely destroy so much habitat
Great content!
as someone who's been living in dubai for 16 years since the day i was born.... i don't really understand the hype. It slowly gets too repetitive
The only reason he was Allowed to stay was he had a vast reach of audience,so they had an opportunity to advertise for low cost(almost free,some meals won't cost much).  I'm not jealous but it is what it is. The benifit of having a large audience.
How many people died during the construction???
Imagine how many kids could have been feed and school money paid instead of building waste.
is it open for business yet?
Thanks for getting more organic!
- What to do when you have tons of money? 💰 - throw tons of sand into the sea.  Yeah.
What If A Couple Years Later The Islands Will Look Like The Country. If You Dont Know what I mean: France ~ A Miniture Eiffel Tower Brazil ~ Christo Redentor Australia ~ A Miniture Hungry Jacks And A Miniture Opera House
i like how much money dubai has we just build random shit now
What's the chairman's name? Everyone keeps calling him the chairman 🤣
That guy at 12:00 taking about bamboo houses, plastic leftover, decomposed fertilizer comes from his owners manual instructions.
They just build shit for the flex even if they don't need or use it. UAE has the highest exotic cars abandoned everywhere.
Translation correction - the Chairman said he developed Deira* not 'there' (as in Deira Palm).

thats a unique & amazing island man made so nice
instead of man made islands why didnt they just build floating cabins/homes like the ones on norris lake in tennesse
I want one of these islands so I can start my own nation.
Shaggy Thomas is very attractive
With Covid everywhere you'd think all the rich would want to buy their own island 😐 I can't believe I never knew you could build an island😕
That flying chair is scary🤐😖
Thank you for the video! That chairman was inspiring with how passionate he was to make the islands thrive. 🤩
I can’t believe you failed to ask how it is all powered, how the waste and rubbish is handled.  While it looks amazing how do the facilities actually work?
Looks boring. I'd rather live in Vegas or in a big vibrant city with access to a boats and peers.  What was the point of these islands? Then again what was the point of the ghost cities in China?
Why does most of Dubai look like a ghost town?
I lived in Abu Dhabi in 2014. I got to travel to Dubai on the weekends. All the stuff that was under construction still- most of it has been like that for 5-10 years because the developers run out of money to finish the projects, lol.  Not saying these islands have anything to do with that- because its a different situation, but all the construction you see in the video that is just Dubai. haha
My dad went to Japan and the people he was staying with gave him pasta with ketchup because they thought it was American.
Talks about reducing environmental impact of his organization, flies to Dubai in a plane and flies in a helicopter. I believe this is counterproductive.
It's empty because it was an idiotic idea...you dont build houses on sand
Dubai! modern day slavery!
Wow! The world Islands are made in the shape of the Azimuthal Equal Distant map. How cool is that? Which means: The creator who made these islands knows, the earth is flat and does not move.
lol dubai is such a joke of a city
Fantastic!!!!Protecting the environment....
A very nice ad.
Chairman for President!
With the city looking like OZ off in the distance.... Amazing
dubai is the most horrible waste of money, sustained by the worst slavery system of the contemporary world.
environmental concerns - going to a country that lives off fossil fuels, going on a plane for a very long flight and even advertising Dubai as a cool place (oh so new wow). hypocrite! who paid for you trip? I guess I know who.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MJS1ijshHA In case you're wondering. You are part of the problem.
“Seek Discovery is becoming more environmental” — literally goes to Dubai. Y’all are a fucking joke lol
Incredible the peoples you met. I’m glad I came across this video
Incredible the peoples you met. I’m glad I came across this video
Dubai is the biggest shithole in the entire world.
why are they not inhabited? because Dubai and the Emirates are horrendous places of modern slavery. these islands are not made for people to live on, they are not made to help the common man get a place to live. these islands are just made by a bunch of billionaire oil princes who had nothing better to do with their wealth than to suck up sand from the sea floor, ruin the marine life, and build this d*ck measure of "look at what I made." yes it looks nice, but what's hidden underneath all of it.  I'm sorry man but just a bit more research into this whole thing could've shown you enough to realise how fcked up it is. and the fact you decided to become more environmentally friendly, yet not realise what kind of horrid project this was? idk something's fishy here.
Dubai is garbage. Period. Show a luxury island with Villa's but not state how the sand is on top of marine life and if they don't further the projects it will all sink. Not environmental friendly but pushes environmental friendly shirts. What??
IT WILL SINK
Why can’t we built stuff like that here in America!!🇺🇸 I instead of getting involved in wars with another countries!!
What a disgusting display of greed and avarice.  Nothing in this video is of any value to the well being of my country, my family or me.
Just shows how stupid you can get with petro-dollars.
Once invited, not able to talk about environmental effects or the smell of the stagnant water? 🤔☮️❤
Too many kiss-ass expats telling some rich dude "Wow, great idea". Now I'll watch your video. 😀
The cemetery is nice and empty, but who likes to go there alone?! lol
The name of The Chairman, please?
That was totally Awesome getaway with big City 🌆 in the Background.. middle of Somewhere..
The knowing yoke marginally breathe because chauffeur relatively accept circa a guttural H habitual cord. used, extra-large extra-small exuberant team
Just because something seems "cool" it doesn't mean it should be done. This video is a typical influencer shallow-minded insight into an utter waste of resources and destruction or marine life. Even the design, bamboo houses to replicate "island" feel while there are absolutely no bamboo growing in the region. Why not go with something a little more authentic, like Middle Eastern feel?
All well and good making light of the environmental ‘work’ they’re doing on the islands while completely ignoring the fact it’s built on a system of literal slave labour where people die… oh and all the marine life they killed. But yeah no let’s focus on the pretty villas that aren’t even really habitable
How do they ensure water in the straits is replenished by fresh sea water
It's an ad....
Epic unnecessary stupidity... Like all that land and you build into the sea. How duh?!?! 🙄🙄🙄
The grateful gratis toad arthroscopically increase because fine phongsaly thaw but a old-fashioned flesh. peaceful, sharp beggar
Really?? Nobody wants to talk about it, like am I the only one that notice that shit on
Aren't they sinking?
all this is going to end in a giant fail all dubai is going to end in a giant fail because these petrol guys just have no idea what is the true world, what people want, where people like to live they just thought that money could fix everything they built dubai like a 7 years old kid would do it
Funny, I just watched a channel Adam Something talking about Dubai is a JOKE
building those useless islands that actually destroyed all marine life.
I wish i could :) Peace .
so where is the poop going to go when these islands are finished? on poop boats? tranport it to the poop trucks? shove it all in the poop holes so nobody sees it?
This whole project is about 6-12 feet above sea level! Does anyone believe this place will exist in 20 years?
The sinking islands
That looks so cool.be better to have friends and family.
12:15  So he is the responsible one for destroying the coral reef.
This is why you let Mother Nature create everything!  She knows what's best for the planet and for all inhabitants of the earth.  These "islands" look so sterile, awkward and cold, night and day difference from this island nation which is also the least visited place on heart, Tuvalu that I just learned by watching another of the Yes Theory video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODuEl4oNae0 which is warm, lively and convivial with naturally formed beaches out of the clear seawater that preserves all marine life.  I appreciate that the developer of these "islands" are trying to minimize the carbon footprint by composting and recycling as much as possible but really the way to leave the least amount of carbon footprint is not to have built these "islands" at all.  Really how did he think people would want to live there or vacation there with all of them completely cut off from main Dubai and people would need to take yachts or extra transportation to get there?  I mean Thomas tried to stay positive while staying on the "island" and tried to showcase their positive side, the luxury and etc. just I am sure out of courtesy to his host but really he was like living in luxurious island prisons there, all isolated and alone and nowhere to explore unless being driven by somebody.  And as a matter of fact, the best use for these islands is really to build prisons there.  These islands are all isolated and are in the middle of nowhere in the vast ocean so that would be a natural deterrent from prison escape.  The chairman would be able to recuperate his $13 billion the fastest by having prisons built there.  Yes it might be a bit of a bruise to his ego but really I see that as the most realistic and best use of these carved-out isolated "islands".
Does this guy have any sense of irony? He parades himself around in an organic T-shirt with his "seek discomfort" mantra on his chest, probably consuming more energy than the average person consumes in a lifetime to get there, fly a helicopter over it, taking 2 round trip boat excursions to spend one night alone in the most pretentious energy-inefficient luxury condo in the world. He should have asked where the desalination plant was, how many miles of coral was destroyed making this ridiculous environmental sink-hole and how many slaves it took to build and maintain it.  Can you believe he is giving "Free Seeker necklaces" with your first $35 purchases? What is it he is seeking, the inner-harmony of complete douche-baggery?
Fakeness personified! The old dude who says he's the reason for all the islands probably spent that much money on coloring his hair black.  What's up with these Dubai dudes...so much black color in their hair. Besides, there's absolutely no character to anything related to Dubai...unique may be...but no character at all. No wonder those Islands are still unoccupied...and will be.   I wouldn't let my dog live there. The issue with most travelers form the civilized western world to Duabi-joke is that it seems exotic...and it does only because you're just visiting...and are excited to see a different place even though it sucks.  Live there for five years...and then post what you think of this greatest joke on earth called Dubai!
Because they stink. Literally.
How would they supply water to all islands once they are all operating?  And how will they collect sewage from all islands? Will they connect them all with pipes? Sorry, the most stupid project I’ve seen!
The determined climb extragingivally report because calendar concomitantly count besides a terrible need. aback, devilish half-brother
The islands are sinking.
They should take all women and children from Afghanistan over there
google map this area and have a look at names of them :-)
Awesome video thank you for sharing your experience. No one can make cleaner energy more dense than ZADEUS with proprietary PPEC/DEI technology. In fact we can power the entire Emirates with the smallest of carbon footprints be it Land, Sea or Aerospace.
The designer/builder talked about how the islands are using Eco friendly ways to be sustainable, however where are they pulling in all that sand from?? I would think that would cause issues from how or where it’s taken from. Also I don’t see how this will work really in the end, the earth on its own could easily destroy all of that.
Dude, this is another level of material.. what a video.. 👌🏻
This is amazing. Wow. That’s so cool. I went to Dubai a few years ago, the city is fantastic, so cool.
breath taking view
I would wonder about nature and how possibly migrating birds and other animals will take to a man made island. Without nature it would seem unnatural or synthetic.
dubai's manmade islands are trash. not bc of the engineering feat--but because it basically smothered all the coral reefs underneath. next up, they're all sinking every year. lastly, they could have just inverted it and done it on land but with water. not to mention use of modern day slaves.
Isolation at its finest.
These islands where constructed using sand from the sea floor, which destroyed the ecosystems it came from. With the Palm islands, they built over a coral reef and smothered it. The islands are also sinking at an alarming rate, and that paired with global warming causing sea levels to rise…. Yeah I don’t think these will be bought anytime soon.
Yeah yeah seek discomfort by living in 5 star hotel. I want this discomfort too. 😂
the videos are good but theyre so worthy and self congratulatory in a way only americans can be. if you asked them what they did at a party they'd say something like: 'its kind of a holistic lifestyle brand for the snapchat generation.'
They destroyed multiple Marine sanctuaries to build a bunch of stagnant piles of sand...
So so beautiful
12:26 the guy said we developed deira not there
I'm sorry, but I personally think those little islands look dead, and not just because they're vacant. To see sand that was artificially dumped above the ocean, when it should be teeming with corals down below, is too unnatural to be beautiful. I have seen pictures of sand bars and beaches with fewer structures, and those look more lively than the setup here.  The villas may be pretty, but you can build them anywhere. Nothing truly exciting about that. They don't even look organic. True organic is when you have wood or palm frond slats for window shutters instead of glass. The only saving grace might be the chairman, who is at least a little open to problem solving. Hopefully, they realize that luxury and bougie fade with time.
4:28   at least it has Disc Brakes . Makes me feel Safer .
Slave labour created all of this.
You must be the luckiest 🤣 guy in the world . Incredible trip !
WHERE`S THE VIEW ?
This whole area was a coral reef teeming with life. They destroyed it all to make deserted islands, that don't even look like what they're supposed to
*habib* - "hey abdul, you remember how you thought that the dumbest idea you could think of was building the tallest building in the world and not connecting it to the sewage system?"  *abdul* - "yes."  *habib* - "i think you should sit down for this one."
Disgusted
How to advertise a project that is socially and enviromentally unsustainable. But hey, who cares, it' s Dubai:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SacQ2YdVOyk
To be more environmentally conscious,  why not make your merch from Hemp?
The building of these islands has a big impact on marine life. The sand is taken from ocean floor, wich gets destroyed in the process, losing countless coral reefs and marine flora. All for what?  Its not only unnecesary but really harmful for the environment In my opinion there should be more critical thinking on this kind of stuff (especially if you talk about being mindfull about the environment).
Thanks for bringing us along. Liked & sub
Wait, did you pilot that helicopter yourself? Whats the name of the company?
The guy who built these is talking about sustainability in the video yet just used $13 billion from oil to build islands that people aren't inhabiting and they will be under water in 20 years. Something about that doesn't add up.
The islands should be renamed Atlantis.
dubai is only shiny on the outside
https://youtu.be/SacQ2YdVOyk new video on Dubai
A girl could not do this but I would love to!
No way they brought you american food . . xD That is respect! They deserve 7*'s
Why worry about building artificial island when the world already has do many problems .
I smell so much discomfort
Does not wear a mask, fate in humanity restored! Great videos and attitude my friend, keep on the good work!
Wow! Your content is amazing! I discovered your channel yesterday, and after just seeing the Bhutan episode, I subscribed! Your drone footage is phenomenal and your music is awesome! This episode is particularly interesting to me, because Dubai is on my bucket list!
Love the video just wanna say places like Dubai, australia, africa & others are really rich in life when some people down grade them cause of the lack of easy sources people would have in america they are limited with what they have there people in america are spoiled to life compared to them 🤣 i appreciate the video.
Looks like they have the technology to save the island of Kiribati which the rising seas are over taking 60k peoples home.
The chairman talking about how sustainable and eco-friendly their system is on an artificial island built on the destruction of a marine ecosystem.
17:04 Love the music! Who is the owner of this awesome music!
Youre so lucky
If u said that is island,  do visit wonderful  islands in indonesia and malaysia.
one quick question. What happens if a Tsunami hits ?
Maybe this is why oceans are rising, not climate change, volcanoes and man made islands
The first step-sister preliminarily own because dessert ostensibly signal below a lame mary. dull, known lier
Cheers for the arial view.....There are so many better places in the world with a lot more amenities down the street with less humidity and heat
Somebody from Dubai who wants to show me around in September? :)
kanye??
Clearly if they can’t do this, they can’t colonize the moon or Mars lmao
There is your sea levels rising,  mystery solved.
We are making solar catamarans, I guess our boats have a future here, (if Covid is gone, that is)!
Bad design. What is destroying life?...Climate Chaos.  What is 84x worse than CO2 release to atmosphere? This methane based burning of garbage. Not YES THEORY. This is self destructive theory.
This is beautiful and high end luxury like no one but Dubai can do.  Now you are talking about giving back to the earth.  How has these island affected the environment.  The Ocean.  All you talked about is luxury  which is not aligned with what you are promoting.  Also eating cows.  Hamburgers and pizza.  One of the unhealthiest things you can put in your stomach..  Just saying.
Or you could just travel to a Dessert located in Brazil, named Lençois. Where the dessert is so vast it´s the size of the Sao Paulo city, and on this dessert you will find millions of crystal blue lagoons! Amazing view of the dunes that includes many lagoons! Only to be seen on Brazil.
jeff epstein is not impressed.....
The way they developed and determined to maintain the islands is innovative genius.
Do we know much it would be to stay there? I've been through Dubai 8 times but only had a few hours there!
Cotton is not environmentally friendly LMAO - quite the opposite
This is how horror movies start, there's is you and a killer on the island.
Brother u should visit autoville village in pondicherry located in south part of india ....complete organic ....must visit...u cannot compare it to this island for sure 😉
if u get killed in that island nobody would know and u will be included in the gas thing which will be recycled and what the chairman is talking about hahahaha
what a billionaire chairman!
Wowwww ..thanks for sharing. The man who said, we developed it ..has so much of ideas ...woww.  A big salute to him.
Dude I love you guys, thank you
Good stuff I was wondering how things were going, looks amazing
Wow you got the best job anyone could have. Have fun with your adventures 👍
try the duch for creating more land
It is all a show properly staged for you,  nobody lives on those islands lol,  its all a PR show because you are an American white dude.
Quick TIP GUYS: Your Audio is about 3 Frames off!                     Awesome Content Guys!
Because their engineering was shit and the investors found out.  Then backed out of the deal.  Sea level rise and erosion will eventually make all of the buildings sink and degrade back into the water.
Lol, “first island built like this” he should come to the Netherlands 🇳🇱
The thin selection densply part because leopard pharmacodynamically multiply mid a attractive table. laughable, abhorrent sled
So much luxury cuz this bloke is a white american! And says he is out of his comfort zone. Meanwhile, others starve. First world idea of growth and comfort zoning!
lol talking abt how good they are for the climate then 5 seconds later going on a airplane
I guess masks are not mandatory in many places
Where is the mall? What to do when you get to the villas?
Can you please make me a shirt in 6xlt? I want to support and represent for you guys, but I am a pretty big guy. It sure would mean a lot to me. Especially now that I am starting to move again!
five million strong is all the power you need to sit with the worlds most pressured developer. You are awesome. And not one cuss word. Class class class
brilliant idea. You bring one last breath of help to all the developers who fucked up. Smart. I hope you are getting a %
HOW IN THE HOLY HELLFIRE F*CK DID YOU GET TO THIS??? OMFG!! DUDE! YOU.....YOU.....WOOOOOOOW! JUST WOW DUDE-THAT'S INCREDIBLE-I JUST WATCHED YOUR FIRST VID. NOW THIS. DUUUUUUUUUUUUDE.....SERIOUSLY. Like this is the dream. I really wish I could do this.....
Amazing and beautiful.
Can I work and live there I will sweep the sand every day !!!
Just beautiful and seems like nice people 😌
The plan is for these to latch unto the actual earth's plates and eventually grow outwards forming empty continents
I just found this channel, do they just explore?
As he is looking at the island  “This is amazing “  My brain: This would make a great horror movie
Can someone tell me the name of the chairman or the man in the boat? I watched tho whole thing but it is never once mentioned.
Continue creating. Your art brings joy and love. What the world needs now. <3
Ad and merch plug all in the first 3 minutes of the video 🖕
Who's here from the sidemen reacts videos
Hmm...now I understand why Egyptians build pyramids and left them...they were hotels but financial crisis hit them 😄
April every episode I watch just makes me want some of the merch more and more and to hear about the environmental aspects and the consciousness of your products I just have to get my hands on the next batch. The current stuff that's going with the watch at the moment it's not really my style so I'm hoping for another denim jacket with like graffiti on it. That is so cool.
2 things, doing good, and feeling good about doing bad.  These islands are not the eco-friendly heavens they are made out to be, that's just marketing to sell to ultra rich, all the harm has already been done, and more will come with the lavish lifestyle and energy demands.  It's money, money, money.
Who else watches yes theory’s old videos when their board
So, why dont they wash away with the tides?
That's an intelligent chairman.
"It's livable, there's a pool." You're funny !
Islands, sandbars whatever
Beautiful place. Imagine it when it's all finished at night with the ambient lights it will be beautiful I can't wait to see it completed
" The Island " looks like shit lol
I subbed out of curiosity, but with caution. Hope this channel has good content and isn't trying to constantly bug you to buy merch.
The clammy tortellini pathomorphologically scold because yugoslavian tribally mark behind a massive cymbal. lying, hallowed probation
Not sure why you're puzzled. This was explained years ago.
thats just propaganda bro
I think this is just a promotion and not very authentic.
WOW, one of the best videos I have seen on YouTube, apart from mine of course, Utterly brilliant, thank you :)
Yall suck up the chairman already Lmao
GREAT VIDEO...
How their spend the water???who can explain for me?? Mega water to use for island….although its mega island???
Is someone here watching from a TT video?
Oh Thomas the life you live,you’re so fearless,adventurous and open minded,a truly remarkable trait
i like the chairman’s thinking , very pure . I respect it
I’m here from tiktok lol
this is what i mean when i say i want to get away from the world
here from tiktok lol
how much was the whole trip in U.S $?
Is that a glider from pubg mobile???
The materialistic bow enzymatically vanish because sponge spectroscopically license plus a doubtful invention. defective, giddy leather
Well that luxury island can get all the glitter and LEDs its supposed to, but it will still be tasteless and souless.
I have so many questions though. Ecological and economic concerns. Did the construction of the islands drive away marine life? Where did the brought-in sand come from and what methods did they use to make sure that the original place of the sand didn’t suffer any ecological disaster? Have they lost any money due to the slow buying process of the islands? etc. etc.
I need 9,000 from the 13 billion for a Car
So you use cotton because you want to be environmentally friendly? Please research cotton’s impact on the ecosystem. Hemp is your best option, if you want to help the planet.
I wish you guys were more size Exclusive. Some people got tummies and might need a bigger size then you offer..
That chair man sounds so smart. Defenitly changes my view of dubai people.

The silky poppy puzzlingly unpack because lung posteriorly program into a creepy duck. striped, vast underpants
We tried sneaking onto "California Island" a few years back. When stopped by security we advised them we were rich investors seeking to purchase it. They informed us our boat wasnt large enough for us to be rich investors and forced us away! hahaha
It's amazing what you can achieve, but I have to say wouldn't have been a plan I would have chosen. All the outside islands would be cool, but the middle islands after everything is built will just be underwhelming for the price.
Wow... that's unreal!
Seriously, who were the people that actually disliked this video? Was it because someone from a different culture or a darker race came up with this idea or is behind it all? I seriously cannot fathom why anyone would dislike this!
Absolutely gorgeous! wow!
Awesome video, still don’t know why they’re empty.
Any white man is god in Dubai. And white man with YouTube channel that has nearly 7 millions subscribers is super god for their business.
Where did they get the sand from ?
The luxuriant poultry contemporaneously frighten because helium cytologically brush athwart a wholesale exhaust. overconfident, faded hawk

lol, sorry had to stop you there. are you actually starting to talk about how environmentally conscious you guys are after flying with a plane around half the globe
Love to see you guys in south africa In the safari camping alone🤣think you guys can do that?

Wow that was a awesome video and and awesome and beautiful place. You are so lucky to be there.
Artificial things make you sick.
Nothing is as expected!!!!!
This looks so beautiful. Are Jewish people and gays allowed? If a women rents, does she have to behave virginal? Just curious who can rent these
Most boring video ever!!! Gave ne a headache

I wanna go

You can tell the project was a financial disaster, look at the guy wearing just normal AirPods, what a pleb, must be broke or smth
Fun fact: I'm actually in dubai rn on vacation and this video just got recommended to me
Yes covid 😭
I wonder how much money the chairman has, like legit.. He also seems like an wholesome person, very intelligent aswell!
Nice you're pushing Plant Based packaging, bro, but were devouring a dead chicken on Tuvalu Island. That's a bit of a disconnect! Prolly getting your priorities about the Planet and its inhabitants in check wouldn't hurt.
the concept of this place is incredible. it’s sustainable and beautiful. of course it must be astronomically expensive to live there but it i had the chance i totally would go
The crowded ceramic tribally stir because ball immuhistochemically blush via a rich silica. four frail, workable weight
Once in a lifetime view!
Seek comfort 😄
Seek discomfort in the most exclusive, built out tourist area I've ever seen. Really?
Don't they execute people that live in sin there (as in a boyfriend/girlfriend or boyfriend/boyfriend or girlfriend/girlfriend sleeping together in the same room) I heard where Dubai is a stop for Australia residents on international flights, they tell people not to get the same hotel room if their flights ever get delayed, because they watch that stuff and will put tourists in jail for fornicating? Do they throw people from roof tops that are LGBTQP friendly? Don't they cut peoples hands off for drinking alcohol? What are their opinions on Christians there?
Wow the Chairman is very wise and protect full of the environment
You know they’re not joking when they say HABIBI COME TO DUBAI 😂
Good result comes out from persistency😁 such an eye opening experience!

would've appreciated a somewhat critical part of this whole project... everything beautiful also has its dark side, particularly in dubai. especially after talking about enivornmental concerns in the beginning of the video...
The are plaing minecraft in real life
totally unsustainable. What a waste of resources.
The video is great but the whole idea of these islands is utter stupidity. In the end nature will reclaim what you took from it and the same will happen to these islands, no matter how much money you pour in to make it luxurious and livable
I dont wanna know how many thousands of families and beaches have suffered from getting all this sand over to Dubai. Such a giant waste of our precious ressources
Love your videos. However a bit mixed feelings when you speak on the beginning about “seek discomfort” “organic clothes” “environmental concerns” but you keep travelling in business/first class...
Why did Thomas not bring his GF to this?
clearly the yes theory at work.

Forever my dream to live out there
Hi Mate, Great video. thanks..... By the way we are garment manufacturer from Turkey and we do produce sustainable durable garments. and using our great cotton we can produce your jogings and hoodies with receyled polyester and/or with Organic Cotton fabrics... Best luck.... Cheers.
how fucking incredible is that, he just experienced something 99.999999999% of people will never even get close to, how beautiful are those islands man, all organic, and they just LET him stay there overnight for free, something that is usually like 1 million (⊙_⊙;)
This video sucks
This was amazing and honestly I’d love to go their once its all finish
This was very interesting but playing about with nature is not a good thing .Seems to me that Arabs only want to get richer and never mind the consequences .What about all the poorly paid immigrants who have worked on these building sites no health and safety .What's nice about it apart from the colour of the sea .
Well the guy who bought the Ireland island 🏝 topped himself , very sad

Can you pleaseee make a video on how you started traveling , and the funds you need to have to be able to travel like you do , etc !! I would love to know how it all began
How are the basic utilities provided ? The chairman didn't address all of it. Is there an electricity supply from the mainland or is it generated on the island ? Also what happens to the wastewater - is there a plant on the island that can handle it ?
Just enough isolation to not feel completely isolated. My dream!
Imagine youre being asked to stay there and youve forgotten all your acid at home
😘
It’s amazingly beautiful and we are all very hopeful for its future!
I like how curiosity never faded...
Theyre so many things to think about: homes, water, electricity, telecommunications, waste management, transportation, security, food source
first time seeing this vlog and i am interested with the content even more . Feels like i wanted to visit this places you visit too
It's a really good initiative and idea for the tourism and stuff ... but I actually think that having all this money to build all this, you could also try to build something for the sinking ones who are on the edge of disappearing and face disasters everyday ! 🥺
AMAZING!!!!
Everything just looks old and dated already. Like a once busy place that’s never really busy and has just been left to fall into disrepair. I think Dubai as a whole it’s days are numbered. Once the oil revenue completely runs out and they rely on tourism the place will quickly go down hill. I can’t see Dubai being the busy wealthy place it is today. Dubai will go as quick as it come.
I need to get a life. Looking up passport info.
I live in the UAE and i have never seen such a thing like this before 😭😭😭😭
So there is no bridge, tunnel etc.? Good luck to live there.
What about sewage disposal. And I thought the problems with the atmosphere are exacerbated by even the methane gas from cows, so why would they convert organic material to methane gas and be proud of it?
Beautiful,  I want to go there!!

Love the choices of music
ya lost me at the uber we so great, look at how special we are selling you shit that helps the planet...umm right -next
That chairman's voice was really like a chairman, A gentleness was there.... Calm and visionary voice...  May be like umbrella academy father.
Humidity in that place will kill you in summer. Non-sense artificial islands !!! Nobody even tried doing such things, because only crazy ones do that in nature?! That is total sabotage to nature!! What you did to Mother Earth, will eventually kill you in the future !!!
If my country (Micronesia) was represented in these artificial islands, it would be made of 600 pieces of dirt (the size of pennies) spread out in the water.
Funny thing is I don’t think I am able to seek discomfort because I am pretty much comfortable with everything except for things that may be harmful to my life in which my upbringing has made me comfortable with many of those situations so I don’t know what to do about seeking discomfort because I don’t wanna die but I want to live the motto. So now I am curious to what do you do with situations like these?
That island with all those villas looks like a prototype island. It had all kinds of designs, so i guess they use that as a business card and invitation to possible customers. Pretty cool!
How about sailing to all the places you visit vs flying by plane?
Why is the logo on all the merch a very stylish serif font.Yet the website has this sleek logo with flipped letters? Feels like a mix of 2 styles. I thing that more sleeuq logo will fit the merch much better. That serif fonts makes it look old
WHy is he alway salone in these vids lately. DOnt the other join anymore. I know one of them decided to go full on writing. But how about the other one?
Yet another heartfelt video.  this guy is incredible. Im a huge fan
If you ask for *hert of Europe* you faund 9497568 video in YouTube end posibility to visit , you are the only one visit the word island end don't go here
stupid money
Besides the obvious reasons, the sooner the world gets off oil, which is financing stupid fake places like Dubai built by indentured servants from poorer countries, the better.
i can't reconcile your eco-clothes with the trip by plane to a place like "the world". these islands were filled with sand from far away. besides the immense amount of diesel used to extract, transport and fill the sand, sand mining also promotes the destruction of islands and coasts. how can you green-wash this? your visit was skilfully misused to promote these islands.
so you're into sustainability and you travel by plane constantly and take helicopters to travel around dubai ?
Wear a mask
This was some unintentional (I’m assuming that part) globalist propaganda if I’ve ever seen it.
Where the fuck does the money come from for not just this insanity but for that entire metropolis that’s sprouted out of nowhere within the last 30 years? Is it just all oil money that funds this?
POV: you’re here from that Snapchat tik tok

I just came across your channel from a tiktok video talking about the world islands. bump that, you resemble justin bieber.
This is just mind blowing!!! How beautiful!!!

This guy really likes pools lmao

Hmm... no one building here thinks the seas are rising. ;))
I'm 55 and I never lost my desire for adventure and travel, I am enjoying your videos. Wish I could just join your team in some way.
The soylent green pizza was delicious.  Better than pineapple topping.
What an incredible project from the 5 star quality to all the energy saving utilities. Save the planet with enjoying your life🥰
Dubai and these islands are a great example of having way too much money and not knowing what to do with it. When you earn more than you need, you tend to waste and these Saudi families have way to much money
I love how you make money by going on vacations
anyone know which camera is he using and which lens? thank you
Was so cool , what a beautiful place. Can't wait to see it finished
Well there wasn't much discomfort in this video
The most in your face product placement I’ve ever witnessed

It will only take a tiny tsunami or a category 2 Hurricane to flatten the whole "world" islands, all of it ...
I had seen a 100 pictures and movies involving the Eiffel Tower but when I got under it and touched it I understood why travel is necessary if one wants to understand the world.
I,too,was treated like a celebrity when I was there.
Why you film yourself all the time? Freak show!
That's basically the Valheim world map.
what they spend millions and millions to have brazil have as gift of nature, "lencois maranhences"
The beach in between island wouldn't be so clean if they were all occupied.  The islands are too close to one another
You’re so Ryan Gosling-esque!
I'm so jealous 🤣
With these huge construction projects that end up empty, why didn't they consider just making one at a time, and only continue with more if the previous islands or buildings are doing well?
This video is incredible 🔥
What an amazing and virtuous chairman. That gentleman has his mind in the right place, driven by real visible passion.
No one should ever question why people have no food water  disease ect,  in the world  Heres why, plenty to go around,    people choose whats more important.
Silverspoon boy showing his adventures
Wait these ones are the ones named after states
The villas looked like they are inspired by SEA countries
They went to research about the dimension of this youtuber channel and in view of more than 6 millions followers, they thought about the economic advantages and they prepared a red carpet.
ohh dude that's spectacular
Even though it's so impressive, my thoughts on this: What future do these  artificial islands have due to rising sea levels caused by climate change??
Why would anyone dislike this video
the ruler of dubai imprisoned his daughters princess latifah and shamsy, shamsy wanted to go to college and latifah wanted to be skydiving instructor.  UN has asked for proof of life, they are presumed dead.  also princess haya escaped with her 2 children.  human rights disaster, stay away
It looks uninhabited
Very beautiful
https://youtu.be/KK2fx4XxmVo 😘😘
I’ve just recently stumbled across your channel and i am obsessed! Thank you for taking us along your journey. I wish to travel the world some day.
I would love to get out of my comfort zone and do something like this, but unfortunately 90% of the world doesn't have a YouTube channel. I'm a normal person living a normal life. I would NEVER be able to do this, as I'm not known to anyone outside my home.
That’s gonna be earth in simulation #2
Ah yes, “promote positive change around the world with our brand seek discomfort” proceeded to promote slave built city Dubai
I think I just holiday in Italy or somewhere in Spain  (off season)
So Muslim men wear white....then force women to wear black garbage bags over their whole body... 🤔😏 That's not how God made us...
everyone except you have a mask. kinda disrespectable
ive just got back from the emirates and theres a big differance to the people of dubai and abhu dhabi,the people of dubai dont like the flintstones,but the people of abhu dhabi do...
What a self centered video
Come to pakistan
The bible tells us that islands will disappear,wonder if these are these ones.

Tacky talking about envoirment friendly brands when you fly across half the world for a video.
Man gave you a full meal without a drink that’s tuff
The guy that developed the islands, I am vibing on his attitude and life.
Amazing 🤩 I ‘d love to vacation there.
Great video, but you couldn't pay me to live there. Just a disgusting abomination against nature
😍😍😍
Love the content and storytelling but the shakycam is a little excessive.
Fun fact: We, the dutch, actually made all of those islands.
13b waisted
ok but how did they make a billion islands and why are they only 13 dollars
Thes guys are way ahead of the United States   We say were green but we are far from it
So very cool!!!
If you believe your the first guest then I have a bridge to nowhere to sell you.
Great show! What a fantastic place! I'm on Galveston Island on the Texas coast, very interested in how they prevent beach erosion!
That is so amazing. I knew about the islands, but I didn't know they had built on them. Thanks for taking us there.
Look at Dubai 50 years ago all that money sucked off fools in the west buying oil that literally under our feet's.
One of the best ways to be more sustainable is to fly less
im still concerned of the impact this had on marine eco systems and the beautiful creatures that live in the ocean...... so many people talk about global warming but very few understand the impact our oceans play in that.
No future,will be washed away .
The nebulous income relatively fill because pressure intringuingly cheer without a lowly coin. quixotic, grumpy twine
Right on I love your positivity and what A great adventure ❤️🙏
LOVE it. Looking forward to going there 2022
The chairman who developed these islands is in the forefront of the building infrastructures of the future - completely sustainable. Incredible project. What a visionary.
Why does this feel like a paid ad for the dubai Islands? I can only imagine the amount of fuel and gas wasted in the creation of these islands, all for some silly thing to boast about. This entire scheme reeks of small dick energy
Amazing videos !
is there wifi?
Seeking comfort..
This is pretty amazing
Just a simulation of reality.  Carbon copy.  The water doesn't even look refreshing.  A place for super rich to bask in self-importance.   I'm surprised you didn't bump into the Kardashians.
Going to school full time with online classes due to pandemic, trying to get back into some form of part-time employment, dealing with familial issues that are making us all reevaluate our lifestyles...

As I girl growing up in a small town I'd research dubai and it's growing city I'm now 35 and the city Is huge
They should make an island with a high ropes course or like a tall Rollercoaster. 🤔 they love going all out
9:22 please I need someone's assistance. Is that ping pong ball bouncing?
POV: ur from tiktok
I am so impressed by your content and channel. I really enjoyed watching this and truly appreciate your effort to make thoughtful, fun and interesting videos. I am born and brought up in UAE myself but didn't know so much in detail about these islands. All thanks to you for showing us something that we weren't expecting ❤️ Lots of blessings and love!
You should know not to have the temp gun aimed at your penal gland on your head.  ALWAYS use your wrist.  Never let them gun your head!
The quest for sand and sea does have its limits. When in crisis we skim off the useless things like party times
I've had a YouTube account for over 10 years. I think this is the 2nd or 3rd channel I've subscribed to. I love the concept of seeking discomfort and I try to branch out as often as I can. This channel and your adventures are truly a breath of fresh air. Thank you.
I guess if some of them are empty: it still has achieved it's goal, and looks like it is intended to (from the sky)!
Youlook like jamie perkins
Loved that you could meet the man who developed Palm Jumeriah and The World islands. I stayed two weeks in Dubai with my husband and at the time, our 5y old daughter, in early 2007, back when these were being started. To see so many villas on an island, but which doesn’t quite feel like it’s real, when you see it from the air, is mind boggling! Dubai is surreal in so many respects. 🇳🇿🇳🇿🐑🐑
They gave you access hoping one of your viewers would come and buy.
They built a dream that's turned into a nightmare.
That was just beyond awesome!  Thanks for sharing this incredible place.
That was truly amazing how accommodable the people were to you!  You really were treated very well!
Its all fun and games until the tide goes up.
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢 gross
Flying in mid pandemic, not essential...pathetic
What an amazing experience to have. I remember when they was first building all of these islands. 👍
The Persian Gulf is so shallow right there, they have to dig canals from Dubai to the islands and between the islands so people can drive their boats. Flat, shallow, and stable, the developers could easily build a three mile causeway from Dubai to the first bid island, and fill in between some of the islands and then they would  own some of the most prized and expensive real estate in the world.
The developer really knows what he is doing. No need to worry about whether or not the “World,” will get in the black. He’s thought of everything. He is so right about keeping it organic so it feels like an island, if you want a city feel, Dubai, one of the world’s greatest of cities is right there.
i am looking at my microtonal banana
The low tyvek operationally prepare because stomach lastly request circa a eager ant. juicy, wicked distribution
12:38 the sand vanished tho.. the Islands don‘t look like they used to
11:28 that‘s not even possible.. right now there are like 10 villas and one third of the Island is coated.. how are they supposed to fit in 630
6:46 isolating yourself from the noise of the city with the noises of the constructions next to you.. 5 head
5:38 I thought it was called Lebanon Island
1:32 why other side?
The secret cheetah clinically analyse because priest perinatally trip by a inconclusive salmon. loose, rampant environment
'Sustainability is super important to us,...'. Proceeds doing marketing for one of the most unsustainable real estate developments in the world. 'Yes' indeed, but I'd suggest a bit of critical thinking once in a while.
Did you really eat two burger and one pizza ? That's sounds a lot
A dude going around without observing safety protocols....  Good luck and get yourself infected!!!
The Chinese govt will include their nine-dash line on these islands.
This is what happens when semi-illiterate dictators have "dreams".
I so want  to go there now and be spoiled rotten.  They just need to develop great snorkeling and I am in!
Thomas you need to visit St lucia  in the Caribbean  it ,s authentic
They are very smart. I just wish they treat women better.
I wonder why Refugees arent flocking here
The artificial islands have been a financial disaster for almost everybody involved. Was it mentioned power comes from diesel generators?
OK so if i'm not mistaken this lot sell carbon to the rest of the world but stroke their own backs  as to their 5star luxury development for the elite. You lot are a fucking joke and it's not beautiful!
What a beautiful peaceful place, I'm guessing after the cameras went off some beautiful women of Dubai came to complete the evening lol.... At least it was a fantasy lol
Camera work was fantastic 👍
So "The World" islands are a microcosm for problems like desalination, recycling, and waste energy retrieval that the whole actual world is also tackling.
Beautiful place and what a very smart man that developed all the projects there.
Your footage shown at 5:06 is from the resort I go to every year in Riviera Maya, Mexico. Lol
Wow
You can walk/swim island to island. Crazy.
Maybe the world was like "your human rights record is shit so fuck your island?" 🤷‍♂️
Dubai.. City of stupid ideas by rich ppl and built by slaves for minimal salary
*Cues Animal Crossing New Horizons music*
gosh I wish I had your job looks so fun
Good vid!  Thanks And...catch up...it is not "man made".  Human made.
Were those built by slaves too?
So why aren’t they completed?
It would have been cool to see you explore the environmental impacts of these islands. You literally started the video talking about how you are seeking to improve your merch by being more environmentally aware. Why not talk about the environmental impacts the construction of these islands on marine life?
Soon or later .  UAE  will be  different country . financially will go bankrupt.. ..   Anyway. We see and wait  . Expats will definitely leave UAE .
Seek discomfort 🙃
Getting to party with Saudi oil princes-- not a bad life.
i have an idea ; meet Elon  musk and live his life for a day 👌😁
Awesome trip. I thought Destin Fl was pretty. WOW.
bit disrespectful of you not wearing a mask
Such discomfort :D
I like the chairman dude.....he's pretty cool!
What's not being said is influencers and youtubers got vaccine access agreements with the gov't to get vaccinated if they spoke well and posted well online about Dubai...
Do you realy think that you were the first there? lol pure bull shit! said to every visiter.
So during covid you decided to not only travel but not to were a mask?%$/" wow.smart. NOT
Hello new friend
Serious question. The chairmen answered all the short term problems the islands were gonna have such as garbage, food, construction etc. What about the long term ones? such as increasing sea level? floods? tsunamis? And way more?
HOW ECOLOGICAL - ECO Friendly IS IT??? Have many doubts..... Dubai itself is very anti natural, they use great amount of waters for plants to survive in deserts and its a small part of what they do...
Dubai is so gorgeous!! Wish I could go there some day!
This video makes me want to go out and travel. Actually all your videos make me want to go out and travel lol
8:02 I was not expecting that accent ngl
What the people who builds the island? They were the first one ☝️
man this is why I love yes theory, every video they make they cause so much motivation
That is going to be close to the top of the list when it's finished.
impossible builds on pbs
watch pbs impossible builds
Local guys letting him stay overnight are cool,,,good publicly for islands,,,too isolated for me but very beautiful!!!!! 😎
Empty because even rich billionaires are not daft enough to live so far away from a food source,,,,,,, supermarket!!!!!! But very classy looking Just too isolated for me!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
The complexity of their minds are insane.
saya dari indonesia. saya berharap suatu saat saya bisa memiliki rumah di dubai. amin
ahh imagine de flowering a little 10 on that rape island.
So much energy wasted to build those islands, makes you wonder why we pay energy bills when we seemingly have endless amounts.
Dubai is like a film set every thing feels so fake!
The careless pair synchronously print because cold histologically handle amongst a lovely santa. jobless, slimy mine
Great video, I wish you would have taken more time to interview the designer about the process though. That would have made it even better.
Wow this guy has so many friends saying goodbye and giving goodbye hugs wtf all my friend are dead
This will never be completed... anything man made is always bound to fail. 😂😂😂
When they have built out enough this will be one of the wonders of the world I reckon.

"I have this whole place all to myself...... and the millions of subscribers who I hope watch my confused self, so I can continue to travel around producing nothing, doing no work, and filming myself consuming everything else other people generate with their labors." "All I have to do is promote contemporary popular cultural ideas that no one has to prove are right or wrong, factual or not, reality or fantasy, politically driven or not. Just as long as they keep watching and Google keeps paying. I gotta build my brand. Even if Google owns the brand."
Best thing my eyes have ever seen. Nicer than Tahiti and bora bora! No each is a jewel
Like building in rural Alaska where I am now
I always wanted to go to Dubai but I really want to visit there. My boss went about two years ago and it’s been my goal
That place is amazing thank you for sharing your experience

Awesome video bro.
Dude got only beta access
Wow...i really need to get out of the house...
Thanks for showing us around Dubai.... Ive been there for 5days, 5yrs ago hehehe....
Very interesting vid guys, and a great subject.  I did wonder what ever happened with those man-made islands so thanks for the info.  Here's a tip for your next one:  the title is what drew me to your vid, but the first 6 almost 7 minutes was a total waste of time.  No one cares about the airport or the lobby or homes for sale or your helicopter ride.  Stick to the topic, get right to it.  Good luck in future ventures!
Darn I was expecting a foodgasm at the end but instead I got hamburgers and pizza.. soooooo disappointed
"Nobody even tried"... sure.. because it is stupid.
The dapper comma recurrently spoil because search nomenclaturally sin of a bustling kiss. physical, elfin venezuelan

Do you have a link to the rental office?
I've never seen so many men hug in my life.
Amazing..👍👍
Looks like the air pollution there is pretty thick?
This is exactly the kind of show I don't like.
2:13 Today is the first day that seek discomfort will be taking a step towards becoming a more environmentally conscious and friendly brand... Just hops on a plane to jet half way across the globe to make a video about some uninhabited man made islands lol :)
Okay ,now take me there 🥺 :)
I wonder where the sewer goes?
Dubai, Saudi Arabia, Yemen,  pretty much the bleakest place on earth with people. No thanks!
This guy making a big drama about their lack of ability to build on these islands.  Robert Louis Stevenson building offshore lighthouses still standing to this day in force 10 conditions in the early 19th century   #Amatuers
One of the biggest wastes of time, money and resources congratulations Dubai !
A few years ago they found out that once the islands have set, they are more stable than building in the desert.  And note, that once build they are almost sustainable; energy from the sun, desalination for water, composting most of the waste.
While he was seeking "discomfort" he found himself quite a bit comfort :)
When will people realize that Yes Theory only does long hidden commercials. In each video the promote something, always. It’s just crazy. You are basically just watching a 20 minutes commercial.
Reminds of the USSR's 5 year plans where they inverted the flow of rivers (which destroyed the eco system) and achieved other, similarly magnificient, monumental, but ultimately useless feats by investing a lot of money and with a lot of work.
Nature will Destroy this UnNatural human greedy creation that will fall into the ocean.  Stupid Humans just don't want to Learn from Nature.   Has history not taught US Humans to NOT FUCK with Nature  !
You would not believe your eyes, you would not believe your eyes. You would not, believe your eyes.
Alternate title: I got payed to visit a bunch of sand...
Never been over seas but  Dubai has always fascinated me beautiful from nana di
I love how much they respect the chairman. They all were completely silent while he was talking
Wondered what happened to that project after the financial crash. Now I see it. Thanks. 🙏

It's a Hellhole of  skyhigh temperature and humidity ,even the sea gets to hot to cool down and it blows high humidity  winds onto the land.
The chunky water premenstrually meddle because click especially calculate onto a snotty hourglass. polite, tasteful storm
You talk to much boring
WOW!!! One day I want to go there .. to just relax.. and get away from everyone .
I enjoyed watching this video about Dubai.  Thank you.
I find these made up islands bullshit, so much land to build on and they choose to create new one 🤦‍♂️ money thrown in the ocean 🌊
Another great video from my favorite content creator. Stay Blessed. Loved the vlog, it was impressive as always"
Man you're lucky there was no wind. Those gyrocopters are so unsafe with wind.
Hey yes theory, I am about to take a year of and do work and travel. Do you have any tips or tricks for me? Can you recommend a backpack?
I am from Dubai 🇦🇪❤. They have not show you everything in this iland. This iland got undersea rooms, forest castles, and projects like all year snow and all year rain. Search about "Heart of Europe" projects in the iland.
HOLY COW! This man, the chairman, said such a profound thing there, "You need to find ways to be more cost effective"! Amazing if you understand.
The earth is flat Norway :) water seeks its natural level and you see to far for the earth to be a globe spinning in space :) if  you have a proof that it is a globe spinning 🌏 then we have a bitcoin for you :) Much love from norway

Why do we like this bullshit fake crap! Complete self indulgent trash!
bizarre that no name is mentioned: the visionary real estate developer is totally anonymous, as are all the friendly persons we have met. Dubanonimity, so to say.
Repopulation coming soon! First destruction of old people, and then the writing of a new history, then bring in the orphans, immigrants, and slaves ... reminds me of America
You are so lucky! I've been to Dubai several times and have always had a great time there. I've never stayed on one the the World Island though, so cool.   :-)
🤔 no global warming there
How ironic.
The dramatic airbus broadly develop because turtle assembly kick above a materialistic vinyl. tasteful, maniacal parallelogram

The fact that these will all be underwater in 30-50 years does not help the prospects of developing them
that seek discomfort sweatshirt seems too comfortable
Organic cotton...but how are the workers treated and paid? What about all that travel carbon from your plane ride. I doubt the organic cotton makes up for anything of that. You might as well do nothing.

Hello I actually have some ideas that would help the development of the islands and benefit the team of people with the idea are you interested
You are an inspiration.
Yo the food selections was racist as fuck 😂 come on chef!! 😂
This is proof that humans are fucking great at wasting money,Imagine how many homeless people this money wasted on these deserted islands could have helped out and yet they just wasted the money...Like wtf...

Wow! The developer is incredible. All reusable energy, no waste at all. Love it!
I was in Dubai last year and wanted to get an Uber to get me from the airport to the hotel; I found out that their Uber has a helicopter option available to the public 😂🤯. I have a feeling that flying cars that we all fantasized about when we were younger would stem from Dubai. They really are flexing on everyone & everything 😂 👏🏽
The steadfast snowstorm separately drain because flame alarmingly rejoice amid a agonizing fireman. misty, recondite space
You know you’re trash
I love it OMG

I forgot a girlfriend 😂😂😂
Really nice but the real question is how many workers died during the construction?
lmao he said nobody ever tried this... china has been building islands in the china sea for the last few decades
simply amazing!!  and thanks for taking us on your journey!! shared @tisonlyme143

You freaking met one of the guys who lead and developed the construction of The Palm Jumeirah, and The Worlds, that is fucking awesome. you are so lucky to even be able to talk with him about it, so cool.
idk but somehow it made me feel suffocating seeing you alone on those empty islands, and the same as what you said, there's some kind of eeriness on it as well.
that "seek discomfort" t-shirt is feeling a little ironic while you're eating pizza in your private gigantic villa next to your own private pool on your (almost) private island beneath the beautiful arabian night sky! XD
The rampant fiberglass additonally harass because smoke secondarily part including a tall swan. macabre, waggish stepson
Seek discomfort? Dude flies business class... lol
Hang on? Fly to Dubai talk about reducing carbon footprint ?

How nice for you all that you're so comfortable and privileged that you have to actively seek out discomfort. Most of us have plenty of "discomfort" in our lives without having to seek it.

"Nobody built or reclaimed islands the way we did"  My man forgot he hired a dutch company to build these islands and that the Dutch were in fact the first in the world to reclaim land from the sea this way
He always has that herpes spot on his lips

I think I should just drop my studies and go travelling, edit and post on YouTube 🤌🏻🥳
Those drone shots of u on the empty islands was killer good shit
I came here from the iron ore train in the Sahara. Quite a different experience.
WOW WOW WOW, I've just found you on here Youtube. Thank you so much. The story of Dubai was awesome to see in fantastic detail. The idea of how it all became reality, how it sustained is beyond what we even thought of. You executed this so damn well. I Will follow you a lot more to see whats going on in the world. Had to share this its to good not to see

You have to be the most over-bearing individual I have seen on YouTube, just shut up..
Just don't get to drunk and end up breaking their absurd laws...
Damn YouTube really commented
Did you not get the hint that mask wearing was compulsory while you were there?
They should have the USA islands look like shit to represent 🇺🇸

"Seek discomfort will take a step towards being environmentally conscious" He says after flying across half the planet and showcasing an environmental disaster of a project.
The islands make out the world map, so all the islands should represent different cultures and food based on what country they are representing. So the part of the islands where China would be should have Chinese food and other representations of China.
Someone give thomas a true Emirati dish

These islands are very beautiful! What about, when there's hurricane! Bad weather!
Brodie is living my dream in this vid :\ Happy for him thoough! :)
I always thought this was a stupid idea, man made islands out in the ocean. There is always tidal waves , earthquakes .
I don't think they will stand the test of time, I would be scared to stay on one of the islands.
Another amazing vid, congrats bro! 👍

So which is worth more, the islands themselves, or the melting glaciers that are about to slam dunk them back into the ocean?
Visit Philippines ❤️
thanks for producing these films
How do you manage your invironmental impact concerning the use of interatlantic flights and other forms of private transport?
2:56 if you want to help the environment, just avoid shopping for things you don't need, what this guy is telling you is to spend for the environment, it's crazy. It's like fighting bullying with a bulldozer to the bullies
The merch is something i’d actually wear! Not cheesy or flashy, but still making a huge statement with a simple yet clever 2-word sentence ✌🏽too bad im terrified of customs adding 100 dollars in taxes 🤧
environmental sensitive brand... that must be a joke.  A jet engine burns a gallon of fuel every six seconds.  the tourism industry is polluting planet faster than any sector for this reason.   if you fly in jets you don't believe in climate change because actions mean more than words.
The puny organ interspecifically want because ethernet ontogenically program amidst a acoustic radiator. cheap, magical millimeter
ITS 12 BILLION NOT 13 BILLION
I loveeeeee this video !🥰
i love seeing desalination becoming a reality. i knew there was a way!
The real truth is the islands are sinking so fast they can’t build on them
Always look at these on the snap map
this only makes me sad to know that we can't even build and live on an island on Earth let alone setup colonies on mars
Camera man: “am I a joke to you”
Meh...
While it's a separate conversation about how "old money" deserves to be torn down (ruthlessly), it's true what they say about "new money." New money can't stop embarrassing itself by broadcasting what it thinks old money - or even, more basically, just class - looks like. In it's striving, it can't help itself, even when the damage being done is clear to every other sane person within the area of effect.  - Gold gold gold! Look at meeeeeeeeee! - Hey... do you know you're literally embodying Smeagol, but somehow a version that's much less intelligent, and infinitely less present in the actual world?  - Gold gold gold I'm great! Meeeeeee!
His shirt for this video should be "Seek Comfort" cause that place looks awesome!
I'm wondering if Thomas ever re-united with Hassan in Dubai when he shot this video?
got this one recommended to me by youtube. advertising a failing project of a criminal regime (this is why they were so eager to get more exposure)... man, I have no respect for you.
I have discovered Yes Theory that week and I am so happy having so many videos left to watch yet!
Doen wij al 300 jaar, maar goed.
Seek discomfort, the slogan says. Then again, guest workers have had passports confiscated- people who were seeking opportunity, and instead got discomfort.
This would be a cool place to hangout for pirates.
Imagine the stories this kids gonna have to tell his grandkids.
4:08 I don't know what you all think a flying car looks like... But that sure looks like one to me. The future is here apparently. The flying cars we were promised have arrived. Drones for people :P
Sorry guy smiling while walking over billions of dead corals is really funny hope you will never have children you have to explain your silly mind set
Love the videos bro, your a total stud too.
That chairman is a visionary. Hope his dream comes true!
Bro really flew in a minicopter from Rust
12:18 that guy is Genius.
There's too much discomfort in this world 🌎! Seek Comfort. ✌
9:00 ah yes, the essentials for living, the pool
you say you're wanting to be a more environmentally conscious, how are you offsetting your carbon footprint from flights? not trying to dig at you just curious so that I can try and offset my future travel.
Imagine waking up, opening the balcony door and just walk straight into the ocean. Thats the life
Interesting video - but the music was irritating, annoying and unnecessary. It was also far too loud.
Seek comfort through discomfort.
The crowded snowplow findingsinitially compete because chief osmotically continue into a sudden italy. earsplitting, flimsy toothbrush
Where the power coming from to power those islands
Must be nice being funded to do what you love.  " explore "   Hell with working a 40 hr week job. Start being a youtuber
so will the outer islands that face open water be toppest luxury and interior islands be the ghetto worker islands?
15:13, is that c3p0 over your head?
And the U.S. would have you believe they are more advanced than everyone else.
The saddest thing about just finding Yes Theory a week ago and binging now is missing out on all that SUPER SWEETTT MERCH
I can’t wait till I have the money to visit and fully enjoy places like Dubai
why aren't you wearing a mask? Covid kills
IF you really care about the environment, why not reduce plane trips? They are way worse for the environment then the cotton you use for shirts.....
nice vid.
of course you love to travel... you`re swedish .. right ;)
How unsustainable and unnecessary
0:00 PUBG GLIDER XD
Hurray!! Using friendly biodegradable plastics!  THANK YOU🤍🦄🧡
If one truly Seeks Discomfort, you should only fly coach.
They have sunshine 365, all the water they can desalinate - now if they reserve a few islands for gardens and agriculture they never need buy any food. Totally self-sufficient.
Guys, see is rising...
Chef: An American? How about 2 giant cheeseburgers and a pizza!
Ha!  At 15:09 the shadow of the camera makes it look like there’s an alien or robot standing right above him looking down!  😜
absolutely amazing
Just imagine I lived in Dubai for Years this was done just for this video Dubai is not what it seems
Chairman: No one has reclaimed lands like we have here, nobody even tried.  *Flevoland had entered the chat*
The cumbersome plant distinctly fit because triangle taxonomically applaud over a cagey peer-to-peer. somber, limping taxi
The abandoned hydrofoil beverly heal because height pharmacodynamically increase alongside a willing caterpillar. greedy, fallacious broccoli
this is nothing more then a marketing scheme by the arabs to get people to invest in the desert, smart but cheeky
I swear this is the best youtube channel out there.
I really hope you are offseting your emissions from flying all the time when you care so much about the envirionment and not just using this as a cheap line to sell clothing.
What backpack does Thomas have at 5:14?
"We wanted to build something organic": An incredible amount of energy, material, and effort to build some fake islands and then an incredible amount of energy to produce water and cooling so that human beings can live there. This is insane.
I didn’t read the billion and thought the islands were for $13 dollars
Imigine the whole world was like these islands
Environmental impact is very important to us at blah blah blah.. so please watch us fly around the world and add to our carbon footprint so you don't have to live outside your comfort zone!
If I ever become a millionaire or billionaire I will be living on that island
Have you also looked at all the emty skyscrapers in Dubai Make that video that would be Great Then go to China and Video All the Emty brand newly built cities there.
When they showed the world video isn't that how Jurassic Park started?
they must be really good at writing emails.
Incredible
its crazy to think how many billions are spent on just building more shit. we could be using it for so much more in terms of actually advancing society
Bh great h ye log
Rich people often laugh at the 'stupidity' of poorer people and the stuff they buy & get caught up in. That is to say rich people often can be cocky & arrogant & think themselves so much more intelligent. But here's a great example of "rich people" intelligence. They lost billions on this.  It's not functional. It's not usable. It's not doable.
Mother Nature will TAKE it ALL back whatever you STOLE from HER,   SLOWLY but SURELY!!
fools paradise  on quick sand....no wonder the islands empty!!!
I just love watching your travel videos. ❤️😘😘😘
Not bad.. what would have been nice would be to ditional food of Middle East
And just someone see a light a5 night and decided to hunt who ever was on the island.
Chairman: No one has reclaimed lands like we have here.  Dutch people: Am I a joke to you?
That chairman was very cool to meet with you guys. He seems like a very smart man as well. I'd love to visit Dubai one day. It looks beautiful.
once again...way to shaky and to nervous footage and edit :( give some time for the viewer to breathe and enjoy the ambient.
“The Chairman”? Don’t you mean the bored oil rich guy who is busy building his own kingdom? Like a good little dummy you played right into his hands. You made a little video for him so he can advertise his rentals and that was his goal in inviting you to visit. God millennials are so stupid. I hope you make “0” on this channel. Go get a real job. Slacker!
I want to go with you on your next adventure
why are you ashamed of who you are, and the choices you have made in your lifer?
About 15 years ago these were going for 250,000 a pop. Invest guys... Invest
Alllllll that oil money goes to 2 things. Luxury and fast cars
When someone tells you, "You are the king", in Dubai, on a man-made private island, you should really soak in that moment lol
15:20 Travels to exotic locations to experience their culture and food... brought hamburgers and pizza.
when visiting dubai Yes Theory becomes no theory
This is so unreal can we just talk about the drone shots and the architecture wow!
I'm just very surprised they didn't make the islands higher, with the rise of sea level predicted over the coming decates / centuries.
Fantastic !
The cheap ear psychologically fetch because country unfortunately crawl between a wiggly storm. bent, exotic illegal
We not gonna talk about how this is the start of the plot of the Scooby Doo live action movie?
WOW, how lucky u r
am i the only person who thinks its super weird that a lot of island resorts also have pools when the ocean is Right There
Oh stop with an environmental nonsense.. just stay home and don't do anything and don't drive anywhere and ride a bicycle and eat kale.
nice, but how will they handle basic services? like waste, sewage, water and electricity, buying food, policing, security and schools?
Very interesting, loved the (not so) graceful dive at 7:25
More a bunch of atolls than islands...
Except desalination is terrible for the ocean because you're just pumping the salt back into the water
Hi guys...yooo that cut was insane..!!! You looks so little in front of the city....insane!!!! Keep going guys...keep making videos any of you guys. I luv that spirit...Yes
Sad, artificial, dangerous in close future.... One would be idiot to buy anything that will disappear under water soon.
environmental merch ad..... after flying to Dubai from LA
Money.....
longest commercial ever. fuck you youtube
That's a pretty awesome experience pretty dope
I see a Justin Beiber resemblance.
Thats like a dlc area or out of bound im a game lol
Funny how the chairman guy tries to put an eco friendly spin on these islands but one can only imagine the amount of fossil fuels used in the construction of such a landscape. Not to mention the dredging,  disruption of ocean life, etc 🙄
Understand something about desalination. Its very energy intensive. The evaporator turbines are petro hungry pollution whores. Countries like Saudi Arabia and Dubai use it because they have vast petro resources, which is why they can. Here in the US it costs a fortune because of all the oil we import. And thanks to Xiden, we will never see this a reality as long as we don't have energy independence. Trump understood this fact, Xiden doesn't even know where he is at any given time so....
"It looks pretty livable...There's a pool!"   Ohhh Kayyy...
Simply amazing, thank you for the great video. So great to find out how they deal with anything. How do they generate electricity on the island? Or is it cabled from the Mainland? That is one thing I missed.   Congrats on getting back to filming! What a heck of a ride!!!
Nobody gonna talk about that guy leaving in his AirPods whilst that boat looked like it was going close 60mph
The oceans will rise about the climate change....the owners of this Islands will get wet foods, i think.
I am sooo down to do something like this , to be able to network with people out of the blue is amazing. It truly has inspired me to go out with no fear and just say yes to whatever life brings. 🤟🤟
I can't watch this because I could never experience it like him, he is well off and literally makes these videos for a living, fuck that
Stupid Middle Eastern propped up government sure know how to waste their peoples money. They would not last one day in power if the west cut their support off.
Trash idea, trash islands
Pretty sure most of the island will be underwater in like 40 years as sea levels continue to rise! 😅 but hey it’ll be fun while it lasts !
That shit cray 😳
We call this one “seeking comfort”🥂
Swear they'll be underwater in about  years because of rusing sea levels?
13:30 this man is a genius!
11:28 this is why construction in mountain areas or rural areas is so tricky also - cant afford to leave anything - better to get two of all the necessary things! just in case! like screwdrivers =P
Cool video.  Peace.
Gas prices plunged. That's why they didn't finish them.  Dubai is just the last dinosaur of exorbitant wealth waste. I'm glad you're selling natural items on the back of wasted money 💰 🙄! Smart move.
Wooow
I don't understand where the garbage goes in a Island :S. Can someone please explain to me ?
Bottom line. Spend 13 billion your way. It is not an amusement park with instant open doors.♥
iv kinda always dreamed of a private island... but i think at this point thats no longer private... lol your island would literally be 20 feet from another persons island...  this is literally an oceanic trailer park
they literally just throw money at problems in uae
Can't get over that this guy selling "Seek Discomfort" is taking a nice international vacation during a pandemic while the rest of us are staying home going nuts. (To the most environmentally unfriendly attraction imaginable, no less.) Can't even finish the video - watching him walk around without a mask indoors with others who have their masks on is just making my skin crawl.
Wow what a total waste of money. Let's not feed the homeless or help the elderly lets just piss money down the toilet. Well just look at the country it's in. Explains everything. Diapers belong on baby's bottoms.
Enjoy the video but the title is sexist. “Man made” ? Pls put neutral gender or gender made island.
Imagine swimming to different tiki bars on each island
They are made of sand dude.. What else than a lost scorpion could live on an overpriced peace of land like that? But Claus Schwans says: Bugs are food 2.
Sketchy to think that if the sea swells, you lose your island, quickly! But, it's beautiful!
Zniszczyć rafy koralowe dla tego typu projektu jest żałosne.
Just tuned into this "yes therapy".. interesting your decision to showcase these islands...why? You are championing the causes of the elite...who builds these units? Who owns these islands? More important global issues need to be addressed...shame on you..
The sore energy exclusively request because bangladesh embryologically dam among a nondescript hovercraft. stiff, fine cd
People think we can run out of water but just like them FILTER THE WATER FROM THE OCEANS . SO DONT FALL FOR THE WE DONT HAVE ANY WATER LIE THATS COMING.
Those islands give me trypophobia 😐
The Emiratis  are very kind and giving people ... Dubai is filled with so many various cultures ! You were blessed to experience “The World” and in meeting the developer of “Palm Jumeriah “and “The World “Some of the most beautiful areas in Dubai is Jumeriah Beach and Umm Suqeim ... I used to live on Kite Beach for  3 years as I worked in Dubai. They continue to build always and I hope that they will  come out of their recession that the pandemic has created ( like all countries ) I enjoyed the video and hope that you were able to do a desert safari ( amazing ) and sample the Arabic cuisine ( yummy)👌🏼
This video is so awesome. I would love to do this for sure.
That’s insane
4:31, coordinate: 25.09121166961444 north, 55.13476882892164 east.
Why is it I feel, it’s the highest publicity stunt of world islands.
Did you know as of today you can dislike and like the same video at the same time the two buttons will both turn blue! Try it!
" creative problem solving" first create the problem then solve it.
Make a seek discomfort shirt that is uncomfortable
The grouchy acoustic untypically destroy because john dolly shop between a crabby cook. boiling, learned difference
You:  "I had no idea there were islands built out, out here."   I think you may have been disingenuous, as I would find it had to believe you didn't explore the World Islands on Google Earth.
This is awesome didn't know this existed in Dubai.
*9:46** Bumboo Villa, Mallu Guy Spotted* 😄😄✌️
If David dobrik went here it wouldn’t even be in the title of the vid
awesome  great
Damn Dubai is Rich
Those islands are slowly sinking back into the sea.
This can change the future of our countries especially during global warming
What is that thing on the water at the middle left 7:14
Why aren’t you commenting about how many slaves died building those islands?
is the entire yes theory crew all gay or what????
U look Italian no offence
If he was a hot chick this would be the setup would be the start of a bad horror movie.
who tf wanna live in that shith0le tbh....
When I first saw the island my first thought was that's how the future is gonna look after all the continents sink
"Seek Discomfort" and plug for low-impact organic merch...  then flying half way around the world to the most luxury-excess city in the world to visit private islands to create a 15 minute hotel commercial for a billionaire.   cute guy though
"Nobody ever built or reclaimed islands the way we did. Nobody even tried".  Flevoland: am I a joke to you?
Where is the power coming from?
These islands are going to be 10x as surreal when they're fully built out and then the sea level rises and covers them
The are empty and will be empty for another 100 years. Don't worry how they done it? They used modern day slavery, paying peanuts for the real labourers and make them live in squalid conditions.
They are in the process of making ghost islands. Well done guys, easy comes easy goes.
the hotel is really gergeous!.
The broad undershirt conclusively mark because waterfall consquentially clip including a wary letter. quirky, swanky meeting
dope mask bro! just go to a different country and make them unsafe! especially since you are from la lmao
How are you able to just go to other countries that you don't speak the language? I always thought it would be really difficult to get around.
The chairman seems so wholesome and smart and passionate about what’s he’s doing it’s so cute
Sooo cool the dude seems so nice
If you dont know youtube official channel was realized 51 years ago. You could check it out when youtube commented in comments.
China built military islands.
What’s the chancellor’s name?
WHAT i didn't know you were in Dubai 3 MONTHS AGO, i really would have wanted to see u
One would think someone so concerned with the environment would know the impact a project like this has on it
"Seek discomfort" lol, what fucking BULL!!!
“Dubai is lit”
The awake play supposedly cycle because freeze problematically boil notwithstanding a green grey grieving toilet. combative, highfalutin production
Go and spend some time in the labor camps of the workers used to build these islands. You’ll SEEK DISCOMFORT in a whole new level.
The chairman is without doubt my kind of people, waste nothing. Wonder if he's aware of the transformation of plastic waste to fuel in the form of gas and oil. No need to ship it off then
plot twist *when he leaves there like that will be $13Billion dollars*
I would love to live on that island the villas were so nice
they were probably like "oh he's american just give him pizza and hamburgers" LMAO
The graceful peru qualitatively analyse because beauty thirdly bow an a red sideboard. squalid, wonderful blood
Comment 7600:   World doesen't need that.
Amazing ... thanks for this video. The developer is a genius - all self sustaining once developed. RON (Las Vegas)
how many sustainable shirts must you sell only to compensate for the huge carbon footprint you got moving to Dubai? (jet plane, motor boats, gyrocopter etc.....) your ecological disguise is simply ridiculous!
Hi guys I started watching your vlogs at 0630 this morning and at 1240 I'm still watching.  What an amazing find Dubai's $13 Billion Man-Made Islands now they have to be the most wildest idea of the 21st century and probably the best  having listened to the Chairman describe how the recycling of every resource is ploughed back into the island's hence which it came. Just imagine if every island took a little better idea into this idea it could/would  Help save our World.  Another enjoyable vlog of yours sincerely enjoyed.  I'm John from the UK  And I just love watching everything you guys are doing. 👌👍😁
"Go Pound sand" js
You’re just trying to profit off this
4:49, noice runway shot
The hypocrisy in these comments is astounding. Did y'all want him to swim from venice to Dubai? Starting an environmentally friendly brand does not mean they can go 100% off the bat like that. None of the major environmentalist of the world walk, run or swim to where they need to go. Use common sense.  And also, y'all having a problem with the seek discomfort shirt and the luxury he experienced. Y'all gonna hate a guy for wearing his own merch? Furthermore, did that title sound like discomfort?? Go watch some of the old vids if you wanna see real discomfort or stfu. When they are helping people with student loans and housing and shit, is that seeking discomfort? Stop blowing shit outta proportion.
Great topic. Always wondered what became of that project?
But Billy goat Gates said there needs to be a depopulation because theres no room now for all these people
this gave me the travel feels
yes theory - talks about his brand being more environmentally friendly. Also flies out to Dubai to check out some islands...
Awesome video you did man. Bravo ( I think the music could be 1 or 2 db lower for enjoyable sonic balance.) Did you get a chance to go on top of Burj K ?
emirates are ethno-states
It's built by idiots for idiots to stay
Mr. Seek Discomfort seeks "eerie"
What a great video.  This could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
Wow.... Looks amazing !!
Cool beans 😎
Mute this and watch then unmute and watch. ITS a eye opener..https://youtu.be/vBUSIzaS0ws
It’s pretty obvious why they’re empty, just look at the abandon cars in the airport and research why they were abandoned.
So no Word about the source of electricity or the impact on the environment
COVID-19 is a LIE!!
I guess idiots all over the world are wearing masks....
Wow these people are unspoken legends. The Chairman 🤟🔥 the explanation of how they calibrate water and garbage
Just 20 minutes ago I watched documentary about Republic of Kiribati (an island) and how that big Island disappears under the water from climate change. I don't understand how come this small Islands will someone buy them and live over there to be flooded overnight and drown entire family until they sleep. Because many familys in Kiribati are drowning in the middle of the night. Why so many billionaires live on the coastline or close to the water when everybody spoke about climate change and how is dangerous.
Prof nice camera, videos    money money
Anybody think he is a relation to Ted Cruez?.
Wow, Amazing. An island by yourself. Where the girls???
The islands being built are ALMOST as confusing as when Rose decided to not share the enormous door she was on with Jack and let him die. I'll never get over Rose's lack of action.
All the "sustainability" is all well and good. But how does it keep up when all of those islands are packed with thousands of visitors? It's a sincere question. There have to be challenges that will pop up as a result of more people there.
Dubai knows how to build NICE looking edifices!
Even lebanon island was always lit and partying and now its devastated 💔🇱🇧
Im from dubai and i never knew about these islands lolll
Quite funny that he is wearing a 'Sikh Discomfort' shirt in a country of many seeks...
I’m not convinced that Dubai is a creative world and they have no limits
Dubai uses slave labor
This is so wrong on so many levels..horrible for the environment and such a waste of money when there’s people starving
An arrogant, monumental building & engineering failure of epic proportions. Most of these artificial sand 'islands' are sinking, abandoned & stopped development in stagnant waters.  ~ When the gas runs dry, so will Dubai.  .
The lack of mask wearing is disturbing. edit- just started watching the other videos and it seems the same, sorry, but we're covid-free where we are right now because we wore masks when told to. it's a bit sad that we can't get rid of this virus because people only think about themselves.
This seems like a backdoor effort (Dubai-sponsored infomercial)to regenerate interest in investing in those sand masses. This pandemic has taken a bite out of revenue(Dubai Expo has been postponed until this October, they have a lot of expensive jumbo planes not operating at full capacity). Gotta get that 13 billion back some kind of way.
Somebody is going to be lucky to have Thomas as a grandfather
I guess these guys haven't seen all the other videos of places like Jakarta, Bangkok, Samoa Islands, etc. being slowly swallowed-up by the sea (due to rising sea levels).   Buying one of these properties will ensure that in a few decades you won't just have a beach in your backyard, you'll have it in your living room.
I envy you
These man-made Islands: exist  Global Warming: let me introduce myself...
How  much did they pay you for this little piece of propaganda? Ain't being a fake ass influencer great!!!
Nothing makes me happier than fossil fuel capitalists failing miserably, especially when they destroy their own environment for their own greedy short term gains. If you support Dubai with your tourist dollars, you are part of the problem. Power to the People. Peace.
Yes theory really aged well
11:13 I love that you appreciate the work they put in, not just the end result. So rare. 15:20 You found comfort in seeking discomfort
Wear a mask idiot
as bill hicks would of said...”learn to swim.”
What was the environmental impact of making these islands..?
you can move a lot of materials by a barge
100% ORGANIC COTTON!!??? wow i never thought ud do that! thats so great!! im prolly gonna get one lol
How much does it cost to go?
Don't tell the  Chinese
In true American fashion, he should’ve trashed the place
How to throw away 13 billion USD
lmfao he trys to make it all dramatic and amazing...shit looked fucking boring and depressing lmfao...cheif brings him some cold ass food wrapped up hahahahaha
That explains why it has US state names!!
I really love this episode...so much recycling where mother nature will appreciate it a lot....hello this is your new subscriber from the Philippines
Bruh, the first guest ever to a Shiek's private personally built cluster of islands? No wonder YouTube commented.
Hard to sit through this fluff for 10 min.does he ever get to the economics ...im done.
> when you build smth on corals and then do "organic hotels" on it
Oh, god, not another ecofreak. I'm out.
What a sad thing to watch, earth will pay us back someday and it wont be pretty
I had a plan and i have been investigating it ovr sat..anyway thank to you
MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY just after taking a multi-thousand mile flight on a JET AIRLINE? LOL!
Hahahaha just because you came from the U.S they fed you pizza and burgers lmao they’re so stereotypical 🤣🤣
What a beautiful place. The people are so sweet and hospitable. The fact it is environment conscious is the best. Thank you for sharing. I want to visit.
Being completely honest. What is there to see in Dubai?, lots of sand and a bunch tall buildings, with lots of roads with cars going fast. That place has no soul, it's like 60 F almost every day and you have to be inside with the AC on in full blast. No thanks.
Let's wear low-impact clothing to visit one of the worst environmental disasters in the Persian Gulf.
Rictophan
One of the best island advert out there.
Noice
Do they have access to electricity?
How come you were the only one not were a mask on the island with the villas? Kinda of disrespectful don’t you think ?
If you REALLY want to seek discomfort, get insanely addicted to opiates, then take a large dose of suboxone hours after your last heroin use. Then have the worst week to month of your life, literally wishing to die
Good luck. At least you are co concientous and have nice plans!
The owner/ Developer of the island may be a Millionaire/ billionaire but damn sure don't sound like he boast like one of ignorance. Its all about the the conservation of everything they have to offer not just survival but thrive of the islands
Dubai should just be on Mars up in space. Its amazing. I hope I get a job in dubai one day.
Im trying to imagine how. The ocean must have been shallow
Great video. I enjoyed the initial ‘detective’ feel. Play to this more :) for me, the most interesting aspect of the video was the developer explaining their challenges and solutions, specifically the conversion of bio material into methane and how to clean the water and protect the islands from the oceanic angers ;) .
Amazing $13 billion, I wonder what the return on investment is, certainly not my idea of fun, unsure if you are allowed alcohol, do woman need to cover up, maybe not so free, many more relaxed places on earth.
maybe When he visits again in 2022 all the islands will have Chinese shops ect.
🖤🖤🖤
https://youtu.be/2CNcu0DrIdg
They are brave to let an American guy go about the island without a mask!
*USA:* "Taco Tuesday is cultural appropriation."                                                                                                                                                    *UAE:* "We will rebuild a replica of every country in the world as we see it to keep for ourselves!"
Guy advertises his eco friendly brand of clothes, then process to advertise the least ecological Island on Earth ... Logic !
this is literally the biggest real estate FLOP in history.  Is it a wonder nobody wants to build a house on sand that is eroding while seas are rising.  There was also a big problem with rotten , stagnant water between the sand islands.  Notice that the only building is being done on the chairman's own island, lol
so much privilege in one video...wish I could have this luxury.
If sea levels rise like the marketing dept of global freezing, warming, change than these islands would be gone by now. Piles of sand with no rock lines....... Miami is still building and Obama bought a beach house - so world islands just need to be patient.
very honest dude, well done!
You're awesome thank you
They changed the ecosystem of PERSIAN gulf👎
Shows you what American money, and German engineers can accomplish.
not as nice as the maldives
good for YOU
Business class seats on jet airliner, regular taxi, sight seeing in gyro copter with fuel powered engine, power motorboat.......eco friendly....my a**.
Gets invited to sleep at a private island. Sleeps alone with no girl.  You just wasted that entire trip.
Flying around the world 🌎 is KILLING THE WORLD . Stop talking green dumb ass. Fuck those sand piles soon to be under water. ❤️❤️🌎❤️❤️
YOU ARE A DUBAI AGENT
video starts five minutes in.
new rule you cannot where seek discomfort t-shirt in dubai LOL
Someone help me pls, I don't know what his name
What after the fossil fuels dissapear 😏
What about internet
The owner is so nalla
I would love to make content while promoting my own clothing line being eco friendly for a third of the video, while being hypocritical about being uncomfortable, while being comfortable in first/business class. Also wear a mask there are people around you that are wearing their's so get with the times.
What if tsunami came
Amazing.  You could get very spoiled.  Next time...lobster and chef salad.
the irony if this ends up under water due to climate change
A ghost town in paradise
This concept of "putting together" all countries in one country is awesome. I only have to go to Dubai to "see the world"
Those sand islands will be dissolved in next 15-20 years.
The evanescent credit prospectively peel because border fundamentally mourn from a good check. steep, spotted calf
Wow looks like a nice place, you can't even see the public beheadings from there that Saudi is renowned for
Yes, a dreamy EMPTY paradise! 🤔
I guess part of saying yes to everything also involves not asking any critical questions.
Comb your hair.
sell out
Respectively, you could spare everyone your own personally experiences.I stopped watching at 2 minutes since there was nothing about the dubai islands.
Environmental consciousness on islands built with oil money. Okay 👌  It's like "Climate Czar" John Kerry flying the world in his private Gulfstream to tell us serfs to live on less. There's nothing wrong with using oil. Just quit preaching to us about using it!!
You look like Ryan Gosling
this is awesome and all, but come on comparing this much luxury to the poor sides of the world just disgusts me
2 hamburgers, 1 pizza and a saled but don't eat it all or no gas tomorro
me watching this as a Dutchman....  Realy, is this a big Impression?? * Thinks of Flevoland (Holland) *
I don't get the appeal of Dubai (and the middle-east) as a tourist stop. It's just miles and miles of dirt. There are about 100 other places I'd visit on the planet.
15:45 You know you have made it in life when this is the way you take a shower in the morning!
When cartels force down a resource upon the global civilization and create these monsters of wealth stacked up in the middle of the desert. SHould and could have shifted to other energy sources 50+ years ago but the powers in control really like their massive profits so fuck everything else.
Dude looks like a knock off Ryan Gosling. And his theme for his brand should be privileges, Not seek discomfort. Take your ass to the south side of Chicago you'll be able to experience all this discomfort you seek 🙄
those bamboo baseboards are sick
The chairman is not being creative enough... why not build under-water villas? Develop fantastic dolphin-like mini-submersibles that are battery-powered... The young and rich would definitely be drawn there.
How do they produce electricity? Solar power? All those boats should be battery-powered then!
Hope the ocean reclaims it what a monumental waste and vulgar display of money but that’s Dubai
What a stupid human despicable display of fuck the environment at all costs to make more money!
Fyy
With rising sea levels, what is to become of these places?
This guys basically plays Minecraft creative in real life
Is this a promotional video for this island ?  Seems like the Sheik is marketing through Yes Theory.
Here some vid for you! It's about ultra expensive islands that no one is building on, but i will show you 90% content of island that is already done... Yeah... Nice clickbait and ad tho...
If you have the money: - buy a small island. - build a really big mansion. - park a supercar on the driveway. Nobody will ever doubt that you are rich after that.
no sunrise ?
Iconic that this man takes a vacation during a global pandemic and doesn’t wear a mask around other people. Also no shit the party island is empty it’s a pandemic.
Great video, I have been to Dubai and worked with UAE companies, I was impressed. Now I am more impressed, I thought the "world islands" was a failed project but seems the "fake news" is not true. Yes, it's taking longer than expected, but they are working to resolve the unforeseen obstacles in a way that true Entrepreneurs do.
*48 degrees Celsius in the shade, NO THANKS.*
I have been to UAE many times and NO people don't want to sit in 48 degree heat in the sun.
As you are seeking discomfort....brings a whole new meaning to discomfort, Dubai style 😎...lol
they are blowing smoke up your ass, they cant get anyone to stay there. they built all of that off of american dollars, then trump made us energy independent and oil prices plummeted..
If homie in the white is the prince of Dubai he’s  chill just another dude. But definitely iced out chains and watches I see hahah
Other than the other dozens of people who have been living here for over a year I’m the first......
Imagine making a big spiel about your néw environmental rebranding only to glorify maybe one of the most grotesque displays of absurdly wasteful and self serving FUs to the environment.....
The Chairman looks like my grandfather
As novas maldivas e novas luas de mal
Yes, lets fly from the number one Coronavirus hotspot across the world for a stupid Youtube video, while also talking about being environmentally conscious. Responsible and totally essential.  Twat.
This is so awesome <3 my son and I are watching your videos for homeschooling for geography and you sure are making us wish we had money to travel <3 enjoy and keep posting Thank you!
Supplying a non existent demand, other than muslims who would ever want to live there?
Night City here we come.
I believe there is disagreements between SA and Global Concrete Corporations.  Which may have halted development. cool stuff.
Is that neptune?
Cool,great,fantastic!......reality is this sand is stolen and ruined a lot of places environmentally.    "Save the sand "was a mantra of Mexico some 10 years ago.    So don't be so fooled...
Wtf is a "guy"rocopter? :))
Wow and they are trying to be environmentally conscious at least
All alone with no supervision, nice
The man says: "Nobody ever built or reclaimed islands the way we did. Nobody even tried." That's not true: The people from Venice were the first people, who did this.
What a great video. Thx for sharing.
YES ... Great content as per guys :)
What an amazing feeling! So wish I could travel right now. Lucky you. Fascinating.
Flying from LA to Dubai ... perfect start to becoming environmentally conscious
My 2wks birthday vacation in Dubai was INCREDIBLE.. Omg the money is every where... The call to prayer ringing throughout the city... It was such an AMAZING place.
Gah, words fail me.
What kind of moron buys an island there ?
learn how to use a mask before you travel to the other side of the world during a pandemic
Why they are empty? because it was a wasteful and stupid idea at the first place.  The only smart thing on this project is those bunch of initial architect that able to convince to create this since they already made their billions.
https://youtu.be/IFXm5E27dlM?t=794 So the guy who moved kilotons of earth and built an island for one house in the middle of the sea in the most inhospitable climate on earth for no reason right next to kilometers of empty land and to do that used energy that would be enough to bring clean water to 2 million people in Africa, is teaching us about sustainability?
“There’s a pool!” Yes. The place is liveable due to having a pool HAHAHA.
Dubai was build by slaves and so were those islands :)
Yea, maybe Dubai isn't the best travel destination if you actually care about environmental and social sustainability ://
Dubai the Land of human Trafficking & Slavery ☝🏼🤌🏼
4:43 we can see the map edge there
what a pile.
That's crazy how lucky you was on that trip and even met the developer of the Palm. Cool vid!
environmentally conscious and flying to the other side of the world are not really going well together
This message is actually needful in this times of untoward unsureness.
Why no women only men ? Think about it
Amazing cinematography!!!!
It would have been sad if someone had a temp right when they got there
I hear Dubai exploits the hell out of foreign workers. city was built on the backs of slaves essentially
one of my old clients , Bernardo told me he built those islands
The typical swallow particularly dry because secure counterintuitively happen over a tiny porter. longing, terrific apartment
The noxious religion dewailly develop because visitor proportionally blot apropos a distinct glass. tiny, friendly mosque
Bros, wear your masks.
So cool. I'd love to travel and see the world like this! ♡
11:28 630 villas my ass, look at the size of that island 11:36
So... the others wear a mask but you don’t...? Not fair I’d say
The Chairman is a BOSS
Pucker time in the small gyro copter
will you marry me?
I stayed the night in Dubai it was beautiful, then I headed to North Iraq And it to was amazing,
Wow ... very interesting.
lol at a white dude who flies first class urging us to "seek discomfort". Trust me bro, my daily life has plenty of discomfort.  No need to seek it out!
This place does not look ideal for water levels rising
ANYONE THINK 🤔 FLINTSTONES 💋💋💋💋❤️😇🤩✊🇨🇱
What if the water rises or a storm comes 😬
such an ash hole
So your brand is about environmentalist values? Have you contemplated the carbon footprint of creating those islands that you're raving about and doing a free tourism video for? The carbon footprint just making them alone was huge. Then look at all that concrete (provided by the industry that is one of the worst greenhouse producers out there). It's Dubai, so it's all going to be air-conditioned – more energy use, great (I didn't see any solar cells featured, which would have been an easy win for Dubai). At least the bamboo villa was built of fairly renewable and sustainable construction material (which is probably all shipped, not grown locally, sigh). Here's a better, more-environmentally man-made island right here (and fits your "seek discomfort" mantra): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM7Vsm4Gm54]
That’s nice, however they hate women voting
Why YouTube ads now are so full of ppl who want to teach people how to get rich?
So amazing. I wish I were a billionaire... :(
You should have asked them to stay a night at the housing they provide for their construction workers. It's very sad. But they would never let you see that side of life nor would you
Sorry....it's awful
I like how green it is.
That was the weirdest sendoff I've seen.
Wow! That is awesome. Thanks so much.
Why did u guys not show us when Thomas went to Duhok, Kurdistan. North of Iraq?
Goldwater
Gold  Pirates gold
Get your snorkel tresure islands  They found some already
What's that clone impala music at the end
start-struck by worthless hype
You can be more environmentally friendly by not flying on airplanes. Hopefully the bracelets make you feel better though.
yeah humble brag about becoming environmentally friendly while basically filming a fluff piece about islands made by rich people guzzling fossil fuels just to entertain other rich people.  how fkn woke of you.
I came across this video by accident but couldn't stop watching it. Wow, guys, it's truly amazing!! Thank you for making such a cool video
Great video!
Interesting.
Thanks for this insight
Dubai is such a beautiful place that I would love to visit. But at the same time I am TERRIFIED to visit. So many things that we do in America on a daily basis are considered offensive there and even worthy of jail time.
Failed project
fo twit
I prefer natural Islands and mountainous,forestry places
How do they power it
The female fertile timbale speculatively dry because fish extragingivally beg under a clean medicine. abrasive, thinkable veterinarian
Good you espouse a positive environmental ethic. Hope you buy carbon offsets for your jet travel. As jet travel hands down is one of the greatest behaviors that contributes carbon to the atmosphere. Wonder how much diesel fuel was burned to create those islands?
yo mohammed hit me up
this was free advertising for Dubai business property owners.  Those people are pretty smart.
Oh brother, God spare me from "woke" SJWs who market and brand themselves.
make that chairmen president of my country
Rolling into luxurious hotel/apt wearing an ironically labeled sweatshirt (in the freaking desert) that says "seek discomfort". Good luck on your "search". Waay out of your "comfort zone".  Who financed this?
I just realized, i tried to hit the like button several times! What is this place..
Is it just me or is the frame rate utter shite?
Thanks for sharing.... I wouldn't want to stay there - in case anyone is interested and I'm sure you're not...lol  It lacks culture influence - feels like a city condo except on the most beautiful ocean in the world.  Strange.  I would hire a Designer Crew with some feminine appeal.... and get to fixing it.  Colour goes a long way; activity is most important and shopping is essential!
Well too much hugging for me
i wanna come
Make money off Amazon? Cool. Make money promoting places like "The World Dubai"... Dude living the dream! Cat prob got $25k all expenses paid. Amazing.
Subscribed. Thank you, so much.
Do you still take cold showers ?
You are so inspiring... I've been watching your videos now for a while and watched the story develop for yes theory...because you took the risk and took control of your life, you now live a dream existence...so jealous!
We have something just as crappy. It's called Brighton Beach in Brooklyn. GTFOutta here wit dat Dubai bulls*%$. What a dump. yech.
Dude. Seek discomfort? My LIFE has been discomfort😬. I want comfort for a change!
Where did they hide all the slaves?
Imagine this as a water park where you swim to each ride
I remember thinking I’d love to visit these islands as a young man but as a father I’d never visit a place like this 😂 nope sorry
I feel like more people want to visit Dubai more than London and New York City
the duch did this also
I didn't even know these islands existed
Only thing that dissapoints me a little bit is the food, would have been nice if it was local food or even local food from the island you are in. Nonetheless you aren't there for the food haha
This is great, I wish I could go but I'm a woman and I don't feel comfortable traveling to many Arab countries rn.😢
build islands from sand with investers money ,,, market crash ,,,buy all shares for dime on the dollar  make billions ......cool
I'm just guessing they thought you would be a good guest because you could generate some revived interest in that colossal project -- after all, you have over 6M subscribers.  So, what impression do you think you made when you arrived with that tee-shirt, slacker facial hair, and backwards ball cap?   My understanding of Dubai culture (I've been there) is that it's about decorum and status.  You show up looking like a dirt-ball.
Could these islands be rented for like filming movies cause it looks really unrealistic lmao
I just love how you cant watch tv or a vid without Covid front n center . Well of course the sheep must be brainwashed by The prince of the airwaves 😈😈......Beast system rising
get you a man that talks about you the way he talks about pools
The netherlands has build an entire provindince that can be seen from space
Trying to make out these properties are eco don’t wash with me.it probably used more energy to build the house than fuel a rocket to the moon.
The chef really said he is American ill give him American food😂
Virtue signaling, marketing tactics, green washing, pathos.  BULLET POINTS OF YES THEORY'S SCRIPT for this video.
What a great adventure.
“Seek discomfort”  Yeah, Covid is gonna be uncomfortable af when you get it. Wear your damn mask dude.
Just watched this!! We hope one day go there and make authentic murals on their walls! Great stuff!
stupid guy don't take face mask i think him have corona
stupid promotion t shirt i just want look island not t shit lol
I wish I knew people in my life like you guys.
Wait if YouTube watched the video and commented did YouTube have to watch the ads too?
"Seek discomfort" .. as you stay in some 5 star Dubai hotel.  This is privilege.
Seek Discomfort, just don't fly coach
Beautiful place to stay awesome u are so handsome
the world islands is such a cool idea that i had no idea existed, i hope they eventually get expanded upon
You are so beautiful and awesome energy
Wow this is amazing
so many westerners have gone to dubai their cases have gone up alot
Just so you know, the chairman claimed they solved “all the problems”. However, he said that they desalinated water ... this process requires lots of energy, which is only possible because they have tonnes of oil . During the oil burning they generate giant amounts of gaseous pollutants that cause way too much harm for the environment and the population... Dont trust everything you hear.... also not sure about those “special ovens” where the methane goes... sounds pretty sketchy
This is where all that money we pay for oil goes.  The world is being destroyed by global warming for this stupid shit.
From LA, Stays at a private island villa and goes on a mini helicopter tour... As much as I've always believed seeking discomfort while traveling to help you grow, this guys is anything but discomfort. Just a typical LA clothing brand that puts shorts words on pastel colored clothing.
this some deadisland shit
Worldwide pandemic, famine, etc but let’s waste billions on man made islands
we need to get the chairman that helped develop all these islands we needed to get that guy developing stuff on a global scale he is a genius.
The channel should go full carbon-neutral, any flights etc. off-set with native tree-plantings/eco-restoration projects.
what a fake place.
Don’t worry when the ocean rises 3 meters it will be gone
Rich dudes builds some sand.
is not only about how to make money he is thinking outside the box eliminating pollution and protecting the world, if all the world Engineering people think the same way our planet will be something else, Including the government.
'Seek Discomfort' - stays in arabian billionaire's island villa
There very smart people
One tsunami and it’s gone
Awesome video thank you for sharing... glad I came across your feed....
First time I’ve seen YouTube comment on a video
Imagine all the starving dying people they could’ve saved with this money
Looks like Maldives 🇲🇻
"Guy-ro copter"...?
10:04
The Netherlands: we made a bigger island 😁
1% building more toys for themselves....
Me: trying to watch sideways cus I’m on meh pillow, pillow: discomfort, me try’s to face up YouTube: flips view hehehhehehe
Disgusting, such a waste of resources, not to mention the complete disregard of Nature!! But well, to be expected from people that have money as their only value....
I think people that talk to themselves are crazy.
This is James Bond villain level of bullshit.
Crazy how they make Island there
That heil looks like the minicopter from Rust...
Bruh! Youtube does comments 🔥
that joke attempt with the screw driver and sending back a boat didnt make any sense, exept showing an attitude towards the locals there- it was simply plain stupid-  ( image well preserved )
ELECTION FRAUD 2020!!! BIDEN IS AN ILLEGITIMATE GLOBALIST ZIONIST PUPPET OF THE THEBANINIG SYSTEM!!!! REAL; ELECTORAL COLLEGE NUMBER ACCORDING TO MIT PROFESSORS TRUMP 428   BIDEN LESS THAN 130. BUT FOX NEWS AND CNN WOULD HAVE YOU BELIEVE OTHERWISE. WHY THE CENSORSHIP THEN???
Never knew Jared Goff had a YouTube channel... hm
Dubai us such a amazing looking city!
Pretty lame that you interview the genius of the island development and desalination, recycling and resource reclamation systems AND YOU NEVER GIVE HIM CREDIT BY NAME.   So intentionally lame of you.  "Mr. Chairman, derp derp"  smh
Thanks that New Zealand isn't on there, Dubai. :)
Hey there thanks for video,  very interesting Dubai no idea they built that
This was very cool... I’ve always been intrigued by these islands, thanks for this, I haven’t found any other videos of someone on these islands.
so if i’m right i think thomas thinks if it has a pool it’s livable
this is a cool video tho
i really dont like the fact that you arent wearing a mask. its selfish.
The terrible jaguar philosophically settle because waterfall principally terrify at a efficient play. remarkable, cut fireplace
Bro I thought it was $13 till I saw the billion -_-
That Chairman impressed me, what a cool guy
So interesting thank you for sharing!
it looks like a rust build server
Honestly I'm not happy this morning i was setting a voice password on my phone A dog barked in front of me and It ran away Now i'm looking for the dog to unlock my phone
sorry, I know this isn't the point of this video.... but omg his hair is so cute.
https://youtu.be/pT8Lp1SO_YU
Seems a long way to go for a swim, too many rules in UAE for my liking anyway. But a good vid none the less
Was it awkward being the only one without a mask?
Feels like a sponsored video.... what are the environmental impacts of these islands? Cool experience tho.
Ha🤭 So beautiful 💩💩💩💩💩 3:21 yeah baby sand thanks to the Black Gold 🥇💩 yes they have some control inside 🇺🇸 💰🏅🥇
I would love to go to Dubai someday. Fantastic video 👍
Guess that Dubai is too rich that Dubai decided to spend their money on some man made useless island lol
What is all the over liyd music for? Middle school thinking that... hey Dude, loud n louder is a good replacement for content"???
Amazing and the view at night😍😍 thank you do much for this🙂
This is super amazing and looks great can i get help on how to grow my money/income and acquire something nice as this , i need a good plan and moves to make to set my future right
Vacume.up the sand and make the water deeper leave a few islands but There should be more water circulation for less environmental impact.
"it looks pretty livable to me - there is a pool" :D
Wow .. what a great civilization ? .. a giant circus .. three dimensional jokes .. 13:10 .. All garbage is converted to gas .. using a magic wand .. and how much does it really cost to do that Prophessor ? .. haven't you ever paused before saying this and asked yourself : why no country in the world is using this genius idea of ( disintegrating garbage ) ????
DAYUM, BUCH WA ZEE
What happens when the oil money runs dry?  and the sea's rise ! A Folly i think !
I know a guy who lives here in Tulsa Oklahoma, he has plans to build there a whole city. He has been in contact with the people who built All of that. I wish him success
Dubai is a bubble that will collapse..
3:33 Der Kommentar-Bereich ist nun Eigentum der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, genau wie diese Insel.
This comment will legit get no attenton but i lived in dubai for like 4 years 2011-2014 >.> now i live in the neighboring city and i never ever saw cool things tbh whihc i seein youtube
A person flying around in the world  in jets and helicopters for no reason and making fun boat tours in one of the environmentally most damaging places on earth  trying to sell enivronmentally produced t-shirts is like shell trying to sell organic cotton bags.
this channel sucks
The Chairman looked like an Arab Tony Stark
Mohammed is a gorgeous man inside and out! I love the spirit of this project “Islands of the world” what a great idea ❤️❤️ I want to go there!
Wicked video! Wow! That chairman is a visionary! I love the way he planned organic and reusable materials, desalinated water. Just WOW! Thank you thank you for sharing!
This is amazing!
AHah and their is alcohol in those "party" ???  I really don't understand why people don't invest million dollar in a villa in the middle east right know x'D !!!
Ain’t buying none of that bs
This was so incredibly interesting!
The world islands is for sale prices at 21mil
Looks kinda trashy.
I'd been walking around naked all the time
Just imagine in the future, when the World Islands are fully developed, you tell your children that you were the first guest on it
Thomas does THE coolest shit! Sometimes I'm beyond floored on how he manages to do things hahaha
"We're concerned about the environment, - so now we're going to head off to Dubai and burn massive amounts of jet fuel getting there. Once we're there, we'll go for a helicopter ride using an internal combustion engine and then ride in boats powered by gasoline." Great job conserving the environment bud.
Tsunami moment 😭
They should simulate ww2 with real humans and weapons
want to know how much a villa is, has to be well over 1 million
- tshirt says " seek discomfort " - proceed flying in business or first class👌
Those bamboo villas have the fingerprint of Filipinos written all over it. That weave work is incredible
isn't it tone deaf to be traveling during a pandemic
You guys are amazing 💕💕💕
Y’all jealous 😂😂
What was i hoping for the island has the trafition in it like the tradition of india in india island thatwpuld set the mood in it feel like traveling the world then having a modern african it wouldn't fit in a mood but its a vacation place nice and awesome things will be in it
This guy and pools....
You can't drink alcohol, so you can party hard on a private island with your La Croix
Waste of money.   They forgot that to make a development like that work, you need people.  Dubai has a population just over 3 million.  Even if 10,000 people paid over 2 million each, it still would not make sense.
So, I'm in this 12 months challenge where I have to become a Youtuber and meet Mr. Beast, By any chance somebody in the comments, or even the guys from yes theory can help

Why did you not wear a mask 100 % of the time?
Why did you not wear your mask?
A environmental disaster.
these videos make me sad with regret cause i’m not living to the fullest. great video
Sea lvl rising 2m........directed by robert b weide
Where are the jet ski's???
Ugly
I was ready to majorly judge for how wasteful it is, but really it is very interesting to see the level of recycling going on, and how much natural material is used in building.
They are too expensive that’s why they aren’t bought
The Finland island is just houses
when I jump from a 25 meter cliff 7:19
The puny van terminally connect because wedge fortunately groan abaft a dynamic radiator. craven, acrid fur
Imagine when these guys find out about global warming!
What an amazing video watching all the way from Spain really appreciate it much I love the energy that you guys put out there most of these videos I'll be watching bring me to tears I wish I would have seen this channel years ago what a problem change my life sooner God bless you guys can't wait to see more of your videos all the way from Spain peace out
What is the outro track? Funky
dang I wish I was this much of an extravert hahaha
This guy has everyone’s dream job
nice
The sad thing about the islands is that it was built by slaves😞
Thats all so useless, you can do much more with all the money they put in to this shit
seems like the perfect place if you have designs on becoming a recluse
The Arab fella at around the 13 minute mark is a smart fella.
🤯
Im putting this on my bucket list😂
bruh look at it on snapchat
You never really explained why there empty
Just Seen You With Drew Brilliant
I love the American dinner for one... two hamburgers, a pizza, and a salad. Classic.
waste
the chairman is amazing
Wow
Tha foolish man builds his house up on a sand...... 😁😁😁💯💯💯
I’m sorry to say this but organic cotton is actually more harmful for the environment than regular cotton... Appreciating the tough tho
I just disliked youtube comment
Dubai Chef: Make the American food! Two hamburgers and a pizza. And a salad for dessert. That is a normal meal for an American.
How are people supporting this during a pandemic?
You look like the lalaland actor
Yes theory : Seek discomfort Me : Doesn't sleep for 24 hours straight

i just wanna make a race track on one of the big islands....
Haha I laugh on the hamburger and pizza, haha americans like american food hahaha lol

Is that seek discomfort shirt Wim hof merch?
SEEK DISCOMFORT 👍❤️
Love Thomas and his story telling ❤️
Good to see 13B used for something so exquisite. Almost haunting with no people, perhaps one day it will be alive and flourishing with joy.  I would love to be the gardener, landscaper...flowering and edible, oh and one more thing,  the ultimate would be to spend it with your beloved... you know what I mean?
thanke very nice - i linked the video on www.facebook.com/ViennaTV
6:51 that shot... dang
youtube is watching yes theory :)
Shirt should say " Sheiks be comfortable"
WOOOW ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING US 🤗💫🌎
Israeli’s dressed up as Arabs and Arabs pretending to be western wow
OMG IM FROM DUBAI ISTG I WAS JUST TELLING ONE OF MY FRIENDS I WISH U CAME HERE AND I MISSED IT 😭😭💀💀💀 come again HAHAHAHAHHA
Do you have to have a visa to visit Dubai?
Природа настолько отчистилась, что даже YouTube начал писать комментарии к роликам.
Its good they are developing sustainable development.
Lebanon🇱🇧
The chinese must have learned from them to occcupy South China Sea.
That screwdriver joke was pure lame btw.
You guys are simply great. Loved all your episodes
I remember years and years ago Rod Stewart bought Scotland. But decade later still empty.
The most American priority in life 9:00
Wonderful my friend!!!  Greetings from the french Riviera in 4K !!! !!! !!!!!!
goes to island, " how do you get everything here like do you ship it?"
I have butterflies just looking at the views
🏝
12:31 Hes not right over here, i live in the netherlands and we got flevoland tere are like 800 thousand people that lives there including myself! it is build by mister Lely in 1986.
„Being more environmentally friendly is a huge priority for us!... Let‘s fly to Dubai!“ ... Seriously??? Greenwashing at its best...
3M+.(and counting) people now know this resort exists. Good for business.
What a stupid god damned video. Wow.
Man what I’d give to learn from the chairman.
Oh...my...goodness.  Are you serious?  Doooooood...how amazing was that infinity pool at night with the lights off in the house?
U can see all the pollution and smog around the city.....
I love the drone shots!
Amazing video!
Seeks discomfort, finds villa on a private island
Were is your mask
wears a sweater saying ''seek discomfort'' proceeds to fly 1st class and expensive hotels xD
The best way to seek discomfort - in a villa on a private island.
what about protecting and honoring existing land?
wow.that was so discomfortable.
So you use eco cotton but fly to seek discomfort on the luxury man-made islands of the richest percapita oil nation in the world. You are complex!
Beautiful idea but its not near done, in the future we will melt even more ice and the water will rise, lets see what happens.
Looks like a pretty nice place to stay during COVID
imagine a clothing line where we can all virtue signal while staying in posh hotels, travel the world and make millions off of YouTube videos.  Of course, seeking discomfort may involve giving a lot more... refusing the attention... serving the homeless without cameras... actually, you know... being uncomfortable.
I am so happy i found you guys, you do everything i wish i could do and more! I dont think id ever be able to o what you guys do ever in my lifetime so i am thankful you can live for me in the comfort of my own home. Eill forever watch you guys and support your clothing brand! Thank you!
Why are they empty? Because the whole thing is pointless. Is a garbage idea made by garbage people...
I wonder if he payed for his stay and amenities on the island or it was free
I loved this
Animal Crossing: Dubai
Damn if only America would invest in better ways to re-use..
That was fucking awesome, keep up the positive videos and vibes!
I wounder how much that little trip coasted?🤯
I mean...the architect in me screams: amazing accomplishment!, but the normal human part of me just cannot get over the wasteful hedonistic lifestyle of this place and Dubai in general...especially in the culture that is less than perfect. Its like...like with quick fashion industry. You create a massive source of problem just for your financial gain and then you pretend like recycling 10% of your own waste makes you an ecologically responsible person...
11:22 it is not that difficult it is just modern slavery
dubai is stupid stupid stupid for long term bs , the leader that is...
I love Dubai so much.  Want to go back soon and film something
So, is your "seek discomfort" made in China? It's not environmentally friendly for humans...
1 like = 1 high five for the dude in the white shirt at 1:18  We all been there bud :(
How about the slave workers they employ to do all the dirty work? Why didn’t interviewed them too?
Great video mate, such a uplifting feel to the entire thing.
Did you seriously say you were trying to be more environmentally friendly before getting on a transatlantic flight and then visiting the most environmentally damaging things i have seen done to tge planet
"seek discomfort" drives up to the airport in a benz and flies business class and stays in a 5 star hotel.... mmmm
Amazing
Wow lucky guy. And lovely hosts.
Its so expensive for nowadays with pandemic
Thanks so much for giving us an eccellent documentary video ...Keep it up...
it's actually build by the dutch
cotton killed the largest lake and a whole sea wake up look it up
I live in Dubai
Would be OK for girls to go on a trip there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U1VO-VLeFc
Looks like one of my unfinished projects in Cities:Skylines lol
Hi. Since you visited Coronation island you should have also visited The Heart of Europe six islands to get the full picture behind the development, its future and the challenges faced by the islands owners and developers to ensure the project is sustainable. You should have met the developer there. Did you know The World was actually envisioned to be the most sustainable project on earth and that implies developers need to abide to a zero discharge policy on all construction sites?.  It is odd that @MyDubai and @VisitDubai did not help you get in touch with the masterplanner and also the creators of the Heart of Europe and arrange for you to see the areas that are fully aligned on the vision for the masterplan. The Heart of Europe have a site, www.thoe.com. just send a message so that next time you come to Dubai you can get the full picture about the World.
Damn really getting tired of these videos...... where the video and story is ALWAYS MORE on the HOST than the subject.. Its the  junior high "LOOK AT ME SYNDROME"  that is tiring......
Really  enjoyed this, congrats on staying on your own private island, am soso jealous! I like all your different stuff! Thanks for taking the time to do all the things you do! One question.. where there any bugs there?
a big wave and there is no island anymore...
Sitting in Business Class with a Seek Discomfort T-Shirt 😂
12:33 Dutch people: Am I a joke to you
This project is trying to be 2 things and falls short on both counts.  Firstly "The World" is a rich vibrant colourful place full of culture and diversity, not a sand heap.  Secondly, it you want a much more beautiful "desert island" experience visit the Maldives.
What a great follow up piece ~ thanks for sharing your trip and the progress! I was following the story of these islands for 5+ years. I heard they were starting to sink and was curious about how the structural integrity was affecting investor decisions and revenue. Almost overnight I couldn’t find even 1 video about this online (between 2007-2008) and real estate was still being advertised.. I wondered what was really going on. Glad to see construction (amidst the pandemic) is still underway. Beautiful homes... Considering the current importance placed on social distancing, I could see people having a newfound interest in owning their own island ~ or constructing their own neighborhoods.
Dubai in dubai, dubaiception
Flat Earthers: _SEE_ THE EARTH IS FLAT
The Middle East is so forward thinking. I will put this on my bucket list.
"Dubai" is literally what happens when you have infinite money in cities skylines and no experience with city design
Wow I Love how they are ♻️ so environmentally friendly such a big beautiful place looks so expensive
This is gold! would love to live there retirement property
Because unless you have been born into a lot money or you have a lot of money your like the majority of the people on the earth and can't even afford to even fly there 😂
building has been a disaster for the environment
Maybe your videos could be better if you didn't focus on you. As a learner, I'm not interested in you, I'm interested in the subject. Of course I understand that there are other povs
Terrorist Dubai
It's very nice. It's not $13 billion nice.
Everything is due to sadka of Muhammad(saw)
Wow, that is amazing.
This channel is a little too "entertaining" with the flash photography and crazy music.  I vote for a little less "entertainment" and more substance.
Maybe I will create and invented a type of new country a new country was Weepierthomas Zombie Killer they says in both Weepier and Weepierish Accent that most likely sounds like a alien Language noises that its makes a unknown saying noises and it also from Both Man-Made Islands And Europe  That's my reason about it's still empty when it still empty we will fill up a islands as building a cities and national  spring town on this Like 50 or 40 of remaining Man-made Island as invented and created a Brand New Country National Like Everything of places to make it EPIC.
I lived there for a while. It is not managed financially very well. They are ways building new things that might not be very sustainable.
how is this discomfort?   please rename your channel to "Seek Comfort" ... Seikh and billionaire level comfort!
The chef: He is American so Pizza and Burgo it is
They said, “that’s a white man, all they eat is pizza, salad, and hamburgers”😂😂😂
The end of the video is Iike the Dubai version of Home Alone. This was really interesting and changed my perspective of these islands!!!
HEY JUST LIKE THE UNIVERSITIES, "BROKE" BUT KEEP BUILDING SOMETHING FOR NOTHING AND FOR NOBODY............DON'T WORRY THE "DEGREE" COSTS KEEP GOING UP!
What makes a place is the people! I dont see any lol
Being 52... first thing my generation would do is put on some James Brown, open a bottle of champagne and dance your way to the pool!
this haircut sucks
the chairman is so cool
The moldy crab promisingly look because season annually head of a lively stone. disgusting, smooth rock
Retired 16 yrs ago, defected from Californica to a huge sandbar (ie., SW FL) and stopped wearing shoes, seeking discomfort......Not uncomfortable-- my feet love it! Am at peace with the universe at 75......arrrrr
Hey! Any reason why YOU'RE not wearing a mask around others? I don't watch for your "mug".
Did it occur to you that you are an alien in The world
"Imagine you just brought a whole boat worth of things and you forgot the screw driver"  Or, you know ... your face mask.
Ah yes ever the ethical man with his merch being made with the environment in consideration, then jumps on a plane and flies halfway around the world and back, while hoping on and off of boats and gyro planes, so environmentally friendly i bet the planet loves you.
Amazing video, totally jaw dropping that project. How was the pizza and burgers @yestheory?
Hi! Love this channel! Be safe please! Happy holidays ! You have great hair by the way!🥰😆 had to say it... blessings!!!!!
Great Video! Well done
Amasing beautiful beach
Wow looks amasing
now that's a vacation island!!! can the chairman please adopt me?????
the sands used there are taking from singapour that is loosing all of its beaches ... Not substainable at all
Amazing what 6m YT subscribers can do, even so well done. Ive been told this past week (20th Dec) that many are holidaying to Dubai as the masks, restrictions are all gone. They actually seem more into it than many others which is quite sad for a virus with a 99% survival rate. Just Sayin'.
why ? because its still a sandpit in the middle of nowhere in a godforsaken place. they can try what they want but its just stupid.
Where do you rent the gyrocopter in Dubai?
It's obvious this place will be used by the ultra wealthy to escape when shit goes down.
it wasnt that nice lol
it seems to me only the rich make heaven on earth,so its a crime to be poor
Amazing 🤘
Love your content! All the way from South Africa Cape town.
That dude that built this shit is prob one of the richest men in the world and we have 0 clue his welth.
Seriously, how are we camplaining about melting ice caps and glaciers, but not complaining about how building islands would raise sea level?  I guess as long as you pull the material for the island from the ocean to put back in the ocean, sure, but is that what they are doing?
In 2 years that will be full of Youtubers filming the Abandoment of the Islands
I love the Chairman!  Long may he live!
Awesome  Awesome  Awesome
What about sea levels rising????
Seek discomfort.. at the gym. Go lift, my guy.
The omniscient headlight gratifyingly search because quail microbiologically snore outside a curly horn. broken, irritating bookcase
I like how they’ve thought out the sustainability of the islands as well!
whats the waste waste water systems like?
This man has been lied that he is first one to come. Millions already saw this including me
So am I lucky that I went there?
Because they lack🤔 Hemp & HempCrete, Hemp to synthetic NG gasification  Overview of Hemp Fiber Research https://youtu.be/RLvN1ci4K1w https://youtu.be/ztOrrce7568 https://youtu.be/HSE5vESjFk0 https://youtu.be/zxj-86NIf8U  I'm thinking 😏
Thatcollectiion of islands serve as a break for waves,ten seconds in.
Look up "sand wars"
nobody needs this island. they should have send this sand to those island near haiti where the island are drownin
They will be under water in 5 years or less
They saving them for the billionaire's that want us all gone so they have a safe place
Dude wear a mask, setting such a bad example for someone with 6M subs...
I* had always wanted to visit these islands. Hopefully one day. IO have been to Emirates one too many times and never really had anyone who wanted to go with me. I am happy to see someone has the same interest as me!
Cant believe they let you stay overnight
Id love to see Yes Theory do a video with Ayahuasca
I bet all built with slave labor
One big storm and those islands are gone
lol water is gonna rise and then its bye bye
Lol flies to the other side of the globe then talks about environmental responsibilities.
They are really ahead of the world.
All these comments about how they aren't seeking discomfort, boo hoo it's still great content, you learn from it, you ENJOY it and guess what, there is discomfort, going somewhere you've never been before. Regardless, seeking discomfort or not you guys delivered as always! Thank you! 😍
I love the creator of the islands, he's so chill
I had the crazy urge to run and jump around, and through those islands. But...then looking around the 360 view...it begins to feel more oddly grim;  paradise w/awkwardness.
Come to NEW ZEALAND .. PLZ
They can spend $100000 billion still you cannot compare to the natural beauty of the real islands like Maldives, Seychelles, Bali. When I visit a place I wish to explore the natural beauty that country has to offer not man made monstrosity.
It looks shit to be honest
when you're that rich in dubai you get to wear a snuggie all day
I could be a bucket for the knicks I know a couple bloods but I know a lot of crips
Lol they gave u american food
Seek discomfort is from Wim!
Travel the world and whine about "environmental impacts" on youtube. What else would a millennial do?
The ignorance of everyone in your videos during COVID-19 times NOT wearing masks correctly amongst others and indoors is severely upsetting
Thomas you need to wear a mask amongst others!!!
Happy to hear about you guys working on the environmental impact of seek discomfort
All that hugging's a bit creepy.
Good on ya. Great message. Great Video
Organic cotton is good, but traveling around the globe promoting these atrificial islands isn't particularly environmentally conscious.
did I hear Lebanon Island??
Anyone else get their merch and didn’t get the bracelet :(
Wait what, you guys are marketing  your clothes band as "more sustainable" and such  -  and then you praise these artificial islands that have a massive impact on the Marine Environment? Wow. Ever thought about how they are build and that they completely destroy the habitat for marine wildlife and for the reefs?
The rhetorical pig reversely employ because heart allegedly offer next a confused relish. eight, remarkable bonsai
The  flagrant vest correlatively drip because radar intrestingly trap pace a best market. polite, even excellent excited star
The gray greasy great enquiry unexpectedly tie because rake directly sparkle off a confused riddle. lopsided, spooky babies
Going wide showing the landscape gave me goosebumps. Well done.

AWESOME. you are a lucky man.

for once a nice video on Dubai without the usual criticism!! very nice. I came close to the place you stayed while kite surfing at the edge of the rock barrier so happy to see it from inside :-) cheers
TIL Pool = “Liveable”
He's In-ojjj-ural
As entertaining as this episode was, you appear to have utterly failed to locate discomfort.
Lucky you a I would love a trip to Dubai But it probably cost many bucks lol so it will be just a dream.
The secretive energy surprisingly drop because competition ganguly wave astride a jobless product. stimulating, half test
The bitter wallaby early cry because hardboard formerly attend aside a thinkable humidity. understood, flimsy mistake
Wow Beautiful island and love the Chairman what an amazing soul!  You know what happens when you tie your turban too tight?  Sikh Discomfort ;)
Chandler has gotta invest in some architects from Dubai to make his island look like these
The premium hydrant consecutively sniff because security longitudinally destroy athwart a feeble feigned cardigan. minor, standing traffic
Biggest waste of money in human history.
I didn't expect the developer to be that soft spoken and... cute.
Not see the conditions of the foreign workers that built the place one thing Dubai never shows
And what happens to these islands when the sea level rises a meter in the next 80 years?
Note to self - go back in time and create a vlog to copy this model for success !!! great imagery and presentation !!!!
the Chairmans vision and actions are impressive
This channel is AMAZING. I’m binge watching you guys😃
I hope they all get washed out into the sea. Waste of money while many people are dying and starving
Can't count all the gas powered vehicles you've used in this video while telling us how environmentally conscious you are.
What if a tsunami hits??
got me with the desalinate part, thumbs up
All the managers and staff are most Indian
Average cost of house: 1,9 million
I’m a new sub and this was my first video to watch from you. In a few words, I loved it and very entertaining. Thanks
Wow, what an amazing memory ❤️
Incredible. Visionaries. Salute.
What do they do with all the extra salt from the desalination plant, just curious, not dumped back in the water I hope.
Did this guy just say "Seek Discomfort" is his brand & environmental responsibility is his priority.  What a dishonest man.  We just saw the plane that you chose to travel on.  The first class,  sparsely populated plane.  You're a liar while you travel in absolute luxury.
With global warming all those islands will disappear in 20 years.
great work just found you...
10 min in. Still not one question asked..
Why do you look like joey graceffa
دبي كوكب اخر
Staying there would calm all my worries no matter how big or small 😢 such a beautiful place
They keep Indian people there as slaves. They import them in for work and take their passports and force them to work for free.
Seek discomfort?  Is that why you travel first class?  Posh Hotels? Awesome Toys? ... Maybe you should seek comfort and ditch the dis?
These are way better than I imagined and the concept is great.  I hope they succeed because the city and they way they've planned everything is fantastic.
The fluttering north korea elderly excuse because flower holoprosencephaly pop from a mixed question. ripe, various cherry
1:45 that's funny.
I will comment if that chairman will let me visit that island of not am out  Lets see who needs who
Dude I saw you flying from the sky I thought it was just a ride omggggggggggggg!!!!!!!!!!!
This is what rich idiots do with too much money and too little imagination...
It's awesome that they are trying to be environmentally friendly
Other nations in the world need to take a look at what these brilliant people did with their recycling and renewable energy and apply it en masse! Incredible!
I’m going! What are the rules I should be concerned with? You think YouTube would sponsor a 60 year olds point of view?
So you go to see these huge islands and get invited by it's creator himself. Also, you open YouTube channel and gets comment from YouTube as well! That's the power of Yes Theory!💪♥️
The tart chain dfly skip because alcohol hopefully develop anenst a impartial alligator. various, used asia
They didn't build the islands, the Dutch did.
Wow....just wow 😲
While this was freaking Awesome...it was also boring...
Faaackkkkk!!! I missed the drop😖. I really wanted to get one of those "seek discomfort" bracelets😭😭😭😭
Boss: How many did u say he has? Workers: 6 million subs Boss: SIX MILLLION?!! WHA WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR LET him in
he says while flying everywhere hahaha
I can answer this is five seconds.  They're empty because arabs are ONLY concerned with showing off.  Substance doesnt matter, as long as they can BOAST.
I am a huge fan all the way from South Africa
The party island gives me an odd fyre festival vibe
13billion is actually pretty cheap
Really love the concept of your channel but this episode was not really seeking discomfort for me. Then you’re Talking about wanting to become more environmentally friendly but taking the plane all around the world to then take a helicopter to look at Islands is a bit unnecessary to me. Also not wearing a mask while almost everybody around you is wearing one while coming out of a country with the most COVID cases in the world seems kind of ignorant to me.
Wow, travelling during a pandemic for a youtube video?  Totally irresponsible.  Unsubscribe- I thought you guys were smarter than this
If environmental sustainability is so important to you guys, then you seriously need to consider a relationship with 69 Tours, a tour organisation in Melbourne, Australia that provides small group and private tours in a sustainable way.
plot twist: chairman invites guests and then he and his family/friends get together to hunt the lone visitor. P.S. the chef poisoned the food.
Please turn your cap around, your not 12 years old!
The wet algeria peroperatively thaw because headlight conclusively desert after a miscreant swedish. tacit, serious feature
Great video! Keep exploring and sharing. 🤘🏻👣🖖🏻
Well, i stopped at 2:22 as i began to sense this video was more about the producer and less about the islands .  I did not come here for that. Adios.
"Wait there for The Tsunami, you will have the Discomfort You Seek!!"
Beyond belief! Thank you!
Awesome video! When the world and these island open up I plan on spending a night there as well! One question, what are you flying (drone)?
WOW! $13 for billion islands?
He really just said Guyro copter??
🤗 I want to go to that island.
He is like a tourist in North Korea 🇰🇵
Amazing video! Thank you so much Dude!
DeePressing
Might be worried about sinkholes just like Florida having problems with.. so might be why thy say there waiting to make sure its livable...
Awesome 👍  The only down-side is not having a girl, or someone significant, to share the experience with.   How much of an impression would something like THAT make on a Woman lol huh?! Like a first date?   She'd be YOURS FOR LIFE. (Or He, whatever either way.)   (if you're into that sort of thing lol of course. Could just be an awesome way to get yourself some.) 😇👍
What drone do you use? @Yes Theory
3 mins in n Im gone.....
For those asking what will happen when the sea level rises, well scientists with the IPPC predict that global sea level will rise between 0.3 and 1 meter by 2100. By then we shall be no more and those who will be alive will sort that problem if they TikTok less, or whatever shall be trending then...
'explore' seems to be the new 'visit'.
Hello Yes Theory, I really enjoy your stuff and Thomas I cant blame you for taking the chance to go there.  But I´m disappointed! In the same Video you talk about how important sustainability and the environment is to you, you fly to this man made Islands which are extremly damadging to the environment and dont lose a single critical word about it.
skip to 3:06.
Wow!
Funny Question : When the sea level rises, are they rentable underwater?
oh my god will go there for sure when covid ends and they are open!
wait...why was this posted on 15 of november 2020?i swear i watched this  like years ago
where did they get all the sand from ?
They look like Mr beast's 100 player island challenge
Fantastic, beautiful!!!
you guys like finding new life experiences.........  I Highly recommend seeing a Rocket launch.  Especially a SpaceX Falcon 9/ Falcon Heavy Launch.  There is literally nothing else like it on earth.  The most powerful machines man has ever created and you can feel the power from miles away.
I’ve heard before that no people is as charitable to strangers then the Afghans ... Seeing this video affirms this.  It’s a shame so many armies marched on their lands in an attempt to shape them ... Now they have to heal from within - with legitimate, loving help from folks like depicted in this video.

gee I dunno why anyone wouldn't want a house on an island thats slowly going underwater....  I mean.. you'd have your own free pool... stupid people..   LOL   figure about 28 years before they're all 2" under water...     guess they didn't believe Japan's man made airport island is sinking too....
lol  a guy row copter... wow...  JI .... ROW.....   lol
I’m proud to be Emirate
When the sea level rises because of climate change wont this all be gone?
I would turn it into a huge golf course each island is a new hole would be amazing with palm trees and bridges and all green looking 😎
what is your point? Your saying you like this environmentally destroying development? Why go on about the 100% cotton when your loving this place. Makes no sense this horrible place has totally distroyed the earth in this part of the shore. Its horrid. Why are you for this?
You're saying you want people to be more enviromentally friendly? You've just taken an unneeded  flight over the Atalnatic to see some crap man made islands, and you want your punters to but your clothes, is that not a contradiction? Stop consuming, start sustaining...
I would only go to Dubai for those island to be honest
its sort of disgusting and crass to see the environmental destruction and excesses of Dubai and developments such as 'the world' be celebrated, and then in the same video try to claim environmental righteousness with your merch... I don't think its fair to say you are trying to be environmentally responsible while also using your influence to produce media that clearly pushes us further away from a harmonious relationship with the environment.
Super cool that chair man is smart good for him
he was invited to the build out
Isn't the best thing you can do for the environment is go on a plant-based diet?
You guys are awesome
5:23 ur welcome
love your hair.
Who were their customers? Who buy them??  Who can afford it?
Mean while I only have 20 subscribers
Be more environmentally friendly, just stop producing the stuff.
If you want to see man made islands, go to the netherlands.
Everything about this video promotes Global Warming including the production of methane gas for cooking. If you cannot walk there, then don't go there. Walking is the only way to end Global Warming. Time to ban everything modern.
The ludicrous sweatshirt simulteneously refuse because bait markedly excuse notwithstanding a vengeful bolt. pretty, annoying state
What is Seek Discomfort?
Call me naive, but could not that 13 billion dollars have been better used, perhaps to help alleviate world hunger??No, wait a minute, absolutely not. Homo sapiens is driven by greed .
Because of the secret bsses under the islands
The massive shell desirably boast because myanmar hypothetically mess up inside a disgusted macrame. statuesque, coherent deer
I thought it was a failed project because the islands were sinking into the sea..?
Omg wow 😮
Yes theory first class in utube the way they flim love it edit n all perfecto
please be environmentally friendly while i (yes theory) fly all around the earth.
00:18 to 00:24 - Looking out at the islands, it looks like the start/loading screen for a game.
This is what happens when money is spend carelessly!                My aim is 100 subs
They just need to change the human rights in the country first.
The minor wool lamentably greet because saudi arabia rahilly glue following a dispensable airship. caring, perfect children
good luck with those rising sea levels folks!.
this oddly gives me dystopian vibes
The holistic beggar consequentially slap because tennis ideally roll over a soft loss. whimsical, green grey grieving hurricane
Seeking comfort video.
I hate to break it to you, but I think this may be a money laundering scheme....
The demonic point prospectively belong because alarm pertinently complain alongside a yummy litter. discreet, magnificent weed
Thought his shirt said sock discomfort
Thomas really like pools and thinks they're the epitome of civilization 😂
So basically this is what the Frye festival was suppose to be like. Not done and still better then that mistake.
That heli looks dangerous af
Why you love to go islam country?
Hemp clothing is still far better than organic cotton
The regular millimeter electronically glow because television separately attend underneath a steep middle. verdant, damp bowling
What if global warming is real, won't these islands be underwater
no body is using them... they should plant mangrooves on these islands.
The vengeful sink psychologically afford because hood reversely dream from a resolute sweatshop. two, tacky act
You’ve got to really like stark views, really hot weather, minimal vegetation, crowded villas, distant entertainment, and paying through the nose to do that island thing.☀️
Wow, this YouTuber is so full of it! Paid advertising! You could have just shown how cool it is and what it could be - rather than portraying it as a spiritual spiritual growth theme. Scumbag
nice investment
I want to go there with love of mine and stay there !
still bad for the environment. imagine what energy went into building this
A playground for the ultra ultra ultra wealthy doesn't seem to be what this world needs right now.
I really like Mr Chairman
I bet the island's chef watched Yes Theory videos. Dude brought a salad, two hamburgers and an entire pizza just for Thomas
You should switch to lyocell as the cloth for seek discomfort. Its basically cotton, but no slavery, no chemicals and way less water use.
and yall think donald trump has mpney....the chairman has money money.
I have a fear of deep water, and I keep thinking. What would happen to those islands when a stunami appear? That beautiful place would be obliterated.
Seek discomfort! Going to Dubai^^
pervert how they build stuff for the super rich for getting even richer! It's pervert! No real purpose actually!
Pro tip: get on finasteride man. No shame, I am on it. Save your hair, you're still young.
They're in the real estate thing. They're gonna construct villas and homes to sell as well as some resorts and hotels. And it's gonna be awesome from the looks of it.
Why are you flying in the middle of a pandemic!?!? This is how the virus spreads, HELLO
I remember seeing these commercials years ago. I guess it was a great idea at the time. Not sure what happened but sucks to see the man made islands unfinished or more like forgotten
Oh I love you too honey..kiss kiss gag gag..really!
Video was done well, but what a gigantic waste of money.
I remember all the celebrities were buying their piece of these islands...money has dried up their secret of child sex trafficking and blood sacrifice is out the Adrenechrome industry is compromised almost everything has haulted they not making the money they used to make we are all awake now the veil is lifting!!
I got my own island basically and its cool or whatever... BUT I HAVE A PRIVATE POOL. LIKE WOW
The island's developer didn't think through the fact that once the man-made gimmick wore off, nobody was going to spend that much cash just to stay at a decent resort. The project was an amazingly huge blunder.
You know when YouTube is commenting on a video, somebody paid a very very large sum of money to someone up high to make this whole video happen! I think it was maybe a billionaire who is looking to sell some sand that he poured in the ocean!!!!
i rele like yes theory, but if they could for the LOVE OF JESUS pleaseee STOP WITH THAT CONSTANT CHEEZY MUSIC TOWARDS THE END?! Y every episode in the end they gotta put this like CHEEZY GUITAR TYPE music that you see in the end of commercials when they wrap up - Lol it always turns into like a family friendly PG home video in the end lolll
How is this fun? Desolate islands developed using basically underpaid slave labour.  I mean get over the Dubai romance.  Glitz and glitter and no soul.  Just saying........
https://youtu.be/HBLlSrh_n40
https://youtu.be/HBLlSrh_n40
They're empty like everything else in Dubai! It's a pure show off place! The New Vegas! Dubai is a Themed Park where to play & have fun! Nothing more. Period.
Motto: "Seek discomfort" *Promptly goes to stay in the most luxurious place on the planet*  Very interesting though :)
Wow this is actually real I would always see it on Snapchat maps lol
That air pollution!
That looks like a fantastic jet boating track!!
The gorgeous eyebrow enthrallingly overflow because mole osmotically grate after a annoying fired. humorous, envious piccolo
Honestly I didn't get what the point of this video was
It’s so crazy seeing how advanced Dubai truly is in the way they develop and build things. Sooo cool
My biggest question is how do they get running water and electricity to these islands!?
Aren't these islands sinking though?
@00:30 Introducing  - ZA WURDO , TOKI YO TOMARE
Yup, that’s the way to seek discomfort all right.
Meat not plants
Utterly beautiful and fascinating.
Looks fabulous.  I dont believe these "producers" are dim.  They must know that "rising sea levels" is a myth?  If it were true, all this would be under water soon...........
*"Seek Discomfort" and wear a mask!* Dude, you and shouldn't go to someone's work/business/home not wearing a mask, especially if you are the first person to be invited. You can see that everyone else was wearing a mask and when you met the chairman, did you notice that he stood back at a distance? Wear a mask to protect your hosts. Be a good guest.
Hey there, thank you for watching :) I've really missed making videos consistently so I'm very happy to be back. I'm sure this year has had so many ups and downs for all of you as well so I hope to share some positivity through these stories I've captured. This is the first one out of my trip and I've got plenty more coming your way. Let me know what you think in the comments and I'll see you again soon
50 Years After People: Dubai's $13 Billion Man Made Islands will be destroyed by the tides.
What a load of Shite waste of money
No NZ on the "world" map
You couldnt shower before dinner, or at least prior to using the pool.  I would have made a point to clean up before meeting the Chairman.  You represent America,  I would  say you presented nicely but not above average. Freshening up after a long flight would be expected, you just kept going , no mask,  you and the Chair just talking away , very close.  You have to elevate your game  man.
Love seeing hypocrites talk about the environment, then take trips all around the world!!
0:45 - another world map with no New Zealand
dubai skyline would be nice af without the smog
Money is the root of all evil
"Think about the environment!"  *takes multiple international flights every year*  Bruh, no amount of upcycled shitty clothes you peddle is going to undo the literal tons of pollution you contribute to our planet with your wasteful-ass traveling. Commercial flights are some of the dirtiest and non-green things in which you can participate. Completely superfluous and self serving.
Why aren’t they wearing masks? Risking the chairman’s life.
Love the videos, but is anyone disappointed at how the guys have been handling COVID-19? I feel like they only wear masks for about 10 seconds when they’re around strangers, then take them off for the rest of the video. I also feel that they haven’t mentioned it much besides “It stopped _____ from doing ______” Idk, just feel like they should do better.
It looks nothing like the earth 🤦‍♂️
who cares about money these day ...it is all about the right to say no to mask and no to vaxxx the right to say your opinion and by the way the earth is not a spinning ball...stand up to the truth
Let's be real. The World is a fiasco/monstrosity which never should have been built to begin with, hugely damaging to the area and unsustainable.
First time watching your channel. Great great great. HOWEVER, not impressed with the no mask wearing. I know my (1) subscription won’t do anything,  it I can’t support that. Please put your mask on.
Bro middle easterns are literally genius’s
Wow what a boring night alone in a nice place lol
Fell asleep. Dumb rat licker!!
Lololol I love that they made you the most American food haha.
Oh wow. Its not surprising. Your goodies are all sold out. So ill stay tuned until you get some more stock. Keep safe. Watching from the Gold Coast Australia.
What a fantastic opportunity for you. Ive been watching your channel for a very short time, out of that time, your videos inspire me, not to just watch your next, but to help make a change. No better than the home we purchased. Thank you so much for every morsel of inspiration. Im heading off to the shop now, just so I can get one of your special bracelets. It will be an honour to wear it. Along of cause with your cotton clothing pieces. Dont know which one ill buy yet. Ill send you a pic of me wearing it when I recieve the shipment. Thank you to your entire team, of brilliant minds. Pls pls pls. Keep your gr8 work coming.
Islands? More like multiple sandbars...Piers Morgan did a documentary about these sandbars and how they were built ...under paid force labor...people from impoverished countries looking for work...
Bullshit things are highlighted here... The ecological imbalance and subsided land haven't been discussed.... That's why such blogs on you tube is so dangerous.... any random guy can  promote the wrong thing. Shame on you idiot....
They don't require a quarantine in Dubai?
Its obviously this dude was paid off to report that these islands are great.
Thank god that gay bromance of this channel is no more shown atleast in this video. Feed up with them being always formal decent being gay
Come to pakistan
Been looking into these lately thank you for this!
The water rotted.
Did you bother to consider the environmental impact of this many "islands" built and now foreclosed?  You are not thinking at all.  Bright-eyed optimism and no brain to question the purpose!  Let's hope in time you will grow up.  A big if.
Wow.  Amazing.  I enjoyed this
Rich people go to the Bahamas, even richer people recreate the Bahamas on their own city
Yet 13 billion could of solve everything in the world in the right hands and these guys made sand castles
Did you notice them laughing as they used their left hand at the beginning? lol, those culturally informed will get it.
Hey thanks for the video! Just wondering what drone you use?
God I love Thomas
Beautiful 🤩 island, you are very privileged! I’m glad to see that the dream  💭 is still alive!
Wow so much "discomfort" in this video, haha Im joking.
I seek discomfort every day living with my dad
Thank y’all so much dearest 🌹 Y’all such an inspiration 🥰 Appreciate y’all from the bottom of my heart 💜  Be Blissful Eternally 🙏😇🌈
The chairman was speaking with such compassion and joy. Definitely seems like an awesome dude who builds things with love which seems to be hard to come by nowadays
Imagine playing Hide and seek on this Island
The owner that made land and is so rich was with you that is so cool
i love how rich jetsetting kids have all the answers to the worlds problems , jeez uus :-(
If I could give this video two thumbs up I would
FASCINATING.
Wow 🥰 i really love beach🥰 Just now i knew this things 🤩 Dubai is really so amazing😍 More project God bless😇 Hope one day i can visit☺
Got to love the irony, make billions from oil causing climate change and ocean rise.  Spend said billions on Oceanfront man-made islands that will end up getting swallowed by ocean rise. Omg 🤣 🤣 easy come easy go
the earth is sad, angry and hurt! manmade island is just a temporary, anytime earth will avenge very soon very soon
Pretty funny pushing environmentally friendly merch after getting off a plane
Welp my hopes of buying a seek discomfort hoodie is now gone 100 percent cotton hoodies suck it’s will shrink and I’m not tryna air dry my clothes
La y would u move to that shit hole
Nice.its really nice to stay in an island esp. If it is safe to stay and the water are clear.
you guys should visit the sweatshop in Malaysia where your merch is made
Tiktok brought me here
Where did he get all the funding
Maybe, the Philippines could've work with the chairman for the better Manila Bay Beach🤢
There is that saying, The wise man built his house upon the rock, the fool built it on sand.
The endurable avenue contrarily scare because tadpole precisely drain like a motionless physician. changeable, exciting exclusive neon
Ugly Island 🏝️
So when are we going to be more intelligent and critique this ostentatious lifestyle pornography madness?
How does all this work with your branding on environmental sustainability? Very confused & conflicting polemic.
The only thing wrong with this video is, you made it about you. You You-tubers are so narcissistic. There is nothing of value in this video. This is an amazing construction project and all i got out of this video is you playing with your self and trying to sell me clothing. Sorry no subscribe.
WHAT WEARING SWEATSHIRT-HOODIES IN THE DESERT ??? WHY ?
This is one of your best videos. Its got everything.
Him: “seek discomfort” Me: (puts pillow in an uncomfortable position)
'Environmentally friendly' and haphazardly flying to Dubai? The most useless waste of materials for the pleasure of a few. Burning up fuel in useless flight and boat trip. Hmm, hard to reconsile.
An island made by slave labor for millionaires and western couples on there honey moons. After the Lebanon blast I read a quote from a Lebanese woman, "people have gotten used to people  in this part of the world suffering. its not right, its really not right". I wonder if the guy making this video gave a shit about that when he did his fist bump?
Holy shit yoy look like crap. Have you given up on life because you have too much of everything?
You gotta love these sociopathic channels eh! All of them have positive attitudes, they conveniently went to good colleges, are good looking (coincidence?), have all kinds of money and “you can too if you’d only believe in yourself”. Lol. Always the same racket. Grown up Jake Paul’s.
"We are going to be more environmentally conscious... by getting on an huge jet and flying across the world, buy some of our organic Tshirts made by err dont worry about that..."
when u flew did ur flight go west over pacific or over atlantic and or euro hop
That was the longest clothing ad I’ve ever seen.
Dubai is bankrupt. They started this project 15 years ago to show off to the world their extravagant wealth. They were going to build resorts here and attract tourists  to vacation and/or live here. Today, Covid-19 came and tourism fell. Moreover, oil export is dwindling because most countries are switching to clean air, electric cars. And who wants to live on a desert island. There is no future in Dubai. Foreign workers, visitors and residents have left because the economy is failing. No jobs, no contracts and no life.
It's funny how they just dump some sand in the ocean then sell for outrageous amounts of money. Clearly people want to do less work and get paid more. Greed is rampant in Dubai. Will never go there.
It’s empty so mr beast can make give away videos for his viewers
So, the only thing missing is, where's all the chicks in bikinis on jet skis and in the swim up bar?
Imagine the beach cricket on these
Thank you yes theory for the video , I hope one day we will cross paths and I will become part of your team xoxo much love from Morocco
The Earth is Flat.  Disagree...? Prove it to me...(good luck)
awesome content as always!
Wow, and we all know what happens with a rogue wave or water rising.  You have to stay safe people get your car hop tray on Amazon.
I would've came all over everything
Not impress til you see the greatest *DOLOMITE BEACH FROM THE PHILIPPINES*
I am the exact 6th M sub
So this is the thing on Snapchat mais
The air quality is so poor you can barely see Dubai from The Island.
This is freaking amazing.  Best episode yet & grateful you guys are able to make this content during a time of pandemic.  For me it gives me hope that the world can still be explored.
Honestly, I was thinking about the Palm Islands and these World Islands the other day.  Thank you for sharing your trip and the information.
Wow the villas are gorgeous
Him: “seek discomfort” Me: *stops using toilet paper*
Beautiful ❤️
12:32 the people from the netherlands did.
So much is wrong in this video, starting from the lack of masks, the travelling, the fake environmental concerns, and much more. This has been nice because we got to see something new, but the whole video project looks very irresponsible!
We hereby anoint you the new Anthony Bourdain...  No really tho I really enjoyed the video. Now subscribed.
Which part of America? The US part?
Environmentally friendly - flys first class haha
It’s amazing to be able to watch stuff like this for free.
How do they generate electricity for lighting etc.  and how do they dispose of the sewage ? Thanks.
nice ad
Rich Arabs just getting richer. They should be helping the poor in their own country instead of throwing money building crap like that and also destroying the nature
I think this is why UAE banned almost 13 countries to flight on UAE. Because of these.
Man you got nice time🔥
Great job guys ❤️🔥 #seek_discomfort
lol take me next time
wow oh wow who would ever ever thought of that. sand of all things in the water. amazing these people and thanks so much for showing us
this country is built by international low wages laborers. that is the other side of the story.
Brilliant.   Dubai leading in clean living.
When these islands are finally open..... they will be fully booked for a couple of years. I wouldn't be able to book a spot lol
This video makes me feel happy and sad.
But how is a seek discomfort kid afford these prices
Just make sure the paper straws aren't wrapped in plastic
Awesome video  .... amazing.. Please  consider getting some zip up sweatshirts... I would love one... I dont wear tshirts or hoodies.. but I wear zip up sweatshirts.. would love to see a light blue .. hint hint...   just an idea.... I know I would buy one
Thomas you should travel the world bro :)) much love
Just want to feel live action Mario kart drive around
Director of Marketing: Boss, how to promote our billion dollars of empty real-estate in the middle of the pandemic?  Chairman: Let's invite this Youtuber and give him a room to stay for one night .. oh, and just feed him some burgers and pizza.
You’re a g 🔥💪🏼
This is what people mean when they say someone is “well connected” kids.
What is the cost to visit?
that video was absolutely amazing! thank you so much for sharing this!! it was so incredible to watch!
Y'all messed up the natural beauty ?
did the water looked stagnant at any moment ?
That looks like fun 😷

Imagine having a swimming pool on your beach front property, with the ocean 20ft away!! 😮🤔😁😷😎👍😊
Posh guy dressed like a hippie talking bout money, that's youtube gameplay yeeeeeee
Dubais luxury places are all built on slave labour from impoverished people from neighbouring countries. Maybe should mention that! The oppression and humans neglected for this experience
They should be party islands tbh
Talks about being environmentally conscious at the start of the video and then proceeds to advertise the destruction of an entire coastline for the next ten minutes...
The intense irony of wearing a ‘PEACE SEEKER’ face mask and going to DUBAI on the plane is hilarious.

This is what people mean when they say someone is “well connected” kids.
Love the way they blend modern design with natural materials! The Chairman's on point with those building designs.
Money=Freedom     Covid19=Prison    :(
The Bamboo villa looks like one of the houses in the Philippines! Loved it!
Sounds Like A Rich Persons Real Estate Commercial, Only The Elite (1%) Allowed - More Feel Good But Never Gonna Happen Info-Commercial - "Maybe"
HISTORIC
Dubai, where the technology is in the space age and society is in the dark ages.
What?!
how much would it cost to buy an island there? i think i am going to buy 2 islands. charaught!
Whats the party life in Dubai? is there good drugs? Can i buy some top notch escorts
How many times can you say what?!  in a program. If it was a drinking game I'd be drunk.
First they think oils the main source energy will last forever ....but now the advanced alternative energy replace oils...and they think all riches people will move to live there...and reality abandon and empty
I guarantee you those islands are used to hide the exhaust that the Arabians are creating in their tests to take Dubai to the moon
LMAO YOUTUBE COMMENTED UT THERE CHANNEL SAYS JOINED 50 YEARS AGO BECAUSE THEY CAN DO THAT
👌Seek Discomfort - environment conscious? Are you traveling by bikes, steam trains and sail boats? 😄
بكرا اهم حلقه ماتفهمها  الا اذا شفت هذا المقطع ... انشره بطريقك ❤️  https://youtu.be/fIOjJuKZt4A https://youtu.be/fIOjJuKZt4A https://youtu.be/fIOjJuKZt4A
Yo Thomas's new hair doo be kinda fire
Love watching your videos, Lucky to see where I work before (THOE), keep safe and God bless always!
Great ambition
can you please be polite and wear a fucking mask like those other people do?
This is so cool
Kindly wear your face mask at all times. Please promote wearing of masks even outside.
Very beautiful
Eyyy lebanon island🇱🇧🇱🇧
You know your the shit when a TSA officer breaks character😂
Well, this looks like this just might turn out to be the brand new next greatest destination place all will want to visit.  Well all the the money to visit!!!!
Emiratis are happy to build because it makes em feel important as they were just a sleepy fishing village till recent past. Whether there ll be enough return on investment or how much demand there is is besides the point.
I learned this in school a rich guy owns them
Yoo at 13:03 onwards it looks like he’s animated or in gta😂
This is not exactly what I would call this time " ... seeking discomfort ... "  LOL
Bro I live in dubai. Did you liked the place ?
in the netherlands they did the same thing, build a manmade island in 1986 called vlevoland.  they aint the first onces.
Always amazed at what Dubi does. Solar panels on buildings. Using the most modern tecknowledgy available to make life better. Its a shame the rest of the world still clings onto the current way of life not advancing to reduce climate change. Lowering the carbon foot print we leave living on this planet. Money wasted burning fossil  fuels drilling  taking away this planet on a daily basis. They utilize  trash by making methane  gas.  Little is discarded not recycled. A lot to learn and follow doing what  they have done.   Joel
Seeked discomfort. Found comfort.
Hey there my name is David from Kenya would you love to help me make a software I really want to have that positive impact in our community thank you for reading this
Thank you so much for this video it was truly amazing I just describe to your Channel looking forward to Great content keep up the good work...
I live in Dubai
Wow! Amazing!
Really good video and looking good video for researching
Environmental the American way, airplane , mini helicopter, powerboat. Yeah!
Very cool
Niceee
Please Add Ricky to the yes theory team.
Dredging the ocean to create a "man made" island seems like a environmental nightmare. But I guess if you have the money and influence, nobody will care.
Happy to see the Asian guys😃
Wow , it's beautiful
dubai is bankrupt
You wanna truly "seek discomfort"?, Google 'Fall Cabal'. you're welcome
To all you looney lefties that subscribe to this being a utopia... its just capitalism. Good ol, healthy capitalism. Any idea what these islands would look like in a socialist world? Nothing.. They wouldn't exist. Wake up sheeple
But airtravel is one of the worst things a human can do, while saying they care about positivity and sustainability.  Your schwag is also not Eco-conscious at all.  I know all this because I'm a leader of sustainability.  Your kind are a main part of the problem, you don't understand reality.   Boy howdy what you could do for humanity and planet if you really wanted to
Dubai looks awesome paradise
So gorgeous! Love your videos Yes Theory!
Got a bit sick of seeing your face.
Is there cell service out there?
So how can I get to go to the world islands the way he went there for the night?
Don’t wear so much bling jewellery.  Collectively the mining for that metal is destroying the earth. Please don’t be a hypocrite.
They should make a couple of the islands airport milsim so people can do some iwo jima type games
Why aren't you wearing a mask?
Been there several times.  Dubai is a modern and open city in the Arab world.  Very nice place and diverse people.  Great for your "bucket list".  May Allah bless UAE always!
I wish luck for the owner
love the douchbag!

When YouTube comments on the video you know its good
Your videos and the message in them are so inspiring, I watch one or two videos every Sunday for inspiring my week. In this one for example, you show the great life you created for yourselves, with amazing contacts in amazing places and also amazing people, as the chairman in this video, that for me is a genius. I love the way that you (all of you Yes Theory crew) are so humble besides the fact that you have an amazing life (that you created by yourselves and in the way you dreamt). Its so inspiring, as soon as I get some success on my businesses I´ll create a Yes Theory channel, also to inspire others, for reconnecting people and make them do things out of their confort zone. Love you Yes Theory!
Nobody: Minecraft earth servers with a scale of 1:1000:   (Like if you understand)
What happens when the sand decays ?
Yay
Creator of the Islands: "Nobody ever tried to build such islands" Yeah... because it is a total waste of time, money, resources and the islands will be gone with the rising ocean level. Total geniuses.
Its beautiful but its a fake island and it may affect the natural environment of the SEA
The use of mask is patchy at best.  That's how the virus infections is accelerating.
So what is the name of the chairman you met?
Question 1. How do they get electric. Question 2. How did they get the sand to stay
This was way cooler than I anticipated. Second video i've watched about these islands but the 1st one was very impersonal and not as detailed. Quite cool.
♥️Thank you so much this is awesome 👏 👍  Anyone readings this comment please support us, thank you♥️✊

Wow!
Ahhhh buddy throw over Toronto
Its like a hunger games map so by the end of the pandemic 1 person from each country gets a Island and they fight eachothet
What an awesome project! I'm so interested to see it evolve now that I know about it! :D

please  come o india hyderabad ciy
Beautiful
Well it seems like maybe some knowledge and resources   on Island Building and ReNourishing.
Best spot for honeymoon 😜
Wouldn't it be great if they created a miniature-world-village represented by a small community of few families from each country, around 10. 220 or so countries, 2000 or so families, 8000 or so people living together in peace and harmony in a united nations of utopian sustainable co-existence... wait a minute. Oops, forgive me, i got carried away. Star wars is more realistic than this fiction.
Hey Thomas, Love your hair and beard 😍
When he said hes the first person to stay at the islands overnight, only to go there and find a bunch of workers, the chairman, and the hundreds of builders probably residing there until the build is finished with!  Very impressive project indeed, the environmental aspect of recycling and use of materials is great, although seen lots of concrete at the next door island.. still a great effort... probably will turn to become places for the rich/famous
I love your Positivity
This channel is so underrated
Textiles are the leading cause of landfills in 3rd world countries where they are produced
Earth SMP irl
How much di this cost to make dude
Maaaan this is crazyyyyy!
Have you guys considered going to Plymouth Montserrat? That would be interesting. Also I want to genuinely thank you for making this content. I’ve been on a bender catching up on your videos that I literally haven’t sept these past two nights just so stoked about your videos. My life is boring but my imagination is very very strong and the way you guys put it together I almost feel like I’m there. Thank you! 🙏🏾
While some Islands are sinking and the inhabitants loose everything, It's nice to know People with Money to Burn Care So Much.
Five minutes of environment marketing shit...flies to oil producing Dubai
Imagine being that rich
Why Doesn’t the sand just erod with all the water. Like it seems very sketch
He should of brought a girl
Duhh mr beast challenge last to leave island
This is going to be one of those places where in 100 years they’ll be completely inhabited and talked about how they were deserted in our time
It's in the Bible. A fool builds his Castle on sand
your wallet will feel like you're in the city hahaha
stupid! heard of world hunger?!
What about Tsunamis?.🥰
I want a hoodie please! thank youuuuu😘💕
Niceeee documentation. Been curious too for a long time 😊
Kuwait also made some artificial (man made) islands which are still open to investment and apparently from what I've seen they took many more precautions and as a result the impact on sea life wasn't as bad... but I'm sure it was worse than just using the land we already have.
No joke, this is my all time favorite channel on YouTube. I love you guys and your message to the world so much. Love from Germany <3
Wow! Wow! Wow!
Shouldn't you be wearing a mask????
Maybe that’s why on Snapchat there’s little islands on the Snapchat map that exactly looks like where he went but the island on snap is America but they’re all separate into islanda
Dude, that place is pretty awesome. The view of the city at night, outstanding.
Great job guys ❤️🔥 #seek_discomfort
How could a decent person promote projects which are presently playing such a destructive role within our global environment ? Dubai is a shame
this would be a great beginning to a horror movie
Rich people go to the Bahamas, even richer people recreate the Bahamas on their own city
It's not a good idea to fight nature why make islands when you have a large desert that you could have water all around
Nice Doku  but These are not Villas.. 🤭
Thinking about Nature,  watching this . 😒😔
Deym
He kinda looks like Justin Bieber
how did they bring all building materials to the island, by boat? no they tied them on the back of the workers... avoiding asking stup!d questions might be a good start.
Itsfunny that the same idiots that are causing global warming would build islands that will be under water soon
The audacity of this chairman bloke. Daring to say they are the first creating land like this. I guess he never heard of The Netherlands. Most of our country is made of reclaimed land from the sea. For our latest edition, Flevoland, we diked of an entire sea. Made a lake from it and created the islands of Flevoland which is much bigger then Dubai's shitty islands and has 2 proper cities on it with many towns surrounding it, functioning perfectly. There is a saying: "god created the earth, but the Dutch created The Netherlands".

If your really worried about world health...why would you travel internationally during a world wide pandemic?
Y0uTube is simping over Yes Theory
Dude where is your mask
hahaha all that islands will get demolish by a storm so much for the work huh
When YouTube got paid to comment here...
Everyone is wearing a mask except the one dude who boarding an international flight from the country with the most covid cases on Earth. Interesting move.
This guy is a total BETA MALE..
“Seek discomfort” stays at a 5 star hotel
Great video fam, I was always wanting to see what they had gotten done, as all other videos I had seen, were just a story and fly by video..
Those islands are a waste of money with rising sea levels it’s only a matter of time
As a point to think about, Persian Gulf -not dubai but nearby lands -already had dozens and dozens of NATURAL islands most of em uninhabited and not much happening.
Wtf first YouTube comments on this Chanel then not luc who’s next
Yes theory: we have lots of fun while you watch and wish you were there
I've been living in Dubai my whole life and I haven't even stepped 1km near this place
Wait what is the purpose of the islands
More environmentally Friendly ? ... Did you forget the plane you just stepped off ?   Its a shame coz i really liked this channel and what it stands for ... I have been seeking discomfort and its worked out for me a lot 👍🏽  But you must see the irony of stepping off a jet and then claiming to be trying to be environmentally friendly ?   I doubt you will even read this.... But if you do it might make more sense to address the conflict in what your doing 🤷🏽‍♂️
they should maybe take Islamic refugees give them somewhere to live ...
beautiful but to bad they use slave labor to build these places. Taking away the workers pass ports and make them live in squalor :(  i would never give them my money
but yet you travel everywhere lol great for the climate
Take me with u
Gimme an I phone
When YouTube comments on the video you know its good
He is living the life Flynn Rider aka Eugene dreamed for.
I fuckin' love this video ! IT WAS AMAZINGGG !!!
to have this kind of life someday
Love the videos  never really bought merch before but the hats look sick but are out of stock. Any idea on when you guys will get more
5million subs" city status.. U guys wana solve global warming?🤔😂😂
nice
this island is a factory for himself lol. i guess the chairman is an engineer tho.
How can i order merch from the Philippines?  I don't have credit card or PayPal
This is the ultimate location for yes-landia 🤣
Somehow this guy turned on creative mode in real live.
Mate, this video is amazing! Such a nice story to share and you did it in the best way. I randomly came across this video now, so thumps-up to the algorithm, and one more subscriber for you!  🤙🏾
I tought the world islands in the dubai is actually blank empty but theres actually a lot of good spots
I am in Dubai for a while , I would have never known this ! Remarkable ! Thank you guys !
Dont let the Dubai tourism propaganda make you forget about their horrendous humans rights record of the past and present. Dont support UAE.
AIrsoft Gameplay here WHEN!??
Philippines should learn from them from keeping the dolomites washed away. lol
They should build like a Silicon-valleyesque place on one of those islands
I would build using LONG stilts
10:06 his laugh 🤣🤣🤣🤣

“I’m the first person to pee in the pool”
Song at the end?
This comment is below YouTube’s comment
Why are the islands empty?  The project was begun around the time of the housing crisis.  The developer ran out of money.  This isn't news.
How is he so calm about everything?
thanks to the dutch
How can he just destroy the environment like they own the ocean and land? Who does he think he is, god?
Probably a boring place.
Can we just do the same thing in Tuvalu and save it? Fundraiser mate 😂
Larry Dembrun  This video made me smile
"You're the only one here" the cameraman:
Excellent video 👍🏼
I feel like not a lot of people know Dubai was built by immigrant slavery
Alberta for sale?
This is awesome
"Were going to be more environmentally friendly" says the channel's creator. Meanwhile they fly fossil fueled jetliners EVERYWHERE the go. lol! Just like the movie stars that preach the same shit. Hypocrites all!
clearly not a fluff project ... Talent and Vision
These the islands everybody on Snapchat sees with all the countries ?😂
"No one's here?" sorry but the rest of us are fighting corona in lockdown
Excellent.
😍😍
THE STOCK MARKET SOARS AGAIN- According to Dr Albert Bourla, CEO Pfizer and Dr Moderna who announced that America is 95% ready to announced the VACCINE for COVID-19 pandemic anytime soon, this has really snowballed into nothing less than 4.65% in the stock market; an increase that brings hope and joy to the stock market community. Time to invest in Delta which has now increased by 18%, Carnival 31%, AMC Theatres 66%, JPMORGAN 9.5%, etc. With this, investing in the stock market for now seems like the best unlike before. You can acquire this Island with excess profits if you invest rightly!!!
insanlar nelerle uğraşıyor biz hala sağ sol derdindeyiz böyle ülkeden gitme de ne yap :/
Dubai is such a gross display of inequality
God gifted us free earth but man sold them in money... 🤔
Bjl
Lovely.
For anyone wondering how youtube joined 50 years ago it's a glitch,search up: Timeworks youtube joined 50 years ago for more info.
$20000 for an hour for that villa
ok but the chairman is a genius...like imagine if all millionaires/billionaires think like him
hi from Türkey. i m very love your channel but sometimes i don't understand u . i mean i hope you are add the Türkish write . see youu
Apparently building the islands as closely as they have has lead to a real bad sea water circulation problem, essentially leading to lots of stagnant, smelly bodies of water between the islands...and other islands are being eroded by different currents
After all this years the Islands still pretty much empty!?.....☹️☹️☹️ must be too expensive!
You look like the DEA agent on Narcos
man... how much I'd love to see you show the world about Tsaparang, Tholing, Mount Kailash...  <3
It's pretty disgusting to see the waste involved in all of this, so much disruption in carbon expenditure and the ecosystem for a few bits of extremely hot sand that will probably be gone in a few years from climate change anyway. Reclaiming land is important and not something which is necessarily bad in principle but they have just focused on this one goal of creating as much coastline as possible and not really used any common sense.  There have been some very positive developments with investments towards creating a large artificial reef and a bit more appreciation for environmental issues in the past few years so it does look like there have been lessons learned to some degree, that sort of focus does really need to ramp up though. It's a challenging enough environment to live in as it is and the direction they are currently headed is unsustainable on every front and they really need to put a lot more effort and funding to protect what makes Dubai unique.  No offense intended to the youtuber, you've obviously got to monetise what you can to have a decent lifestyle and I don't grudge that but I did feel that you were delivering a bit of a misleading message re your conversation with the creator. He was passionate re the sustainable living concepts and that's all interesting to hear (and fundamentally some good tech) but that isn't reflective of the whole picture - no matter how eco friendly operations now are, the construction of the islands themselves will far far far exceed that.
IDK It Just seems Exajurating to me😂Come on dude Feels Like Unique in this Landscape🤣🤣🤣🤣That's How u get India Feeling when u live in South india😂
Say Yes to Nigeria??... Please....? I'll be your tour guide 😀
How are people still flat earthers when theres even clearly a curve in multiple shots of the video
Check out Valeria Cuervo's video! #TikTok https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSgdJJkx/
Go look at this I'm sure you won't regret it
Quick question -- you guys are flying to some random spot in basically every video. Do you do anything to offset your carbon emissions?  I'm over here feeling guilty for flying once or maybe twice a year! I know there are ways to do it, just wondering if you are conscious of that. Cheers
The videos you showed of these islands being made shows the environmental degradation they caused and focusing on just the money is  a lost chance to use this platform to speak for a bigger issue on environmental degradation being rationalized for tourism and money.
This seems very off to me. you are promoting green and more environmentally merch while also also traveling across the world when a lot of us cant even see our family and friends due to this pandemic. I was going to buy so of your merch when you talked about the practices but realizing you aren't caring about the global health made me decide not to. this behavior is not okay just because it is for a video and for work. Lives are at risk, please do better and care about us

You aren’t the first person to stay on these islands. Inaccurate.
I've never seen a YouTube response on any channel but Yes Theory.  WOW!!!
Hi man i liked yuor vidios. I wonna won ticket to travel to go other countries
They should take a random person from like, each portion of the world that the island represents, then give them the island and see how they develop it
The dude dressed in the traditional uae clothing had perfect American English.
Incredible !
Beautiful but what a waste of money. The should build villages with water in Africa to start with.
why does he not wear a mask
Convid*
That's a true art of engineering
imagine if all  of this sinks because of global warming
Allahu Akbar, it's almost impossible to think this could've happened in such a short time but with Allah SWT anything is possible. Much Love to all and great video. <3 :)
The chairman is very smart.
Which sweatshirt was he wearing at the start of the vid? Which colour is that
*Thomas:* “I have the whole villa to myself, with no supervision.” *Also Thomas:* Filming everything he is does.
I need to go there to build Real Estate for People who does there tasks first then movie
Seek discomfort ... from a 5-star hotel in Dubai
Is it true that they built these islands without the infrastructure for electrical, water supply, waste system in place?
So this is what I saw on snap maps
I've been curious as to what's going on with this place.
How did he get residency in UAE in 3 months?
16:06 who’s that man in the back? He sleep with you?
He went down in that pool
it's like glitching outside of the map where you shouldn't be able to be in a video game
11:08 this mans flexing his AirPods
U wearin sketchers?
Can we get a Yes for GyroCopter 🥙
It's amazing what a bit of dinosaur juice can do.
“If you try to find happiness through the pursuit of worldly things, it will elude you. The only way to find happiness is through the pursuit of God.”
11:20 amazing joke, had me laughing
Did they think about impact on nearby coastline, fishing , beach erosion?
"No one ever tried to reclaim land like we did" Dutch: Am i a joke to you?!
That's like me leaving a food review of my sandwich and then my sandwich saying "thanks for the nice review."
Most of all you present comfort, come live with me you'll get the discomfort you are seeking :)
Yes theory becoming brand ambassador of UAE
Yo what sunglasses is that rich owner dude wearing
My brother took his hot air balloon off the islands and then floated over the city skyline.. Awesome vid! - Alex
Hey as a Zoology student, I was incredibly fascinated by this and I wanted to know if there were any animals / what animals and signs of biodiversity in the ocean between each individual island created? especially after the creation of such a project. If I'm being truly honest I did not even know this existed, and after my swamp load of work, I am for sho going to be researching into this. As always thank you all for bringing light, laughter and love in the most amazing of ways.
Added on my bucket list.  Already told my wife😊
im jealous of the tinder pics i could've gotten from this...
These islands are a part of the long list of failed projects in the UAE. The UAE seems to think that there are an endless supply of dumb foreign billionaires willing to invest into dumb ideas. While the multi millionaires and billionaires are definitely what has made past UAE projects successful, my point is simple and that is that there aren't enough billionaires in the world for all their crazy projects.  And no I'm not a UAE hater by any means. I love the country and the people and it is without doubt one of my favourite holiday destinations. I wish them well and hope to see them change their economic strategy for their own benefit.
Wow this is super amazing, i love the idea of the recycling, being eco friendly and less waste
"Your da king"
I have acquired very beautiful shooting A lot of impressions from your video🤝🤩😇
your face more similar to justin biber
in india there is an Island Called as Ramasethu
Haha Dubai!
just seeing Thomas makes me smile :)
I really wonder if they already contacted these guys before idk.. looks so planned. but still amazing!
What about that slave labor tho
you guys should visit lebanon !
Why is youtube here?
all of those are easily flammable, i guess the firefighter is moving by driving a boat?
please visit Nepal !! 🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵
This is reply for youtube omg !!! pls fix some of your rules like contents of youtuber being exclusive only for kids theyre not babysitter
Dubai is honestly so crazy, i went there last year and was just in awe of everything
i live in Dubai :)
It's crazy to think Sergio Perez may lose his racing seat in F1.
https://youtu.be/xXCXgMJWyWw
1:43, oh so thats why my flight is delayed
Your island is joke. Not a single coconut tree is available.   Sincerely honest from, South east asian people
The irony of wearing a "Seek discomfort" t-shirt while visiting a private island villa that nobody has every been to.
Climate change: I am going to ruin these islands careers.
I cant subscribe, I cant afford lose 3 hours every day. Love from all good ppl from Czech Republic.
🤣🤣🤣🤣being environmentally friendly while flying around the world in a gas gussling plane to make money from your followers 🤣🤣🤣   Way to keep that carbon footprint down
This might sound stupid, but I didn't ever think cooking with methane gas was an option
Does moving sand really need to cost $13 billion.
All those villas and hotels is so beautiful 😍 and it is so amazing how they manage all the garbages
Environmental, interesting. The first class flight must be solar powered then? ;)....
Fuck i watched it on day 7 😭
The camera man is good at his job.
The giggle when he saw the pizza killed me
what a waste..
Za Warudo
Hi how much it cost for this trip ?? thanks
Is flying allowed now?
This is irrelevant but when you guys said you were going to make a podcast I thought it was going to be you guys having a chat like friends
YESSSS love the sustainability!!!!!
Nice! While the rest of us are stuck at home y'all traveling to islands... K
What a horrible investment.
Saw this, immediately subscribed. Thank you, this is absolutely beautiful. Peace.
Put on a mask you ass.  They all have one.
how come everyone else has their mask on but the dudes from yes theory?
Me looking at that seek discomfort sweatshirt: "...man that looks comfy"
The production is insane Yes theory never disappoint. Also I think it would be cool if you traveled through the whole of Africa...
boo who who ...
What drone was used to film all this!?
lmao @1:20   You left him hanging
Plot twist: they built all that infrastructure in the day they made him wait. Can't pass up on the greatest free advertising opportunity knocking at your door!
This man makes me want to be successful in life so I can try to experience these things
BE CAREFUL WITH CHINA CAUSE THEY MIGHT GET IT.
What a waste
More environmental friendly ~ Gets on jet and flys across the planet using 100k of fuel.   Okay...
How is power brought to the island ?
How is you just gonna make some islands like that? 👁👄👁
amazing
I want to seek discomfort too in a $13 Billion Man-Made Islands! :P
I love yes theory. I was really disappointed with the mask usage in this video. It’s not like you are around friends/family in their homes, for example on Lebanon Island you were maskless while the workers were masked. I know it’s outside, but you definitely weren’t 6 feet away. If it’s strangers you should always be on the side of caution..I hope you keep that in mind for future content. Travel safe!
Man thats pretty tough to top as an experience  .  My Thanks to the folks that own the place for letting us see it and talking some about its history and evolution. This was a brilliant idea and makes a completely awesome get away !!!!
I want to see a Pangea of the world as an island
Didnt michael jackson buy an island there? That's it deserted is coz the company went bust during an earlier financial crisis
Who was that in the background in the window while you was talking😂😂 at 10:42
Go to lebanon
Youtube commenting was the 2nd most bougiest thing you'll expierence 😂
such a nice advertiser for Dubai...doesn't even seem that you were paid to do this. But yes...is sad what is happening around the world...but at least Dubai knows how to find people to promote their country.
Am I the only one thinking it’s kinda ironic that you start the video telling us how much you care about the environment, but the video is about Dubai? They literally made and are still making their wealth on selling oil?
It'd be a dream to be the head maintenance there
we are going to being more mindful of our enviroment... gets a flignt half way across the world  lol
It would be so cool if each island had the architecture from it's original continent + the food as well.
Should’ve brought an ounce of top shelf weed bro 🏖😎 🏝
To much money over th3ere
The abuse and kidnapping of indian workers that built these islands should have been the topic of conversation. Not a massive advertisement.
Man bun, 5 day "beard", typical annoying millenial.
Looks like something you'll find on Minecraft..
Come to south africa 🇿🇦
Flying across the world... "We want to be more environmentally friendly"
I like the shirts
No thanks

So funny that the chef assumed that he wanted burger and pizza lmao
Where there any fish life in the water?
Who is scrolling through the comments instead of watching the video 🤣
Bio degrade.. oh he's on an airplane.
The marketing error was thinking that thousands of rich people would flock to a country run by medieval madmen where one can be executed for sex between consenting adults.
Build it and they will laugh at you.
Yes
8:11 yo he even got airpods
As a israeli, we are so excited that we make a peace with Dubai! Great timing
I'm just scared of tsunamis
FANTASY ISLAND vibes lol on the chairman! great guy!
I like how he talks about caring about the enviroment while he makes a video that harms the enviroment as much as i do in 2 years...
Seems like a lonely place to live permanently.
How do I work for you guys
Whats the goal the of the project, a completely sustainable microcosmos of the World?
1:27 always. AND I MEAN ALWAYS. Kiss the homies goodbye. thank u
Respect. All of those shots looked so good... :)
Those islands are a waste of money and an example of humans destroying a habit/ecosystem
what about rising see levels though... aren’t all the islands gonna be underwater in like 30 years 😅
words of billionaire..duhhh
All the billions in the world can not reproduce the beauty of nature !
Didnt know you had an ad
PUBG glider in real life!
Yes Theory made a good comeback
Dubai, the best example of government with no corruption and people of dream to make the world with better living without any damage to environment..thats what i see in this video
13:31 The Netherlands enters the chat
Awesome! This video is very helpful! You can visit my channel to see awesome stuff, too!
They are empty because they were speculated property. The economy had other plans.
so the islands are a jojo reference?
The chairman is one intelligent dude.
My new dream destination listed!
Banger
That’s so cool, I would love to see this in person. I love that helicopter you went on, awesome flight.
Him: “seek discomfort” Me: (puts pillow in an uncomfortable position)
Cant imagine how much money was used to make one of them islands
I came here for the Islands.... but I'm now subscribing for the Organic/Environmental friendly clothes.
I didn’t get my permission yet.
I think, after watching this video, we can all agree that Mother Nature is the best architect.
SO WHAT D OYOU GUYS DO? you guys just travel to experience things?
Thats the dream!
most useless use of 13bill that has ever happened. What an airhead
It would be cool if each island had a different cultures from the real world
Stop flying. That will help the environment
*Scrolls down to comment's* See's YouTube commented                                *Nani?!*
Can you guys make a video on the Spartan race???
Just bought a hoodie, can't wait to get it!!!  Much Love to all!!
The fact that the islands are man-made has me guessing they would have to constantly monitor issues such as erosion and other natural evolutions. That aside....what a beautiful country!
They killed off the ocean where they built this 😫 Environmental Impacts The construction of the Palm Islands and The World, for all Nakheel's attempts to do otherwise, have had a clear and significant impact on the surrounding environment. It would be impossible to introduce a change of such magnitude to an established ecosystem and not anticipate any negative changes or reactions in the area's wildlife and natural processes. The construction of the various islands off the coast of Dubai has resulted in changes in area wildlife, coastal erosion and alongshore sediment transport, and wave patterns. Sediment stirred up by construction has suffocated and injured local marine fauna and reduced the amount of sunlight filtered down to seashore vegetation. Variations in alongshore sediment transport have resulted in changes in erosion patterns along the UAE coast, which has also been exacerbated by altered wave patterns as the waters of the Gulf attempt to move around the new obstruction of the islands.
They are also supposedly sinking back into sea 😂 hope they clean there mess up and don’t leave it in the ocean 🙏🏻
People haven’t tried before because environmentally imagine what he did to the ocean honestly it makes me sick watching this
Video idea, in Virginia go to the President Head Museum! Coolest and Most Strange place i have ever been to
Ayo is this that Snapchat thing of the world
It’s end of 2020 and robot can watch YouTube video
I really would like to know the economics behind all this...
There isn't much mention of the people who toiled to build these islands.
Hi
The UAE!! The most environmentally unfriendly place on earth. Waste at its finest. Just look at what oil money gets you, rape the 🌎. Tragic
when ur outside, "the floor" is called the ground
Is this where they held the fyre festival? 😂
If ur bored just go check this on snap map and you will be shocked 😳
When I see the bamboo I remember my country lol
Does the chairmen have any sons?
This seems like a terrible idea considering rising sea levels
nice
huh. he never answered what's happening with all the islands
What will happen to these islands with the rising sea levels 🤔
i guess dubai is not concerned with global warming lol wasting so much energy building worthless sand islands
Can you imagine how rich that "chairman" dude must be to be the dude behind all of this?
when 2 much comfort is actually discomfort ;o
wow man. great video :)
walmart version of the paul brothers
With today's sand erosion and sea levels rising is this a safe place to build a home?
12:25 He is refering to Palm Deira, but the subtitles just say "there". Palm Deira has the same layout as Palm Jumeirah, but on a much larger scale.
Wear a fucking mask you see them wearing them so put one on just Bc you’re a YouTube don’t mean you can’t get rona and spread it
Yep- looks like really seeking discomfort in that luxury hotel. Must be hell  :-)
From celebrating in the streets of COVID infected LA without a mask to traveling to the other side of the world in the middle of a pandemic. This channel is about as environmentally friendly as the virus itself
How many wives does the developer have?
Why is he only wearing a mask 30% of the time.
dubai never fails to amaze us..
Song at 5:15?
Tell me I'm not the only one seeing Westworld at 6:55
Becoming more environmentally conscience while being based out of one of the cities with the worst pollution, traveling to a city that is known to abuse it's workers and quite literally has been fighting against the environment because of where it is located. Seriously, look up some of the challenges Dubai faces and will face. I don't doubt they will have to continue to pump more sand onto these "islands" to combat rising sea levels, or the massive dust storms they have might help with that. Honestly, what a disgrace. Pandering to the masses about being more eco-friendly and doing this honestly sounds like some satire channel.
This video should mention "INCLUDES PAID PRMOTION"  banner at the beginning .
All the staff and even the chairman have a very "Indian" accent which is surprising.
i remembered one vid from a girl on tiktok who was on her snap map amd ignorant about these islands claiming that dubai "owns the world" like foh. you're a child who knows nothing yet. a quick google search isnt that hard but meh she was a child so who cares lol
Why did you guys add subtitles for the chairman??? he can be understood clearly LOL
Thank you for this perspective of a man visiting Dubai. As a woman I won't be able to go there without a husband and won't be able to have such normal conversations with arabic man at eye level than you had. I am happy that I could somehow be a part of those conversations and gain an insight of the behaviour of arabic man to other man. It's a whole different story if you are a woman. Thank you.
UAE have more money than sense
1:17 Why Ammar looks so depressed here?
The real discomfort in this video is how ridiculous its to see that much money is wasted because of one person Ego, instead of spending it to fix the planet...
How many bodies of dead slave workers do you think this guy was walking around on out there? Amazing experience....
Eco friendly man-made island that costed billion to make and will most likely be flooded in a few year because of climate change... Should we stop encouraging these billionaire to do these kind of thing instead of actually spending money on fixing the planet... These fake island are just another example of how ridiculously disconnected the top 1% rich is from the rest of the world... All about their Ego...
Flying long haul business class is really getting out of your comfort zone and being environmentally conscious eh?
He’s using a helicopter from rust
Thank you for sharing beautiful and amazing video! ❤
He should make the rocks higher because we have been on the Antarctica island and shipwrecks happen because of the low rocks
They’re like: “Boy come from America“ Oh, ok!! Send him some “Hamburger & Pizza” 😝
12:32 every dutch person be like:  Flevoland Nah but for real tho that guy is talking bullshit, in the Netherlands we build an entire province out of nothing
Real life tomorrow land
You and Drew have nice experiences because y’all are guys. Do you think ladies would be as welcomed(alone)? P.S. Still love y’all and can’t wait for your future adventures!! Hopefully ladies can travel alone soon in the future 😊
This place could be home to the Flat Earth Society.
i love how so many people are angry of someone success , and jealous
Just the view of the city makes me want to pack up and explore the world :(
The Chairman is the literal definition of : )
Man I love my country my only wish is to meet you in dubai sometime
The hypocrisy by Yes Theory in this video is stunning. How can you say that you want to be environmentally friendly then fly all the way to Dubai for an advertisement for these islands? At the same time preaching to "seek discomfort". Did staying at a luxury resort make you uncomfortable Yes Theory? The only discomfort you should be feeling is from the choice of making this video...
Wow awesome, I had wondered what was going on with these. Had no idea
The music is so annoying asking away from everything!
Still Dubai though, you can say you’ve done what other didn’t even try and we know how much you like to brag but let’s not forget it’s built by slave labors. How about you build a better country that doesn’t go out of its way to kill innocent people in Yemen and other countries. I’m sure a lot will not like my comment but if you really claim to spread positivity you can’t ignore the fact that this tiny country is ruled by a family that their kids and wives ran away from all the shit they do. Wives and daughters of ruler of Dubai ran away because they were prisoners basically, imagine how many slave labors are oppressed. More than 100,000 killed in Yemen since UAE and Saudi Arabia started bombing innocent civilians in 2015 until this day.
Stupid people with stupid ideas lol 😂
Yo bro's!! Yes Theory is the best!!! . I appreciate your hard works just to make people find comfort or discomfort or whatever it is.. It's such an amazing idea.. But please man.. You should try to my country Philippines.. There's a lot of crazy adventures here that awaits you.. Please bro.. But I know also that this will never happen soon, because of this pandemic. But I hope this ends very soon.. I am hoping to be noticed guys.. This will be crazy.. Thank you.
Wow
*Yes theory:* Were becoming more environmentally conscious    *steps off of 15 hour flight
These videos help me realize how beautiful the world is and sometimes I forget that
Can I come on a trip with you ?
It`s ashame that im probably never going to that place because im gay and homosexuality is punishable by death there :(
Thomas looks like Justin Bieber in this video 😲😲
Jurassic Park vibes
QUESTION (READ THIS IF YOU WANT): Will you go to Heaven when you die? Have you lied, stolen, used God’s name in vain, or lusted (which Jesus said was adultery, Mt. 5:28)? If so, God sees you as a liar, thief, blasphemer, and adulterer at heart. If you die in your sins, you will end up in a terrible place called Hell. But there's good news. Though we broke God's Law, Jesus paid the fine by dying on the cross: "God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life" (Jn. 3:16). Then Jesus rose from the dead and was seen by hundreds of eyewitnesses. He fulfilled all the prophecies of the promised Savior. Please, today, repent and trust Jesus, and God will forgive you and grant you the gift of eternal life (Eph. 2:8,9). Then, to show your gratitude, read the Bible daily and obey it, join a Christian church, and be baptized. Visit NeedGod.com and LivingWaters.com  ..
hoping manila bay gonna make like this beautiful and planned as well
So many issues
Oh my god. “ how do you bring all of the materials out here in the middle of the ocean? Is it by boat?” Hahahahahahah Thomas- “” imagine if you brought $900,000.00 worth of materials and you forgot a screwdriver?” Ahahaha are you fucking kidding me? You are a child Brody. You would think that by now you would have some kind of street Common sense
one of the epicness videos i have ever seen, it would be cool if u return in the islands in 10 years! see u in 10 year back haha
I used to DJ most days on Lebanon Island.
Seek comfort
I love how he's living his life can't wait to make it out and live like that
Hair- I understand the want for curly hair Brody but you are either going to have to spend some more time in the ocean to obtain a little more curl or use chemicals/fake it up in a salon
*Indeed, When it comes to beauty it is Dubai NOT Mumbai*
Goes during pandemic ... **wHeRE iS eVeRYonE**
There is one island that has a giant mansion on it that is a upturned Viking ship
I hate to know how much the building of those islands damaged the environment
Oil money can do crazy things
"Our guest is American,what should the chief make for him?" Chief makes Burger AND pizza!
Why not wearing a mask ? Even to show respect ????
Wow
I wanted a hoodie but it is way too expensive for mexicans :(
I don't get why don't you wear a mask. Its not that hard and it would help to be an example to people...
Damn I wanna move to Dubai one day or just go back to visit. 😭😍😍
i like your channel. very informative not the typical millennial you tube channel. you seem intelligent and you have a purpose ad a goal.. congrats. im following your Chanel
thumbing down and giving you very little run time because you're not wearing a mask around the people that are hosting you. Later. Unsub. Be better!!!
I wish I could not only do this for myself but a stranger too!!
H
Imagine u sitting there at night on new year and seeing firework show gng on in dubai
Holly shit yesssss!!!!
That wasn't a big discomfort you found there, was it? :D
Waste of money
They waiting for the multi millionaires and billionaires to build houses on them.
Sad archipelago sounds
"Today is the day Seek discomfort will be more environmental friendly", Dude flies across the world in the same video :P Loving the videos btw, keep them coming :)
Typical American , when all around you are wearing a mask  ,........don't bother worrying about their safety and so don't bother wearing a mask.....
Fake
somehow, this video took me back to 2018
what a hypocrite go on about the environment to sell your merchandise then go on a long flght to make a video 😂😂wtf
I am leaving this comment here because I know you guys are capable of processing constructive criticism... I like your work and I admire your grit and passion, but I have to say, this one about the man-made islands in front of Dubai left me quite puzzled. You are promoting a much greener "product" (I hope you do not mean just your merch), and you end up traveling with a commercial flight to a place that has done nothing worth noticing, but disrupting the ecosystem. Not just that, but you pick this topic when there are plenty of videos on youtube that offer extensive information about these islands and the ecological mess up they are. I understand the cut you gave to the episode, being "alone" there should make you feel some sort of extraordinary feeling, but what was the challenge for you exactly there?  What discomfort did you seek in that place? I kinda missed it. Cuz you traveled safely, with local prime tourist guides bringing you around to the point they introduced you to the boss of the islands... not sure this is what I expect from you, definitely not what I liked you for when I first subscribed to your channel. It felt more like a promotional video encouraging people to consider living there if they have remote works allowing it. Virtual hugs and good look with your next challenge, anyway!
so good to hear that intro
Pretty Interesting Video!
How did he get into the UAE?
"Nobody ever build or reclaimed islands the way we did, nobody even tried"   Eeeeehm yes we did... the Dutch did in 1700.... with most of our country.... and to correct this fine sir. the dutch build these too ;) most of our ships got hired for this :P
Did anyone see the Tom and jerry movie ad.....................ah hell yeah
Dude where can i find this sweater youre wearing 2:11?!
That place looks amazing 🤩 id love to go someday
Guy: *talks about how they are trying to make the island as liveable as possible* Thomas: There's a pool!
I'm getting some Jurassic Park vibes
I think I am going to vomit.. :(
Wow
What an experience! I love the positivity. God keep blessing you all on the team.
This was the dopest vlog i ever watched
You should visit lebanon 🇱🇧
Thomas ur so handsome...You are very HOT too...🔥❤️❤️❤️
12:30 is this guy aware of Flevoland? The Netherlands did it 50 years before this, and a Dutch company also made those islands lol.
They say the seas are rising ...
I've been searching about those islands. At first i can't believe that there are small islands near dubai on google map that called world island Thank you for visiting it, i would love go there
Love this ❤️❤️❤️❤️
What a dream you live in. So happy for you and the team. Keep saying "YES!"
welcome
Billions down the drain
They should held the Fyre festival over there. Tons of room lol
Just got a seek discomfort ad, feeling proud.
yo, guys, your new videos are top-notch, nice shots
Surprised to see waste management in Carbon exporter country
I like how Jeff Bezos can literally just buy all of them lmao
Mrbreast would love that

How to build your fanbase? Go to PHILIPPINES!
Everybody gangsta until youtube comment on your video  on youtube.
The man is a GENIUS!!!!
Did you have watched the documentary on vice Channel that how Dubai is made . I mean from labourers coming to Dubai and how they treat them badly . Like modern day slaves .  In that documentary they had shown the real face of brutal Dubai .
Man-made no human-made
Man-made no human-made
This is a coastal marine fauna and flora massacre.
When will you be cutting out air travel, or doesn't that count?
real funny to think about how the water level will rise and all these islands are going to drown, only the funny part is real short lmao
Be one of the only people traveling during this time, doing crazy shit while wearing a shirt that says seek discomfort. Great marketing guys. Love the sustainability movement as well
As if YouTube commented, that’s their 2nd every reply to a creator
You gotta love the Emiratis. They are absolutely innovative and future-thinking. They love luxuries but they never forget the basics. They are true representatives of peace and prosperity!
#Greenwashing
There's only one problem with the world islands in Dubai. IT Doesn't look like the world 😂 at all.
Ah so you basically made an unpayed commercial for the world islands?
Nobody ever reclaimed a island like us? *laughs in Dutch* my man, the Dutch did this a long time ago, a lot of the reclaim work was done by a Dutch company as we perfected the skills of doing it.
i pressed youtubes account and it showed it was created 50 years ago
Come to El Salvador :(
Where's your Afghanistan video?
I've been dreaming to go in Dubai and i hope someday i can to it. 😊😁😂
I am surprised he didn't just go naked in the villa when he was all alone.
Hey Guys  Usually l am a big fan of the channel but there are a couple of things in this video that seem pretty problematic:  1. You preface this video saying that you are taking steps towards being an "environmentally conscious brand". You then go on to tour a group of man-made islands that have undoubtedly had a major environmental impact on marine ecosystems within the Persian Gulf. In addition, these kinds of projects tend to be financed through revenue generated by the petrochemical industry. I feel like you guys should be trying to distance yourself from such projects.  2. I'm not sure what this has to do with your original message of "seek discomfort"? It feels more like a lifestyle blog of the rich and the famous ......
What happen if there a climate change
"the covid" torpedoed those plans .....
proud to be a msulim 💖
does anyone know the name of the helicopter?
Waffles on about being more planet friendly with clothing lines, and yet travels across the world in a huge passenger jet.  Picked up and dropped off in cars, then an autogiro trip, boats, and lastly a 4x4 buggy thing tearing across the dunes.  Yeah - saving the planet one step at a time? DMML!
Yes
Discomfort lol. Gyrocopter, personal escort with motor-boat, inaugural stay on an island with a villa and a pool, meeting with the chairman of the palms and the world.
Wish I could visit this place one day.
I really enjoy watching your videos. Its always fun and makes you whish to travel the world. I only wish that sometimes you would also show the other side of some topics and be more critical about topics you are talking about, like the enviromental consequens of those manmade islands. I think seeking discomfort is also be able to adress critics, breaking taboos and to admit mistakes.
What about the rising sea level, the islands look very low
Oh so this is where our government got their idea to dump Dolomite white sand on Manila Bay to make it a paradise.... but failed.
This is really nice to see. These dudes are probably billionaires, but hearing them talk about the islands it doesn't fit the greedy, corporate image we normally associate with the top %, he clearly cares about this project just as people might care about any other project and he's really considering how to make these islands sustainable, not just using all the money he has to solve the issue of sustainability.
I’m over here eating Mac n cheese in a cup and Thomas getting 2 burgers, a pizza and a salad.. trying to throw me a slice? 😂😂
WOW
I liked that they recicled, garbage. Maybe this will be used in other places
Chairman sounds like robin williams
i wish their was a 'SUPER LIKE' button !
AWESOMEEE
theyre going to build houses on it
All built on slave labor.
Dude all way from South Africa, just like say thank you for showing me the islands. My family and I will try and go and see The islands. its out of this world, also well done to the developers of the island it looks outstanding.
guys, just because the motto is "seek discomfort" doesnt mean you should visit dubai because being thrown in jail or tortured is a bit too uncomfortable for most
Amazing video 1 can't believe the owner is so knowledgeable about the island. Way to go!

Me- finds that the quality goes up to 2160 Also me- *surprised Pikachu noises*
This is actually fucking amazing the man who built these is beyond his years. I've always hade Dubai at number one to visit but it has just gone up even more!
FAIL! Check out the newest video up now! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vul5s...
Za Warudo
"being mindful about the environment". flies to dubai and goes on a helicopterflight.
“Being mindful of our environmental impact”.... and here I am taking a flight to the other side of the world. Irony?
That group of island is called zawarudo
Wear a mask 😷😷 we don't want u to get sick
how do they power all these islands, amazing
Soon everything will be under water....Soon realize the power of ocean
Must be nice having money
I honestly thought he was going to be sleeping in a tent when he said he was going to stay on the island overnight.
Who got a country full of sand to buy sand? lmaoo
cool ad .... I prefer my islands to be built by nature tho 👁
7:10 is the music of city-building game
everyone that disliked is just jealous lol
Those islands appeared out of nowhere, it is called "The Big Bang".
They are just waiting for Mr beat to make video....
How are man made islands made?  Real question 🙋‍♂️
How many countries have you all been to?
Yes a country I’ll never be able to visit cause I can be imprisoned or sentenced to death for who I am
Dubai is amazing one of  best country to visit for vacation
i miss the videos when you guys used to seek discomfort
Dubai, founded and funded by Bush Family
He's not wearing a mask!!
how do they power the inland?
I live vicariously through YES theory.
Watching from the Caribbean 🇻🇨🇻🇨🇻🇨 and I enjoyed this video. Informative and relaxing to be honest.
why aren’t you wearing a mask lol
careful, China will claim this islands 😅
Dubai as a country has grown so much more than any other country in the world ! The best country in the world
that water almost has no life in it, the water is extremely salty from water disalination plants
Amazing page, i love it. You should try visiting Lebanon🇱🇧
6:12 music playing is so dope what song is that
The cool thing about these guys, is the fact that they’ve basically set them self’s up to rarely get a no. The whole concept almost “forces”, people they contact to say yes. Without actually forcing anything.
Loved the video bro.
I love you guys for the past 3 years I’ve been watching your videos. I love you guys :)
Island hopping just got a lot better 🏝
There is literally Ocean around this island. And this guy happy, because of pool xD
cool
Plot Twist: He lives on the island and never comes back.
planet is over everyone 4 th seal of apocalypse when Jesus marks we the chosen we are leaving in my spacecrafts bye bye
Planet the sleepwalking ring millennials so blind ! Such a waste of a cute face and a hideous man bun ugg
I know you don’t care about my opinion but are you for real? Are you that flipping delusional!? It’s the fourth seal of apocalypse moron, Gods destroying this plant by 2025 it’s over dude wake up!
noice
Wow, great experience for you.  Good luck in your endeavours!
Breathtaking...
what happens if a storm rips threw the place
Why does the merch link direct to a page that asks for password? I can't shop or even see the collection... 🤔
i one day will visit
is there much demand for this? There are only so many billionaires in the world, and most of them have better taste...
To reduce carbon foot print yes theory decided to travel world. Well that is not harming the environment at all. Right?
Sooo what happens to the islands when all the glaciers melt?
I am curious about your clothing.  I was wanting to check out your site but is says I need a password to enter.  It also says it is on the page but I don't know where to find it!
Damn 5.92 million subs it’s been a long time
The Middle East has changed a lot in 15 years
I was thinking the chairman would be someone talking about money, power with servants running all around him but he turned out be the exact opposite..Humble, down to earth and environment conscious. Wow! lol
Wow. I repeatedly kept saying wow to myself through the entirety of this video lol. Once again thank you, Thomas. I’m in real estate development at college in Boston right now, and this man knows what he’s doing. Need his info lol.
Just curious to know how much they paid you to promote their shiny hot garbage.
Dubai people are really really rich and have the ability to build crazy stuff
Saw these on google maps months ago and wondered the same thing.
lit no one cares, but i can see the island from my house 😂🙌
the chairmen is a genius you can tell
Who else was thinking the one dude one have a like a strong accent
imagine this guys stories he’ll tell when he’s 80
It’s the lack of consistent mask wearing for me and of course it’s the white guy being absolutely reckless
Where are my European bros at??
The amount of times his mask is NOT on IN PUBLIC near others is alarming and this is why we STILL have a pandemic.
beautiful
Why not just sell nothing and reduce your environmental impact significantly more?
Whats your backpack
Wow what has Yes Theory come to... That‘s one giant non-marked ad. I‘m out.
Having lived in Utah my entire life, watching this makes me want to visit Dubai so desperately! So different in every way
These idiots have got way too much money
very very impressive.  I was talking about humans could build islands so more space could be created. First-ever very impressive God Bless Dubai!!!!!!
Wow the chairman is humble and mindful
inshallah i will go there oneday.
❤❤❤
get a haircut
love it id live there
Its aiiight , its an island with some buildings on it
They’re like: “Boy come from America“ Oh, ok!! Send him some “Hamburger & Pizza” 😝
I love Dubai.
hell no with that copter lol
Video idea : most expensive hotel in india vs cheapest hotel in india
Ever heard of the Dutch reclaim story? you'll be fascinated.
Best place to go in an apocalypse
tom looks like a 35 year old man
no way \\
Who watch one piece 😏😏, You already know what is it.
I actually went there by boat 2 years ago.but I didn't stay overnight they were showing us the island.
Dubai. Such a great place for woman
Also known as: dio's getaway
I love Dubai! I used to teach English there and it was the best 3 years of my life. Can’t wait to go back!
Chairman is an incredibly smart and down to earth thoughtful guy....hope he succeeds in his mission👍🏻
Another muzzle-wearing yahoo
I have to tell you that I really really but also if its like that I hope you have a regardless for now so thank you very also.
Good traveller. I want same you so much.
He is able to fly a drone in dubai. You have no idea how much of a struggle that can be :D
I'm pretty sure you can get arrested for hugging California.  🙄
Announces new “environmentally conscious” merch simultaneously with free metal bracelet... Kinda stepping on your own positive action there aren’t cha?
I see you guys are getting WOKE and if you continue and turn it up even more i guarantee you you will go BROKE. 👎🏻

imagine a zombie breakout at this island
Did he realise the chairman was the Vice President of the United Arab Emirates😅
So exciting
Recently I’ve been getting a lot of recommendations about this topic. Is youtube secretly advertising them to potential buyers?
Soo this is what mrbeast was talking about when giving away an island?
Am i the only person who think this guy looks like a combine between Ryan Gosling and Tim Roth? 😲
I was concerned that the islands might wash away but they seem to have a solid foundation built on the bodies of journalist's and dead yemeni children. Very inspiring video guys 👍
2160p looks mad on this
LOL A SEEK DISCOMFORT AD CAME UP TO ME IN THIS VIDEO LMAO
Dubai is amazing. I miss it
Tell the story of Hong Kong and its protest lmao
I love Dubai❤️
Awesome!
awesome! your very lucky dude coming all the from the states just to be there. Im living in Dubai but i never get a chance to be in the World Island. thanks for sharing this and i like the way your create videos and it gives me more ideas  Im just a small youtuber and just started my channel ... Are you still here in Dubai? hope you can Check out the night life here maybe you can feature us Filipino artist.... Stay safe and god bless

How can I buy seek discomfort cloths in India ???
Yo, iz dis fo reel??
This is the first video where I saw on YouTube commenting...
thirteen dollar billion
Thank you!
what a coincidence you wound up being a guest of the developer. that's just wild
15 million budget of philhealth & Dolomite project < 13 billion man made island
DUDE WHATS THAT 7:04 SHOT OMGGGG
15:06 Yeah, whatever I got a private islans, time to sleep.   (JOKE)
Dubai is soulless I hope it changes in the future..
Omg,I live in UAE and I saw these small islands on the Google map before the epidemic struck and I wondered what those were,well...now I know
music festival
I hope I can make the right decisions through my life so that I can do things like that, and help solve the worlds problems, but I'm just a single person out of 7.8billion, there are so many more people out there, that are way more talented or important than I'll probably ever be. But who said we cant try.
i wouldn't ever go to dubai, they use slaves to build that city.
They need a school
it’s not even been long but the yes crewneck is sold out alr :(
They spent 13 billion dollars on a group of islands!!
I’m from Dubai, and I’m glad u visited it!
Dubai was made with slave labor btw, don't idealize this country.
This is where za wardo lives
Namaste from Nepal 🙏🏼 Nice episode. Just subscribe your channel
Sadhanam kayyilundo??😁
Big admirer of Yes Theory..lots of love from Nepal🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵
You actually came here at a good time. Virus patients started getting low
It's called the ground when it's outside.
Thanks my girlfriend wants to go there lol so cool
Seeing you guys growth since 500,000 makes me happy, ya’ll have always put in the work and it shows, keep on going
AHH I WANNA GO HERE!!:D
ZA WARUDOOO
That is incredible
my fav moment? 8:19
wait u can travel now?!?!?
i wonder how badly making those islands fucked up the habit around it
The second phase of lockdown is more than imminent globally. The best way to beat this COVID-19 is to embark on an aggressive online investment which is the only way to avoid much contact with people thereby preventing you from testing positive. The future they say belongs to those who see possibilities before they are obvious. I never envisaged that a time will come in life that going out will be amounted to almost a crime. 7months ago, I started investing with Elizabeth Cullum Hart who is a professional stock broker and financial consultant; living did I knew that I was saving my future and today I have made over $665,000 with just a start up capital of $232,000. DO not wait for any government but take your chances and invest today! This comfort can only be enjoyed when you invest well and by the money will seem nothing to you because you will only be spending your excess profits! Great adventure guy!
I want that kind of discomfort, please
Ah yes, 6 years of slave labor from Bangladesh.
Subscribed. More power to your channel. Mabuhay! 👍🇵🇭💖😊
WHEN YOUR ADS RUN ON YOUR OWN VIDEO LOL
This guy is a genius great way of designing the island
My life sucks. Why can’t I live like these dudes
Environmentaly friendly? Do you realize how much carbon emission comes from planes flying all over the world?
They are so nice LMAO
it look like a call of duty map lol
love it!
This is defiantly my favorite YouTube channel
damn.
You could have visited Micheal Schumacher's Island, unless its private am not so sure.
The yes theory guys are gonna have a lot of stories to tell their grandkids
Man made islands? The Netherlands made whole land! *Flevoland*
Funny thing is that if u go on snap map it looks like a glitch when it says world
Environmentally friendly - with so many flights involved?
that's my fav fishing spot
Congrats for 6mil subs
It would be cool to actually colonize these tho!
Seek discomfort, or seek advertising dollars. More promotional than anything else.
thomas video>>>
Didn’t you guys delete your channel like 6 months ago?
Question, where does the sewerage drain to or get treated from these islands ? did you ask this question whilst there ?
they bankrupt rn lol
That’s so fuckin rad. I want to go to Dubai so damn bad
A
This dude says some of the dumbest shit
Love seeing those environmental steps with the merch my dudes! Well done!
you look like ryan gosling
Imagine having a pool when you have a ocean in your backyard 😂😂😂😂🙃
You just made an advertisement video for one of the most brutal regimes in the world. Love your videos but tbh this is just crazy.
Imagine fucking building islands worth 13$ billion and not putting anything on it like wtf man
Money talks 😎 get rich or die trying ✊
This dude is lying, the Netherlands would be underwater by now if we hadn't build new islands, land and walls in the very same way. But nice video though! 😍
Ever heard about Sand stolen from beaches all around the world especially in the Caribbean even in Jamaica. I believe that this where it went
That I. The USA would have costed 3 times. Instead of $13b , US $39 b
YouTube commented and I just saw Imagine being *the* company and not having the most subs
YouTubes so bored they watched ther own recommendations and commented
I wish you would show your hosts respect and wear a mask.
How about just not producing merchandise that people do not need. That’s environmentally friendly!
Hey guys I’m just looking to get my mindset better and get more motivated, any books or anything y’all suggest to try to read and try?
Ok YouTube fine I'll watch it
Hundred naked islands
Unnecessary  flex   for 13 billion $
really good
see levels is going op for 1
please keep ur mask on around others for safety <3
It seems boring
Yes theory is back !
That place is a vibe
The guy was undercover American
I love yes theory. No further comments intended.
Where did you get power?.how on the island?
I came ere to find out why the islands are empty, like it says in the thumbnail. Now ive seen the whole video and i still dont know the answer!
When he said you are the king I don’t know why I found that super funny😂
Mas maganda pa toh kesa sa dolomite e
I have never seen one Yes Theory video that didn’t have over 1 million views. 🙃
Welcome to Da Nang city :)
much love from Malaysia <3
Awestruck! Loved every bit of it!
I think this is a payed promotion video  from the Island's 🤪
way too many ads
Sooooo glad you're baaaaack! 🥺😍🧡
I miss Dubai
Please wear mask especially when around with other people :(
"Nobody ever reclaimed islands like we did"  Except of course for the Dutch, who you hired to do the actual reclaiming.
This reminds me of the FYRE festival 😂
Please film 18:9
8:59 There's a pool = Livable  Me: I quess my apartment isn't livable then

What an excellent video!! So glad I checked it out
Is it me or the islands give me a weird feeling.
I’m trying to run with uz tech me
Cooorooona virus 🦠 🦠
I used to be super insecure when I went outside and because of Yes Theory I tryed to "seek discomfort" and actually started talking to people. Now I don't leave my house cause im  insecure.
This looks incredible!
Tkis is like Kornati in Croatia 😊
Great video and editing Thomas, but frankly this is quite hypocritical to mention yes theory becoming more eco-friendly at the beginning of a video that offers positive exposure to a project that has disastrous environmental consequences. I’m not sure the innovative garbage reducing innovation mentioned by the chairman are ever going to make up for the tons of energy and waste generated by the creation of these islands. :(  Moreover, it is debatable if 100% organic cotton is a more sustainable option than conventional considering that, although it limits the use of pesticide, is it very resource intensive, requiring up to 2.5 the amount of water than conventional. Recycled cotton, which limit waste as well as land and water consumption is the real eco alternative here.  Finally why not go on a trip to places like eco-villages where people live alternative lifestyles and actually trade-off some comfort in order to build fairer and more sustainable micro-societies.
Please remember who built them and under the fire/dire conditions in the heat there!
seek discomfort ... wow... new line on my daily check list. fucking crazy were life gives you word of wisdom !!!!
I seen these islands on Snapchat maps
If you notice - there are SO many empty islands and apartments and buildings spaces. And they kept on building. I worked on a few projects there and became so bored. It’s such a boring city.
This gives me Jurassic Park vibes as he is like the only one on the island
I'd like to see you guys vlogging in Indonesia, we are have 718 local languages and we live in diversity. Because the country's motto is unity in diversity.
The chairman guy was amazing
people be playing Minecraft before it existed
I am amazed at the beauty of the islands and their villas!  They have carefully thought of everything, well done!  At their gracious invitation to you to view it, now so many people can see it and look forward to spending a vacation there!
Wow! I can`t reach this place and i can`t afford to go this place so thank you for sharing.It`s Amazing and beatiful place.
still missing New Zealand... Nice 👌🏽
Just a random question: If there was a health emergency on that island how would they respond to it as they can't send an ambulance obviously. Do they have like a mini hospital on each island?
TRY TO VISIT HERE IN THE PHILIPPINES   GOD BLESS BE SAFE...
A little uninviting i have to admit
Malayali da😄
...are there sharks swimming among the islands?  Is the water nice or too salty?
Yes theory: eNviRonMeNt fRieNdlY Also yes theory: flys to dubai and  promotes a project that is really reaaally not environment friendly
a nice bottle of alchohol woulda been the cherry on top that's all the man was ever missing
With the raising sea waters due to climate change..they will be under after 30/30 years
bro have you ever been to the Maldives.
These islands look so bad haha what a stupid idea
I've ALWAYS wondered about these. You should have done the palm too!
Imagine casually talking to a billionaire
The damage these islands have done to the sea is insane
What airline did you use?
The engineer is a Malayalee 💜✨
Yo I live in dubai
Trying to visit Dubai one day 🤙🏻
There’s people fucking starving in the Arab country’s and this is was they wanna fucking invest in
They HAVE to be making a video with the Burj Khalifa and Burj Al Arab. You can not visit Dubai and not see these places.
Is the water hot Bc of the circulation difference Bc of the rocks?
all of you go back to tuvalu
Him:seek discomfort Also him:
i like the music choices in this vid
I've lived in Dubai for 18 years and this is the first time I've heard about the world islands in like a decade lmao
Name of the young emirati?
lmao why does the chairman sound like john hammond from jurassic park?
Fun Fact: UAE still has plentiful slavery.
Sana all
Sana ol
There are so many YouTubers who have totally different personalities off camera but you can tell this guy is just extremely nice in general.
Still wanna know the future of the islands though
For Thomas if there is a pool it's liveable!
well those environment friendly t-shirts are noting but a marketing gimmick but its a nice try though
Amazing video
The view of the city from distance is also cool
Chef: What do we feed the American? Sous Chef: A burger and a pizza? Chef: Better give him 2 in case
Wow, that’s very cool
That chairman is incomprehensibly wealthy
Amazing drone footage
Yes theory you need to buy a hand gun for protection on your next adventure you never know what can happen
Duddeee you out here living the life! On your own island!!! 😁
D party venue??? HAHAHA  Your sponsors are angry party promoters are making more profit than investors of the project!!!  LMFAO
Imagine being on that dope island and you can't  drink or smoke SMH
Mother Earth is unpredictable with all the human activities and climate change. One Tsunami would Wipe out all the islands
this video is amazing I love what Dubai is doing to create a sustainable society to reduce pollution
Dude I randomly learned about the world islands last year and since then I did a school project on them, it was cool to see this video😂
Of course they showed him it, it’s gonna bring them massive revenue
natacha oceane is in dubai ! my two favorite youtubers in the dubai at the same time ?? what is happening
'Hey guys have you heard of climate change and rising sea levels' ? 'Oh yeah i forgot about that '    STOP BUILDING . SELL EVERYTHING !
Oh my f*ck, that is extraordinarily gorgeous
Jesus Christ is king
Wow, billions of dollars poured into these “ideal man made island”. But, not much could be put to helping the sinking Salomon Island off Australia, where people have lived for thousands of years, where they have the kindness of people are living.  I see where we have our priorities.
Wait, what about hurricanes? Or floods? ....or storms?...
How cool would it be if he made the water around it a sanctuary for hurt wildlife like turtles fish and what ever else they have in the ocean around them they should also build up coral and a lot of ppl would snorkel and bring in more business and grow what he’s doing it seems like an amazing retreat escape from the city life and also not hurting the environment around it I think it’s actually quite beautiful what that man has built for himself  if he keeps going and finding away that place will blossom into an amazing wonderland
It's like the hundred island's in the Philippines
How does one get rid of waste septic and trash.. I guess just shit and piss on the ocean.. It would definitely get real with all those islands so close
These people have more connections than some celebs and politicians
Thomas needs a girl to go wit him😭
Ummm .. MEH !
SUPER Like 😁👍Welcome to Dubai.. Let me know if you want to meet in Dubai.. We are youtubers. Same community. Same passion. - Tahera. #MashoorMedia
Can sharks swim there
In the Philippines, we have dolomite. But it's gone now
Please watch jack omerus 😔
This video easily made my day brother, thank you
A future trillionaire will like this comment!!!
really drifting from the content that made you
uhhhhhhh they forgot to put New Zealand on the map :(
As always another awesome video. Such a beautiful place what would make it more beautiful would be people enjoying their self.
Dubai treats life like it’s Minecraft
"Bring the American some burgers and pizza, they love that shit"
https://youtu.be/-_Z6RQtqseU
This guy reminds me of Prison break for some reason... a specific character...
Dude, you are just an awesome human
Can we just agree that yes theory, is 145% the best channel ?
"Seeks discomfort" t-shirt while laying in a bed in a villa on the most luxurious islands in the world lol
Great job guys ❤️🔥 #seek_discomfort
Could make a good concert spot even a beach day, a day rental
What a load of shit google wont allow anyone to post the violent truth about this country
wow amazing!!! try to visit the philippines  ❤️❤️❤️ new subscriber here
Imagine you were an alien and you landed there. Wtf
More like seek comfort
Hmm

PLEASE come to Iceland 🇮🇸
AIrsoft Gameplay here WHEN!??
They are bad for the environment
cannot wait for my rose hoodie to arrive.
Dubai 💜❤️❤️❤️
A salad, a pizza, and two burgers... where was the mukbang?
I would kill to live that kind of life
Hey just subbed! Live in Wisconsin and traveling to small and unknown locations to explore and learn has always been a dream of mine! Really love watching you guys do it...keep up the killer work
Nobody: Everyone that isnt omg this chairman is really smart and cool. Its amazing how smart and innovative Dubai is. Dutch People: your welcome
This looks so perfect. It only would suck to go to work if you live there.
This is how you do a 17 min real estate ad.kudos🤑🤑
15:10 looks like there`s a skeleton looking over my man lol
Am I the only one who got the seek discomfort ad by youtube?
Because 1. they ran out of corruption money and 2. They found out the stagnant water wasn’t nice to live around
it looks as if you cant get enough of seeing your own face on screen
Such a cool video, I hope to stay there one day
I honestly forgot about these islands in Dubai 😅
yes... all of this just screams DISCOMFORT
You guys should revisit these urbex and climbing videos. Shiey has seriously grown since you saw his video! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1KqO_koJX0&list=PL3EUtBTFLB4X8lbOurNYd-wMn_5fc8ct9&index=4&t=3s
Lmao that one dude “you are the king”
https://youtu.be/8kz8S6ia1rk This young man would love to join your team... I would love to see him...
How can people dislike this?
10/10
Ayyy man are u still in dubai
This video is truly amazing
I have the place for you. Atomic CIty, Idaho. First town powered by nuclear power. there's a bar, a Texaco station, a racetrack, post office and a few houses. People still live there, it's very small but they hold racing in the summer. in 1960 there was an explosion that drove most people away and now it's falling apart.
Because when they ask the consultants on what they can do with their billions,  the answer was built schools and educational infra so their people can grow and create something, but they decided to spend on collecting sand and building islands for..... there you go
12:40 Guess he never heard of the netherlands huh xd. Reclaiming islands and land is all we do
be careful i hear theres some laggy players at the airports.  i wonder how many people are gonna get the joke.
visit Dominican Republic
How did he get his hair like that from it being short and straight???
LET JACK OREMOS JOIN
I’ve allows wondered what the World islands were when I saw them on Snapchat
What happens when the islands could be swallowed by the ocean.
WOW SELLOUTS
Packaging is not biodegradable, but atleast recycled :)
Is that merch itchy? Because I *Seek Discomfort*
Isn't it a tad ironic to say you're environmentally conscious then take a bunch of plane rides which are notoriously bad for the environment? :shrug: Also... I've heard the islands themselves are potentially very bad for the local environment. Also.... why no mask?
Uh its called the Lebanon island? I’m from lebanon, the country not the island😂
There's a strong reason  they chose a chairman like him, mad respect sir
My man really sought COMFORT
K
Is it just me or did we all get seek discomfort ads from YouTube. If its only me then what a coincidence!
I’ve wanted the pink seek discomfort hoodie since the first time it dropped but I just can’t afford it😪😂 one day i’ll be able to buy it
Dubai literally stones and lashes people for being gay, but they get a pass from all these YouTubers because they have money.  YouTubers: stop going to Dubai and promoting it as this luxury wonderland, you're knowingly turning a blind eye to sexist rapist murderers for views.
I miss the old Yes Theory Like if you agree Comment if you disagree
Am I the only one who saw the Seek Discomfort lineup campaign as the ad before the video? 😅👍🏼
I have been a follower of Yes Theory for years now and I love the intention behind the content they create, but I feel like there should be an acknowledgement of the smothering of local habitats that occur by developments like this. It makes me sad to see the promotion of money driven developments that are actively destroying our beautiful planet. I'm sure the intention was not malicious, but I wanted to bring this to light.
Your channel is very underrated
Lexie would LOVE This! :-D
Yo if you want you could take a one hour road trip to Abu Dhabi from Dubai but if you stay in Dubai for like a few months I might email you and invite you to my apartment and the apartment is attached to a mall so yea it’s crazy you would have to come to see everything so yea it’s a cool place in Abu Dhabi very close so yea you would for sure like it it’s called sky tower
Chairman is very humble....simple man with extraordinary thinking...
can someone here confirm if this is Matt in this video? https://youtu.be/JtH68PJIQLE?list=PLt6UmZesGWZ37Lqe-8R-nJvjALbCAhlrZ&t=102
I’d love to be there one day
I’ve seen that place on the snap map
take your hat off in someone's house.
Jesus loves you spread the word
They should make their Seek Discomfort merch super itchy and...uncomfortable
I would love to just sit down with the Chairman and talk with him. He seems like a genuine guy looking to solve world issues, while also living a great lifestyle. Mad respect for a man I didn't know existed until now. Great Video!
So fireeee
When you have too much money and decide to build islands
They spent Mooney Doing something completely useless and fucked up the future ecosystem.
Ohh i wish i could teleport there💙
PLS CHECK JACK OREMUS! he made a video about u guys!  greetings from Austria btw 🤚🏼
14:08 in the words of Babatunde, "Ganngg Sheeeet" XD
That moment I heard Future of Forestry play at 15:49 :D :D :D
98% random BS, 2% actual footage of the islands. Where was the exploration?
I wish to buy products from you guys, but is way to overprice at least for me, brazilian, it's like americans paying $240 for just a t-shirt, it's crazy
Bro y’all already know where imma go and take a vacation at. (Once it’s done ofc)
They started seeking comfort 😭
You should come to Qatar
It’s crazy how far y’all made It I remember when y’all only had 100k and now you have 5 million crazy
2:38 lol what Holiday
the Old guy is Amazing
Tell us how were the burgers Thomas!   + the merch so dope I can't decide how much of it I can afford
Shocked how the US can’t do the things they do so easily, this video made my day 😊
This seems like its pretty awful for the environment
OKAY AM I THE ONLY ONE OR DO Y'ALL HERE LIKE THE ONE DIRECTION YOU AND I TUNE @ 15.49 (PROBABLY BCZ I'VE BEEN LISTENING A LOT OF 1D FROM THE PAST 7 YRS😂)
That Sea-Airport was interesting. Anybody know the name of it?
It's all fun and games until Britain finds out
Hi Yes Theory. I was wondering if you guys have kids sizes for your hoodies and sweat shirts   Please like so he can see this 👍🏻
Me, a Dutchman seeing this: *pathetic*
Dubai was LIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIITTTT
I wonder what will it look like after 10 years :) must go to dubai :)
future millionaires will like this post.
@herb
I just saw a tiktok about this island, what are the odds. I loved this so much
Im not gonna waste my time im say they are waiting to be sold or people bought them and haven't did anything yut
Burning garbage is not environmentally efficient...
Where's your mask Thomas?
U should let jack  oremus  be in ur team he is a good person
This video taught me if you go to Arab countries befriends some of the most high class people their
I am from a country named Lebanon 😂 that island is for us
i find it kind of offensive to the chairman that you have to give him subtitles , his english was perfect
Dubai is on another level
don't show this to the Brits
Omegakek
In fifteen yrs all of these silamda will be underwater
My favourite channel on YouTube
Complete nonsense of a project  - these islands will sink as sea levels rise
Wait wait was the transporter 3 movie beach scene filmed here? 🤔
Far Cry 7: The World Islands
this video is gonna blow
Love these exploring videos. Currently working two jobs on top of college and training for my future Military career. But saving up so one day I can go on adventures like this 😂
All it needs is a beautiful obelisk with markings showing the expected sea-level rise over the next century.
Sikh discomfort
Risking the lives of the locals by not wearing a mask is a no for me
The yes theory team is probably one of the most down to earth groups on this planet
Wait they were in Dubai I- no wait comeback I didn’t get to meet you 😭😭
The creator or whoever he was talking to is DRIPPY
HIRE JACK OREMUSSSS!!!!!  WACTH HJS VIDD
where's his mask? :/
The only thing discomforting about this video is the fact he isn’t wearing a mask throughout most of this  Edit: wow people actually argued about this? It’s simple to just wear a damn mask.
Him: “seek discomfort” Me: (puts pillow in an uncomfortable position)
my anxiety rocketed when that dude used his airpods in high speed boat
You fly business class to Dubai to go visit an island made for human pleasure? How is that seeking discomfort lmao? You are just flying for no reason contributing to more CO2 output.
You are talking about environmental impact of t-shirts and clothes at the beginning however go to a country which has no respect for nature and natural habitats by building artificial islands for billionaires to shelter from others while wasting natural resources and destroying the ecosystem. 👏  why do so many YouTubers portrait Dubai as the Paradise it isn't for most of the people including workers and service providers living borderline dignified lives in this country with no regard for Human Rights *apart for Millionaires/Billionaires.   Did not expect you guys to be so contradicting in your beliefs and statements.
It's nice to see you only show the money part not the truth of the slavery that build it.
talking bout environment and shit and then going to made man islands lol... you know where the sand comes from?
talking about saving the environment while travelling to artificial islands in dubai🤦 that's pointless
the funny thing is, all that sand and it looks rough as hell, w rocks and all
The creation of those islands is a disaster, it's a huge waste of sand which is actually running short. Those islands are useless and have emptied lots of beaches in order to be made A bit disappointed to see yes theory advertising them
curly hair Thomas>>>>>>>>
these iselands are amazing, but if the sea levels rise in some decades, they´ll be gone
i swear soooo innovative but the owners are all soo stupid
waited my whole life for this
No way you’re at the same hotel I was 🤣
Wasn't Thomas with drew binsky just now?
I left uae to move to bahrain😭😭 and now u visit
The project that destroyed the world 🌎
this is probably the most extravagant and useless project in the world. typical Dubai shit.. maybe they should focus on actually doing something good for the country and its people and not just rich billionaires who can afford a stay there. ;)
celebrating eco friendliness by taking a flight to dubai to slave made islands... yea i see
Wish I have the same privilege... #YtPipo
NO WAY THEY CAM TO DUBAI AND I DIDNT KNOW
By all the nice environmental decisions that were made by the people developing this, I think there ist one thing we all should remember and I would've honestly thought you'd bring that up, especially after your new clothing announcement.  All the sand for these islands is the most horrible thing you could do to harm our environment. Just google a few minutes and you'll find plenty of articles and studies that show you the negative parts of this which I think is way heavier than the positive effect of a nice chill area for rich people and tourists in Dubai. They are scratching the sand out of the seafloor or ship it from china to build these islands and that is destroying so much! Please respect that when dreaming of those islands, thank you!
That’s sooo cool😳
I liked you guys better when you did acts that involved less money and came more from the heart
An ad for the drop came on while I was watching this video
omg their own videos have their own ads
We're so caught up in social media and our own shit, we don't see that there's a whole world out there waiting to be discovered!
You know it will go viral once YouTube commented it lol
Yes theory nothing's impossible
It makes me happy that there are people who seek and achieve answers to issues that should have been solved a long time ago, such as trash and desalination. As a young child "they" said its too expensive to desalinate water but to me its worth it vs making a pipeline from Alaska to LA. I mean really? What's more expensive in the long run?
Do you have the Yes Theory merch in extra-long for us tall people?  Great vid, Peace! ✌🏽
Hahahahah dolomite
E
My concern was that most of the people I see on this video were not wearing a mask 😬🤷🏻‍♀️
i literally looked at that grey shirt and without even knowing you were about to premote it i thought “damn, that looks fire”
I've been living in UAE for 17 years and haven't known about this, crazy
I wouldn’t dare to lean or move on that helicopter thing
Eerie!! Sneak peek into the future of faded oil wealth.
Just seeing you happy is amazing. Always be happy even if a little thing breaks your mood just don’t let it get in your head.
Crazy you went, was just reading an article a couple days ago. Dubai is full of ambitious risk takers, I’d just like to see them do right by people and the Earth. I do think everyone should look up things they heard in this video to learn the environmental impacts themselves. Yes Theory could also come back with a video showcasing what they found. This video still shouts seek discomfort as Thomas had to reach out to a billionaire and interviewed him. Some of you reading never even picked up the phone to cold call anyone in your life. As far as the eco friendly journey, it’s a journey. It’ll never be perfect. Starting with the clothing line is nice but I challenge everyone to see how the fashion industry is hurting us. I also hope the manufacturers you use treat their workers correct. Hoping you carbon offset the flights and that your journey home to family in Sweden was smooth. If y’all at Yes Theory need help with this Eco journey, we gotcha at socially Immersed. We will make sure you are making changes monthly and integrating educational content to your social media strategies.
අර ලංකාවෙ කට්ටියක්ද හිටියෙ :|
>we're going to  be more environmental friendly  >flying to dubai for a few days
I definitely think you should watch the documentary “Sand Wars” and how detrimental this whole project was to indigenous islands.
Wearing seek discomfort merch in a villa  🙄
:Where do you live? :America :Which City? :Dubai :) (Stolen and constructed comment)
Such an inconvenience tho going from island to island.
I got a seek discomfort ad on this video, was by design or just chance ?
Imagine swimming to your friends house
Arabic people are very inviting and welcoming.❤
Oh theres a pool
This was so good video!!
Holy
i got your ad on your vid lol
Well they're gonna be fucked with climate change and ocean level rising...
I m colecting mony for my fathers home can you help me
I grew up in Australia on an island for 9 years and when I was 4 I thought it was normal to go to school on a boat
I don’t know why.. but why watching this video felt like building a new world in Minecraft?
Dubai is built upon slaves. All the infrastructure you see, slave labour. Disgusting.
Anyone know the map on sc that has every states ppl talked about?
You're going green by flying first class?
did you say inaujural
12:32 The Dutch who build an entire province in the water: am I a joke to you?
Wow! So nice to see someone explore the islands up close! Nice surprise, to see they are building again!
He's nothing compared to Tom Nook🤣😅
Wow. For a company being or trying to be environmentally friendly, thus video wasn’t the right place to say that or state it. Such a throw away statement. Plus selling merch and having one person fly from USA to Dubai in this pandemic. Wow the white silence is outstanding
At 15:10, it looks like Thomas is getting laid by a female cyborg. HAHAHAH
The truss work on the Bamboo Villa is 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
Amazing😍😍
I respect that you guys care about the environment but isn't it a bit contradictory to be flying from the US to Dubai and taking a helicopter in the same video?
Worlds island.. hope to visit the philippine island there
Whats the creators name that you talked to? He is so interested in solving todays big problems and is actually succeeding doing it. Would love to follow his work, he seemed like the arab Elon Musk. Please drop his name or socials
I saw this being a wierdo on snap maps like 4 years ago and was so confused, this is crazy
So they can do a green new deal yet those that want to do a green new Deal are not interested in an actual green new deal.
Incredible video! So glad I discovered your channel!
How are these guys able to go and visit these places
LOVE THIS EPISODE. 💛
Whole country fucking stinks! That's why.
One of my uncles bought an island in 2008 for 20 million and now he’s 20 million in debt because of the financial crisis
I love you guys, but forreal some really corny-cringe in those one lol.
How amazing and fun
go course u would meet that fan working at the airport 😂
I saw this on the Google Earth
This is awesome!
So during a pandemic you travel to Dubai to make a video....that’s why covid ain’t gone yet
"Seek discomfort" This dude:*Proceeds to live for a night in an island with villas while living a life of luxury and comfort and no care in the world*  Me: ....Uhhhmm how is this discomfort?
I’ve been there, lmao. It’s called the world and they have all these small islands, it’s very cool
N i c e  v i d
dubai is like the picture of when you gave a lot people billions of dollars
dubai is in creative mode
Dubai is like a bunch of people in creative mode
I live in Dubai and I never knew this was a thing
The villas didn't look very nice but I guess it's coz of limited  access to material. I think some of these questions should have been asked before building the islands. However it's  an impressive engineering feat
So refreshing seeing more Yes Theory content. Really is the best channel on YouTube
If your reading this you have potential to do great things. Yes. YOU.
Probably empty because they don't have any where to put your cell charger.
Normally, I love Yes Theory content, but the failure to recognize the devastating ecological impact this has been is quite disappointing.
Why was he the only one without masks
Dubai looks very polluted, or is it just me?
Is this an Ad or a video? I can’t tell.
Listening and hearing things from the Chairman who manage and help built the Island is so amazing, all I can say all the time is Wow
I went to dubai around 2016 and this project was supposed to be completed in 2020 i always wondered what happened to it. thank you
Imagine what $13 Billion of solar farms could do. Should of given the money to me.
I got a yes theory ad while watching yes theory, Nice
Watch jack Oremus he seems like a great person to join yes theory
To think Jeff Bezos can buy all the islands and still be the richest man in the world
At 12:26 I think he might be mentioning Palm Deira, which is another land reclamation property (also changed due to 2008 crash.)
Why does him not wearing a mask make me so uncomfortable
https://youtu.be/8kz8S6ia1rk      This man wants to join the yes team and I really think you should let him join
great video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyW0gURLNRI  sri lanka
are there any sea life still alive there?  it seems they  damaged and altered the ecological landscape there forever
next trip can you please keep ur mask on when around others? :(
Just for that 12:56 view i would rent this place
I have a couple of questions.  1) How are they dealing with bio waste (I mean not food, but specifically poop and pee) on those islands without a sewage system and without it being transported away? Those islands are made out of sand, so I doubt you would just bury it on the islands. The "system" / bio factory he mentioned that converts food waste to methane gas doesn't work for poop and pee, does it.  2) Internet/tele comunication services. Those islands are in the middle of nowhere. How do they get Highspeed Internet over there? It surely is not Satellite. That would be way too expensive and inefficient. They must have lain a line underwater from mainland Dubai I assume? I would assume the same thing for electricity - a line being lain from mainland Dubai, but for electricity it's probably less of a problem, since they most definitely have solar power on those islands, and it will be enough to power the few people that will be living there. But for Internet it's different. I don't see how else you would get Highspeed Internet on those islands other than from having a cable lain from the mainland. I'm really curious about this in particular. Nobody who's planning to go to those islands, either to live or to rent, would want to be isolated without access to the Internet.   3) The chairman mentioned "desalination of sea water" (we desalinate, he said) as the way they are getting drinking water on those islands. I read up on that technology a bit to know it's advantages and disadvantages, and I wish the chairman would have elaborated more on the technology they use there. Are they using the thermal method - solar power to heat up and collect water vapor from sea water -  or are they using the membrane method - push sea water through a series of filters to pull out salt, other contaminants, and small sea life - or are the using both? What filters are they using? How modern/advanced? How big is the ecological footprint? How recent is the technology they are using there? In both of those desalination methods "brine" (that things that are filtered / remains) are all pumped back into the sea after all. It's a useful technology for sure, I just wish the chairman would have elaborated on how advanced the system is that they in particular are using. Is it advanced? Did they have a breakthrough in the filter system possibly? Are they using both systems? Or perhaps...are they still using the same desalination technology from the 1980s...?  Those were the things that came to my mind when I watched this video. A hypothetical situation, if I were to live on those islands longterm: Highspeed Internet? Freshwater? Sewage?
Honestly, nobody cares.
I want someone to love me as much as Thomas loves pools lol
Imagine if a tsunami came out of nowhere. I dont mean to jinx it, it is 2020 afterall
What is his accent? I can barely hear it but slightly
👍https://youtu.be/RUUiFVwnrjs
I got you merch ad from youtube before your video starts
*Funny how this all is done by dutch companies like we use to do here in the netherlands*
9:35 from IKEA XD
Hey yes theory wassup there is this guy who wants to work with you and be a part of ur team   He made a vid bout it check it out  https://youtu.be/8kz8S6ia1rk
Ironically those islands "Seek discomfort" with UAE the impossible is possible!!!
I got the seekdiscomfort add in this video 🙌🏻🙌🏻
launching environmental mindful merch and promoting an environmental doubtful project in one video
Guys the construction of Dubai isnt a tax evasion.
ironic how people living in the hilly regions try to build houses inspired by the city and the ones living in the city build their houses inspired by the forest 😎
Video yourself flying to dubai. Then sell a eco friendly product. Bit of a  contradiction
What drone do they use?
I worry about the environmental affect, yes it’s nice but the environmental impact it may have needs taken into account
wow that developer seems like an awsome guy
You have a private chef in Dubai to make your dinner. I imagine a multitude of exotic foods and what does he do? Pizza and hamburger. That's Disappointing!
Man made piles of sand, no hate but this has got to be the most boring content ive seen you put out. Considering the bangers you usually make.
Its been 10yrs? bruh.
Thats show us how we could deal with recycling, we have the resources, what we need is political willness. He want to recicle, he has the resource and he had done
*global warming btw*
yall r environmentally friendly but these ppl r putting their toilets in the water why u think they have pool
Just watched a video on Beirut and how the explosion has added $15 Bil to their world debt... Such a shame there is so much divide of wealth in this world
Just WOW.  I wouldn’t mind having an island to myself!
sucks u went all that way and didnt ask how there plumbing works lol
Island Cheff: Ohh American guy!  🍔🍔🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕  Island cheff: WHAT IF HE IS VEGAN OR SOME SHIT!!??  🥗
If you're so rich you can build a valley without someone there.
i got the seek discomfort holiday drop as a add perfect timing.
i saw thier own ad on this video ..shocked !!!
“More environmentally conscious channel” and the guy takes a 16 hours flight from DC to Dubai. #greenwashing
I laughed so hard when I saw these on the map for the first time
Maaaan how much I miss Dubai🥺😫
None of their recent videos have to do with seeking discomfort. I miss when they would do fun stuff with strangers
Starving kids in Africa could have eaten those islands.
this was dope, thanks for sharing
Day 1 off trying to get famus
He went to iraq with drew Binsky
Am I the only one who got a yes theory ad in this video???😂
i saw a seek discomfort ad before this vid lol
wow at first I thought that creating man made islands would be a bad idea environmentally, but after hearing what the chairman was saying, i am impressed at how environmentally conscious they are
no, I'm not investing in this. whit the sea level keeps raising up, no no
I fully expected the owner to have some thick accent then I heard him and ZERO accent
I remember reading about this project in 1996
I think the chairman is also the chairman of virgin hyperloop?
You look like off brand Ryan gosling
they asked for a paid review, you guys suggested a normal review. Hope you got a better deal than blondie. eco friendly? cut the cr8p!
Guys, I love your videos. But I do not get how you can fly to dubai and talk about how important it is to pay attention to your own impact on the environment two cuts later...  Kinda hypocritical
Kind of odd to launch your environmental friendly line in the same video you visit a disastrously environmental project...
Is there no Covid in Dubai?
Good video but i dont know why theres a robot looming over him 15:10
When all the islands are built out I feel like it’s gonna be like a big amusement park or a big Las Vegas
what i wanna know is if you went to dubai by yourself... who is filming you haha?!
I can assumed theres is not a Single 1 Rat or Cockroach on that Island. LoL
The real sultan
My parents are in dubie right now
The dude dressed in the traditional uae clothing had perfect American English.
That pink t-shirt slaps though
Thx to come to my country If i wouldve known u were cming i wouldve invited you to my car collection and test drive the rarest cars
So... why are the islands empty?
At this point I dont feel like you guys are going out of ur comfort zones anymore, instead just living the best life, too comfortable
I like ur hair Thomas 😍😍
I can never get over how much your hair looks cool
Check out Jack Oremus, his video about how he desires to work with you is so genuine you need to check this man out.
Did you see tion over there?
i can’t believe i started following you guys when you guys only had 500,000 subs and here you guys are. i am so proud :)
When are you posting that video in kurdistan
but papyrus... why?
YOW IF COVID IS ELIMINATED PLS PLS PLS PLS MAKE A YES TABLE POP UP IT WAS SO FUN TO WATCH!!!
Stranded deep be like
7:20 nice bellyflop
all at the cost of slave labor
Mr. Beast did it first xD
wow these islands are cool
That gyrocopter looks like the most unsafely crafted vehicle since the wright brothers
Just... wOw 😳
It's empty because the water have to soak the soil minimum 20 years in order to build a strong wall to build a strong building
This is what I call "Marketing doing right"! A lot to learn from Dubai!
12:34 , my Dutch heart has to correct the gentleman. Flevoland, a province in the Netherlands was completely retrieved from the water. So yes, people HAVE tried it :)
they should only drive with golf carts or not drive and make bridges from wood from 1 island to another
So what I learned is that sunbathing together with a despot while the rest of the world is being locked down still gives you thousands of likes. Our new future.
Just saw a video yesterday to why those islands ar empty, maybe we have the same videos recommended lol
Remember that a golden cage is still a cage.
Isn't rising sea level going to submerge it?
I got Seek Discomfort ad prior to this video ❤️👍🏼
Just imagine when every island has hundreds of villas. A man-made wonder of the world
What is this hippie shit
https://youtu.be/8kz8S6ia1rk
https://youtu.be/8kz8S6ia1rk
https://youtu.be/8kz8S6ia1rk
I'm surprised how much they thought about the sustainable aspect of the islands. Waste management, desalinating water etc. That's really impressive!
What was the air temperature there?
I'm wondering, how did they build the island? Is it by huge amount of sands? And how and what is the function of the line of rocks? 🤔
Lol literally got recommended on a documentary about this yesterday and they weren't that nice or positive about their view on these islands.
What’s that song at 6:57?
Scar joined the chat.
Wow very cool I had no idea they were building on those islands a buddy of mine he's Canadian is wifee is from Beirut in Lebanon he was telling me all about Dubai and the surrounding area very cool I had no idea a lot of the stuff he told me thanks for the video very eye-opening and very enjoyable to watch stay safe guys
Im going to be there in 2 years. Staying and having fun with my family.
Is anybody else wondering why he was not wearing a mask for the majority of the video during covid ? 🤔
This is totally great! So happy for Thomas!   But... at some point I started to think that a woman could never be in the position that Thomas is in this video. Meaning, a woman in the society that we live in, could never feel safe if a group of men invited her to stay a night in an island alone.  I personally have this dream of traveling all around the glove and have this kind of adventures, but being a woman is (sadly) definitely an obstacle nowadays.
It's ironic that we got that lecture about being environmentally conscious in a video where someone flys halfway around the world in a gas spewing airline jet to visit a tourist attraction built from oil money.
The chairman looks like your casual Arabic uncle lmao.
Za Warudo!                    Why has no one said this yet? Or maybe I just missed it.
Great video, the world had no idea construction was already happening.  My concern is that sea barrier, so tiny and shallow I'm not sure it could withstand a tsunami or even a strong sea storm. And they happen.  I think the chairman could have been interviewed a little longer.
Good but too many adverts
Alone on an island. This is the dream life of an introvert 😱
maaaan yall are living it up! i hope you guys can shed some light on my tiny channel which i just started https://youtu.be/BfByMYgI084  always stay safe guys!
You dont want to even mention the environmental cost building these islands in a video where you launch your new considerate clothing range?
Let's take a moment for the chairman - clearly an incredibly wealthy man, putting his main focus on sustainability. If more people in power had his dedication to the world and it's safekeeping, we'd all be in a much better place. ❤️
LEBANON REPRESTENTING!
Dani 13:55
everyone talking about how nice it is and the views and im just here thinking bruh how rich is that chairman to create all this LOL
Hello from Nepal. Just got your channel and subscribed. Nice video 🙏🏼
Never thought I would dislike a Yes Theory video, but saying you are going more environmentally friendly and then flying to Dubai and it's massive destruction of nature (In the same _episode)_  is just emberassing.  That's probably the most discomfort I've ever felt with a Yes Theory video...
Everybody: quarantined Thomas: well...
Seek Discomfort brings whole new meaning when it comes to the slaves that built it all
More more more
We have 389M Php Dolomite island too here in the Philippines, unfortunately it looks like shit.
I have been to one of the island (Lebanon island). its a great experience.
I lived in Dubai for 10 years now and I didn’t know there are islands
7:21 that must of hurt 🤣
Bro you are just living the dream 😆
One of the coolest videos Ive haver saw
I'm waiting for the day Yes Theory goes to space
What an obscene collection of sand dunes with flashy houses, built for the elite and superficial 'stars' of thsi sad world.
go to lebanonn
Just got a seek discomfort ad before the vid lol
If the New Yes House will be on one of the islands it would be insane
I hope I have a "right place, right time" scenario like this one day
wait what.. I got seek discomfort ads - holiday drop 1, seek connection
Am I the Only one who got an ad of their merch in their video
We also have that in the Philippines. We called it dolomite
Forget Fyre festival... Netflix needs to publish a doc about these! Maybe get Yes Theory to make it!
Ayyy live in Dubai lol
The irony of seeking discomfort..
please wear your mask more!!!  things are getting very scary out there now.. NOVEMBER 2020 where was your Beer with your Chef made supper lol.. beautiful eh.. very nice.. I guess the sand wasn't hot to walk on? you certainly didnt do the ouch ouch ouch run.. lol reminded me of Cuba, white white cool sand.. beautiful blue topaz water...
No way while watching the video I got an ad from seekdiscomfort
Well im from lebanon
This is like the yes theory of old!
WAIT! YOU WERE HERE?!
I love how he forgot about the netherlands the first country who reclaimed land and the dutch companies who were  in charge of the first man made islands in dubai
I live in Dubai, and I'm a huge fan. Would love to show you around the city if you'd be up for that! Just let me know if you're still here :)
I got seek discomfort ad before this video😂
Good vid, but spare the sanctimonious environmental concern---you can spare the environment by not creating your merch line to begin with, etc.....fake!
I love your videos, but this just felt weird  and off having heard you announce regarding your changes in your manufacturing of merchandise and watching a video on man-made islands. I'm not quite sure if it's sincere :/
I spontaneously broke down in tears listening to the Chairman speak about the islands and their sustainability...the pure light and knowledge pouring out of him is astounding. An incredible example of the potential for our future when we seek to live in harmony with our planet and eachother...thank you for sharing this experience with the world 🙏💖
keep up the work guys! and man ur lucky to meet the creator of the place aswell!
when will u make a video on iraq
Dubai is truly a place of abundant ambitions, magnificent minds, inspiration & infinite possibilities. You’ll find plenty surprises in this city and will meet people who are doing things you never knew were possible. We are so proud to live in the UAE. This place has given us so much opportunity and the energy here keeps us constantly inspired to reach higher and push our own boundaries✌️❤️
So clean 🫂
You did good By interviewing the chairman. Seems like a humble man even though he has been so successful in the past. Wish them all the success! This was honest man
Any seek discomfort coupon codes?
i wish i could go to dubai lol
Where did they get the sand from ?
Holy I wanna move there one day
I've seen these islands in pictures and videos all the time. This was a great way to learn and see more about them that I probably would've never have discovered without this video!
@ 5:05 those volleyball players were so sunburnt like us coming out of lockdown after 18 months of zero sunlight
Great video & next video go to Epstein Island.
Hey there, can anyone here from canada help me how to move or immigran to there?
I love your theory about the 'greening' of your  products and brand, but perhaps more of your creative energies should be focused on how to make interesting and valued content WITHOUT having to fly around the world in an unsustainable way....I think you're missing the point
How does Thomas always gets the best trips ?
Just wait till one good storm comes through...those unsecured sand piles will be reclaimed by the sea.
So this is a reference to jojo :'Za world '😅
This is what the fyre festival wanted to be
YAY! You're in my hometown!!!
I GOT A SEEK DISCOMFORT AD ON THIS VIDEO
Hello Thomas and crew I love your videos so much keep doing videos and don’t give up keep up the work
Meanwhile, the rest of the world is running out of sand.
This discomfort seems actually quite... comfortable
Sus
3:13 It seems who ever designed this has never looked at a map from roughly India -> East. Thailand, Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, Korea, China... None of them look right. (Japan is almost right.) I notice it's also typically Eurocentric as well. Since when is Greenland bigger than Africa, South America or Australia?
Funny I just watched a short documentary about this.
So happy about your business changes!
That was unreaĺ.
This is amazing dude. Thanks for making incredible videos
Yes theory- I have a place you guys have never been (and literally my dream to go to): Pitcairn Islands.    Incredible history and only 50 people who live there- the least inhabitant place in the world.
https://youtu.be/8kz8S6ia1rk
As soon as you got on that helicopter, I clicked Like!
This looks like a hallmark movie
I would like to live there! I hope next they can find a way to recycle plastic waste too.,
This is like something I would make in minecraft
Methane gas is a green house gas
Help! Those anyone know the brand of the backpack that Thomas is using?!
The, "Remember when you were a kid and dreamed about staying on a private island" line is so relatable. Can not wait to experience something like this soon! Awesome video guys!
👍🇵🇭
Moral of the story Chairman is really rich!
Every time I watch your videos I feel like I'm watching a movie
I got a seekdiscomfort ad on this video
I hope Mr.Beast have this same vlog.
I love you guys so much and you make my life just that much better! Never stop doing what you do!
anybody knows that song name at 7.00
I do love Yes Theory, but when you say environment friendly... and you taking planes and stuff some more in business class...  more support to killing environment with flight.. GG double moral in this one...
Very smarty guy on the methane! He uses the methane from the biofuel made from the biomass! Very smart guy!
Wow this is stunning, MY GOD!
Felt like im in that island❤️
Who else got a seek discomfort ad while watching this vid?
i cant afford the merch ATM but i can definitely watch the ADs all the way through to make sure you guys make enough revenue to keep the content coming.  I know you want us to seek discomfort.. but it would be of great discomfort if yall disappeared... i dont see how that would help me grow.
13:10 "Even the garbage, we convert it to gas"  They're burning the garbage lmao
"Lebanon island" the closest yes theory will ever get to visiting lebanon lol
Thanks for sharing this incredible trip ... they are finally finding great ways to reuse waste and minimize our carbon footprint.. from VANCOUVER BRITISH COLUMBIA.. much love and support to all of you MAKING THE DIFFERENCE 😆
Dubai, the capital of the world.
😍😍😍
Incredible video. I’m convinced Yes theory makes some of the best content on YouTube
Another episode of things that I can't do or buy.
Imma be honest witchu chief why Thomas looking like Chad Kroeger?
A perfect example of when your making fuck tonnes of money while losing a fuck tonne more brains
This is really awesome 😍🙌 I hope one day I will travel as much as you do even just in my own country and record with my own camera... but need to have work and earn.... Your videos really inspired me seek discomfort..  Love you YES Theory ,😚🧡❤️❤️❤️🤎💜💛💙
Is it just me or does this sound like the plot to 3rd gen pokemon games when team magma tryna resurrect Groudon and have him create more land????
If the internet is good there, i would actually live there.
Thanks yes theory 🥰 my father lives at abu dhabi, but i can't find him. Im watching from the Philippines ❤️ iliked your videos a lot
am I the only one that got a seek discomfort ad before the video hahaha omg
Did anyone do a thorough and transparent environmental impact assessment of this monstrosity ?
When i get older  i want to build a whole Continent
Island hopping just got a lot better 🏝
Dude sounds waaayy too positive. Anyone else thinks he got paid for this?

Minecraft Creative Plots really be like
How the hell did I get an ad with you guys in it??   What The Fawk
Hey Yes Theory! Have you seen the Jack Oremus video? Check out his channel and video!!
"We want to be more environmentally conscious" - visits an OPEC country with a long history of brutal repression of women and LGBT people - makes a video on a millionaire's playground created by destroying shallow water habitats (desert sand is not suitable for reclamation) and abusing migrant workers with the kafala system  I've never understood why westerners are so tone-deaf when it comes to the UAE, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait, and especially the Maldives.
I missed these videos so much mang. I’m excited
12:30 hold my dutch waffle
Thats so fricken amazing that he's been able to be so conservative on the islands
No favorites...but Thomas is definitely the best at making solo vlog trips...This one and the Tuvalu trip were pretty much perfect
INCREDIBLE!!!!!
I hate Dubai time will show how destructive and naive humans were with their treatment of the earth
8:15 is that veritasium 🤔
How can i get my 17 minutes back ?
An someone bring the chairman to be the next USA president? 🤓
It’s amazing what oil money can do
In Brazil there is a landscape thats is just like it but natural, its called Lençóis Maranhenses. Search it up
Why the corny/sad/feely music and "emotional" vibes all the time. Dramatic I guess
i genuinely believe these videos improve my mental health so thank you :)
Surely this should be marked up as a paid for promotion. It was interesting to see the current state of the world project.
Sorry dude but this was a bit dull
Finally. Been waiting for someone to do this video .. Thank You Yes Theory ❤️❤️❤️
Matt you need a haircut🤣🤣🤣
He's American he needs American food! Cook a pizza and burger for that infidel
Am I the only one that got an advertisement about the seek discomfort merge drop during this video?! (one that wasn't edited in by them)
Let jack oremus join the team
Let jack oremus join the team
Are you in Dubai bro?
Celebrating environmental friendliness by taking a flight to Dubai!
Thanks for that mini documentary.  I was expecting those island to have the typical city style but they did amazing keeping it peaceful / bamboo. I love how they recycle most of their waste.   It will be interesting to see futur developments!
I would drop everything in my life too go live out there, it could be a 6x6 room just that view is so nice
always good content.
Every New one is his favourite haah ;D
The only Ad that i totally enjoy and dont skip is when i see you guys in that awesome Seek-discomfort one
what happens when the sea level keeps rising lmao
That chairman just solved global warming lol
I’m a coastal engineer and a dream is to see this place or work on something like it. Thomas please get in touch! Would love to hear about this journey more
The owner of the World Islands should hold an extreme motorboat racing event like right now to bring attention and tourism to the Islands. Or even an amphibious vehicle race!!
I feel proud now to have an Island in this project with the name of my country "Lebanon"  And the fact that it's the one partying is funny because usually foreigners call us "THE PARTY OF THE MIDDLE EAST"
WOW I LIVE RIGHT WHERE YOU WERE. THANKS MY GUY
The video is so good even Youtube commented so why wouldn't i
JACK OREMUS watch his video yes theory the man looks like he belongs with you guys.
I just got seek discomfort ad on this video?? I fkin love it!!
What you are watching in this video is provided free of cost to Mr. Content Creator
A white man’s ambition lol
I think however that the chairman forgot about the Netherlands. Complete province, and so much reclaimed land. I believe Dutch engineers also helped with developing the palm islands.
Well, this could be a shot in the dark... But regardless I'm going to try anyway. Plus you miss all the shots you never take, am I right?    I'm kinda stepping out of my comfort zone on this one guys. But here goes nothing.   Let Me Explain:   My mother, Lori Nelson, was born in Chicago, Illinois to my Grandmother, Elaine Graf, and my Grandfather, Vincent in the year 1968. My Grandmother Elaine was a hard-working mother of 3 children. She was a single parent for a great period. She was married for a few years but I do not know how long. She was not married to my Grandpa though, she was married to my Aunt's father. My Grandpa was sadly out of the picture. He had no real tangible connection to my mother. They shared no relationship which was an absolute travesty. He left Chicago back in 1968 I believe, and I say I believe because the details are scarce. To the best of my knowledge, he went back home to Guadalajara, Mexico. To be more specific, Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, Mexico which is in Guadalajara. Sadly I have very little information about my Grandfather because for whatever reason my Grandmother didn't seem to like to talk about him very much. She was very secretive regarding my Grandfather it seemed.    But that doesn't mean I don't have any information regarding my Grandfather. My Mother, I believe passed down all the information she gathered from my Grandmother before she died in 2011. I wished I could have asked my Grandmother about my Grandfather before she passed away from cancer. I was only 11 at the time and not interested in learning much about my family, so I never pressed her about the subject.    Request:   I know this is kind of weird and probably out of your comfort zone, but I'd be so grateful, so grateful if you could attempt to track down my Grandfather for my Mother's sake before he passes away. Before my Mother goes I'd like her to see or at least hear from my Grandfather. She's not doing the greatest physically so I'm afraid to a certain extent there isn't much time left. And I know what you're thinking, he could have passed away by now which is true. But I don't know for sure. I believe he was born in either 1932 or 31. If that's the case, that would make him quite old. If you guys are up for the challenge I'd be willing to pay you guys. You guys seem like your the best suited for this type of job. Maybe. 🙂    I'm only one person and I don't have a ton of money or many resources to turn to, so my hope is you accept this request. Thank you for your time.   Ps- I'll be sending this message throughout social media. Just a heads up. I don't mean to be annoying.    Ps #2- If my Grandfather has passed away I believe my Mothers brother who she has not met, would still be alive. She would be his half brother. Also maybe we could talk about this.   Best regards,    Andre Nelson
To bad they don’t make the islands more natural. It is like Salao, Spain... They should make it more natural like a paradise island with palm bushes and many palm-tree’s
"seek discomfort" in first class seats and 250$ a night airbnb's - LOL
The irony of becoming a more eco-friendly company while going to Dubai, and specifically these islands.
Such an awesome video! Looking forward to see this type of content more!
Bracelet buddies!!
Stoked about your environmentally conscious merch- good job and far too rare!
New slogan for you guys ''seek comfort'' :)
A cruel irony to think that the very CO2 released from the wealth of oil reserves tapped from this region of the globe will likely contribute to their watery demise in the not too distant future... Sadly this is not a safe investment for the future, given sea level predictions.
all those billions i just know theres so much exploitation behind this

https://youtu.be/8kz8S6ia1rk
the word you were searching for the whole time is: BORING
When your are about to watch the video but you get an add... bud it's seek discomfort add and you don't skip hahaha.
Dubai is shit place when it comes to rights. No recognition for people who have lived there for generations. Indians, pakistanis, Bangladeshis who have their 3rd generation now growing in Dubai are still foreigners to them abd worst part is that those young people have no idea how hard it is going to be for them, when they wont have jobs after conpleting their educations, no recognition in the place they grew and once they go back to the country their grandparents fled to live better lives, they will start to hate Dubai, the only place that will ever feel like home to them.
They're mastering the art of terraforming, which I'd consider an art equivalent to space travel.
I would love to have the money to stay here for a week 🤩 it's stunning
For everyone, not just religious... To believers and non believers, "THE FINAL JUDGEMENT," is at hand, know that what you choose and accept for your spirit (including your actions in the carnal), will be your eternal fate... You must be very cautious how you choose to live from here on out! Please there are no lukewarm heavenly bodies in Heaven!!! Choose now, in your heart and spirit, righteousness or evil?!!  Please everyone,  if this message is spiritually received...  share to let others know...
16:25 The guy in the background checking Thomas's room after he left😂😂
Great video, very well done!!
I didnt realize Amar went with you?!?! (and got some baby weight back in the face) 11:32
Why would they be full?
Doesn't answer why the islands are empty..
talks about environment and flies across the world, what a jackass.. no you did not have to fly to dubai to make this video... hypocrit.
@YesTheory Is it only me or did I see the seek discomfort ad?
I was about to say “omg why don’t we have this here” and I remembered that this is in dubai and I’m in dubai 🙈
me, living in dubai, camping on the world islands almost every weeked: thomas: I aM tHe FiRsT gUeSt HeRe On ThE WoRlD iSlAnDs in DubYe
no mask in public during a pandemic great message you are pushing to your viewers
Hey Thomas , Matt and Ammar a challenge for you come to India New Delhi and go on a bike ride to leh ladakh with a stranger at the New Delhi airport or else at the L.A. airport try to convince that stranger to come with you all ❤️🤙🏼 I will a sure you that this ride will be the greatest ride you will do .  Lots of love from India 🇮🇳❤️ & please do this please 😭🙏
omg so much discomfort , unbelievable  !  seek out discomfort guys
Let @jack oremus join
“It looks liveable for me, theres a pool” Yes, the pool is the most essential part of a habitable place HAHAHA
Who else got the seek discomfort add at first?
Starts @3:00
Spotted a malayali (constructor) ⚡
2:50 What are you doing about the environmental impact of your travelling though? And the impact from all the deliveries of your clothing? What about all the people who have started travelling because of this channel- what are you doing to remind them to be environmentally friendly?
why did i just get their ad before their video?
Why do ppl put thumbs down. I dont get it.
How do they plan to combat rising sea levels? If things continue the way they are going there won't be any islands to live on in 30 years.
i love all the new merch sm! looking great
Damn I miss dubai the malyalam accent dude made me comment how much I miss living there
the reason for the emptiness is nobody wants to live in Dubai
Looks really nice. I'm more of a cooler wheather guy and being able to be gay type of guy, so I'll pass on going to Dubai.
Great video
I love Dubai and I am obsessed with Dubai. This opportunity that you were able to experience is a once in a lifetime opportunity. I am so happy for you. I wish I could be the one with you. I'm an architect and I have the Burk Khalifa and Burj Al Arab tattooed on my sides from waist to chest. Dubai is my dream vacation.
1:42 OH MY GOD. My dad is the black pilot at the bottom of the escalator in la
No mask.👎
Come to qatar
I think we've all been waiting for this video!!!! Atleast I have been.....
100% cotton 100% shrunken 😂
So proud to be a uae citizen🇦🇪💓💓💓
**Googles how islands are made**
I just randomly looked up “Dubai Vlog” because I was interested in the city, and found out Yes Theory just made one!
Go to Zlatibor Serbia
👏
Is it just me or are the villas not so beautiful inside
I love you
You should have taken ammar with you it would have been so awesome
It's awesome. I would love to make a design one of the villas on The Worlds Island :D And I'm waiting for my hoodie since Seekers Day. #patience
Yes Theory: "seek discomfort" ... ... Also Yes Theory: *stays at private island resort during covid*
Man the chairman is a genius!!!!!
Is no one going to talk about how Thomas did the finger snap thumbs up like Casey Neistat does?
I think this is exactly what the flat earth people think the earth looks like
Say yes !!
You are such amazing people
free marketing for the islands through Yes Theory is probably the smartest thing they have done
Minecraft changed so much!
Woowwwwww So beautiful 😍
Dubai is the land of dreams
Why didn’t I get recommended this earlier. I watched a little about this earlier and I’m hype yes theory is doing a vid on it
That island could make a good cod map.
Cool vacation vid
Why are they empty? Did you miss 2008 and housing market crash? This is a dumb question.
https://youtu.be/8kz8S6ia1rk
Watching your video + watching your Ad .. Awesome ❤️❤️
Appreciate the insight here Buddy, but what about actually living there? In summer, the temperatures reach Stupid Degrees. Do you believe that "living" there for we Northern Hemisphere folk is realistic?
hes a genius
i like how you’re always the one who does the traveling
Is it just me or does the horizon looks like a sphere? 7:16
Welcome to our country ✨✨
Gets on a plane. Then talks about the environment. Lmao
As an architect I'm so much more curious than Thomas is about this...I would love to visit Dubai some day!
all rich people should pass away i think
I need to get into film, if it means this much traveling :)
wooowwww
Wheres mr beast
I got an ad for seek connection while watching this video
2 Hamburgers and 1 Pizza... that's luxury 🤗👍
Thomas why is there no yellow crew neck?
amazing!
Chairmen is best person I ever seen.❤️
What happened to the guy that asked for a job in the yes team.
Welcome to the uae From the uae please come to Abu Dhabi it will nice and I hope I can met you 👍🏻🙌🏻
To this day, I find it hard to believe that several people agreed to spend that much money to make something you can literally find around the world and yet there are people who are starving, have a hard time trying to find food, and have no place to live 🙃
This was a great video!
The Netherlands build a whole new Provence in the sea
The Island is so lovely. Party Island 🏝
Oh! Wow! That's  mind-blowing
Whats with this guy randomly jumping into the sea? Like every shot is like hey one minute I need to jump into sea shot.
Why build this!!????????
you're literally an hour away from where I live 😭😭
I’m still stuck on the love from everyone around him as he leaves. My heart. ♥️
https://youtu.be/8kz8S6ia1rk
https://youtu.be/8kz8S6ia1rk
Omg YES I was always so curious about these islands
I love the way you tell stories, and I love the way you all edit your videos. I'm inspired every time! This is wild, and it's so cool to learn about *how* they're making the basics happen (energy, garbage, water, etc.).
These islands have a huge downside on the ocean ecosystem ! I think yes theory should never endorse such a terrible idea/place/manmade disaster ! Kindly explore the downside/negatives of these islands including palm islands
My heart get so full everytime watching yes theory's videos, it's crazy!!
I've seen a video on these a while ago and it's super interesting history! Fun to see others covering it.
yall dont miss goddamn
IS THERE ANYONE WATCHING FROM INDIA?
Thomas thank you for taking that big decision to leave the us!! It’s worth the content 🖤
Are they using solar power on these islands ?
I got £20 to my name thinking of killing myself
I need to hear more about the yellow plane
Real talk... it’s a middle eastern version of Epstein’s island
Things like this only happen to Yes Theory lol
I got a seek discomfort ad on this video 😂
Lebanon island : the party island Why am i not surprised 😂 if you know you know.  Well not anymore, not with this colossal crisis we're facing right now in Lebanon :/ can a person feel deeply nostalgic about just last year? After the year we've been having? Yes, Totally
Vilars
I am in Dubai rn
Did anyone else got the seek discomfort merch ad from YouTube watching this video? If u did like this comment.😝
Chairman, i love to live there. Can you hire me😄😍👍
proud to be from and living in the gcc countries
I wish I could relate to your experiences like I used to.
Here are them reasons  1.crash in real estate market and investors backing out 2.barriers set to prevent erosion resulting in dirty water around these land  3.restricitions on land expansions in water bodies
Ok but why papyrus?
Such a humble and smart chairman
The first island is just a COD map really
More like Seek Comfort than Discomfort
Me looking for the comment by YouTube
Someone needs to teach you that if your near someone you wear a mask smh
Need song names @ 7:00 and 17:00 :/
I was in Dubai like a week ago I wish I could meet you :)
Seek discomfort merch looks fire!! Keep it up boys. Love the content
welcome to the World
If there's a pool its liveable haha xD
I guess that everyone is surprised by how beautiful and paradise looking  the Islands but what is behind those aesthetically pleasing buildings and the island itself , is  hard working exploited  immigrants that are treated in inhuman conditions  , dont get just amazed by the looks of it  , if you look it up  by just one search you will surprised by finding about  Truth OF Dubai and the rest of the UAE territory
Thank you for flying with Lufthansa. They're supposed to be my future employee (I'm a trainee with them), but obviously that can only happen if they get through this crisis. So thank you for helping a little with that.
Who  miss TUVALU episode 🏝
Live in dubai imagine I meet you😱
5.16 how tf she wearing a headscarf and showing 95% of her legs 😭😭😂😂
The ads I watched on this vid could pay for a round trip
Anyone know the music at 7:16 ?
Best YouTube page
Arabs are cooler then their stereotypical image...
How does he gain access to inaccessible things? Like, he just asks, "can I go there?" And they accept? 😂
Really hope to meet you guys someday really brings hope to a blind guy like myself to see the world
Glad that I came across your channel. You guys are doing a greatt Job. Keep the good work. Ly <3
Love it!  https://youtu.be/gMh-vlQwrmU
PLS Watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kz8S6ia1rk
Being dutch, listening to the chairman talking about how he is the first in the world to build land like this is laughable. We already built similar islands 100 years ago (flevopolder) and the islands shown in the video are also built by dutch companies lmao
this is so cool!!!!!
Just go to space already. Lol
Is he really out there for rehab? Or was everyone else just lying
Very interesting, I'm also developing a project with sensors to reduce waste
Why are they empty?! because they will be under water in 10 years, no one is as dumb as Arab overlords it seems :))
It is really nice to see Yes Theory pumping out vids, but this episode felt like an infomercial to me..
The chairman seems like a really down to earth, smart, thoughtful guy.
LOL "I developed all the islands" what a bunch of bogus.
<<<< Scary Channel OMG
Did Susan just commented
Can you please take me there with you the next time you go? 😢
Dude i saw your seek discomfort ad on this video. Did you pay for it.
so much hugs😅😅😅😅😅
Lebanon island ❤️🇱🇧
That place looks like a hellscape
The amount of ads in this killed this video 😕
PLEASE TELL ME WHY YES THEORY MAKE THE MOST AMAZING VIDEOS?
Its sad that what once was an Islamic state, is becoming westernised...🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Petition to make Mr. Beast do some sort of challenge on these islands
Love from Lebanon   Do it scared <3
I'm so glad to hear about your drop! And the bracelet give away! Especially as it's on for 7 days, I get paid soon and am excited that my first purchase will be an environmentally conscious one. Can't wait to get my new threads!!! Thank you!!! 🥰🥰🥰
They should have named it as greed Island
I got a yes theory ad while watching a yes theory video
Always interesting videos from you guys!
That developer is really laid back! Someone to easily have a very intelligent conversation with.
No one ever tried to make islands like this. Netherlands hello? We closed off a sea and made an extra province xd
I can see myself living there for another 20years
I love how I got a seek discount advertisement
Been staying in Dubai for 21 years , I totally forgot about these island , but it's amazing to see what's going on there
i literally got an ad about yes theories merch while watching yes theory
Seek discomfort merch is dead drippy
I actually love your hair!
what if tsunami...
That add at the beginning
Donald Trump:  I built the World Island
THE MILLION-DOLLAR QUESTION: Will you go to Heaven when you die? Have you lied, stolen, used God’s name in vain, or lusted (which Jesus said was adultery, Mt. 5:28)? If so, God sees you as a liar, thief, blasphemer, and adulterer at heart. If you die in your sins, you will end up in a terrible place called Hell. But there's good news. Though we broke God's Law, Jesus paid the fine by dying on the cross: "God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life" (Jn. 3:16). Then Jesus rose from the dead and was seen by hundreds of eyewitnesses. He fulfilled all the prophecies of the promised Savior. Please, today, repent and trust Jesus, and God will forgive you and grant you the gift of eternal life (Eph. 2:8,9). Then, to show your gratitude, read the Bible daily and obey it, join a Christian church, and be baptized. Visit NeedGod.com and LivingWaters.com
Thanks for the airport & flight montage near the beginning of the video (because we've never seen anyone travel by air), moreover because it gives good insight as to how trite the rest of the clueless clip is. BTW I stopped watching at 2:20
Good luck with global warming :-)
watching your own ad before you own video was amazing👍
This was such a cool and vibey video. Thanks for making this I might do this for a project
he looks so much better so happey for them
Bro, the man's laugh at 10:05 is so contagious xD
Hi! :)
Why is he giving me such justin bieber vibes
when you get a yes theory ad on a yes etheory video
Lol
Love from India❤️
I hope that's at high tide?  How are they going to deal with potential sea level rise?
Only for the rich and the famous...
let seek discomfort / seek connection on a empty 18 billions man made island in 5 stars hotel in Dubai..WTF that even mean.. i'm no rocket scientist but that sound pretty f$#@% disconnected from reality to me, maybe you should start a political career who knows ?
When they started talking about the desalination and methane gas systems, I was really looking forward to a detailed tour and explanation. But I guess this isn't the SmarterEveryDay channel.
Watching this makes me realize how community developers actually care about their environment and the earth, I’ve always thought community developing was cool but now I wanna do it like that where I make a change
LMFAO I JUST GOT A SEEKDISCOMFORT AD ON HERE 😂
You want to know why they are empty? It's a pile of fucking sand in the ocean! What do you think's going to happen................
Beleive in yours D R E A M S
Thomas weren't you in Kurdistan ??
The chief should've made some middle Eastern food That's were Thomas gets more confused
Yes theory make the best videos
“Man-made islands” China: *enters the chat*
Am I the only one that got a seek discomfort ad, on a yes theory video?
It can be used for a miniature of the world with every building design around the world 💁🏻‍♂️
i wish you were wearing a mask : /
Dubai In the house 🤘🏽
This is so awesome. I’ve been wondering about these islands for the last 10 years. Thanks for doing this video!
I got seek discomfort ad on yes theory
Wow I’ve been fascinated for these islands too ever since I found out about them...such a big festure yet so mysterious
Lol, I got an advert about the new merch before this video!!!
Ummm you said your heavily concerned about environmental impact just to jump on a needless jet across the world to Dubai for nothing but those island where they heavily impacted the environment then push garbage merch oh the irony 😂
Only the 0.1% of the population will be able to live here
Well screwdriver joke didn't work 😂
Didnt he say he's going home to his family?
Is it only me who lives in dubai
Got an ad for "seek discomfort" 😂
I miss travelling... 😢😢
I actually got a yes theory ad on this video!!!!
It's nice but it's no small apartment with mice and cockroaches and loud neighbors...I'll hold this W
Hey I live in uae. Local it’s amazing to see you exploring uae
Chef: I need to disappoint him not,hmmmmmm...he's American,what does Americans like  Also chef: 2 Hamburgers,a pizza and a salad if vegeterian.
just to show off
this was the opposite of seek discomfort
Do you feel like a hypocrite with your eco bullsh!t while jetting around the world to make videos?
When yes theory's videos have their merch ads. Duh.
Awesome. Been to Lebanon Island couple of times but obviously didn't get the same treatment as Yes Theory. LOL
How would you buy something from their new drop if you're not in the US?
the lebanon island seems just like lebanon lmao. very disorganized, chaotic and confusing, but its used for partying lmao
I would love to pick the brain of the gentlemen who designed these islands, seems extremely intelligent and wise!
DRONE 🔥
Yes Theory do the things extrovert persons' whole dream. Meeting strangers, dating random persons, partying in random places, travelling in random countries, Oh come on I'm so jealous.
Cool slave labor experiment bro.
Wants to be more environmentally friendly... *Flys to Dubai*  🤣🤣
The chairman looks so highly educated and insightful respect
most forbidden documentary in history:https://archive.org/details/EUROPATheLastBattle
Dubai is the world’s best city <3
i am missing the "team"
I saw the seek discomfort add 3 times 😂
I feel like I discovered a new Thomas
So happy to see you here In UAE again.    Your looking good on your hair by the way.  Keep safe and Enjoy Dubai. Hope you can come here in Abu dhabi 2hrs drive from Dubai.♥️ i missed the group adventure.♥️
This video is terrible when it comes to content. It's all surface level fluff. There's way more reason why these sets of islands failed. You got to meet the people in charge of the projects and did no homework before speaking to him. He explained about conservation and he seems proud of the complexities of the system and you didn't go deeper. You could have asked about showing the system at work. This is all fluff to sell an island project that has failed for over a decade. I wish I can take back this view and time watched algorithm from youtube. Absolute crap of an infomercial. Watch this, you'll learn more than the crap Yes Theory spewed out. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riETCR7FnZE
Thomas, thank you for sharing your incredible adventures!
I would love to live there...PEACE, Quiet and Relaxation
Dubai is just another place that exploits the poor to prop up the rich.
Where’s yo mask @?
This is gonna be where MrBeast makes his next video
Somone should put a soccer field on one of the Brazil islands
Muhammad seems like the chillest person in the history of mankind
I just got a seek discomfort ad on this video.
I can only imagine how good the skyline of Dubai must've looked from the islands . Man the way it is presented in the media is not what it really is. It really will be paradise after a few years!
I saw another video on this. Apparently they were abandoned because they were causing the surrounding ocean water to get stuck and become stagnant.
Wow this is amazing
“Seek Discomfort” = “Get to stay in 1st class accommodations”
Man I just got thier own ad in this video
That is free advertisement for ya
It's funny that there is a seek discomfort ad on the video
Who else was waiting for their next adventure....
I got the seekdiscomfort ad. Lol
When the island is finally open, people are gunna just be saying on social media, “IVE BEEN IN THOMAS’ HOUSE AAAHH” 😂
sad reality is that as temperatures rises, these islands will sink... Once the buildings have been built, it we cant just add more sand.
Do a meet and greet in dxb
Welcome back tom tom!
You somehow got on Google's good side... First a sponsored by Google Video and now YouTube is commenting on your video. They've only commented on 2 videos and both videos are yours!
1st I love Yes Theory & the islands are beautiful! But there are things wrong here.  They don’t talk about the harm the islands are doing to the water & the displacement of the native sea life but it is good they are now trying to minimize their carbon foot print. For me the saddest part of this place is the way woman & the LGBTQ communities get treated there. If Thomas we gay or female he wouldn’t have had such a good experience. Just saying.
They are one of the best content creator on YouTube
What they're doing with the man made islands such as desalinating the water and using paper as compost for agriculture is the future for sustainable energy.
$godgifted04
Most of the royal family and a lot of the wealthy people there seem like nice people.
I couldn't imagine a better way to spend billions of dollars. Fuck the homeless, sick and starving! Build unusable islands! Woohoo!!
Yes theory add on yes theory channel
it’s so crazy to me how they literally have the power to make you feel like your there with them wherever they are🤯
And we have dolomite sand in the philippines 🙃
Awesome content😊
I lived as an Expat in Dubai for many years... what you don't see is this place is one HUGE scam filled with corruption and built by slave labor. F'ing hate that place.
Do shaolin temple stretching, it is incredible uncomfortable, you guys are into that right?
I got a seek discomfort ad at the start of the video lol
Not much to except wow amazing
RIP to all sea life that used to be there😊😅
RIP all the sea life that used to be there.
Wth happened with the audio at 1:02 tho
So the answer is it's still under construction. That's the answer. Ok thanks
YouTube commented on this
Imagine how much stories would yes theory have to tell their grandkids!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kz8S6ia1rk
WOW
Because they have no sewer system
Love you 💕🤙love this
Organic cotton uses more than twice as much water to produce the same yield...
Definitely want to go to Dubai some day.
(3.06)Our seek disconnection drop is available for the next 7 days 😂
Makes me wanna plan a trip to Dubai
Bruh I got an ad for seek discomfort while watching this vid
Dubai will be a desert again in 20 years oil money is running out
No good bye kiss for the homies 😘
Yes theory = Happiness ✨
If only we could travel freely in this time
Vote Republican !
hehe guyrocopter
They really forgot New Zealand... can’t say I’m surprised though 😭😭😭
*Empty island exists* Mr beast : So you have chosen death
Yes theory is always there to save me when I'm in a dark place. Thankyou
I love your channel but please wear a mask 😷 for your safety and other.
Not wanting to be negative by nature but this has no chance of being a success. The project is a non starter for so many reasons. It has been hyped for too many years now.
manila bay who
this worries me. why are they creating islands. of all the countries. Seems like "hotels" is an excuse. Seems like all the world leaders boutta go there and leave us on our failing world.
Cop pulls me over for jogging over speed limit 😭 https://youtu.be/817n6l5mrkM
Can anyone tell me how the islands are floating?
This gives me hope in the future of the world.
Thanks for lifting my spirits during this video...because I'm at the point of giving up. Unemployed due to covid, my truck will be gone if I can't come up with $1200 in two weeks, don't know how I'm going to get groceries at all and I don't even want to know how far behind I am on rent and credit cards...my $200 unemployment check barely dented it. My only safe space is the corner of my room hiding under my blankets with the phone turned off...thanks for the 17 minutes of escape from life. If congress can't come together to pass a relief bill then I'm at the point of giving up
OMG.... you have just found a place to put all the leftist liberal POS that are ruining America. Good on ya!
Slogan: Seek discomfort Thomas: *proceeds to spend his weekend on a luxury island*  I like that type of discomfort
The 4k looks amazing!
Damn, Thomas!
I watched a video of how they wasted their money on "the world" and the palm trees I thought it was amazing what they did.
Unlike many projects that are really toys for the One Percent, I rather hope this does succeed. the rethinking of infrastructure problems such as water and garbage reclamation have the potential to help us find better ways to deal with them in the real, non artificial island world. I do believe, though, that the cost per square meter for land above the tide line will make it impractical as a way to get more land to house and support human needs.It was awesome though- it really gives a new line item for our "bucket lists"!
They should just seed it with coral. Eventually it'll grow and be great for snorkelling.
i remember first learning about the world islands a few months ago and wondering what it would be like there. well now I know :)
Dubai has man made islands While Philippines has useless, dirty, not important dolomite beach made in the middle of pandemic
What camera is he using??
13:54 this looks like a dani video bois
So nothing about the negative effects of desalination and environment by creating those islands?
When youtube comments, you know it's a some kind of brainwash
Three minutes to get to the story in a 17 minute video?
"Hi, I'm a pampered douchebag who's going to fly to Dubai and talk about the enormous waste of money and resources they spent building islands that nobody uses, and then lecture you about the need to be environmentally conscious, apparently because I lack self-awareness to such a degree that I deserve to be beaten over the head with a metal pipe. If I wasn't such a pampered little half wit I could have instead flown my useless meaningless ass to Africa and looked into the Savannah Forest Project which is an ambitious project to transform the Savannah Desert into rich grasslands and farmlands that could feed millions of people who are currently starving in Africa and provide jobs for the most impoverished people on earth. I could have instead spent my time in Dubai asking their rich dilettantes why their wasting so much money on fake islands and instead do the same thing throughout the Middle East. But I didn't do that, mostly because I have the self-awareness of a grapefruit, and the life experience of a hamster, yet think I'm in the position to lecture anyone on earth about anyfuckingthing, when in reality I'm just virtue signaling so I can feel better about myself when deep down I feel awful about the meaningless of my pampered existence. Enjoy my video!"
I got a seek discomfort ad in this video ahahah
I just love how thoughtful you guys are, always caring about every little thing around you. And you do it while having a good time. Keep going.
This crazy
This is possibly my favorite yess theory video, loving this!
What a smoggy city.
You lost the game
Nothing to explore on the islands of nothing.
l challenge you to go zimbabwe
I know the Yes Theory guys are getting COVID tested every three days and "being careful," but please, PLEASE know that this is still very risky--and the guys aren't the ones absorbing all of that risk. Even if the guys are young and healthy, each of the three days between tests can be spent sharing the virus with others--including those who don't have any choice to stay home. People who work minimum wage jobs, have high risk family members at home, and are placed at higher risk by this sort of leisure travel.  Love Yes Theory, but I gotta say this feels pretty bad as an immune compromised, high risk person.
WAY too many ads
Oops you forgot to mention why they are all empty.
I just saw another video on these islands the other day! Maybe there is hope for these islands after all!
Do a hot pepper tier list
15:40 when you find the deep end of a pool without realizing it
''No one reclaimed islands like we did'' The Dutch: hold my beer     Fun fact, the islands discussed in this video are actually built by 2 Dutch specialist companies: Van Oord and Boskalis. So the dutch people practically built those island too.
Just wear a fucking mask. Be a leader not a discouraging president... I mean person. If we have to wear them you should too. Regardless if you have tested or not. My daughter was tested and a day later was positive. Wear a fucking mask.
Who cares
really., some of us have been struggling to get by.,and in some cases in LOCKDOWN because of the corona virus., and you are travelig to the other side of the world . and on top of that , saying u guys are going eco friendly with starting with your merchandise yet you fly across the globe . I NTERESTING
What an utter environmental nightmare of a project these islands are.
adding to the bucket list.....
Your living my dream life, 2021 travel restarts for me again
Absolutely amazing storytelling!
As someone who lived there for years, I always wanted to go there but never had the opportunity. It's awesome to see them up close through a Yes Theory video!
*FROM WHICH COUNTRY.... ?* ARE U WATCHING THIS SPOOKY ISLANDS FROM 🏝
Looks like a JG Ballard novel
the 100% cotton helps us in the industrial field because i can now wear your merch at work
The dislikes are stormtroopers that missed the like button
Looks like it’s a sims map
Muslims for you. But nobody will ever tell you how generous we are.
My empty wallet is crying.
They are empty because they are fake and expensive. Imagine living in the middle of that thing and trying to get around
Dubai: Why are our islands empty? Donald Duck: We don’t like sand in our quack.
Do you have seek discomfort merch in the philippines?
why is he rarely wearing a mask?
this was a really cool video !
Those villas look like for me a Modern-Traditional Southeast Asian houses.
Can we please say human-made ;) Let's try to stray away from androcentric terminology!!
I have a few ideas for the yes theory clothing brand
its because Dubai's coming to its end....what made them rich is not ending
Dude, the camera work here? Perfect. Absolutely amazing
They stole the sand I wish I was kidding lol
Dubai just gives me such climate anxiety 😥
Please tell your editor he is insane
The air looks so polluted😟🤢
Oh wow i love the low waste system
that the Paramont hotel in Dubai
Hey @YesTheory. I need to reach out to tell you about a scenario you might be really interested in. Is there any email i can send you a private message? Thanks
What about global warming? Sea level will definitely increase in the future.
This is wild.
Wish i could afford some merch and support you guys more. Hopefully everything isn't sold out by time i can afford something.
This seems like a Minecraft world.   "There's the chairman's house"
My father JUST passed away In April RIGHT after my birthday unexpected and the main wish he had for me was to follow thru with my dream and start my channel. After months of mourning and depression I got tired of being lonely and I followed my dads wish guys!, I UPLOADED MY FIRST VIDEO GUYS. I FINALLY FACED MY FEAR ITS MY INTRO VID PLEASE GO SUBSCRIBE AND SHOW LOVE, and comment I’d love to hear feedback!!Ill be posting 2-3 times a week.ALL positivity and humor on my channel but mental health and some story times that the public,YOU GUYS,need to hear as awareness will be coming out in a month. I want the first month of videos to be positive only and 90 percent of my videos will be,and let people get to know me first. THANK U to everyone nice enough to take the time to check my channel out like and subscribe.I finally faced my fear. Hope you all enjoy! I will be uploading my music very soon too(rap and rnb) I’ve been told that’s my greatest talent(music)My dad would be so proud and happy to see people liking my content and me especially but all of us need to come together. Stay safe much love-Life with Franklin
Wow I'd kill to live in the chairmans house
I'm longing to travel again 😊✈️🛫
By far the most interesting video about Dubai in a long time!!! Thanks so much! Hey, what’s the name of that Chairman? The dude looks so chill.
I've watched and wondered at a lot of Yes Theory videos but this one is truly the most magical one I've ever seen. I'm currently studying tourism at university and everything about this video seems so surreal and I'm literally out of words. It's such an enchanting place and it has so many potential. Imagine all of the islands being built up and functioning properly as hotels. Going there, even in it's current state or in the future, would be a really unique experience and I just can't imagine the amount of fun and relaxation I'd get out of this place.  As Thomas mentioned, it used to be a place to have parties at, now it's more of a chill out zone. I'm asking myself, why not have both functionalities on different islands? And it's quite weird because after a holiday, I usually get a feeling of being a bit disappointed that it's over and this video got me the same feeling. 17 minutes of extraordinary scenery.  Thank you for showcasing this amazing destination! I hope I can visit it one time.
Nice place
For what i received i passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the scriptures  1 Corinthians 15 3    PS: "according to the Scriptures" - what the Apostle means is that Lord Jesus fulfilled prophecy's of the Prophets of God in Old Testament. There are like hundreds of Prophecies that Lord Jesus fulfilled, just look it up bruhs and gurls. God is our Father. He is the best of Fathers, the most lovable and merciful of fathers. Read the whole uncensored Bible that is Catholic(The Original) and  pray my friends. Wish you all well🙏amen🙏
The ad that played before this vid was an ad for their merch😂
they continue to outdo themselves with these videos constantly elevating their content
Well these islands are not getting finished by the time the rising sea level claims them ‚:D
“With no supervision”
desalination is not all it’s cracked up to be. please do research on the harmful byproducts it releases
Your best decision ever, to leave America
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos🎈
types 2 words on a shirt and calls it a 'design'.. lol fucking zoomers man
I love Dubai
This is insane.
Really cool but I just kinda miss the videos where they did things everyone could do and it was more about meeting strangers etc :/
Take me plz
Amazing video!
Love the video Thomas, super relaxing
Eventually, they should make grass on the islands or something to match the island to its designated area. That’d be cool
Watching from philippines 🇵🇭.   👍 ⬇️
This is a channel where every video is worth watching!
15:30 reminds me of that tiktok where the guy buys the other guy a pizza and it’s so wholesome. he goes, “cheese pizza?” on the verge of tears lol
Seeek discomfort add also nice

Man it’s so beautiful!
The vision was good, this place will be spectacular when (or if) it gets completed.  Your documentary is superb.
I just knew they'd leave New Zealand out of the map 😒
????? During a panoramic ?????
the camera man having the time of his life
Brilliant documentary about a modern mystery 👍
the arab guy english very great
In a decade all of that is going to be underwater if we don’t change 😭
super cool :)
Private chef in a private island in luxurious Dubai.. expecting this most amazing dinner, but "how to make the american happy?" is actually two hamburgers and a pizza :D
from a logistics stand point i can see why this didn’t work
This has nothing to do with the video... I have to WARN you all in LOVE...💝💝... (John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.) We are living out revelations in the Bible, please choose Jesus Christ today while he can still be found. He died for all our sins. We all have sin in our life the Bible tells us and we each need a Savior. I'm so thankful Jesus died for my sins and please accept this gift on the cross he did for you too. He rose from the grave 3 days later and is seated on the right hand of God. We have to confess with our mouth to God we are sinners in need of a Savior. Turn from your sins, invite the Holy Spirit (get baptized) into your life and pray to God often, get a bible.. KJV is a good place to start!! I am praying for the ENTIRE 🌎 daily to choose Jesus today because I KNOW things in the world will continue to get worse according to what the Bible says. God is trying to shake people out of their slumber and choose him...this is his mercy on each of us!! He LOVES us so much he sent his son to die on the cross for us so we can all make it to heaven! Jesus took on the sins of the 🌎. I LOVE you ALL so much and pray for each person on Earth daily. Hell is real and you don't want to go there. I cry for those who reject Jesus, because I know things won't get better for them..🙏💐😊💝💝
trillionaires exsist
Yes Theory AD on a Yes Theory video. Nice
All that money spent and decided to use the Mercator Projection smh 🙄
how was the food?
Where did all the sand come from? What's the foundation like underneath all the empty islands?
This particular video is more like seeking comfort than discomfort!
Could see myself being stranded there for a while..
Who was the other person to hold your camera?  Edit: forgot to say - what a video, contanstly goosebumps
How do people dislike these videos?
Bible prophecies are happening like never before, we're in the end times. Are you saved by believing in the Blood Atonement of Jesus Christ? John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life. Christ said, "Come to Me as you are." It's not about not sinning (we should as we're thankful and build heavenly treasures), it's about having faith from the heart that Jesus lived the perfect life we couldn't and died for ALL our sins and raised up proving who He was and you're given eternal life. On the cross Jesus said, "It is FINISHED!" The Blood of Christ IS enough! God wants to give you salvation from damnation, all you have to do is believe in your heart and have faith in what Christ has done for us.

I’ve known about you guys like 4 hours ago and I can’t stop watching your videos what is going on 😩❤️❤️
OMG! I love this video! As a Zero Waster, I have to say that for such a big Island Project, it's great that they try to do it as much sustinable as they can! And I love that you guys this new eco-merch drop. Saludos de Argentina!
Yes Theory using douchebags, very nice:)
Yes theory: We are eco-friendly  Also Yes theory: Let's see these beautiful manmade islands that are damaging the marine habitat, burying coral reefs, oyster beds, and subterranean fields of seagrass, threatening local marine species as well as other species dependent on them for food.

Think: pandemic, hugging, so do you thinkyou are?
Finally some content
Damn👏🏼
i’ve been watching yes theory for years and this might just be one of my favorite videos
Mind Blown
Whichever editor/vfx designer used Papyrus for the title... ummm... hmm... I’m puzzled. 😂
No one: Water tides rising* 13 Billion dollars down the drain Lol
That chef totally googled "what do americans eat" aye
The ad was also done by Yes Theory
Holy cow! That is so beautiful 😊
HOPE ❤️, Salvation is found in no one else, no other name under heaven given among men where by we must be saved. Saved from the punishment of sin. I’m trying to offer people Hope in absolute perfection !!! No more dying, lies, decay, depression, anxiety, crying, sickness, rotten food, broken things , etc... offering the Hope of Eternity in heaven with Jesus Christ. We must be willing to turn from sin to receive Jesus forgiveness. And to know and live out his teachings. He who does the will of God abides for eternity 1 John 2:17  nkjv 🌎⌛️heaven and earth will pass away Jesus said. But My Words 📖 will never pass away. There will be a new heaven and new earth. Revelation 21✨🪐💫🌎🙂
The hunger games irl?
Jesus died for you was buried and rose again on the third day according to the scriptures   If you confess with your mouth Jesus is lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved. Please repent of your sins and accept Jesus Christ as your lord and savior.
What if there’s a fire?👀
5:03 I thought you said "The Banana Island"
,
Seek Discomfort......
honestly, I liked their old videos better...
What a wonderful video 🥺
Got to see it to believe it.
Wear a mask dude,  have some respect for other people. Nice video though :)
I just got the ad of you Seek Discomfort drop on this video
you look like jesus!
Nice sunset view 🙂☀️
Living 😍
how do you guys get these drone shots?
I got the same ad 2 times at the start and end of the video and the same ad is included in the end of the video. So i just watched 'Seek discomfort' 3 times while watching this video
Hey guys you should travel in the Philippines in the future or maybe after the pandemic
They cut out New Zealand😅 we always forgotten
Check out my book on my channel
this is how i want to live ❤️❤️
I was hoping for Thomas's videos, he's such a good filmmaker and fresh personality. This is so cool!
free bracelet for orders $35 and more btw :(
POV : ur looking for youtube’s comment
Why tf would anyone who wants their own island have it surrounded by other islands?  You don't feel special that way and you don't have the privacy and atmosphere you desire either.
Amazing!!!!😍
My life sucks so bad rn this would be a dream to be on
You tube hides your videos from my feed now, how do I fix that?
Thank you for making the Seek Discomfort merch more sustainable! I didn't buy any of your merch up until now because I've been trying to live a more conscious lifestyle. Now, I'm finally getting one of those hoodies, so thanks guys!
Such a lucky person who experience a luxury island and that person is seek his discomfort 😍💓
Mrbeast will bought this someday
HMU if u wanna go on a adventure in Dubai. I’m here and down!
12:32 the Dutch would like to have a word with you they have an entire province made on reclaimed land
G'DAY Yes Fam: I want to seek discomfort each week for the month of December, if you have any Ideas/ Challenges I could do that you maybe are afraid to do, please comment then!! Thanks and have a good one😁
Hearing the word "villa" pronounced as they are pronouncing it is weird. It's not a word used often. But I take Latin and we pronounce "v's" like a "w" and the occasional "u". So villa is pronounced willa or ouilla like the word "oui" in french.
Love from Lahore Pakistan ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🥰♥️♥️♥️♥️🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
The Gyrocopter is straight out of James Bond movie  “ You Only Live Twice “ 😂😂😂
Those people were super nice.
ZA WARUDO!!!
So demon worshippers steal sand from the earth to create islands that destroys the state of the ocean and y'all are ok with that yer all fahkd
So weird, i seen a video about the world islands a few months ago and was so confused and amazed by them. This video was an awesome insight and you are so lucky to have gotten to stay and everything. Incredible!
I’m glad the chairman explained all the environmentally conscious alternatives for waste. It is great to know it was prioritized!
Watches a video about Yes Theory leaving, 5 minutes later sees Yes Theory at airport... NANI?!
Omg I got an ad and it was their ad for promoting seek discomfort what are the odds tell me now
Videos like this are exactly why Yes Theory is the best channel that has ever been on YouTube. No click bait titles, no filler videos with boring content, just wholesome and amazing footage that keeps its subscribers wanting more each and every week. Been a subscriber since you had around 100k. So happy to see your channel blossom into the amazing thing that this has become.
Thank you for sharing the experience to us. I'm really interested in getting Seek Discomfort items but sending it here in the Philippines will make my pocket crazy. 😂😍
Imagine running/swimming between all the islands
Dubai built socially distanced islands before covid-19 lol should be huge demand for them now
You guys should buy one of the islands and make it the “YES ISLAND”
Way more insightful and real than all those lostleblanc videos.
Got a seek discomfort ad in the middle of my video 🤔
So happy for you Thomas! Have an even greater trip later on!
My mum says I’m wasting my time watching YouTube but I just learned more in this video than I learned in school today
How have I never heard or see anything about these before. They insane
this is one of your best vids
Its kinda crazy and cool .. Hopefully it doesn't effect the nature in bad way
FREAK YEH ! LETSGOOOOOO !
Am I the only one who got advertisement from these guys in their video itself ?
Anyone knows the soundtrack at 06:57?
The city from the island at night>>
People acc verifying that its youtube by looking at the channel info lol  Its what i did 😂😂😉
MALLU SPOTTED 9:50
i heard about world islands year ago and i was so confused that time . But your video , helps to understand alot. Keep it up 👍💯
Great video!
please stop... It's an environmental disaster
It's actually crazy how much I learn about the world from this page !!! I love it Thankyou for always teaching me something new
I literally got a seek discomfort add before this! *Youtube how?*
You're the King!
WOW.
Thomas: no one has been allowed to spend a night here yet, I am the first person in the world to do so..  AllyLaw: I got some bad news for you..
I would die to go there for an hour
A FUTURE MILLIONAIRE WILL LIKE THIS COMMENT
The last island is Java from indonesia?
Music selection in this was so good!!!! What platform do you guys use?
When you live n Dubai and still don't get to experience it completely because it's too expensive😂✌
I am in tears! Thank you Thomas on your behalf, thank you AS ALWAYS for inspiring us SEEKERS of discomfort! Love you all guys!
Your actions will effect the environment more than donation ever will.so keep your money and just do your part to keep environment clean.
The UAE are a nightmare for the environment and human rights...🤦‍♂️ disappointed
Dude YouTube just commented on your video
If you just buy a sweatshirt do you still get the bracelet?
i wonder how the underwater life look like, the water kinda green 👀
what does lexie think about you leaving the US ? i figured she comes with you but ...
He literally has the best job in the world😭
What about global warming will the island be underwater?
Awesome video!! By the way, I just got an ad of your merch in your video lol. I wanna buy one!!!
um those blades on that little helicopter are way to close for comfort
I'm from dubai
https://youtu.be/o7vcuaDiCdQ
Who else is here for Thomas's long curly hair?😍
The quality of these videos is always impressive!
Anyone else think he looks like Wal-Mart Ryan Gosling?
seek comfort
I am in Dubai wanna meet hahahahaha I am your biggest fan you are the best...... you changed how I think about life......
It's amazing. ❤️❤️❤️ That's why I really love Yes Theory because of this kind of content. Another quality and worth to watch content here in this platform ❤️❤️❤️
i was just looking this place up a few weeks ago happy to see that they are fixing the water flow problem,, should be dope when its done
They should now try to convert it into a forest.
I'm confused what is he confused about....? The answer is always money.
A PLACE BEYOND IMAGINATION AND ACHIEVEMENT
*This Video is what YES THEORY is all about !! 😹😹*  Experiencing things that nobody thinks are Possible !
It’s amazing what visions can be fulfilled when money is no object
Dude the video is awesome!!! and the editing is exceptionally good.Big fan..:)
With such an amazing concept, you deserve to have not 6 million but 60 MILLION SUBS..!!!_❤
Is the seek discomfort line with the long paragraphs part of the permanent line or just until they sell out?
Beautiful snowy Canada  https://youtu.be/FHDnADaBkh8
Wow... 5.9 subs.... Crazy.... Strated from The bottom now we here..... Keep at it boys
Come to Doha/Qatar you'll have fun exploring all the places and most importantly we have an island that's called the banana island and the best thing is that it's shaped like a banana and where the richest country in the whole world if you research about the history it'll get interesting. And most importantly I'm a huge fan!
Yes theory please go on a Disney Cruise... hope you notice it. If u do it this will be a dream come true
*Shows 2 Burgers, A whole pizza and a salad*  *"very happy"*  Me: *very hungry*
Watching Yes Theory Ad on Yes Theory video, Now you all are rich!
The Billionaire Island Owner was so humble even tho he built the Palm Jumeriah
All I can think about is how my family doesnt dont kiss/hug me before I go on a flight
I live in Dubai B)
It's just like Disneyland !
I got here when youtube commented on yes theory's video
I’m always happy when I see a new upload
Each video of yours makes me feel love you guys even more. Yes theory, your amazing 💕
Huge bullshit that they're trying to save the environment. First of all they're contaminating the water with a crazy amount of chemicals and second of all they're building the whole country with slavery. But keep doing cute videos instead of real investigation. So fucking disappointed  of what Yes Theory has become
Chairman is like “why is it subtitle for me? I speak perfect English!
Why you have that Ryan Gosling feel?
if anyone listens to this american life, their is a story about some people in 2016 who get stuck on islands in Jamaica Bay within sight of the nyc skyline. They get rescued and it's a really interesting story
I'm just a guy with 1k subs  Beautifully captured Amazing always..
Nice advertisement for Dubai! Wonder how many foreign workers suffered from non-humane conditions during the construction of these islands. Nice to know that you have sold out. 👎
Once I went to goa, I saw a hippie that looks so similar to you.
I love your vid
My teacher worked on this project.
Wwwww
It feels kinda cynical that the guy is talking about how sustainable the islands are if you think how unsustainable the creation of the islands must have been
this video is insane, i came for the second time now
This is so epic... but if you like fishing and hunting check my channel 😂
This is absolutely insane! It’s crazy to think when they started this channel they’d have some ideas of what they could accomplish but they have outdone themselves here. This is an absolutely incredible experience for that kid
As long as there is a division between you and fear there is conflict, there is a wastage of energy by suppressing it, running away from it, talking about it, analysis and so on but whereas when you see the truth that you are that fear, your whole energy is gathered in your attention to look at that thing. Now what is that thing which we call fear, is it a word which has brought fear or is it independent of the word?
So amazing! I’ve always wondered about these islands and this was so great to watch
We have to appreciate the great editing!
After watching this video, I've learned that Thomas loves pools 😛
"this looks pretty livable to me theres A POOL!" LMAOOO im dieing
Me: Watches the video, Scroll down to the comments, See youtube's comment My mind: Mmmm.... Interesting..... Never seen that before.....
Gotta watch out for that 3000 aed fine if u get caught slipping without a mask
These videos are starting to make me feel worse about things.. not better. What's wrong with me?
You should visit IMG world
Damn... Thomas is just living life 🏝
Go to Qatar ( Doha )
My wallet is crying.
I don't think this project will work as just travel to and from will be time consuming and is it a good place to stay? With the rise of water level due to global warming, guess the developer will need to raise the boulders barrier to protect the islands of sand.  Maybe is meant to be a holiday place not as private resident. One can say I am not qualify to make such comments as I have never been there.  Fair enough, is just my thoughts.
And flying Lufthansa. very nice!
WTF!? Youtube itself has commented on your video! Congrats!
wait... how the hell they got power there ?
Your seek comfort YouTube Ad run on your video only..
As aesthetic pleasing as Dubai is, it is built upon the foundation of modern slavery. There are a lot of documentaries that cover the truth behind Dubai's success. I'm not spewing conspiracy b*s. It's the truth. Search it up. Educate yourself. Stop visiting Dubai!
Isn't a pool on a tiny island surrounded by water such a strange idea?
The only thing missing in this video is friends 😢
Dude you should've invited me I live like 20 minutes away
DUBAI IS LIKE A SPOILED RICH KID.. WHO DON'T KNOW HOW TO SPEND ALL MONEY😂.. It's Freaking Awesome 😍
Thomas new long ish hair looks very good! Keep it growing! Also nice how he met all these people in Dubai, wish I could do the same as a female :)
This is the dream man. Making content like this would be a dream 🔥🔥🔥
why was the last video deleted?
the thing is in the end this is all so horrible for the environment, and most likely will be under water in years to come...
Man this was so cool🔥
The last ad played the ad that is in the last part of the video
I thought these islands were not suitable to live and the surrounding water was bad and stuff but damnnnnnn this changed my whole viewpoint, humans can really make amazing things if they try. I pray that these islands become completely habitable and one day maybe, maybe I'll also be able to stay a night there ❤️
No words. Just WOW!
My ad today was literally your ad and trust me I don’t skip it unfortunately my financials are terrible right now so I can’t buy anything off your store, but hopefully I will soon
seek discomfort merch please, 😍
The chairman is amazing!
Did he just casually fly a gyrocopter?
If i had 13Billion i would not have made a iland that does not exist anymore in the next 10-20 years. But hey i would have made other stuff like helping the enviroment or making Robots that do that.
You should've brought your friends
This Dubai tour has been a million times now
"this looks totally livable there is a pool" - Thomas accidentally reveals he's a reptile in disguise
That was a beautifull video. Well done.
i got a seek discomfort ad from youtube before the video started
The https://youtu.be/5pQvM9ZY41k things to come
I got an add on the seek discomfort merch before the video started🤣
Loved this video. Dubai really is a risk taker and it shows. Love living in the UAE 🇦🇪
why do these islands look like something out of a Mrbeast video
This episode is more like seek comfort😂
Did he have to pay for this experience? Or is he paying them with his media influence?
Flip and it’s no nut November... I felt you bro
Everyone allow this message to be spiritually received...  share to let others know...  To believers and non believers, "THE FINAL JUDGEMENT," is at hand, know that what you choose and accept for your spirit (including your actions in the carnal), will be your eternal fate... You must be very cautious how you choose to live from here on out! Please there are no lukewarm heavenly bodies in Heaven!!! Choose now, in your heart and spirit, righteousness or evil?!!  Please everyone,  if this message is spiritually received...  share to let others know...
I think it's great that your merch is produced in a more sustainable way now. But I'd like to remind the people, that one's not saving the environement by consuming "fair" products. The problem is, that we consume way too much as a whole. You want to stop the deforestation, climate change and species extinction? Eat plant based, buy one shirt instead of three, just consume less in general. :)
I missed these kind of vids
“For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words. Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.”  #LordJesusiscoming
That was wonderful!!
I just love Dubai. It’s a really nice place. Beautiful Video. :)   I can’t travel, because of Corona.. :/ Videos like this make me cry and happy at the Same time...😅
I hope you could help my country ( philippines) from the devastation happened last two days due to Typhoon Ulysses.
Great video! Check out our video of the global village stunt show 😀
Mrbeast should’ve done his island challenge there😂😂
Simply Awesome Video
So so sick Thom!! Keep going Yes Fam 🔥❤️
Seek discomfort ad on your own video, best promotion I have ever seen
seek discomfort becoming more environmentally friendly while visiting one of the most environmentally detrimental structures on the planet
i live in dubai
Jesus Christ loves you all so much. Come to him today! He's coming very soon! Accept him as your Lord and Savior. Jesus died on the cross 2020 years ago so that we may be free from our sins through him. Believe on him and Trust him! He is our peace in these troubling times. He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. The time is now! God Bless!
This is the type of videos i subscribed for
there is so many things wrong with this video, the complete lack of respect for people dying due to a worldwide pandemic, the environmental issues caused by these islands. just a tad bit insensitive
and how much did they pay you to promote that useless project ?
Wear a mask brotha
Amazing Dubai
What do u think about Cox’s Bazar longest beach in world?
''No one reclaimed islands like we did'' The Dutch boutta head out
🌅 This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins. Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us. 1 John 4 :10‭-‬12 NIV You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart. I will be found by you,” declares the Lord. Jesus Christ!  https://bible.com/bible/111/1jn.4.10-12.NIV 🙏
i misss you guys so much!!! your vibes are still the same thomas!!! looking forward for more travel videos 🥺❤️
Wondering if this money could be used to feed or construct homeless people in Syria
I live in dubai and it’s sad to see that it was unsuccessful but once the new deira island opens you can go check that out
Bold of you I would/could sleep if it were me on a private island
Time to wake up people https://youtu.be/3GwN_LeKwhc
Hey great video, but why don't you make a report on the awful conditions of workers from Bangladesh, that are making all this luxurious life possible. Beside the fact that more than 30 % of gdp of UAE comes from petrol and gas which is for sure not helping the climate change you guys care so much about. I don't think we should take Dubai as an example for improving our society or technological advancement if made in those ways. I think with your audience and great values you share you really have an opportunity to do good and let people know the truth.
I just watched another video on this
Honestly loved this video. And the part where Thomas was enjoying the island in the end was kinda fun
Thomas: This is very liveable, There is a *POOL*
This story is too on sided you are ignoring fact this all was built  by slave labour and all environmental issues with this :)
Amazing,  would love to just join you guys on one of your travels
Something about a cute guy in a white sheet😉
Yo long time no see bro glad to see you again
you are wearing DB backpacks!!!!
Wonders of the mordern world,Dubai man made islands🚣‍♂️🏊‍♂️🌴🌴🐋🐟
where's your mask? :/
Seek discomfort ad on yes theory video 💯👌
So they advertised on their own video nice lol
Fun fact: Michael Schumacher ( The F1 driver) was gifted an island in 2012 with a house and helipad by the prince of Dubai. Located in Greenland of the world islands.
Simon? You never told me you were married.
this guys are truly amazing have been watching for a year now and don't even regret subscribing love from rwanda
What a waste of money.
No ACs?!?!?! You know how hot it gets in UAE?
I cant take anyone in a man bun seriously...
“I just have this villa to myself, with no supervision” 😂 whata child
We, in The Netherlands have a whole man-made province sooo... we kinda outplayed Dubai 90 years ago already
Seek discomfort ad pops up
Its kind of sad to see people like you not mentioning any word regarding the devastation these island create in the envoriment. Or mentioning that it would be much better to use the resources for a better cause than an Childs dream. Many people love your content because of you authenticity, but your non critical voice in this one is quite concerning.
I would love to smoke a joint there with this amazing view. Just sad that weed is not tolerated and certainly not in Dubai.
Awesome what reality you are creating!
So happy that you had this amazing experience, Thomas! Really seems like a dream trip you were on. Keep up the good vibes! Love from Holland!
Little too comfortable dont you think guys? Been a long time fan, and I know its been a tricky year, but your videos are loosing some of their original magic.
*Enters Chairman’s house*  Thomas: Why is boss music playing?
wish i could buy the seek discomfort hoodie. but they so exp internationally x3 the price for me uwu
7:00 anyone know where I can find that music??
Those islands look very special. But knowing that sea level is rising every year, do you think you would be safe there? Is there precautions for that?
Lol I’m going to Dubai in like 2 days 😂
seriously thomas get a HAIRCUT!!!
Anyone else got a seek discomfort ad? lmao
Please amar, Thomas  go and see jack oremus. He have my made a very great video about your channel. Please it's a kind request .  Note: I'm telling this just because i liked his video and I don't know him personally.
The most wholesome contents are here... My heart is so happy rn💕
When you get a seek discomfort ad on a yes theory video
If you want to make positive change around the world maybe dont support a totalitarian monarchy and their oil barons selling their islands to multy milionaires. I really like you guys but seems you have sold out like many others 🙈
Few days or weeks ago i watch documentary about the world, now u're there thats cool🔥🔥
That oil money created an amazing place 🤭
Are we not gonna talk about Thomas’ curly hair?! I love it
Absolutely incredible. What an opportunity. I still think you guys should go Elk hunting in Montana. I think that would honestly be the farthest from your comfort zone that you have ever been, except maybe with the Ice Man. Even if you didn't film it and did a short synopsis vid on it afterwards maybe. I know hunting vids brings out strong emotions in people, but ... your brand is 'seek discomfort.'
considered making your own island out of the rubbish in the Pacific?
the things you are unaware of is it's all black money game
Very inappropriate traveling now when every government recommends you to stay at home.
this is wholesome <3
this is awesome vid!
Very inappropriate traveling now when every government recommends you to stay at home.
I like the energy of the chairman
Dudes be like: WE BUILT THIS CITY!
Been to Dubai for 5 days now and this happens! Damn, hope to see you if you are still here!
It amazes me how a channel can have such consistently sick videos
Dubai is a horrible place that treats women and other minorities like 3rd class citizens. This video is serving as propaganda, making them seem better than they are.  You wouldn't record a video of you vacationing in North Korea Id hope, so why Dubai?
i love u and i love ur videos.
i'll wait for _mr.beast_ to make a country in *The World*
Did you just say 3 months? Is there any possibility that the Philippines is on your list? HAHAHA hope so, come on Yes theory you haven't planned or even talked to come here!!!! I dare come on say YES
Huge fan of yes theory and loved all their videos until now. I just don’t think that supporting a massive ecosystem disruption and near slave labour of the immigrants who built it aligns with the values of the channel.
so was all that stuff about spending time your parents just bullshit
"No one ever tried to reclaim land like we did" Dutch: Am i a joke to you?!
Made by the Dutch
These islands are an ecological disaster. Cities like Dubai as a whole are so unsustainable.
These islands just demolished the Philippines' Manila Bay white dolomite sand
this was informative.   but, at the end of the day,  empty buildings on empty artificial islands are  just  Not  that  exciting.      nevermind, expected rise in sea level.             happily, we  did not have to  tolerate  the presence of  Any  distracting  females.    welcome to an islam-dominated culture.      googletranslate
Great episode! Hearing from the chairman was so interesting.
Did u have internet on that island? I mean its Dubai so possibly
They trying to ripoff Maldives lmao
That gyrocopter looks fucking dope ngl
Man Dubai has wonderful hospitality
Looks like a dream
Something about yes theory videos are just so wholesome
Dubai is such a fascinating place
Happy to hear about the new eco-conscious initiatives! <3
.
Wasn't this concept completely ambiguous? I mean, okay, they can recycle and reuse all the materials - carton, organics, etc., and also the houses are built from environmentally friendly materials like bamboo, but at the same time they have spent enormous amounts of gas by transporting all the materials and especially - sand - to actually build the islands? It would have been 100000 times more sustainable to just build bamboo houses on actually existing islands :D
dubai loves social media, so of course the moment they found out you're with Yes Theory they'd do anything in their power to do it as right as possible
its amazing
what is the song at 7:16?
Anyone From Kerala
I spy a Douchebag backpack.. Douchebag x Seek Discomfort collab coming soon? Would be amazing!
12:25 is not "we developed there" it's "we developed deira" it's the Palm Deira
The big question is, with rising sea levels do they not feel that in 20 years time the islands will be shrinking and potentially gone? Will the islands not move? So many questionsssssss
is this europe, Thomas?
Shiey and yes theory pls
Wonderful story, Great content again. Well done :)
COME ON IM WAITING FOR THE 6M SUBSCRIBERS          COME ON SOMEONE SUBSCRIBE.
The last island he mentioned, that he developed is Dubai Deira Island, just wanted to mention it because it did sound like "There". but I don't think that's what he meant. Love to see you visit the other emirates in the UAE in the future too.
If your ever back in the UAE, I recommend going to Sir bani Yas island it’s a really great place to visit for wild life, nature and healing away from the city. It’s was one of the best places I had the chance to stay in.
Why buying a private island where you still have neighbours😬 You throw a party and the neighbour comes by on a boat to ask to turn the music down. Wouldn‘t be my idea of private island life. Still dope though
please feature seek discomfort merchandise in indian myntra app, its largest fashion store in india
Malayali aannen thoonunu
It’s sooo hot 🥵 and humidity so high
I got an ad for seek discomfort before the video
We stan curly hair Thomas!!
I’m in Dubai rn it’s fun
Btw he says "Deira" at 12:25 not "there". Palm Deira was also an unfinished project as part of the 3 palms.  (Dubai resident)
I would pack my bags rn to go live there without looking back
What is ‘built out’? I hope it sticks
not cool man, promoting shit with no disclaimer
I got your add while wachting your video😆
This was more like "Seem Comfort" :D
Video published on my birthday. thank you Yes Theory :D
Because that's is very expensive to live there hard to travel hard to get there own food.
Amazingly enough got seekdiscomfort's ad before the vid
wow that is amazing man!!
I got your merch add while watching YOUR VIDEO (i live in dubai btw)
I’m sad to see in all the comments how this is opposite of seek discomfort.  A.  The channel is NOT called seek discomfort. B   Maybe flying to a foreign country and meeting extremely wealthy strangers to then stay on what’s technically a vacant island with no other people.....  hmmm 🤔.
Do another Instagram decides
Where’s the women in Yes Theory?
Who else lives in dubai
Cool
Bruh did I just get a seek discomfort ad on a yes theory video
This was so so amazing. You guys really prove that things can be done if your Committed and believe. Always a great inspiration.  Much love and thanks you guys 🙏
Watching a Yes Theory video with Seek Discomfort ads
while watching this i got an ad from seek discomfort
1:16 Peace Dude🔥🤣
-imagine ordering Uber Eats delivery from the island..
The first ad that popped up on the video was seek discomfort merch is that scripted or somethin'
Saw a seek discomfort ad before a yes theory video
With rising ocean levels not sure how this will work out . also something about building your house on sand .
This is amazing! 🌍
You look overwhelmed, Lol.
1 tsunami
Couple of days back I just saw this video about how these islands are empty, bingo they are now there.
the chairman was so kind
Wow! The place is truly amazing 😃🤗❤️
Wow, that is really beautiful, like actually beautiful, just wow
Vorfor bygge dette og flytte store sann masser for og bygge utti havet  nor dere vet det er faktiske øyer utti havet som spises opp og mensker på flytte for att sann masser på deres øyyer forsvinner husk tat du sann nedi havet henter bare havet ny sann fra et annet sted  mensket forandrer jaggu hele jorkloden tenk dere bygger så store demninger forr vannmasser på land dere endrer joras rotasjon og va skjer med magnetiske naturlige felt som dyrs vandringsmønstrer nnor joras axse blir endret dere endrer tilogmed havet tenk på  det dere der natuli vannet skulle passere helt natuli tilogmed det endrer dere mensker va holder dere på med så blir vere på jorkloden mindre stabilt i tilleg?
Imagine playing Risk here
It doesn’t look anything like the world
I am from UAE, didnt know this even existed till I watched this video
<3
I love that they stop because of the recession and in 2020 when they finally get things going we have the first pandemic in 100 years
Nobody wants to live there 😂😂 Hot and only polluted nature... wow 🤩 The place to be for rich people 🤣
Fyre Festival vibes!!!
Youtube algarthym, watched a video on global shortage of sand & today watched a video about billionaires building thier own islands out of said sand.. wtf
omg I could it keep watching this video longer the quality and overall so interesting love love love your videos ❤❤❤❤❤
My favourite video you done in 2020! What beautiful place!
''Nobody even built or reclaimed islands the way we did" The Netherlands would like to have a word lmao, we made the biggest artificial island: Flevoland. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flevoland)
Nice Dubai ad!
The chairman is Yoda in real life.
It seems pretty livable, There is a POOL! Haha
Imagine how many rich guys want to invest on this project after watching this video, that's why they received him like a prince
2 hamburger, pizza and salad 😂😂
Found your ad in your video very very creative
Apparently the YouTube channel YouTube joined 50 years ago, weird.
The islands are so amazing
Nice hair Thomas
Almost at 6 mil?! Congrats! I haven’t been subbed since 750k but I have been watching since then
I’m in Dubai right now and saw this helicopter over the islands from Atlantis the other day - it’s only clicked now that it must have been you! Hahaha that is awesome! I’m a huge fan and if you guys need anyone for your next vid I’m right here hahaha just putting it out there 🤣
This Video makes my bucketlist look bad😅
The like to dislike ratio is INSANE.
u guys the best
Everyone's gangster till youtube comments on your video
Congrats on the Youtube channel comment. Fkn much love and respect. #YoutubeSeeksDiscomfort
Am I the only one thinking of sea level rising while watching this video?
Yes theory fell off
He could have just built it in minecraft
Welcome to dubai my friend I’m Canadian but lived in dubai, this is one of the nicest countries in the world...god bless you guys.. Been a fan of you since 2018
guys in Dubai gassing about furniture no one cares lol
Is it just me or do all the people working on/ for the islands are extremly friendly??? They seem like really nice people. 🥰
i was brought up still lives in dubai and everywhere we go usually for fun .. we always see construction everywhere.. its like this place is already a paradise and still constructions going on. Every day is a new place here in dubai and i m so thank full that i live here.
This is the first time I'm seeing YouTube commenting to a creators video😂
*BEST VOCAL & VIDEO EVER!!!!!!!!!!!* www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR8Mrt1IpXg
Organic cotton = less water? Boy yall need to come to Lubbock Texas. Might see some truth about the cotton industry.
Tell MrBeast he needs to come here
For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in our Lord Jesus Christ:*
I had an seek discomfort ad before this video xd
Wear the damn mask Thomas we can still hear you 😑
Just imagine having seek discomfort ad on yes theory's video
This video makes me want to go outside.
Big ups for switching to environmental friendly clothing/packaging US you tubers usually don’t give a shit about that.
What are the odds that i got their ad on ther video ok 2 times now
I just got a seek discomfort ad nice
12:26 subtitles don't match what he said. He said "Deira" not "there"
Cool
No way!! I got a seek discomfort add and right after that I saw the same exact thing but in the video itself!!!
Some guy on a trip.
After 5 minutes nothing, what is this even about? Yawn....
Srry but are you taking some drugs you seem a lot different and skinnier
Imagine how people from the future will colonize on other planets? We could make any place habitable.
Woah! Amazing 😯😍
Probably with a great video 🥀
WOW I always wondered what those white blobs in the ocean were.  Loved every minute of that history.  Thanks.
Sounds random but seeing videos like this just makes me more interested in the world, it’s so easy to feel trapped in the bubble but there’s so much more than that
Go to Jordan wadi rum, the Dead Sea... Petra
My respect for yes theory making environmentally friendly merch 📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈
Man I love these surroundings! I'm officially jelly of you Thomas! (in a positive way though). Alhtough, I also love the surroundings in Venice Beach. I wish I lived there. But nooo, PRG lives in the boring Netherlands where no palm trees are growing :( But watchin' this, makes me feel like I'm on a vacation for a moment. And I can still see America, or in this case Dubai for a bit ;) The closest I will ever get to these two.
I got an ad of yes theory merch...
I actually got a merch add on your video
Dubai never seize to amaze me !!u gotta live here for a while . . The experience it brings is lifetime memory
Cool
Just saw the seekdiscomfort ad before the video began!
Ok but howww
I love how these guys have been all hype about Bidens supposed victory and are apart of the group putting sole blame on trump over the covid issues in the USA, yet, here this guy is traveling the world through a damn pandemic. Not only that but he is also not wearing a mask all the time when he is in groups of people ......Liberals are the most hypocritical groups in the world and you will never change my mind.
Nobody is talking about what this man has done. This is an absolutely remarkable constructional achievement coming from the mind of one man. Definitely gonna be keeping tabs on this project in the future.
ALOT OF SHADY STUFF HAPPENS IN DUBIA
That place is amazing and the chairman is very inspirational!
2:13 he was distracted, I was distracted after I got yes theory"s notification>)
please visit auroville ,its a place in india .its an experimental place .
So Dubai paid you money to show the world how attractive it is. But the girls in the bikini we saw for a short time in the video will not be found on the streets, because they must have a strict and tough dress code, nor will you find them in significant roles. Note that throughout your video there was not a single woman on the team. In general, their rights there in a very bad situation. Too bad it has no place in the video.
Damn the official yt ad for seek discomfort made me wanna watch the ad
Lmao I got your ad
Real question, I’m trying to travel to a different country rn but I can’t because of the travel ban, how are they able to do this?
Soooo happy to see Thomas again!! Love ya Thomas ❤❤❤ such an amazing concept and execution of The World Islands. Incredible!! Like WOW!
The hardest part if this project would have to be getting started
I live in Dubai
Sponsored by Dubai tourism....
missed your videos thomas. you storytell like no other and i always leave with a sense of wonder and desire to explore. thank you!
I have been staying in Dubai for 9 yrs and I still didn't knew that there was a man made island 🤣🤦‍♂️
12:30 Netherlands is a country built primarily upon the sea. Today, around 27% of the Netherlands is actually below sea level. This area is home to over 60% of the country's population of approximately 17 million people.
Well Ik where my next trip is going to be!!!
Did you meet Hassan
Finally a video youtube recommended to us that is not years ago
Why are you promoting them
I'll buy all these islands 🤑
i saw this on snapmap
Trump 2020 🇺🇸
I love the new hair
Of course the Americans aren't wearing masks.
Everything about this from the location to the video is absolutely breathtaking.😍
Tbh its not.....
I am from UAE I hope to meet you 😂
Play farming simulator I just started making videos on it myself
I was wearing my Seek Discomfort hoodie to class the other day and one of the girls I've been taking classes with for at least 2 years recognized it and told me she loves Yes Theory! I would never have known that if I hadn't worn the sweatshirt. You guys connect people that you don't even know, and I think that is the coolest gift you could have given us.
Dubai: Yes theory Ocean: No theory
Are slaves going to pick the sustainable cotton? You rich prick
When Yes Theory drops an ad in their own video.... 😂
This stay was not enough. With such luxury I can live here for a life timeee.
bruh why didn't you wear a mask when visiting??
Those islands are actually terrible for the environment and are causing all kinds of problems
That main developer guy was really freaking cool.
I'll buy one of them one day 🙂🙂
This could be one of the youtube originals...
Yay
Thomas not wearing a mask most of the time is really annoying me.
Eyy mga ka dolomite
Bro the chair man look like a far cry running the place as a front
high-key love y’all’s content, keep going guys  Lots of love x  ❤️❤️
To name an island “The Island” is so original.
My first ad was their merch WTF
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kz8S6ia1rk
This video really made my day. Today is Monday.
I saw ur ad!!!❤️
The seek discomfort merch looks great
When youtube puts the seek discomfort ad on the yes theory video lol
the person that built these islands is so passionate about sustainable living that i think the rest of the world could learn a lot from him
sorry how does yes theory only have 5 million subs? These videos are amazing
So disappointing that the only one not wearing a mask is the guest! So rude and unprofessional. You guys see the situation in the world and still being this dumb .... I am going to unsubscribe.

Genuinely smiled when he went back for the real hugs from his friends ❤
13:45 this guy gets it. he’s literally solving world problems! imma move to these islands
Are the tides very small there?
What an absolutely ridiculous concentration of wealth
You need new T-shirts I think – “seek comfort“   😂🤣😂   What an awesome experience. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Is Seek discomfort shippable to India?
I love your guys content, but man, your products are woke.
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he conquered death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ;  Except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/1432117742/ref=emc_b_5_mob_i
I got a seek discomfort ad on this video
Truly amazing
All fun and games until night falls, youre stuck alone on the island and you hear strange noises coming from the next villa
This is incredible! You guys are amazing!! ❤️🎉
Ammar could totally get Egypt island (if there's one) and build a whole dang pyramid right in the middle.
The developer is a Genius!!  Wow amazing job! Wish i could get a chance one day to see it😊
viewer 376,742 just wanna get it on recorded that I was here before 1mil . great video bro, ty for tanking me outta my house during quarantine!

THANKS for this vlog,makes the world now a little better... Mentaly this vlogs helps to get your mind positive during convid19 ... Many thanks to you guys ! YES THEORY thumbs up !!! keep the good work guys and stay safe !!
The chairman sounds reminds me of hassan
When youtube comments on a video you know it’s not only good but Fez3 is somehow involved.
Say yes to meeting me and hopefully buying me a new phone 🙂
Who knew YouTube could comment 😂 Well it is YouTube's YouTube channel in YouTube about.....YouTube
I’ve been researching a bunch on these islands for the past week and then you posted a video on it what a coincidence
This was great Thomas. I want to swim-run all these islands!
I got an advertisement about seek discomfort merch right before this video 😂.
Imagine finding yourself in the seat next to Thomas for 10H flight 😍
Always my favorite😍😍😍
This is freaking AWESOME!!!!!!!
Absolutely....amazing.
This would be one hell of a honeymoon!
I love your videos!  I feel like I’m always going on an adventure with you wherever you go!  It really excites me!
Ammar should build his city there...
They sure know how to waste money in the middle East.

Thomas: "When are you guys opening up?" Island Guy: "We are waiting to make it more liveable" Thomas: "It's very liveable...there's a POOL"   Hahaha he has some weird obsession with pools xD nonetheless it was an amazing video as always, thanks for spreading love and positivity around the world guys 🙏❤️
"seek discomfort" ...goes to a luxury private island that is extremely comfortable. haha
Mr beast will own every island 5 years from now
Imagine looking at the Dubai skyline from one of the islands at night
Where is New Zealand on any of the clips
Yes I love this theory very much.
Great video!
2 burgers, 1 pizza,and salad. can't get more american than that.
Ok so the video was great and all but  seeing YouTube in the comments did it for me🤣🤣🤣...like wtf!!
hey yes theory! i love your videos! keep uploading please! BTW i have a birthday on november 19, and a happy birthday would be nice, thanks!
You are great at sharing the full experience honestly and real......You guys are Awesome. Thank you:) Jay from Canada
This is a 17 minute video but ended in a blink of an eye..
Wait, are you guys still in Dubai? You should do a video in Abu Dhabi!
The poor workers there were wearing masks and taking your temperature but you apparently didn't have the decency to protect them and wear a mask yourself :/
i wish. i freaking wish .
Does that mean there will never be any bugs on those islands?
I was so stoked to see a new Thomas adventure video. This was so dope I'm stoked for the ones to come. Keep up the great work Carl 🙏
You are the king!. Peter griffin laugh
"This looks pretty liveable to me..."   "There's a pool"
This is insane!
I hope all these islands are develop a regenerative design and create an abundant oasis for people to visit and stay. 🌱   Also, The long hair really suits you. 🔥
Muhammad... Ima need your IG. Lol.
I am from Dubai 😳
Glad I came to watch this so refreshing 😍😍😍
Man i wanted to see what that burger looked liked
"Hey, we sold all this oil and it's destroying the environment. What should we do with all the money we made though? Cure disease? Feed the hungry? Offset climate change?"  No, let's burn a bunch of oil to move sand to make useless islands that destroy the environment even more." Seriously WTF, things like this make me ashamed to be human sometimes.
I love it when Im so obsses with something and then some of my favorite youtubers make a video about it!!!
Wow, this place is so amazing, I can *ALMOST* forget all the *ACTUAL* good those *13 Billion Dollars* could have *BEEN* doing this past decade as opposed to making beautiful isolated bubbles the *SUPER ELITE*  can use to hide away from the horrors and *ATROCITIES* they committed against the general population to afford such things.
Dubai is beautiful. Hope to one day visit.
Audio is misaligned
This channel has officially lost the way, i am so confused as a viewer! So different from the start videos!
Shouldn’t support UAE. Serious human rights issues.
“I guess I’m alone in this villa with no supervision” - I expected him to jump on the bed or something after saying that...
Thomas, you forgot to comb your hairs. 😬
I love YES theory but honestly those rich ppl from Dubai just put up a front.  They don’t show the real side of how bad they treat the ppl that make these islands and huge buildings and experiences possible.   Some of these people go to Dubai leave there family behind to be put in a room with no toilet.   Just like the immigrants that come to this country to peruse the American dream.   Yes theory should make a documentary on that.  Look them up people!!!!
these islands remind me of some mario kart race track
I am sad from the fact that i am a dubai citizen and born in it and cant explore places as the foreigners can do .
Hey man I am from Sri Lanka.I accidently watched one of your you tube videos . How amazing bro. Your friendship is so good . keep it up guys . You could grab my attention from a single video.So I subscribed your channel. Do more travelling videos for us. And I invite you Sri Lanka to do a marvellous travel video.God bless you. Love you all from SL
Help Yes Theory find him by reposting his video!  https://youtu.be/8kz8S6ia1rk
Kinda confused how this is "seeking discomfort"  Not my favorite Yes Theory video but ill stay tuned for the next one...
Best YouTube channel there is!!
This place is beautiful! Cant wait for it to build up even more!
Just ordered a crew neck because I live by your live style 🤟
Seriously How did you send the footage to the editors?
Where’s New Zealand?
in all seriousness and no disrespect intended, Thomas, why do you keep removing your mask
Loved this video and happy to see you healthy. I think any other travel type videos need to have a covid disclaimer. I know you all are being safe because you're decent and good ppl. Just as someone who lives and works in high risk places (where plenty of ppl don't "believe" in covid) and who hasn't been able to see a big portion of my family-- it's hard to see Covid or safety measures not addressed.
How come you are not wearing a mask like everyone else?
omg wait i remember when everyone learned these existed like 8 months ago and no one could figure out why they were there. thank you for making this!!
I wouldn't think you would still impress me with the kind of places you "crash into", years after the LA parties!
Yes Theory: we want to do something sustainable with our merch. also Yes Theory: Flies to Dubai to stay on uninhabited luxury islands for tax evaders.
I got an ad for seek discomfort on this video
I didnt know yt commented on vids
DEEEECEEEEEMBERRRRRRRR
Ty for the journey 🤲.  Have many more 🤘
Awesome video, hope to visit one day
You can swim across the world!
Pro tip: if you seek discomfort, fly eco.
I hope people research what a environmental mess these Islands cause.
Loved it as usual. Just one thing though: if you care about the environment, let's start to talk about plant based diet... the way we eat has the biggest impact on the planet of all.
"built out" you tool
nice
Honestly looks like a pretty cool area to film
This video is incredible
Love the video so much...but why isn't Thomas wearing a mask for a lot of the trip, even in public or with other people?
they should bring back stickers I need some for my Mac Lol
I always wanted to visit Dubai one day, but now I want to go even more!
I literally got an ad of seek discomfort before the video started lol
12:00 you could have asked him for his hotel website or contact info
Glad you guys are back. Such a good episode
can I get free merch?
Money laundering
Use „Dubai“ and „environmentally friendly“ in the same video.  All of this waste management he is talking about is bullshit... I mean sure the have does systems but I bet you they will ship all there waste back to mainland. I know Dubai people.  Visit dubai should be a sponsor of Yes Theorie. It just doesn’t match.
Well you finally have been someplace your girlfriend hasn’t!! Awesome man love the videos
Man looks like you just shot an advertisment for these unneccessary overpriced houses. Glad you had the opportunity to enjoy them before climate change washes them away. (Irony off)
All that traveling without a mask stressed me out
I jumped when I saw yes theory in YouTube ads.
Not wearing a mask? what makes you think you are above others?
❤️
Ngl, this was a rather boring and dumb video
You're girlfriend would be so jealous 😂😂
such beauty
Hey yes theory somebody is asking u something check out jack oremus channel
Wowwwthis video is awesome
One of the coolest Yes theory video ever!!!
what a waste of money....where hungry people all over the world are dying of starvation
As a guest and foreigner in a country, have the decency to be compliant about wearing a mask when around others at all times
What a beautiful man made landscape
This will be the first place to go underwater when the oceans rise
One time I was on a cruise and I met this guy named Christian. He saw my seek discomfort hoodie and he said he was gonna do a podcast with yes theory and that they followed him on Instagram. Unfortunately I couldn’t contact him after the cruise but I’m still grateful for the experience
I love mobile ad blockers for this kind of video!
I bet when he said "glass" Thomas first thing in his mind was ice cream.
Seek Discomfort my ass
thats damn, cant't wait lets explore this world //soon
it looks cool but also looks like it could just be washed away in a few years???
6:57 wow beautiful

Looks like everything's going well for you Thomas.
Yep, looks like $1mil of tacky tiki huts on top of $12.999 billion of sand.
I got a yes theory ad on a yes theory video.
How much is one of those?
I will pray that God will bless you with an opportunity to visit heaven. It won't be to make a u tube video, but you probably will when you get back. It will be to help you to know how important it is to pay attention to who Jesus is. I have visited heaven once, sure would be awsome to have the resources these people do, i would be busy doing everything I could to convince people about how very real and solid the truth about heaven really is. It is not see and you will believe, it is, believe and you will see. We are so decieved in our pathetic existence, to experience heaven, might seem like discomfort at first. C S Lewis described this in one of his books. He was right.
That hairstyle looks great on you thomas😔👌🏼🔥
Hi thomas, can we switch just for 1 week at least?
Yes Theory make amazing videos 🔥
Thanks for making this story, Thomas!! Well done! I really love how the Eco-friendly the island is!! ❤
the Arab states are actually importing sand from other parts of the world for construction.
So who’s the cameraman? Because some parts I ask myself if he’s alone or not
Awesome to see how big this channel is getting! Spreading love all around.
YOOOOOOO THESE ARE DOOOPE. I WANNA GO VISIT THEM SO BAD NOW... THIS MUST BE SUCH AN ADVENTURE, SUCH AN EXPERIENCE!!! :O :D
is it true that the more you travel the less racist you become?
the chairman is so humble
this will make a great venue for filming adventure and Scifi movies.
There’s literally nothing protecting you from nature and there’s probably no food to live off there.
Total waste...
Thomas always has the coolest adventures and best videos
Imagine disliking their videos. We love you guys either way, I hope you all that have disliked any Yes Theory videos are doing okay. This community is here for you!
That shot from 07:00
Spoiler alert: soon they will publish a video of thomas in kurdistan
the Arabian states just have too much money.
Quarantine is just a little bit easier to survive when you guys push out videos. Forever thankful for your guy's content.
So happy about the sustainable change :)
wow who wouldve imagined a guy sitting ona laptop using youtube years ago and now talking with a builder os the island and becoming first person to stay there, u inspire me being a youtuber @yestheory
Looks like so much fun🚁
How can you travel right now? Better than that, why do you feel comfortable traveling?
THEY'RE BAAAAACK!!!!!
Thomas!! Please go back to Tuvalu!!!!
Besides getting my food. I would 100% be naked the whole time.... you got the whole island to your self!! 😳
You talk about the environment after being on a plane WTF makes no sense lol
Anyone else curious on what happened with Thomas and Lexi?
this is cool. my friend pointed these islands out to me the other day and I was so happy seeing yall post video about it
U should of taken me with u there 😇
Imagine how happy flat Earthers must be after looking at those world islands😂😂😂
amazing commercial.. :)
Man, it's been wayyyy to long
You living my dream 🥲
Don’t get why so many countries aren’t taking examples of Dubai, especially their eco-friendliness.
Great video. I always hopped the islands would be built out. Encouraging news.  I wonder if a loop system from the borning company would help for utilities and transport around the islands. Interconnected tunnels may even provide some type of ground stability throughout the islands
ijsut saw a ad where it was yes theory themselves
i LOVE your hair long
Just wish you were wearing a mask.  Remember, people look up to you.  Save life's.  Love YT!!
This is amazing. Like literally. Glad you got the opportunity.
Mans says “seek discomfort” and then does this🥴🤣
They be looking clean af in those all white outfits no lie
Not to get too heavy, but what about as a defensive mechanism? Makes it harder to get to that area?
I just found out this channel and I can already tell, THIS is what kind of creators YOUTUBE should have. Quality content, definirely deserves 100mil. Cheers!
ads ads ads ads ads ads ads.... this is the outrageous number of ads I got watching this vid.... :-(
It’s like creative mode minecraft in real life
I didn't know that something like this existed in Dubai, and it's sustainable !
Okay time to do a life-size version of risk on the islands
Wow so awesome u guys should start a travel channel
how much energy was wasted building these islands in the first place... you didn't mention that ...
Where is New Zealand? hahahah
I want Thomas as my teacher because of voice,am I only who thinks that?
Thomas did you get a perm?
I missed this kind of content so much.... Hope you're having fun!!!
the mask situation in this video made me cringe so hard... like in every shot, hes not wearing a mask and one person is and then one other person has it below their chin. i gotta say the whole video came off kinda kim kardashian hglkjdfgh ...i know its work for you and you needed to return home but stopping in dubai for a video and never wearing a mask was kinda ignorant to do in a pandemic
1. why aren't you wearing a mask?! 2. Do you realize "seeking discomfort" is the epitome of priveledge? 3. I'm still interested in what you're trying to do but need to see more effort into realizing the world you live in.
The World could do so much better using recycling systems like these islands.
They are all going to be under water in some years
awesome
this video is dope
Being "invited" to stay the night feels more like someone wants to make sure their publicity is only positive when in reality the situation isn't good. Just a thought.
Why didn’t they wear a mask when they were with people 🥴
Thomas channelling some Ryan gosling vibes
Been living in dubai my whole life and never went to these boujee places. I feel so alienated lol
Hey! Will you commit to having your new line made without the exploitation of workers(including children)?
youtube being comfortable with 3 ads per 1 vid eh? -_-
Been waiting for a video for this abandoned island
We missed you thomas.....😭😭😭
Then: Asking billionaires to have doughnuts with them Now: Invited to billionaire's Island resort as the first guest!  can't believe how time flies!
Bye Bye Dubai --- !!!
After watching Yes Theory’s videos..My day always gets better.
Thomas ur the boss!! 🤘 just lovè wht u do
Yes theory climb Mount Everest
Get a haircut ya hippie
Does the island block sharks away?
Dubai was the trip of a lifetime for me! Loved every minute of it. I went over alone for almost two weeks. Can’t wait to return!
Love these x well done spent all day watching your episodes x you all have a great bond x sending love from the UK
Wouldn’t a hurricane destroy these islands?’ I love the idea tho while it last‼️🙌
Dubai is a dump of corrupt money.   All empty buildings
Its so good that even Youtube liked it!
I love how you seek discomfort...in Dubai! 😁
I wonder what the name of the chairman is, sadly you didn’t mention it
Mr Beast: "So i bought island".
Hey Thomas, it would be awesome if you read this and responded. I really look up to you guys at Yes Theory, and I think it’s awesome what you guys do. I would love to travel the world some day. This episode was very cool. I’m still hoping for you to make the Seek Discomfort app. Alright, just wanted to tell you. Btw I’m buying the Seek Discomfort hoody with the checkers...
Isnt he with that one flight destroying evrithing they saved by producing eviromentally friendly packaged shirts? 😂Just thinking ;)  And dont understand me wrong i really really like to travel by plane and  like this video's btw your collection looks very good, i just found it a little bit strange to fly in the same 30 seconds And directly after that advertising for the enviroment...  Greetings and have fun on the trip!
This was insane!
Yo
Hey guys! Come visit Finland! Visit our rich islands and thousand lakes, visit lapland during christmas!
Thank you for sharing Thomas it's amazing to see the existence of such kind of islands. Hoping to visit it someday.
Yes theory are really starting to look those kids on a gap year from some rich family before going to Oxford university 😂
And then there is the netherlands where 1 of the 12 provinces used to be the sea and now there is land since around 1942
He’s my fav
Was anyone else thinkin of Dio poppin out the screen after The World showed up
When you're selling pure trash MERCH  in disguise as self improvement : Fuckin disgusting
I will put this up there with your travel to Tuvalu as one of your best videos ever.
sea level rise.
*Travels by airplane *Lands, then proceed to plug about being a more eco-friendly brand  Right... 😂 not the best timing
A billion money and a billion people want to see that WOW...
This is amazing
I really love when your fans approach to you guys and ask "are you from yes theory?"
Dude, you are so lucky you got to meet the creator of palm juveraa!! That's awesome
Peak youtube content
i remember watching a documentary about the world islands a few years back and i really wish the project would push forward and develop nicely in the future! the concept they had for it was really cool, just sucked it finished during an economic crisis. i would love to rent out a villa there, but i also wished the other islands were developed and had maybe mini shopping places and resto’s and activities. mann
When YouTube comments on the video you know its good
I been to Dubai but will hopefully inshallah visit it the islands one day
keren banget woy
Swear methane is one of the gasses which cause climate change 💀 -oh we’re trying to be more environmentally friendly- travels to Dubai  who built their whole city off slave labour- travels by PLANE in business class during a global pandemic- privileged much 🤔 I get going back home to see family but that extra journey and fuel is a bit extravagant especially during a pandemic when absolutely no one else has the privilege to do this and millions of people are dying - bit disappointed Yes theory and feel a bit like you’re being a bit hypocritical
I know this would sound weird but Philippines need your help over the past 3 weeks 4 typhoons consecutively hit Luzon Island and now a lot or areas are flooded. Due to typhoon rains most of the dam are on spilling level that cause the flood to go on chest level. I am humbly asking for Yes Theory subscribers if you can send some money for donations that would be a great help to buy them food water and clothes.   For donations here’s a link of a fb post that compiles reputable organizations https://www.facebook.com/100000146467824/posts/4082271268454382/?d=n  Thank you and God bless!
If you like to try a real Hundred of islands you must try it here in the Philippines is Pangasinan Called Hundred Island
this might be one of the coolest things i have ever seen. adding this for the bucket list for sure
In a few years or so, this will all be gone by rising water sea levels. All that oil money wasted
This comment will NOT get to 1k likes.
I deadass got a seek discomfort as on a yes theory video
I love that grey seek discomfort sweater, I would love to buy one but I’m broke 😂😔
Its nice and all but what happens when there a water rise?
YouTube is weird these times... First commented on Among us, then here. _Noice_
13:55 Dani liked this
dangerous and out of control  is more my style.
Thomas with Drew in Iraq, Next Day in Dubai. WOW 2 VIDEOS
I live in dubai for 20 years now but this was so entertaining to watch.
Hey buddy, ya gonna drop some merch?  ...gonna drop some merch pal? ... you are so woke.....
Thank you for taking me to places, Yes Theoryyy! 💖 you guys are amazing
You guys are the best!!!
Who would want a house on one of these tiny “islands” / mounds of sand? One mild storm and it’s gone.
M
Wooooooow😯
"this looks totally livable there is a pool". Such insight from Thomas
Man's looking fine af
any one know the outro track at the end?
Feel very weird hearing you talk about environmental care regarding your production on a trip to Dubai for one Video. As if there was nothing interesting around LA, feel like this video overall has barely anything to do with the idea of "seeking discomfort". It rather feels like a "look at my cool trip video", used to like this channel a lot, over time you are losing me due to commercialization and loosing the contact to your viewers, and that is possible during covid in other ways. Sad, will probably unsub soon feels cheap.
where can i get the sweater ur wearing in the beginning of the video?!!!
I guess you made them feel discomfort by not wearing a mask, just making jokes, but also why?
Great video felt like classic Yes Theory again 👍👍👍
Does anyone know what company Yes Theory is using to make these environmental friendly clothes? Video is awesome btw 👏
11:20 for T boogies' joke. Respect the joke lol🤣
Damn that seek discomfort ad at the end was fire though... and this episode was fire. Loved this so much
Hey man that was cool. I agree, travelling is the best... I love it too!!
LA DEE DA
But the question is how much is the rent per night?
But the question is how much is the rent per night?
Thomas! Good to see you, we missed you man! Do make more videos even in Europe
Yo I litteraly have a seek discomfort ad before watching this
I like the advertisement
Okay, for me this just seems like an ad. I've seen documentaries about this place and it's known to be struggling. It also causes environmental issues. I don't even want to know how poorly the workers are treated (it's a known fact that the saudis treat them poorly). This is the first dislike for me on this channel.
Did he pay to go there or was it all free?
Dubai is truly an endeed wonderful place❤ thanks Yes Theory, Thanks Thomas😊
Amazing, but isn’t desalination bad for the environment??
I can't be the only one who loved the shot at 7:00. Great Work!
Wait do they add the ads by themselves cuz I got a seek discomfort ad when opened the video
So why can't america expand our coast lines that are most exposed to hurricanes and flooding? Looks like it's possible to me.
"Send the boat back to go get the screwdriver!" - Thomas Brag (2020)
I like how your hair just flows, Thomas. Haha good job on this one, I love the ideas of how to keep resources clean and green on the islands. Very innovative and self suffecient.
even i have the money, i wont buy an island in the coast of dubai bcus of climate change. sea level will rise in the near future.
That's awesome that they allowed you out there. The water looks incredible. Your seeing and doing some great things.
I don't know how but  Thomas's voice soothes my 5 month old to sleep and I thank him for that
I live in dubai but never went there wtf XD   Its seems soo normal to me
I like how he has an AirPod in 😂😂😂😂
We missed you Thomas
I've been wanting to visit these islands for ages. 😍👌 This is the video I have been waiting for.
We missed your videos. Always great to see content you gave us! Dubai look such a good place to visit. Love from Portugal 🇵🇹
The person who designed those islands is a literal fucking genius
My mom is from Lebanon
What about the dredging of sand destroying natural ocean habitats and Dubai’s utilization of basically slave Labour? You have to be mindful when preaching sustainability and positivity to showcase a place like this...
Let me just say, this new line... my favorite so far! I’m always so blown away by the products you put out and this is no exception. I want to buy them all!!
I just googled the net worth of that guy that you met earlier that came up with the islands... he’s worth 18 billion. That’s insane
This video makes me want to go to Dubai even more
Love your videos sorry I’m sooo late
I like the chairman. Most businessmen will boast about the costs and prices of the place with a big fake smile but this guy, he's very calm, nice and actually has a very soothing voice and presented how the place is sustainable and environment friendly in a very friendly and non-business/political manner.
So impressed by all of you! Keep seeking discomfort!
https://youtu.be/ge60129283I
https://youtu.be/ge60129283I
https://youtu.be/ge60129283I
Wouldn’t all these islands flooded in several years due to global warming? I mean, they are already not much higher than the water level.. That makes me nervous, because building of all these things seems extremely expensive.
https://youtu.be/ge60129283I
https://youtu.be/ge60129283I
Legend has it, they are still waiting on that missing screwdriver to be shipped out so they can finish the islands.
I want to be like the girl who goes to that party island every weekend just to relax👌🏽👌🏽
Lol. I got a yes theory merch ad before the video played.
There was a little bit of video in between my ads
You really seeked discomfort in those hotels
I don’t usually leave comments on videos, however this is amazing. Yes theory always goes above and beyond. Thank you for this amazing content. You guys are truly amazing!
“Wants to be more sustainable”  Flies business, takes every single carbon emitting mode of transportation one could imagine and spends the video promoting an insanely unnecessary and environmentally unfriendly project “Okkk”
what about water supply and sewer system?
These oil states exploit slave Labour and despise anyone in the lgbqt+ community tp the point where they’ve killed people. Seek discomfort indeed. Be thankful you’re a white heterosexual 👍🏼
can it open already
I got a week discomfort ad on this video
i swear it’s like y’all know what videos i’ve been watching, i watched three videos based on the three palms and “the world” yesterday and now this. y’all are incredible!
I love how they included all the provinces and everything😂
That was an incredible trip!  Mind blowing!
very interesting video. such an interesting topic
i love your vids keep up the awesome wolr
Yes, something is very wrong about the money in Dubai... Yes, it seems corrupt and inhumane.
yall needa make you’re clothes bigger, i know I’m a big dude and need to loose weight but godammn it be hard to find merch in my size
Only me who got a seek discomfort ad during the video?
Happy to see Yes Theory being more environmentally conscious. However, promoting these picture-perfect projects like this one is really not great... Although they recycle some materials which gives off some methane for cooking (meaning you definitely need additional energy for cooling, refrigeration etc coming from other sources), they took sand from a natural ecosystem to built this and have to continuously bring sand to ensure it won't sink in, desalination involves energy loads that are very big and similarly all the construction material and I'm guessing the food needs to get imported from the mainland all the time... This project is said green but really isn't or could do much better... Would be great if you could promote more sustainable initiatives. :)
got a Yes Theory ad on this lol
I got a SeekDiscomfort Ad on the Video lol
why "Holiday 2020" not Christmas 2020
i'm not enjoying this content anymore, anyone else?
All I can say is wow.
Such a good quality content
This place has so much potential!!
If i had to go to the moon or mars i want to go with the chairman... Unreal & seems like a great guy..
Who can count how many different pairs of sunglasses Thomas wore throughout the video?
Thank you for making your clothes 100% cotton! I’m a welder and clothes with polyester go up in flames and I can only wear 100% cotton or leather. So I will definitely be buying a new shirt!
14:44 the moment Thomas highkey wished Lexi was there 😂😂
LMAO! I GOT THE SEEK DISCOMFORT ADD ON THIS VIDEO!
🥴
I got a yes theory ad befor the vid
You can tell the chairman of the islands is very smart. It’s amazing what they’ve done
I literally got an ad about the merch in the middle of the video and I watched the whole thing
Well although it's a fancy island and Dubai is an impressive city etc.. they should consider the working conditions construction workers are working under in order to build this. If you just Google Saudi Arabia allegations of Human rights violations of workers you will find out. Yes theory should do more research before they advertise things I am sure they could do better 😉
I think it’s stupid they made the man made islands
I saw your merch ad as the ad for the video before it started lol
This is just amazing,
Lets go Lebanon Island! I’m here for it.
how can i live there
You guys tell the best stories!  Hope you can tell a story about the Philippines in the future xx
Hey there, thank you for watching :) I've really missed making videos consistently so I'm very happy to be back. I'm sure this year has had so many ups and downs for all of you as well so I hope to share some positivity through these stories I've captured. This is the first one out of my trip and I've got plenty more coming your way. Let me know what you think in the comments and I'll see you again soon
running out of money checkkkkk
add a few dinosaurs .. that would be a good vid..  maybe some girlz
Anyone know the song at 2:15?
seek discomfort adds on the video 👍
damn what is Dubai doing to this world... pure magic
Dubai where dreams come true
Lmao, literally most of Hong Kong is man made hahahaha
The best part of the video isn’t even the island itself, is they way that they protect the resources they have and make sure they reduce all the waste they can. Hopefully techniques like that can be implemented all around the world 🎉🎉🙌
I got a YouTube advertisement for seek discomfort on this video😂😂😂
Why would you dislike this?
you guys really are living the dream, it so inspiring
Damn... I even had a seek discomfort add b4 this video
The first ad i got was a seek discomfort ad
At 10:23 am I the only one who noticed the Brocken tile on the side of the pool lol
14:40 , thomas has the hotel w no supervision 😏
“1”
‘1’
Feels really good to see you traveling and having a good time. :) All the best.
Dead island
The dude who thought of this, my guy is literally playing real life sims.
Hey, I appreciate how you told this story to us. You described the beauty of the islands, with the back story of why they were created.   I just wanna say you guys are something special is the most amazing way. Are creating something that no one sees coming 😎
lgbtq: "this is how the USA needs to be, all GREEN"  but dnt realize a night on a villa there is worth what i earn in a year 😂
Ok this is getting scary now, whenever I research a certain place or country yes theory upload a video about it LITERALLY ANSWERING MY QUESTION - THEY’RE LITERALLY PSYCHIC
I’ve been watching you guys a while and your whole message of Seek Discomfort I think is brilliant! I’m dealing with really bad anxiety at the moment and day to day life like going to school has become a real struggle for me. However your videos of seeking discomfort always help calm me and to feel more at ease. I’m still trying to work on my self but you guys keep doing what you’re doing because the whole message and project of Yes Theory is revolutionary!
Ah paying 13 billion for useless islands when almost a quarter of the population lives in poverty
That’s DoBuy 🇦🇪. Yes Tiory
Hey guys, please don't take this the wrong way but it's coming from a genuine place. I've enjoyed your videos for years and have been inspired by them countless times. But as of late, the videos have been feeling a little lackluster? Feels a little like churning out content just because you have to.  The production quality has been great, but the meaning behind them (which is the main reason I watch) might be lagging.  Just my few thoughts, don't roaast  me lol
Oil Money
I love your content and everything you guys do and I'm lowkey jealous of your life
Don't forget that Dubai was (and is being) built by slave labour
Kommer du göra videos i Sverige när du flyttat hem? (Du är väl svensk)
Ha who builds a pool on a tiny island sounded by nice water
oh cool
That moment when you seek discomfort but all you find is comfort...
Thomas your are is just awesome, I'm doing the same xD
what a waste of resources
He really got to fly the mini-copter from Rust? What a lucky man
this video was so epic it looked so smooth great job to the editors on this one u deserve it
Those islands were the biggest waste of money in the history of mankind.
fun fact: Michael Schumacher actually owns one island, the emir of Dubai gave it to him as a present
I'm sure they've had plenty of "workers" stay the night against their will on those islands
This is why there country is so rich
This looks like a good place to go flatland skimboarding
I really love yes theory 💗 I wish I can buy one of their clothing  That's one of my wish in my birthday  Love you you yes theory
Nice! I got a seek discomfort ad right at the start of the video did not even skip :))
Hello guys! I am from Argentina! I want to ask you to subtitle the episodes in Spanish! I want to share with my friends and family but they don't know English please!
I got a seek discomfort ad on a yes theory videos thats crazy 😂😂😂
Lebanon island 🇱🇧🇱🇧🇱🇧🤘🤘🤘
Thomas on his own are the best videos!
Wow, beautiful 😁😁😁😁
It’s the inconsistent mask wearing for me
I like that you can see the city in the night and in the morning you can't see it because of the sand storm
Your the king 👑😁
Yes it sure is amazing what migrant workers treated like slaves can build. Let's thank the +34.000 Indian migrant workers that lost their lives in the Gulf, so this video was possible. Really disappointing to see you promote Dubai and help them whitewash.
longest ad i've ever watched...
I remember watching a documentary about building those islands. And I remember thinking how it is just showing off someones power and wealth. The whole Dubai is built with that idea. Its a big sand box with modern buildings, luxury hotels, rich people....but no tradition, no culture, no living. I dont know where people  who live there spend their time outside...go for a walk, run, hike...its hundred degrees outside. I guess everything there is just about working an getting rich
Man you so lucky first to stay on the world islands 😜
what do they do when climate change raises sea level a couple of meters?
Hello, Yes! Have you ever been in the Philippines? Please comeee
I always love to watch your video's 😊❤
Great 👌
This video was really boring
Thomas as a travel vlogger, I'm all up for it
That chairman seemed so full of knowledge, I'd love to have an hour of talking to him
Wow
I can see it now - The Yes Theory World Island!
Helll
Dubai, the least intriguing place to visit
1:31 “first international trip in a while”   Meanwhile ive never left the US :(
Zero nature, concrete, fake, grim.
Just remember these were all built with slave labor... but they sought discomfort so I guess it’s ok.
The creator of the islands make it seem super eco-friendly, but in reality it's so damn dangerous for  the marine life...
Please make a video exploring sinking islands, countries
1:55 definitely The Netherlands
😊
When you spend 13 billion dollars moving sand around instead of feeding and housing one of the poorest populations on earth.
Guys, go to Veneto. There is an entire amusement park made by only one man and it is completely eco! Imagine that there is neither electricity and is in the nature. Pls show this location
At first I thought you payed 13 Billion to spend a night on these islands and I was like "WTF how much money did these guys actually get from youtube and why would he spend it there??" then I read again and felt stupid hahahahahahaha
Dude this episode was so epic!! Like that dream of having your own island, it just became true as you said hahahah
Hey there Yes Theory! Do you have any plans to sell just Seek Discomfort rings or bracelets or necklaces? I would absolutely get one!
I love the quality of these videoes. And the amount of effort they put into them
"It has a pool..it's live-able already!" lmaooo..I love how Tom gets excited whenever he sees a pool! I've never been in one and I don't think even then would I be this excited! ❤
dubai people are so humble
Wow this is awesome! They should complete building on them. I think it is gonna be a future land mark
Where’s your mask!?!?! Disappointing 👎🏻
WOAH!
Meanwhile the Netherlands building their land already since the 1500's and having build the largest artificial island at a surface at around 970km².
I’m so jealous.
Hi guys, I’m going back to my home country for a bit, peace. BHAM! Dubai
must be nice, but so lonely
Talking about the environment, then proceeds to take a plane to Dubai. A country built on the production of oil...
I would love a vid called “yes theory goes to the top of the tallest building in the world”
Traveling during Covid, Thomas?
If people around you are wearing their masks, probably you should wear yours too .... #americans....
Incredible video!
Interesting
So crazy to see stuff like that - never even heard of it
Great video and content . But, you should google how Dubai treat their labour who built these things.
Damn lucky! The farthest I've gone in the last 9 months is hopping over to a different TV in my house
Wears some Seek Discomfort merch to arguably the most comfortable place on earth 😂 nice job Thomas!
Hi, I love your videos!
wow, amazing video! love you guys, such an inpiration <3
Thomas please wear your mask
Did anyone else get a seek discomfort ad in this video?
The amount of non mask wearing by an American who just came off a flight is infuriating.  So disrespectful
Just.... chills
Wow, very interesting vid! are there any birds, bugs, insects or any other animal on the islands? I'm guessing not.
the chairman seems to be very smart
E
Look like "Lençóis Maranhenses" in Brazil, in "Lençóis Maranhenses" are natural and with no buildings.
Yes.
Plot twist they abandoned it because they decided they are making "the world" on Mars instead ( disclaimer I have no proof of this actually happening yet but possibly in the future pls dont shoot me FBI )
🔥❤️
Being a Dubai resident and watching this just doesn't excites me 🙄😩
Does thomas speak swedish?😋
Out of all the islands opened to the public is my country's island lol will if Lebanon is good at one thing it is at partying and receiving other peaple
Omg I learned about these in history. They’re an interesting and strange concept
Whait.. didn‘t you wanna go to europe?😂
I can feel that chairman’s power even just seeing him on video. He just gives out a dif vibe.
The title should be "Thomas lives like a Kardashian for a day."
Always wanted to visit, but In the back of my mind, I’d be worried about accidentally braking some law and getting trapped in Dubai.
Dude was so rich that he was casually wearing an AirPod just because
Awesome vid,come to Delhi soon not right now but in not so distant future
The logistical nightmare building this island would be unimaginable! I'd like to know how they built it.
Who ever reads this please know: You have so much potential inside you.  You are beautiful and strong.  Have a wonderful day ❤️. Much love!🙏🏽
This was such a good video!!!
When I watch YesTheory I never skip the ads.
Hey,I am very fond of yes theory videos,but I feel lately there videos have become boring,is it just me☹️???
This is so clearly paid for
Back to great videos! Love it!
Still kinda confused on what’s the purpose of the islands
With all due respect, Dubai’s city planning commission is just saying yes to anything at this point. Someone build another Gundam there so we can have a Japan Vs UAE fight.
Come a long way from serving cake. 😂
The entire time I was watching this I thought wow, this is the kind of stuff I want to do with my life, traveling to beautiful islands and seeing amazing things. Great work on the video!
I have both the shirts matt and Amar are wearing, I love the shirts
That looks fun
No way Susan actually commented on this video
I miss these travel videos, keep it up. Not about the views, it's about the journey you're taking, the video is a +
This put me in sutch a good mood, can't exmplain why it just did!!
One of the main reasons most the islands is empty because its a risky investment. there a chance the island will sink in few decades
Ahhhh yes Dubai...The land of Crazy Expensive Luxuries.
You guys are absolute legends. I love the channel so much❤️
I love you Dubai so much 😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
i'm so proud for being Emirati
that’s actually insane, the chairman is so well spoken :]
How was this possible during corona
God diggity damn
I don't understand, how do they power everything? Is it wind powered or how do they bring power to it?
you should make turbans with "Sikh Discomfort" on them. i'd buy one
This place is amazing and that it is eco friendly makes it even more beautiful. Thanks for this great video!
It is amazing how they are recycling so much on the island
Seek discomfort! Find your destiny!
Thomas: Bamboo Chairman: Baambuu
Great vid! Stay health! Mask up everyone!!
This is the coolest, best YouTube video I have ever watched
Me living in dubai and always saying that i have no where to go to have some fun then i watch this video
im s🍑less
Yes theory's loaded to put out a yt ad on their own video
Always wondered what those islands where
The bracelet doesn't fit me
Dubai knows how to get attraction towards them
All this  chef knew was that Americans like hamburgers, pizza and they like to eat a lot. He felt pitty so added a salad.
How were these islands even created?
I can't believe they created all those islands. We were there in Dec and we no idea all this was built. Quite amazing!
Dubai is Bucket List for Sure.
the whole thing looks like a construction site to me, not "paradise"
yes pls
Not cool... That was a proposition of mine for the internship
Looks like a build server on rust 🤣
these videos need to be like an hour ago!
It's so clear that this is all paid for by Dubai
Such a cool guy I hope to go there in my life
Remember watching this channel with "just" a few 100k subs. Now almost 6 million!
i loved the energy these people provided. amazing hospitality. amazing video. one day i’ll visit
Oh my gosh your hair looks amazingly good!!!
i saw these on tiktok and i was wondering about them for so long needless to say im SUPER HYPED TO WATCH <33
rising water levels, pollution but no water flow, big maintaining costs, islands fading after a couple of years,...
Maybe just aknowledge that half of the COUNTRY the netherlands is man made
That is crazy
*ZA WARUDO*
wow, definitely feeling discomfort! This video is one big advertisement, sandwiched between more advertisement. not sure the world needs this at the moment, but for sure a good way to make money.
New Zealand doesn't exist according to them
so fucking cool !! 1st visitor!!
lebanon always partying
You seek discomfort in the strangest place’s
this is actually so sick
I knew about the islands before but didn't actually think that anything was happening on them I thought they were like almost completely abandoned. Always thought they were cool tho and a great idea just sad about the economy, kinda hope that things pick up would love to visit some day!
wow!!
I could spend hours just looking at Dubai and what it holds
The guy which made this is unbelievable, when he talked on camera u can see how much he care about the planet. Thanks yes theory to let us see this, its so amazing ❤️❤️
Yes theory has really made me realize how beautiful and wonderful the world is
The ammount of work and effort Yes Theory put into their videos is so mindboggingly breathtaking. Every single one of your videos is a huge inspiration to me!
Climate change and sea level rise: “am I a joke to you?”
Exploring empty Island... wait, what?! 🤔
H
10:44 am i tripping? who's cameraman is that in the window
Matt will you come to isreal on this journey
As always top notch content! Also huge respect for pushing the eco friendly movement forward by making those changes to the new seek collection!
i hope they can make the most out of this project in the future. those islands are amazing and they really gave a lot of thought into that!
Does like no one realize that he legit just met a very important person ?!??!? THE FRIKIN GUY WHO MADE THE ISLANDS...
Its great how the creaters of this want to make something really cool but help fix the environment while there at it
I appreciate Seek Discomfort trying to be more environment friendly but, these islands are a great example of how humans are trying to alter the Earth and the environement. This shit is gonna get us all killed someday. IF we somehow survive climate change.
I would by seek discomfort merch but I'm a broke high-school student
So what will Happen If the water Level Rises ?  They probably have answer for that . Those Islands are amazing
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Aww I missed these type of videos, specially the ones by Thomas! Such a great story teller and soothing voice!
How long will you be in Dubai
So what happened to Sweden?
Another banger, whatsup yea theory fam. I finally got out of my comfort zone and made a youtube if you could check it out that would be great thanks!
Fffffff I want to see you please see this I love you are you still in Dubai I have been watching you for 2 years no joke Make a meet and greet best ting I'm 12  And I love your videos I want to see you See this please much love
Great to see you out there in the world making new memories!
“During the pandemic, you can’t travel”  Thomas: “Hold my flight ticket”
How about you come to the actual lebanon🙃
this was absolutely insane
Where did they get all the sand to make them?
New Zealand left off a map again, not mad just disappointed
I don't know about you but it doesn't seem like Thomas is seeking discomfort on his own private island
Do u realise the YouTube channel YouTube is fake
Wait what? We can just create land?!?
I cannot put into words how much i love these people. Every video it's a art of its own.
Next time you're in Dubai! We have to meet up so that you can see the amount of underground artists in the UAE and how the music scene is on the rise! Much love guys!
missed these kinds of videos from you guys
I’m from Israel and I’ve always watched videos and read about the uae and Dubai and wished I could go there, now with the peace deals I think this is the first video of the uae I watched after they got signed and now I realized I can actually go there (once corona is over) so this was really cool
I love love the message that you guys are spreading ❤  it gives so much positivity because of how genuine and inspiring you guys are. BTW those islands look so scary and empty 🤭 can't wait to visit them once they're done and ready though, they will look insane 💘 xx
lol I live in Dubai and I saw him
Hang Son Doong in Vietnam is the largest known cave in the world,the three-million-year-old river cave is easily one of the most beautiful places on Earth.  It would make an awesome video you should definitely do it! Like this so he’ll do it.
uhhmm like next time take us with you ;D , very jelly
My heart was pounding while watching this whole thing. No other videos make me react that way. I love you guys
Well.. when the world sea level is rising, these islands really does`nt seem like a livable and sustainable places to stay even in 10 years from now. Even tough the video was enjoyable to watch, I couldn`t get over the reality check how incredible short-sighted and wasteful it is to build there even though listening to "solving all the problems" part which one can certainly appreciate and look for the bigger picture.
*Goes to Dubai* Asks: can i- Response: no
You guys do the COOLEST shit
This is what I call a proper Yes Theory video!😊😍
papyrus font yeah? 🤣
The world islands. Great video!!
3:00 Also please don't forget to climate offset all of your flights and past flights! And please talk more about how we, the viewers can help the climate, that would help a lot!
Just wow
yall really used papyrus for that title frame? hahah
Why keeps this dude talking about how good their recycling system is, im sure it was a a complete catastrophe for the whole ecosystem to build those islands and to build a wall around it...
There wasn't much discomfort in this video lol :)
Welcome to asia 🌍🌏
That is amazing
Just like James Bond in you only live twice, if you know you know
omg this video literally made me cry because it reminded me just how much i miss and want to travel and see the world. Aslo my architecture heart is freaking out rn!
I love this video. It shows that covid is not the end.
I can't imagine how crazy polluting these islands must be.
So he stayed in Dubai for a couple of days and gets a private island and I am still waiting for my island
just ordered a couple things, and am sooo excited! the bracelt that came free looks so dope too. i hope you guys realize how much you are actually genuinly helping people. fear is GOOD!
He came looking for copper and found gold
Yes!!! Back with amazing content!
Paused at 2:35 to order my "Do it scared" hoodie. I love you guys!
Next time just go to Flevoland
That Giro copter is probably the coolest shit I’ve ever seen
Guys should have visited Mo vlogs to help with getting some access to things
Lebanese people watching this👉
I found out about these islands a year ago and it was sincerely the first thing that fascinated me this much. Had forgotten a bit about them and this video just made me appreciate them even more. It's for sure on my travel list. Thank you yes team for reminding me how amazing this world truly is❤️
high tide??
Wow that is insane! Funny how the chef made you burgers and a pizza though 😂
This is one way to proof that you can do anything if you really want to and keep going for it. Really love seeing this motivation.
This was beautiful to watch <3
If only jump boost was real we could jump between islands.
Awesome video! I’ve been intrigued by those islands for a while. What an amazing journey you are on.
Can we just take a moment to appreciate the cinematography in this video 😍
R U american citizen?
YouTube Algorithm yesterday: Let's show her a documentary of the man-made islands off the coast of Dubai.  YouTube Algorithm today: Hey! Yes Theory visited the man-made islands off the coast of Dubai!  I swear YouTube is psychic.
dude, your hairs??? whats wrong with them:)
Bro when where u in Dubai? You Still here in UAE
:48 flat earth proven
Fun to see and I'm sure to stay at but unfortunately the construction of these islands and the palm as well was very destructive to marine habitats and coral reefs as well as contributing to erosion on the coast. So any talk of sustainable waste management is hugely overshadowed by the negative environmental impact of the islands construction.
0:14 Woah that view with the skyscrapers in the background is something crazy next level, like from another planet :o
"Lebanon Island"... cut to chicks dancing in bikinis..."Seems like my best option" LOL agreed. Also, the people in Dubai are so welcoming and accomodating. Awesome.
what about the netherlands building half of our country out of sea
We should be aware of how many stacks of sand they used. must've been at least 2 inventories full!!  on the real, sand is not a limitless resource and its vital to the environment they're in. Yes there's a lot but bro people die for sand no cap. Not complaining, just raising awareness!
I live here in dubai I love to do skydiving with you . This is biggest wish . I wanna meet you . Can i please bro
All that desalination, those boats, and the building of fake islands is GREAT for the environment I’m sure.
Sorry dude, but if you were really trying to be environmentally friendly, you wouldn't be flying all over the planet, especially in first class lmfao
nice vid. keep up the good work
Can’t wait for the Irak videos!
i missed them so much! i just find myself always smiling while watching their videos! I'm so happy that they're back! :)
The chairman didn't seem stressed for how few guests he got on his islands
They literally are making heaven
This video was so cool
Here before 100 000 views
Waste of money. World is big enough and we are not running of space so why build artificial island? There must be benefit and purpose to invest time and money but i guess dubai people just dont care.
Please check out Inaccessible Island too ☹️
You should check out Masdar City which only runs on renewable energy it is located in the  neighbouring City Abu Dhabi.
COVID exists BTW.
Holy land
Oh my fucking god, just imagine living in that house, eating whatever you want, swimming without anyone watching, leaving the other things aside like society and all, this place is a heaven for introvert billionaires provided you get internet as good as other things.
Been living in Dubai for 8 months. Didn’t know this existed
You guys are so sick, good to have you back and to hear Thomas' commentary voice lol😂
The pool is literally a few steps away from the ocean... why...
8th wonder of the world?
How do they manage waste water and electricity?
boring
Finally !!! Been wondering if someone was going to check that place out
Isn't that island that in one of video challenge mrbeast video ?
as much as i loved the video, i think you should've also explored the environmental impacts of making these things of which there are a lot
I am jealous
More eco friendly.  Goes to Dubai by plane.    Hmmm
I love the travel videos.. the fake challenges and stuff are boring
Wear a mask babe 🥰
Amazing 👏
what a life you live
They should populate each island with its respective member of society ... that be pretty cool I think
where does the electricity comes from
I’m impressed how self sustainable it is with processing organiz waste
Million dollar villa, gas station food.
No one talks about how much these islands destroy the environment?
Meanwhile Tommy and Cam naked in the desert lol
Wow! They really thought about everything!! Hahah American food for a European
would like to go there too :)
I am 18 right now and by the time I am 30 I will have enough money to pimp out at this place and hopefully it'll be fully done,
Ngl if i had an entire private island for myself or had the possibility to spend one night there. I’d probably be naked all the time
Really lam so excited for you back.
@Thomas : I would highly recommend that you watch this documentary 'Sand Wars' [EN] ("Le sable : enquête sur une disparition" [FR]). I am concerned because the video doesn’t show what the 'real' cost of building artificial islands is. Contrary to what we think, sand is not unlimited. The construction of those islands in particular did more bad than good. The building process is far from ecofriendly. Also, you are talking for the first time about your brand Seek Discomfort being environmentally conscious and friendly. It looks like the message you want to deliver is disparate from the message you show to everyone.
Me thinking he would be in a tent on a empty island
I’ve seen these islands in tik tok on like google earth and stuff. I never knew what they were actually all about this is so freakin cool!
Most used word in this video "pool"
It's so funny seeing you guys promoting yourself being all eco friendly while also promoting artificial islands and Dubai that was built using oil money, you know, the stuff that makes the earth warm-up? The process of creating artificial islands is detrimental to sea life and reefs. These guys are just trying to diversify their economy from oil because the dependence on oil is starting to be a problem for them, so they turn to banks and tourism. It's easy being optimistic about life when you're ignorant and just plain stupid. Not to mention that the video is just plain boring. Putting optimistic music over stuff is so cringe, just like most of your videos tbh.
Mrbeast @2050: Buys all these islands, giving it to random strangers 😏
God I miss travelling 🥺😩   I only heard about the world islands this year when I was fantasising about travelling again but never thought Yes Theory would take us on a personal tour. Thank you Thomas 🙌🏽
This is so amazing, just wanted to say that I love and apreciate your videos❤ You all taught me to dream and think big, I really look up to you. I am very thankfull for your content keep going and stay as unique as you are😊
Makes me sad af seeing ppl wearing muzzles
I wonder how these islands affect the environment
So cool vid... reminds me of the Tuvalu adventure, keep it up Thomas!
956th!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That is the best video ever about travel and exploring the unexplored! ❤️
Don't let Mr Beast come there
I need your help, guys. I discovered this channel on october 28th 2018. It was one of the best things I discovered on the internet. Ever since I saw that first video of the fake Justin eating a burito sideways, I fell inlove with how professional you guys were with your videos. I've tried so hard to contact you guys ever since but never managed to, I've sent dms and emails but i don't get any replies, but any how just wanted to say that Your videos have helped me understand my life more and more, but things aren't going well in my life lately. Since february this year I left My family from an island called san pedro to come visit my old home town in which I grew up in, but Since I came here I met this girl, and we dated. I managed to get a job with a low salary and planned to stay longer but time went by and I couldnt save to go see my family any more and the island was closed for visitors, so it wad difficult to go back. I would really love to see them again, but now I am filled with bills and dont have a job anymore and Im feeling so stucked, I will turn 19 next year but I am not happy... I recently lost so much this year, I lost my brother cause he was in a depression and cumitted suicide, and all this has left me with a broken heart and I lose faith day by day. I was hopeing if you guys could help my depressing life in some way
After years of supporting you guys I finally got some Seek Discomfort merch. So happy!
Having Dubai 10+ times over the last 15 years or so it's great to see the World being utilised. Having heard about the story before of why the Islands were never developed upon it's great to see a shift in thinking has allowed them to start building it out. Having spoken to people about it in the past the biggest issue they had was the water stagnating around the Islands. Really cool you got to go and visit be interested to see in like 10 years time how much more it's changed.
Woow. The cinematic Scenes of the city skyline at 7:00 gave me goosebumps😍
Nobody: Subtitles: "Hai, I am Hummus Bag..."
Wow i have so many questions. But first, did the islands feel artificial? i mean the sand and plants or it was like a real island? Did you see any kind of animals there? Birds, insects, spiders... I'm impressed with their methods that make the sand not going away with the sea currents, and i'm very interested about the interaction of actual natural creatures with this man made islands.
He said gyro copter in Arabic
Amazing job!
Interesting how you went to one of the most discriminating countries towards females in the world. And also have balls to give them cred for being so climate friendly... Dude you know the whole country, as well as those islands, are founded by oil money?
WOW lol can I have an island!?🔥
They could have used the money in a more charitable way, but naa they decided to bury the habitat and reduce the waters movement in that area (make stagnant water) just because they have the money to.  And they didn’t even get the houses built.  Such a weird project
YouTube has entered the chat
I’ve seen this on snap map. Omg.
2 hamburgers and a pizza? That's hilarious.
Wait, no mental breakdown from Thomas? Its a miracle!
Stop coping logan Paul's intros bumm.
Aww no Lexi 😭 why didn’t she go???
Too much of not wearing a mask.
Ahh man, honestly one of the best channels on YouTube! The production level to the overall message of the channel is just beautiful! Very inspiring to see what you guys have created.
6:55 That's screenshot worthy right there. Seriously, the shots you guys get when you go to these places are amazing.
MrBeast has thought you well in the art of titles and thumbnails 10/10
Thomas being Thomas at 11:22 😂😂
boujeeist. new word. LOL. I finally realized it was actually a french word.. I had a grandparent that called me that since i was a baby. Boujee.. never knew what it meant.
WHY. DIDN'T. YOU. WEAR. YOUR. MASK?
That is so cool
Dubai: Nobody ever reclaimed island the way we did The Netherlands (reclaiming land and islands since the 14th century): Let me introduce myself to you guys
Where’s your mask
This made me tear up, I'm proud to be part of this country and to show the world how we've developed over a small period of time. This is just a small part of it, there so much more to the UAE. Thank you Thomas, thank you yes theory.
why he got the nissan silvia logo around his neck
Not a *single bit of discomfort* in this episode!
I live in a magical sounding land that is partly made by man, it's under sea level. Over half of it I believe. It's crazy right, super developed people actually live on it. it's called the Netherlands. 😂 these islands are beautiful I really hope the tourists that will visit will not ruin it, and treat the island respectfully.
Just waiting for Iraq video to see what unfolds.
Great vid
I just got a seek discomfort ad in the middle of this video
Hey guys,  I'm colorblind and I want to purchase the same colour of the T-Shirt at 14:01.  Can someone tell me which colour is it, please? Thanks!
respect to Neo for making these islands popular again 😆
You really should visit the actual Lebanon. The people are at peak discomfort after all that's happened to theme and they're still going. All the love let me know if you decide to visit i can help out.❤🙏🏻
haha i like how this video's title changed from "staying overnight.." to "exploring.."
C’mon people we can do it let’s get our boys  to 6million subs. We are almost there 🥰🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️❤️ you guys change people without even knowing love you guys a lot keep up the good work 😘❤️☺️🙌
Y'all's cinematography is amazing... One might say it's OutTa THiS WoRLd😂
Why are you not wearing a mask around everyone who is wearing a mask???
Poggers in chat
are these the Snapchat islands
This whole video is amazing ❤️❤️
Thats freaking cool, what a crazy opportunity
Pretty cool !  After being in Dubai,I can tell that you need some place to cool down and these islands are apparently that place :D   Nice Video Thomas !
I just saw Yes Theory ad on this video
it would have been nice if he visited abu dhabi because everyone outside only cares about dubai
The Dubai skyline at the end of your pool is so neat
Methane = poop gas ?😬
Honestly if he didn't go skinny dipping I'm disappointed haha.
Is there any chance of Yes Theory hiking the hardest part of the Appalachian Trail together?
okay maybe you dont want to wear a mask infront of the camera but the camera man having no mask on? rude and disrespectful
If only I could travel and get paid for it 😂
amazing to see you guys back, making creative videos even during times like this. cheers guys!!!
It’s just crazy how well this worked out for them
I'm not trying to be negative here, but what was the company's reason for traveling during a pandemic?
“Tik Tok continents”
On the extremely comfortable sweat shirt made of Cotten it says seek DISCOMFORT on it.  :/
I’m hoping I can rent out one on the island villas when I come to Dubai in December
A mukabang would not hurt Thomas.
did he really tried to sell us the idea that those islands are eco-friendly?
This is what you call, EU-FU,  money
Once the pandemic is over and COVID-19 has become less of a issue, Yes Theory should come to Africa and climb either Mt. Kilimanjaro or Mt. Kenya. Mt. Kilimanjaro is of course taller, but I would recommend Mt. Kenya since it is much cheaper and less guides and porters are required. Both mountains are equally challenging and equally accomplishing. However, in true Yes Theory fashion, they should convince a complete stranger, preferably a local, to join them on the spot and climb the mountain. 🏔
Where’s matts audio club 😞😞😭
I live in Dubai. Watching Yes Theory make a video in it makes me so happy.
Now you need to come to Lebanon the country not the island
Bruh I got a advert for seek discomfort clothing before this vid
Am I the only one surprised by the Arabs English
I got a seek discomfort add while watching this video 😂
As a European I have never been as confused as when reading "$13 Billion". In what world can that be read as 13-billion-dollar when the $ is written 2 words before it is actually read out????
Screw driver 😂😂
such a great vid. deserves more views..
SHOT IN THE DARK! Bro, I've recently moved out to Dubai. Love the videos you guys put out! if you're about still give me a shout. Say 'YES!'
What covid precautions are you guys taking during these travels? I'm genuinely curious lol
I mean, don’t get me wrong. All your videos are truly amazing. But I kinda miss those „asking strangers to do some random sh*t with us“ videos....
Dubai got it figured out, get our shit together murica’ 😂
Lol I realized I am wearing the same shirt as Matt
Apple every year: This is the best iphone we have ever created. Thomas in every video: This is the most unique place I've ever been to.
your videos never cease to amaze me, they just keep getting better and better!
Awesome video
Dubai also has man made palm looking islands.
Love how the title isn't "I explored the massive waste of money islands in dubai"
Did anyone else hear the mallu accent ?
yes  fam
Yes Theory: We're making the Seek Discomfort brand more eco-friendly. Also Yes Theory: Visits Dubai which is largely funded by oil sales.
I went to seek discomfort and wanted something, after being subscribed for awhile, a little embarrassing for me to say but I really cannot even afford a t shirt cos of the shipping unfortunately :/
As an introvert, I NEED this island in my life.   Love your vids :)
This is so cool🤩
>seeks discomfort  >travels businessclass
Hi I'm a resident of Dubai and this is really cool that you came here and made a video
I think they got payed by Dubai cuz the don't have any tourism any more
Missed you a lot  ❤️🇩🇪🇵🇰
Suggestion for the YES Theory team - maybe you guys can use a gender neutral terms like "human made" rather than "man made". I know it might not be a big deal but still it would be good. You guys inspire me, love your videos!
I would have loved to get more information about how they produce energy for example and what the future plans of the islands are!
8:00 I can’t be the only one shocked that he didn’t have an accent 😂
great video! really enjoyed it
Hiii! I'm sorry to bother you guys but I hope you can help me. My best friend's birthday is in one week, and I was wondering if you can maybe send her a video or voice message wishing her a happy birthday :) her name is Amarr and she really admires you!! Thank you! I hope you have a great week💛
Idk why i thought you'd just spend the night on sandy beach. And i got excited for that.
Very smart chairman
This architect like umm yes free publicity!
And there was me thinking he'd be on a small lump of sand trying to survive overnight. I thought this would be like the one where you left your mates in the desert.
Inspiring
Incredible production quality ..like if you agree !!
When a tsunami slowly rolls over every villa
You should go to the Chinese man made islands in the South China Sea lmao
Take a shot every time Thomas says “built out”
So I've been to Dubai like what ? 5 times ? Never heard of these islands before 🤦🏻‍♀️
Fyre Festival but make it more optimistic
what an experience!
Make more videos of these kind...
Yes Theory literally living my dreams for me. I don't know if I'll be able to do such traveling and stuff like they do in my life, but watching their videos always encourages me to live life to the fullest. Great content guys, cheers!
Yo Thomas i've been watching u guys since project 30 and i can only say that this video is really great and i believe people from Dubai are intelligent also. I can see a part of your journey starts and it's really cool, i'm happy and i can enjoy with you some things too. Keep up the real content !
How are y’all not at ten millions subs yet
This is what Fyre Festival wanted to be
When you have more cents than sense. The complete waste of money that these people are involved with is disgusting considering how many people are homeless or living below the poverty line.
The Chairman seems very wise
I'm from dubai so seeing this is normal
Is this place on Airbnb 😅
3 Fils spotted
I’m early
Next up to to egypt new capital  Bigger than singapore Will have 6.5 million people in it and the tallest building in Africa and the first smart city in Africa  Also el alamein in egypt is like the islands project but on a bigger scale
I can´t watch Yes Theory anymore, cause it reminds me of the fact that I can´t travel at the moment. Then I get bumed out AF
I love these  weekly post!!!
Well that was one of best videos on your channel i hope you can do more luxorious trips like that big👍
Few youtube channels can make me watch their videos with a full smile on my face and legitimately happy that Yes Theory is growing more and more every day. Love you guys, seek discomfort as a way of life!
Man, you're livin!
This Chanel has inspired my to seek my own discomfort. I'm someone who needs to plan ahead, needs to know where I'm going, needs to follow directions when driving. So I've decided that on spring break 2021, I will be getting in my car from Los Angeles and driving without directions for at least 6 hours. Don't know where I'll end up, but I'm going to get a hotel when I get there and spend time exploring a city. I'm waiting for spring break so I can save money for a hotel and for C-19 to calm down (I hope). Thank you for encouraging me to push myself out of my comfort zone!
I was literally thinking about these islands two days ago wondering what they were for.. it would be so cool to visit there one day in the future
Dubai did a uno reverse card: "Seek Comfort"
Where's the old Yes Theory spirit? Of doing casually new scary "yes-ey" things...
Finally there is a new video featuring Thomas Brag 😍 My very first video of Yestheory was the one about Thomas traveling to Bhutan. I loved Thomas’s storytelling and his soothing voice so I clicked to watch more and got to know about the YesTheory channel and the philosophy behind it and ended up binge watching all the episodes in just couple of days😁 I am currently back home and just like Thomas Brag I can’t return to the country of my last residence for visa reasons. Anyways I am enjoying time spent with family and would be more happy if I could find yesfam in Almaty, my hometown in Qazaqstan. Cheers to the global YesFam community 🌎🌏🌍
Wooow   finaaaallyyyyyyy ❤❤❤❤
You also have to check the province of Flevoland out in the Netherlands, it is entirely made up from reclaimed land and 70 years ago it didn't exist
You should make a collab w Kelly wakasa he matches ur energy
15:33 what happend to your hair?
6:06 I doubt it's hard to maintain, it's all sand and building
This season is gonna be amazing!!!
I love how enthusiastic the creator was to make it sustainable. A joy to see
The bromance in the beginning
I've always seen these islands on google maps but was always confused
Video officially starts at 3:06
The only thing I want more than the life Yes Theory leads, is a family of friends that love eachother the way they do :,)
Amazing video! Oh and while you are at it , check out love lakes... also very magnificent view and sunset is amazing ;)
I was there at the same time you were there in I was in g19 the only complete private island  Edit: it’s the only island you didn’t film it was in the original photo of the islands
Lit video
Little shocking that they gave you a personal chef and that's what he made you to eat, wtf !!?? 😂 and in Dubai,  it's even Worse
Love these type of vids you guys do, (traveling etc) not “naked for 24 hours”🤦‍♀️
You kinda look like a wish.com Justin Bieber
i find it sooo fascinating how they desalinate their own water considering how expensive and tedious it is. that’s incredible. if i ever get married i wanna come here for my honeymoon 😂
How do they get electricity and running water and gas on the islands?
This was a great vid
6:25  Most of the islands gonna be underwater in 10-15 years.
Just bought a sweatshirt from the drop, so excited to wear it when it arrives!! Also, I loved the video and keep up the good work. We love you guys <3
Yes Theory uploading a travel video makes me feel like the world is slowly going back to normal!! Great video Thomas!! <3
All the Israelis watching knowing that they finally can go there 😂
It's definitely a different culture. But the decadence and the fact that you won't see the things that are wrong in that society, wouldn't make me feel comfortable.  So it's not a place I would likely visit.
How much was Thomas paid to say all this?!? 🤦🏼‍♂️
Fyre fest vibes
I love your videos guys!
yall r cool
You shoulda wore a mask to the second village my dude
Yay yes theory!!! I want to see the trio do some crazy stuff again please! We love you! Soon 6m❤
Yay yes theory!!! I want to see the trio do some crazy stuff again please! We love you! Soon 6m❤
Airport security like you from yes theory go ahead on through I won’t check ya lol 😂
Yes!
So Cool bro
I live in Dubai.
Thomas come on ur not an american wear your mask ! Pleaseee!
Man, I wanted to buy the merch but the currency difference makes it way too costly for me to buy it. @yestheory
I literally got your seek discomfort  holiday drop ad in the beginning of this video. ✌ so accurate advertising.
Link to the World Islands hotel please! December is next month.
Anyone know the name of the song at 5:23
I got a seek discomfort ad before the video. Wow
Omg I got a seek discomfort ad in front of this video like if you did too! That’s crazy!
0:43 myhotsisters.com
Thomas the craziest thing is I was literally researching these islands today and you released this video. Life is so weird
Do they ship merch to South Africa
These were mostly made because the new leader of the OAE is not very eager on him having a fully oil dependant economy, so selling luxury climated land it his plan for the future.
POGCHAMP DRAIN GANG
Thomas please come to Abu Dhabi 🙏
I've always loved Thomas he looks alot like me and reminds me of myself.i love seeing him make his own vids on this channel.great work yes theory!!
Watch drew binsky latest video with thomas! Its worth it!
i love your hoodies but you do not have my size
fucking sick cinematography well done
Wow 😳 that flying vehicle 🙄😌😌😌😁😁
This place looks awesome! I'm defintely going there next time I travel to Dubai. Would be a perfect place for a honeymoon with my future wife sometime in the future as well :)
Traveling in covid 19 ok spearder
Get Amar one of these islands so he can start building his own City like he always dreamt
I want the chairman to tell me stories every night before bed!😂 love his voice
Places (uae related) I would suggest are Masdar city(eco-friendly), and the three stolen islands!
This video is more abut Seeking Comfort than discomfort but whatever
seek discomfort from your first class plane seat
Amazing video, I love Dubai!! Hopefully I can visit the islands one day. 🏝🖤
While it admittedly would have been cool to see this project completed, the 2008 financial crash and now covid-19 makes these kinds of tourist attraction less and less feasablie. It would have been really awesome to be able to boat between islandsm resorts and attractions.
Im just here looking for Dutch people talking about "Flevoland" ;)
Why do i feel like little by little each new video is a step closer to inviting me into a cult
.
Well, west word it is.
thomas is rich!!!!
Man, I have always wondered about those island. I just straight up thought they would always be empty. Glad to have learned something new and I hope things go well for them in December!
You went waaaayyyy out of your comfort zone on this one. ;)
You should have tried to find Hassan!!!!!
Amazing place, but I think Lexie is still ahead
never been this early ever since dad left to buy milk
12:35 the dutch did :) (or tried, I dont know if it was that much) sorry, just needed to say that as a dutch person :)
I live in dubai
You know youve completed real life when u literally build a smaller version of the whole world in the ocean.
the islands were a complete failure but over the years it seems like there might be some light there... they look cool tbh
thank you very much for coming back with a new video........love you all
Seek Comfort in Dubai
Yes theory finally posted a video in my cityyyyy😍.
I'm not hating but that screwdriver joke was kinda cringe even the creator of the islands cringed😂😂
love to see it!!
Thomas what is your tshirt size. It fits you properly. I think we have the same size.
Seeking discomfort in Dubai is hard.
Can I get my comment pinned? Yes theory?
I knew about the islands and asked my mom she said it's empty but that's maybe because she checked it out years ago. That's good to know that they are constructing on it
YES A NEW VID LETS GOOOO LEEP IT UP GUYS!!!!
I will remember yes theory whn I stay there ❤️
Did he even go back to Sweden lmao
Ayyy seek discomfort shop!!
Thomas!!
Please seek discomfort in my words: how is this world island project environmentally friendly? IT IS ALL THE OPPOSITE! Total BS and marketing...
no one:  Thomas: ... and there’s a POOL
That is so cool, a real life master roshi island
I just got a seek discomfort ad watching this video lol
Not gonna lie I think the best part of this video. Was the chairman talking about the recycling methods they developed on the island!
Have been loving Thomas's videos recently, such a great vlogger! :D
i cannot wait for all the new videos to come
Wow
As a Dutchman I approve. Nice job dubay! 😂
They paid YT to ad their own seek discomfort merch on their own video 🧐! What's going on..!
Jami
I love your work, never stop doing this
You can actually see how much effort it takes em to make a single video.. Beautifully made and beautiful editing and also relaxing music just love these guys ❤
Another amazing video!!
Thomas looking mighty handsome here
Got an ad for the seek discomfort drop while watching this video.
Wow/how!?❤❤❤😍😍😍
Can you guys expand on how they are going to work  with the rising of the ocean?
Amazing
Island hopping just got a lot better 🏝
What a banger
This is awesome
glad to see you've enjoyed Dubai <3
Wow such an amazing experience I’d like to try in the future 😻 I didn’t expect that on the island
The Yes Theory we want, the Yes Theory we deserve, Thank you Thomas 🙏
I don`t really get the idea behind being so aware of composting and garbage recycling and then give the world such a negative impact of building dozens of islands in the middle of the water.... Am i the only one who is thinking about all the little animals in the sand, and all the gas that got burned up,  while creating that place ?  Why can`t they  be happy and evolve what they got at the coast or around Dubai ?
loved everything about the video except the use of Papyrus in the title card
Sunscreen on
Seek discomfort huh?
$13B?! 😱
Sorry was I meant to get a seek discomfort add in the middle of the video-
That water is calling my name! 💙
The title made it seem you were going to spend the night at one of the islands that had nothing but sand. Lol. Still awesome video
Dubai is freaking amazing
Wow
I wouldn't even sleep that night if I got a chance like that haha
Creating real estate... nothing smarter than that
Luv from Dubai
Bruh I wished I went with my dad when he went there to work
Finally thomas cameback❤
this is INSANE. I hope I can go there one day!! Love the video!
So this is an Ad for Island World and Yes theory put their ad on this video. So I just watched an Ad with an Ad on an ad
That’s a wow!
Finally we can listen to their travel adventures again, thank you yes theory for making us feel great!
That's so cool!
Dude the fact that they only need to ship out glass, nit and plastic is insane
Wow, this video was worth the wait.
If they are composting, why are they sending the grass out?  Grass clippings are supposed to be good source of organic compost?
You guys should expand your sizes to 3 XL :)
Would have been great to self-isolate/social distance on one of these islands!
This is the number of people who think Yes Theory is absolutely AWESOME!
A dream!!!
Dude i just got an ad of your merchandise
yes, i love that you make your clothes sustainable. Thank you .
woah, I got a Yes theory Ad before Yes theory's video and I got an Ad on Instagram too!!
They should’ve planted grass.
I just want to hug the chairman and thank him for doing it right.
You've done a good job of marketing positivity but how is clothing merch "a source of positive change around the world"?
I got the merch ad...did you?
Not bad at all 👍
Even after living in Dubai for 10 years I still have no idea why they built that
The CEO really sees far into the future wow maybe that is why he is so successful!
Is the water completely safe to swim in? Or does the construction and making of the island make it risky?
welcome to Dubai
Great place to make a porno
Been living in Dubai for years. The world islands still baffle me!
This was awesome, a lot more than I expected to be out there.   Literally my thought every time I visit some place I’ve never been 😂
#ad
Im here living in Dubai, heard of this islands but still very curious about it. It gives me goosebumps watching this! 👏👏👏
If you want to experience human decadence at its finest, just visit Dubai.
yesss!!
Idk but this time the video felt like an ad for the island.
Talking about their environmentally friendly drop, while visiting the most environmentally harmful project of today... that’s sadly ironic
you have to change the slogan of this episode to "seek comfort"
Nice to see you on the road again, great video.
The first things I did after waking up today were - hop online and pick up a rad Seek Discomfort essential hoodie, and watch Thomas live my dream life! lol. One day, I'll get there, too.
Thomas, very laxed with the mask wearing...?
I'm so jealous 😉❤
I love you guys, wanted to get one of the essentials seeker sweatshirts but the shipping to UK is $16 😭😭
You claim to be environmentally conscious, yet you're frequently flying around the globe to showcase those projects that have a dramatic ecological footprint. So, are you at least offsetting your flights?
i’ve seen a tik tok on these and i wanna go SOOO BAD!!!
I came up this really good idea for a 24 hour challenge for you guys to seek discomfort and help with the environment. This is an issue that most people don’t worry about or care about because the problem really isn’t claimed by any country so they don’t care to fix it as they have so many other problems to deal with. Even though It is one of the main reason all these countries are sinking.
I love the way the chairman explains himself about the island. I guess he truly wanted this before the end. We need more of him explaining or maybe a better interview.
Lol! Got an ad for the seek discomfort drop in the video
As a Pakistani yes theory fan living ~in~ near Dubai, I feel very happy that u got to explore my country of residence. May the future adventures be tremendous as they come :)
Is just me or this islands are just boring?
Finally, not nude
I got a seekdiscomfort ad when i opened the video, how fitting.
Video was interrupted by a seekdiscomfort ad
You need to go to Lençóis Maranhenses in Brazil. The landscape is crazier than these islands.
I got an Yes Theory ad before watching it
This video just left me so happy.
You guys made yourselves kings of the world...
It's making worried that everyone else has mask on and he dosent
This Place Looks so sad
I honestly loved the way you do your videos;not only do you show the place and what it has to offer, but you explore every bit of detail and I feel like this is what makes the possibilities endless for reasons people should explore, or even seek discomfort!!
Hey yes theory, big fan, from DUBAI! Have a nice stay in dubai man!
There's just something about Yes Theory's videos that is therapeutic and calming.
Love the actual advert haha amazing
Thomas "I'm just going home" Brag
Quick facts: Half of uae was donated from Oman to uae By al-sultan qaboos (RIP)
My boy’s flying first class! Well done - cool to see the journey from broke to this 👊🏻
Woahhhhhhhhh
Just hearing thomas say lebanon makes me happy❤️🇱🇧🇦🇪
Now this is a good video
So um, won’t climate change swallow those islands, oof.
I always miss out on meeting you guys every time you're in Dubai. One day hopefully, I'll see you guys around.
Hold up they made an add for the video? Hahaha what
Did they consider global warming?
it feels like the TV show 3% soo much it's kind of scary
my broke self looking at the new SEEK CONNECTION knowing I can't buy it!!!!!!
Yes Theory is my dream job
Broooo I got an actual youtube seek discomfort ad
Hi I love your vids!!
LIKE
"Nobody build something like this.." Laughs in Dutch..
Did I really just get a seek discomfort ad on your own video?
I legit watched a video about this earlier today... what the..
Dubai be living in 2030 lol
When you have money man...but in all seriousness. This is amazing! I love how they are also eco-friendly!
i just got an ad and it ended up being u guys
legend says its hard to get a like from @yestheory.....is it false?
Those islands were Oman but oman donated it to uae
Lexie : I'm the Youngest to travel to every  country in the World  Thomas : I'm the First to travel to the World Islands  What a Couple 💛
Great video! Love you Thomas & the entire group!
Nice
You make and sell clothing  to respect the earth. But you go to that part of the world that produce huge amount of oil 🛢    Make no sense to me.  You need to se the bad side of dubai. The one they hide. Belive me its there. I've been there. And I will never come back.
Dubai is really a different world 😍
🙌🙌🙌💗
Imagine buying a property on those island and it is still now finished... scam.
had a smile on my face throughout the whole video, so glad you’re posting again ❤️
YES BACK TO THE BEST VIDEOS
no you guys are lying you have a problem
All i can say is damn😏 🔥
I got a Seek Discomfort ad on Yes Theory Video itself - that is what we call recycling at its best!
Stop virtue signalling. Other than that, great video.
This is insane 😍🔥
Thank you, Thomas, for this amazing virtual scape :)
I love Yes Theory so much, but I wish they actually talked about the economic hardship this architectural feat had. It is still considered one of the largest architectural failures of all time, in which we had a case study about it in undergraduate business class. They also had flooding and pollution problems to the mainland.
I love how 'Oh France? It's right around the corner' won't just be a pun anymore
Maybe the Dutch did this 50 years ago😅
looks like a mr beast challenge
I missed you guys videos. Great job
Oh wow I've never been one of the firsts.
410th person btw love the merch 👌
Nice.
I will be in one of your guys videos before i die
I was about to get one sweater, but I have no money for 16$ shipping to germany 😢
literally watched these out on google earth yesterday and wondered what these were.
You guys never fail to amaze me! The videos the brand everything! Amazing dudes, just amazing!⚡️❤️🤩
Almost at 6million keep going
Guys come to Oman
tell him to add a skate park and i’m there
when are the islands opening I'm getting a ticket
I used to live in uae for ten years (im 12)
this was so damn cool, what a genius way to reduce waste and recycle for resources
Must be uncomfortable 🥵 #seekdiscomfort
this is SO COOOOOOOOOOOL WTH O:
I got seekdiscomfort ads hahaha
Yes theory ad on yes theory video
The name of the island is Lebanon island now that Israel did peace more like Israel island am I right just kidding edit:(cringe)
WOAH I GOT A SEEK DISCOMFORT ADS IN THIS VIDEO 😂❤️🎉 BTW AWESOME ADVENTURE!!!
we miss you thomaaaas
Guys continue doing what you are doing Every video that you post is like a boost to push myself to the next day and head out there to SEEK DISCOMFORT  Lots and lots of love from India ❤ 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳♥
He look like justin bieber now
The chairman is also the CEO of the DPWORLD port authorities.
That was great! Thank you for the unique content, keep creating.
It’s so weird to watch seek discomfort ad before seek discomfort video 🥴
U guys are the best, after so long lucky to have u backkk❤️
I thank Youtube and Yes theory  For making me travel from confront of my couch
They are not just super rich, but they are very mart too. I really love how they care about the environment.
YES THEORY MAKES THE BEST VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE BY FAR
I just got a seek discomfort ad on my video
You guys just surprise me with every video, amazing! KEEP IT UP
I have one question is there internet
CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY THE SEEK DISCOMFORT MERCH HUHUHU😭 BUT EVEN THOUGH, I STILL LOVE YOU GUYS AND STILL HAPPY THAT I GOT TO KNOW THIS CHANNEL AND LEARN AND BE INSPIRED FROM IT💕 SENDING MY LOVE FROM THE PHILIPPINES💞
This is the coolest video I've ever watched on Youtube. Thank you for sharing!
Well, guess the other guys are punching the air right now.
Must be nice being that rich
I love Thomas's hair oml
Wise if i can get one of the seek discomfort shirt but I'm all the way in guyana
Miss these kind f videos from you guys. Awesome man 😊😊
Wish I could have met u... since I live in Dubai
this was so cool, i haven’t traveled since january and it’s kinda like i’m traveling through yes theory haha
Amazing video
It seems like the whole of yes theory have the same voice
Couldn't recognise you for couple of minutes because of hair 😂
Miss ya man!!!!
At first it was sad knowing that Thomas was leaving the USA, now I'm stoked because this is one of their coolest videos yet!
Public announcement: Yes Theory has stopped moving because that creates heat, and heat melts the poles. Lol.      Please no hate for the comment, it’s for the sake of comedy only. And yes this satirical.
you know you are big when the shek is your drover
Thomas is having the time of his life
Anyone else in Dubai was hoping to somehow run into Thomas in a random place--  but sadly it didn't happen xD
this is the dopest thing I've seen in a while
The islands being eco friendly is actually brilliant
When mankind puts their minds together, they can make beautiful things. This is one of them. How crazy is this
even the empty islands has a malayali in it . damn!
Thank you Yes Theory. Your videos always gives me goosebumps. Your channels spreads so much positivities and love! Another awesome video. Well done guys!
OMG HIIIII
That chef totally googled "what do americans eat"
ok you are rich
inspiring man!! great job!!
Just Got an seek discomfort add on this video
I literally got an yes theory ad before the exact same  ad in the Video 😂😂
You are truly honoured to be the first guest of the resort..... did you go skinny dipping ...:)
that looks absolutely amazing 😍 i would love to live there
I just love that they put their own ad on their own video. 🔥
Why on earth would you pay for an add on your own video?
Mom I want to travel the world  Mom: we have the world at home *the world at home*
Now this is epic
woah.just take care of yourself thomas
Seek Discomfort 🔥 Keep it coming 🔥
this was a cool video but i'd hate for Thomas to be the reason covid is introduced to this remote island loll That guys wearing medical mask and sunglasses for most of the video, he ain't tryna get it
Isn't it sad that other people are living your dream 😔
I would feel so lonely. It may be a luxurious private island, but traveling without a friend would be a no for me lol
No one appreciated T boogie's screwdriver joke  Here is the laugh that u really deserve 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Thomas, you really should be wearing a mask while out in public.
Funny, watching a Yes Theory video and get the new merch drop add :) <3
damn Dubai is on a whole other level.
it’s hard seeing ppl out there living ur dream
Just ordered my first ever seek discomfort apparel for Christmas!!
How long are you in Dubai?
Finally, I could watch the latest video after knowing yes theory channel during quarantine.
The Megastructure show on the Palm Island is a super interesting watch.  This only heightens my desire to go and visit Dubai!
dubai is really amazing, i can't imagine actually being there an experincing what you're doing
“I thought coming out here would help me clarify things but now I’m just more confused” lmaooooo that was great
I live there
I read about these projects 3 months ago
They brought you all the ‘American’ food 😂
Yes reality
Dubai really out here being innovative.
I love this video!!! This is so coollll
This places kinda looks like the Lençois Maranhenses here in Brazil, but ours is a desert with lakes not islands, pretty cool
Dubai looks so bootiful!! 😷
literally 1 minute ago and it felt like i was with Thomas traveling Dubai 😂❤️ Had fun
Yayy I missed the travel vids
I am excited for all the new adventurous videos. !!!
Getting Merch now
I would work whole my life just to buy a island, and would stay till death after my retirement
So cool
12:33 netherlands flevoland😂
I got an youtube ad for seek discomfort before the video😂 topic next time: how to hack the YouTube algorithm
If you think that's impressive, you havent seen Flevoland
🤩🤩🤩
Omg so beautiful I’d like to go someday!
Go to Serbia next please
I wish lexie was there with you man
That’s so awesome!!! I do wish I could go

Salute to the chairman❤ so humble 🙏
Dope
It’s like one of those ideas you would do in one of your dreams but they acc did it! The only sad thing is how bad they probably were for the environment :(
Alexa, define decadence
First time this early
Wow that was amazing places..
11:25 guy was SO unimpressed by the screwdriver joke
This is so cool, but one question - what’re they gonna do about climate change and rising sea levels??
When did u come Dubai lol visit me
literally if i could afford to buy everything off the seek discomfort site i would. its all my style and its so comfortable and amazing. wearing a piece of seek discomfort makes me feel more connected to the community and meaning behind yes theory and seek discomfort. i highly recommend to anyone that hasn't gotten anything that can afford to.
I CLICKED ON THIS VID AND UR AD CAME UP BE4 IT XDDD
Private chef? man they just ordered u takeaway lmao
I absolutely love Thomas' hair in the intro!
I already love you guys so much but the fact that you're making more sustainable efforts makes me so happy! And in general I don't like the idea of Merch but you guys are such an exception.  Your message is incredible and life changing.  Thank you for doing what you do!
dude's got nice hair
I wana be the camera man for free travel
Congrats bro
I wish he asked what the chairman's intentions and goals were in creating the islands. I wonder what he envisions it to be and look like ultimately.
Bro your hair Haha I aspire for that!
Love how they just skipped Iceland🥺
YES
Y’all’s videos are the best!!
I can't believe I lived in Dubai for 7 years and never realised how complex these islands are!
Seeing a new Yes Theory video notification made my day!
Nice to hear your voice in a full length video bro..after very long time
Thomas is back with some INSANE editing! Who else missed his narrating voice? ☝🏻
WHOEVER sees this Have a good day :)
How does this work with sea level rising?
Hey there, thank you for watching :) I've really missed making videos consistently so I'm very happy to be back. I'm sure this year has had so many ups and downs for all of you as well so I hope to share some positivity through these stories I've captured. This is the first one out of my trip and I've got plenty more coming your way. Let me know what you think in the comments and I'll see you again soon
I have a feeling that the guide is a mallu.
Oh Wow! I guess rich people does unnecessary crazy things
who else got the seek discomfort ad  before the vid
"It has a pool"  wow, amazing
Anyone get a seek discomfort ad? (I didn't skip it)
That guy he saw in the airport seemed so wholesome
Mlayaleesss
I mean no need to flex but i can literally walk outside and see these sights
I get that you guys are just a bunch of idiot 'bros' but do you have any idea what you are helping fund by bringing tourism dollars to the UAE?   https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2019/country-chapters/united-arab-emirates#  https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/rape-victim-dubai-united-arab-emirates-uae-extra-marital-sex-report-detained-dubai-police-charity-a7422326.html
dayumn, I got so early here
WHOEVER READ THIS. you haven't watched the whole video yet
I got a seek discomfort ad before this video. That is a lot of coincedence!
U guys are awesome!!!
Y’all are still underrated. Thanks you for all the content that y’all make, keep it up! 😎👍🏼
I AM SO EARLY
That would be an amazing experience 😍
Please, don't visit Dubai / UAE and support a country that violates human rights
Thomas’ hair is looking fire tho
Let’s go Thomas is back
8:59 "this is pretty liveable to me, there's a pool"😂😂
Is the seek discomfort ad at the start of the video purposely put there? I didn’t know you could run specific ads
Man made islands? im coming from the netherlands that is like 25% man made
That why he is in drew binsky videos
Ah i know that place, it was a disaster
The cameraman not getting to be the other first  person:👁👄👁
LMAO
Who else got a add from yes theory
*That’s a WOW*
too bad they use slavery to build stuff in dubai google it
Cool
Damn, i'm so early that there aren't even good comments!
"This looks pretty livable to me. There's a pool!" Ah yes, only the necessities
Your ad, played on your video...
The curls look nice
while you were talking about seek discomfort merch i literally got an email about the 1st holiday drop lol what are the odds EDIT: and i got a seek discomfort add on this video?? what
Yes theory!!!
I love when they have unplanned encounters with Yes Fam on their journey's
Guys can we just appreciate Thomas' voice. SO soothing.
🙌🙌🙌🙌 for the environmentally friendly choices!!!! 💚💚💚💚
Dubai is beautiful!But the climate is just too hot
Ayy i live in that country
wow..
save an island for me :D
This makes me feel proud to live in Dubai
The new seek discomfort line is insane I love it so much <3 some of the best apparel I have ever seen! I’m so excited to buy some :)
❤
literally got their merch add before this, im not even mad
I give this a WOW++
Early 48 secs ago
You should have seen the IPL match
Fun fact: an european group invested in creating a miny europe...in the european islands. Theyll be having hotels, and all the famous european sights there. Also they plan on making an area thats cold and has fake snow.
already ordered my stuff for the drop, looking foward to it coming! You guys are awesome!!!!
Good video. Love from Malaysia 🇲🇾
last time i was this early my girlfriend was pissed
Thomas' hair is living its best life rn
I learn something every single Sunday!
Right before watching this video is got this epic Seek Discomfort ad! 😎😊
If you are here now no one has watched the video in its entirety
Thomas Dude , Am disappointed , You Came to Dubai without even telling me , Remember you replied to my email , that if you'd ever come to Dubai again , you will meet me . Come on man , u didn't even tell me .
Fyi i get seek discomfort yt ads lol  Edit : twice
earlyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
How bad do they need money that I get a merch add for them. From YouTube. In under two minutes
how is everyone commenting about the video when they didn't even see the full video, they just posted 10 mins ago
POV: you are cringing at ppl commenting with the user name "100k subs without any videos challenge"
Dam aight
Wow
You guys are starting to become unrelatable. This doesnt really feel like "seek discomfort to find new adventures with new people" it just feels like "we got money now, gonna go do stuff yall can't ever do"
Living in Dubai I’ve never heard about this lol
Fastest click in The West
Lol i suggested this on the what should we do forms.
Just opened YouTube:  Saw him in Dubai without a mask (... #wearmask #stayhomestaysafe
LOVE the info on the sustainability steps 💛
Just wow 😍
those will be reclaimed by the ocean in no time
Love from Viet Nam
Introducing *THE WORLD*  wow thanks for hooking us up;)
Who else loves Yes Theory's documentary style videos? ❤
Seek discomfort babyyyyy
Saudi Arabia is wasting money for shit like this instead of helping muslims in war countries all around the world. You all will be judged by this. Allah won't let this be unpunished. Just wait for it Saudi Arabia.
5 min, catching the worm. That archipelago thou
Thomas: I want to be with my family so I'll move back to Europe. Also thomas: alright so imma go to dubai first
Love then vids keep up the Adventures
Man, I wish I could travel like you guys!

First time getting a seek discomfort ad and its on yes theory
respect for not wearing a mask while we're in this propaganda and bullshit
commenting before watching the whole video rn
how am i so early :---
So excited about you changing the clothing line to a more eco friendly brand!!
Early
Finally!!!!!!❤ i miss your vids bro 😩
I get so excited when that notification rings and it's you guys! 💯🙏
Those are insane but can't be good for the environment. All of the emissions and having to regularly import sand and raw materials... plus this is reserved, obviously, for the ultra-rich
IM SO EARLY
Nice video
😍
<3
So I was watching this and I got a YES THEORY AD. They just paid YT to advertise on their own video 😳
what if someone played monopoly on those islands
Wooohoo
I am from UAE  and proud when watching  that
i was watching all the old videos and suddenly u uploaded the video
zzz
Greatest decadence of mankind
Wish everyone who watched this video able to own 1 in the future!!
Who hasn’t even watched the video yet but is still commenting 😂
Dude, you are by far the best narrator that I know 😁
me sitting here crying because I had a high chance of meeting thomas and yet I didn't  -_-
I love the environmental apporach! good job! now I feel ok with buying something!! Thank you
Have a good Sunday everyone!
Why even travel during the pandemic... Stay home ppl!
Hey Yes Theory, I am trying to get to a point where I can do crazy adventures like you guys do. Any advice on how to get there? Or advice from other commenters? Is there any way to travel a lot without being some sort of media influencer?
ayy

Love me some good Yes Theory content to watch. Especially while in quarantine
You guys do some crazy stuff
commenting for the algorithm
