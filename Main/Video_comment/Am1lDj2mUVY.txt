EDIT: as of 11/13/2020, it looks like instagram has actually put even more emphasis on the shop tab in their newest app update by placing it on the bottom bar of the app, just to the right of the "reels" tab! So, it looks like it's here to stay - and if you're looking for your shop tab, check the bottom bar! xoxo, saf  HELLO FRIENDS!! here is a quite lengthy deep dive into the shop tab that i had a really fun time filming - i feel like i'm lowkey exposing myself & my instagram habits in this video, but that's ok 😂let me know what's on your shop tab in the comments below! xoxo, saf
I LOVE the witchy outfit! Who knew a skirt with suspenders could be so cute
30:42 it’s giving hopescope
Everytime she says e girl it sounds like gru saying gorls
Hello it's been four years and I would like to return to posit that Pink Safiya (TM) was a prediction of Romance Saja from Kpop Demon Hunters.
I think the third outfit would be technically called "Soft Girl" fashion.
She's weird she is judging her outfits by looking down on them not like in the mirror
LoL In the pink outfits looked like @Hopescope Look a like contest
32:55 -I'm sure I'm gonna come across as just some typical goon with a potential restraining order on the horizon for saying this but I srsly havent ever even considered for a single nanosecond paying for pr0n media of any shape form or fashion.. Fact is, I've always been attractive enough to not ever even consider for a single nanosecond paying for any intimate contact between myself and anyone else EVER and I mean srsly not even for shits n giggles.. Ive been blessed with the extremely fortunate circumstances of having females actually fight physically over me and other such seemingly incredible accolades,  at one time or another  and all of this is to illustrate the point that I'm not just some forever alone flower with no ability to pull ass. In reality, I pull ass like a magnet.. okay, well not as much these days but  you get the point, I'm sure, so..  Yeah, anyway with that said, when I heard this  at this timestamp my reaction is hand raised right here-  MFW
Tyler's tired "Nevermind" after Safiya's Sammi Sweetheart ramble is such a mood XD I be doin that to my own ramblings half the time lol
Wednesday
Honey did not age well...
I Vail for my religion and also checking honestly say yeah you got to have a proper fitting bonnet or any hair covering for that matter for it to be comfortable. It sounds like yours was a little too tight which is a big problem some people have because they don't properly measure their head before buying and that can cause problems. And you and me have a similar ride cuz like today I went out in a bustle and my petticoat in a dress that can only be described as serving wench and I love those garments but I also go out quite often and most of the community calls The Goth hippie vibe. Ever seen someone in a black flowing velvet dress with a hippie goth tie dye on top cuz that's me. No joke I have a lot of tie dye that's blues and purples and gray the blacks you're my favorites but everyone's like where's the color tonight supposed to have color and I'm like it does and apparently it doesn't count because it's not the right colors to some people.
Yes! Someone needs to make an edit of Cousin Itt with like rainbow hair now!
who's still here in 2025?
Safiya looks like a badass in 25:30 and she's gorgeous!!! the mask was a nice addition too :D
6:42 she looks *just* like disco Janet from the good place
I kind of forgot how everyone used to complain about the 'having to stay at home' thing of the pandemic. It didn't make sense to me then, it didn't start making more sense to me now.  'There is a disease spreading around that might very well kill people. I need to stay inside, I hate life.' just feels so... wrong.  Then again, I am generally socially avoidant, so that was basically my every day life and I didn't notice anything different to begin with.
I really like the overalls!!!!! And ALL of this outfit! You look great!❤❤❤
BREAKING NEWS: Mark juckerburg is trying to kill safiya nygaard
The “e-girl” outfit has big barbie vibes
Minga has changed so much in 4 years lol
Who else WISHES that Saf would’ve taken the wig off at the end to see the pink outfit with her black hair??!?
Faraway, 3rd outfit maybe more Moné, closer though to Violet Myers.
It's sad that back then, no one told Safiya that the posvr shop was just scam. They bought stuff off aliexpress for cheap and resold it as their own stuff with hiked up price.
31:06 the wig makes your face look AI. I just noticed that, it's kinda funny
I miss the insta gram shop so much
Tyler was on fire in this one. 'Sabbath Night Fever' lol
The witch outfit actually reminds me of The Craft 😅
I live 1 hour from Colonial Williamsburg, I go all the time and it's amazing ❤
if safiya were to get a time machine she’d be able to travel back to any year and blend in seamlessly
12:51 Ah yes, the two genders
Eww not the honey ad
It’s so wild watching this is 2025 when neither the shop tab nor igtv exist anymore
Does anyone else like to rewatch all her old videos as you do your at home duties like laundry or clean?🤣🙌🏻
watching this in january 2025 really just gave me a jumpscare to hear "this video is sponsored by honey"
honey is a rip off.
Here after honey got exposed 😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️
the honey ad aged so badly
Safiya, i hope you know you can edit out the honey ads even after you have upload!
thought i was tripping and you were in jenna marbles house
My YouTube algorithm is bringing back your videos from years ago! And I’m not mad one bit! ☺️  Oh no the Honey sponsorship! I hope you join in one of the lawsuits!
watching this after the honey drama makes me feel bad for Safiya
(i know you didnt know at the time) but not the honey add
She sounds like the watch mojo girl.  Am I wrong?
not the honey sponsor 😭😭💀
i need those rogue wolf shoes
31:02 when i hear e-girl i think of Jenna and Julien's e girl makeover so i feel like this is an accurate outfit 😅
I REALLY hope that you have reached out to the LegalEagle to add into the legal case claim on Honey - you may have lost so much because of them :( Love your content!!
I can connect you to someone from Plimouth plantation! A good friend of mine works there!
Omg I was casually letting your old videos play while doing some housework when I heart about the honey sponsor at the beginning and I got triggered. Thankfully I never downloaded this scammy thing. I hope you guys are informed about what they're truly like.
4 years late... but I think the shoestrings were long so that you can thread them through thr loop behind your ankle and up to the front.
am i tweaking or is she in jenna marble's house
"The memes of production." Brilliant.
loved memes of production
Sammi Sweetheart is my also my due north 😅😅
You look like HopeScope in the pink!
I know this video is 4 years old but the pink wig gives Hope Scope vibes
The pink look is very Marina Diamandis, dark brows and bright hair included!
Thank you for being my background noise as I write an essay for school 🫶
was hoping to see the link for the star and moon boots in the info
Watching in 2024 and trying to find the instagram shop tab but it seems like it’s gone now.. anyone know how to find it?   I really need those celestial boots! Omg!
I *really* miss that 00s heart pattern style, tbh. See, when I was a little kid, it was starting to go out of style, so thrift stores were full of it for a while. Until I was like 14, probably half my closet had hearts on everything. And it only stopped then because I couldn't find it cheap in my size anymore. I still want it even now though, it was the only "cute" style I've ever looked not totally awful in.
Why do you like black and the Adam’s customs so much?
Now can I just ask, where did you get the shirt that you wore while unboxing?
Now can I just ask, where did you get the shirt that you wore while unboxing?
10:00 SLAY SAFF SLAY
A lot of outfits, shoes, and makeup, all 100% nice
22:32 Every time someone says this I'm reminded of the time my mum scolded me because she thought it was inappropriate XD
15:13 MingaLondon is 100% a dropshipping/fast fashion/stolrn designs brand. Just for anyone interested
The middle part suits her face way much more
NOOOO!!! Don't follow Spencer!!
But the third outfit actually matched very well together, what does she mean?
theyre literally morticia and gomez
Saf, I need that witchy outfit simply bc it looks so good on you, i realize this video is pre pandemic but holy crap, that is a VIBE
Nothing in the comments about how they both said “Oregon” 😂😂😂 is that how the west coasters say that?
her kitchen and living room looks like Jenna marbles house I love it
I love love love the witch look!!!❤
" OnLy If YoU hAvE a DiRtY mInD"  - tyler
Am I mad or does their house look just like Jenna and Julian’s? (I’m not a stalker promise)
I am once again amazed by the rewatchablilty of Saf's content
anyone know which video that see-through holo jacket is from? it looks so funky i want her reaction
Tyler just going "never mind" killed me 😂
Saf and Tyler’s back and forth about Sammy Sweetheart kills me. 😂😂😂
With how much this video shows of Safyia's secretly amazing American Girl doll knowledge I'm sad we've never had a "I dress like American girl dolls" video
Put the bottom dangly bit of the straps through the circles so they don't flap around and are hidden
Jelly shoes… I had those in the mid 80s. I want some more. 😩
She actually looked better in the pink outfit than I would have thought.
is this filmed in 2020? why do you have a face mask on outside? don't mean to be rude but just wondering
You look good in all of them The pink wig look really nice on you
i love how much twice is in safiyas explore page
try tucking the straps through the hoops/rings @safiya :)
Yours and Tyler’s back and forth is one of my favorite things about your videos 😂😂❤️❤️
i like how she just has 138 texts and 118 calls and is just acting normal 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣     Love u safiya
Nice
The shop tab isn't there anymore
Love twice being on the igtv
I think you're supposed to tuck the straps in on the pinafore
Saf, tuck the ends of the suspender belt things into the rings!
I want the "sweetheart" outfit the jacket came from. I don't wear pink but I want that.  I was a 2000s baby and my family were working class enough to buy clothes at thrift stores, before they became cool and trendy, back when they were genuinely a cheap option, so as a kid I wore loads of that exact style because in the 2010s people were giving it away to thrift stores (though I never had a heart pattern denim jacket, always wanted one though), and I still love it. It makes me feel 11 again. Care Bear shirts are also something from that era and style I never had as a kid but desperately wanted. I'm almost disappointed you didn't buy and wear the Care Bears shirt... it's so cute.
Please learn how to correctly pronounce Oregon.  Organ, not that hard
So the last outfit isn't e-girl, but what is it actually? I'll call it "a disoriented y2k/soft girl outfit" The jacket is kinda lovecore, the top is y2k/nostalgiacore maybe? The pants are angelcore (yes, this style exists lmao), and the wig is just...pink (should've chosen a different color, it just blends together with the jacket too much).  As a gen z, I do not approve. I'm sorry.
Prayer here when needed loves ❤John 3:16-21❤God bless
Wig looks great Tyler
"E" Girl means EMO
8:40 watching this after seeing her Colonial Williamsburg video gives me so much joy
Thoticia 😂
Who else is here after the shop tab was removed lol
the pink look is AWESOME
She made it to Colonial Williamsburg!!! 🎉
The second catcaller is definitely just someone saying “Safiya!” 😂
I found your long lost twins: -you -LaurenZside -SuperRaedrizzle  Tell me they don t look alike
wow I don't even have that tab
I couldn't help but notice at the start when Safia was looking through the stuff and bookmarked a pair of Edwardian shoes, that it was the brand memery, i own a pair of those exact shoes and i fully reccomend them, as someone with autism i need shoes that are comfortable or i would rather be barefoot then wear something that is gonna make me uncomfortable and these are hella comfy, and made of leather so they will be with you for a long time if you care for them how you should care for leather. Also they have way too many pretty shoes and even sweaters, I'm planing to buy at least one or 2 pairs of shoes outside of the black ones. They are perfect for witch and cottagecore looks and apparently even some movie productions bought shoes from them for filming so ye. Memery have good shoes. And thry also make wider shoes in case someone woth wide feet will want a pair too. But they aren't cheep, I'll give them that.
I don't know why i like the pink outfit so much but it was my favorite 😊
I think the pink outfit would look good without the wig, I'm so late 😭😭
Kinda wild that the shop tab is gone now, this video is like a time capsule
To be a "saucy wench" is my new life goal
You can "Safely stand with no mask" anywhere......you realize masks do nothing to defend against airborne illnesses right?.... Walking down the sidewalk, outside, in the fresh open air with a mask on is literally the most laughable thing ever.
Watching this in 2023 and getting a chuckle about how COVID played out. 🙄
26:32  @Safiya Nygaard....  in reference to the "Moon Shoes", please DO NOT trim the laces. Wrap them around the shoe at your ankle. Kinda like you would with snow boots or something similar.
She is just churning butter
A lot of the things you like are very dark. I'd love to hear your story as to why you chose these kinds of things. I do have to tell you Jesus loves you ❤️ and I enjoy watching your content. You're very positive and always seem happy
Living in a country thats on the opposite side from the more "mainstream" countries (as I call them) makes these shipping times seem so short lol. Recieving things from overseas usually takes a month at the LEAST (aliexpress once took 4.5 months I think)
I think a reverse Monet would be called a "Bosch"
I like that you actually wore what you got outside, many people get outfits for videos then those clothes never see the daylight again 🤣 (at least not until a clean my closet video)lots of c
If you put the overskirt straps inside the hole, they would've been much lovelier.
in the last outfit you look like you are in the barbie movie
Every time Saf sits at the kitchen table and the camera faces out to the family room I think she’s in Jenna Marble’s house. So eerily similar lol
the ‘e girl’ was def y2k:)
I know this was 3 years ago but your probably supposed to tuck the excess strap from the suspender skirt into the circles, like a belt
Ok but she did the luranzside intro In a bit I  think
why are you wearing a face mask outside?
Are we not going to talk about how she has 118 messages 😅
OMG I'm cackling!!   Minger pronounced minga in UK slang means horrid, ugly, terrible LOL LOL LOL
Cool 😀
def don't think they were catcalling you....
Your description of those jeans was a laugh riot. Perfection.
What really impresses me here is that you managed in the 2nd half of the video to recycle (epicycle?) the "saucy wench" joke, from the portion of the video you filmed five months prior!!
Just noticed that the pink wig look lowkey makes saf look like lava girl
Try the catage core look
Colonial girls gone wild…
I need those black shoes! They are gorgeous. I know this is 2 years ago, but they are so fun!
the 'not a e girl look' is called y2k fashion
absolutely lost it when she started reciting macbeth jjadfshdfhsi
4:15 did safiya predict Instagram threads 😂
I like the *E-girl* look GOD bless
anyone else fans of both safiya and jenna marbles watching this thinking their houses have the exact same layout? when safiya is unboxing that is jennas exact backdrop
Fast forward to 2023 and we got a Safiya at Colonial Williamsburg video!
right before she sung they see me churning, i started singing the exact thing
The first two were really flattering, but I didn’t like you in pink much ❤😂
I can't stop thinking about how that house looks exactly like Jenna's or am I fucking insane
I've rewatched this at least 20 times and everytime I think you were in Jenna Marbles house because the background is so similar
Me seeing TWICE that much make me so happy😍😍
the c in witch might be a moon and the t in witch might be a cross
I actually loved the last outfit on you by far my favourite ! I would totally wear if
I thought she was in jenna marbles house
Tyler’s one liners were the star of this video
is it just me is is it giving ✨Pinterest✨??
Owl box
To me it looks good I like it
as someone from the pnw, the way that they pronounced “Oregon” hurts my soul
Chaeyoung dancing to BDZ made my day.
0:54 lovetootrue is actually a small business in the uk :) I ordered from them recently
The pink wig makes you look like Marina and the Diamonds
oooooohhhh the witch outfit😍😍😍😍 yas yes yes
Is it just me or does the space she is filming in look like Jenna Marbles’ house?
Just realised the “e-girl” fashion was actually just y2k 😭
Maybe I’m just also old, but the third style actually looks really E-Girl-y to me.😂
If you got 1800's attire I'm already there. I should have been born then in that ERA  with the dresses and lifestyle and was born there in Virgina.  I musta been reincarnated :)
Yeah, to me the whole witchy outfit is fantastic except for the WITCH across the bust. Too on the nose. The vibes should do the talking.
girl i didnt know that she was twice fan i just get so happy when i saw her fyp😭😭
When I saw the thumbnail I thought she dyed her hair pink but then realised she didn't and I was sad  -2021 me
33:11 still trending but TAKE OFF THE GOD DAMN WIG F4
I love pink e girl saf she needs to make random appearances 💞💞
The WIC application is beautiful. Good job Tyler I just don’t think it’s a great color for you but you’re gorgeous.
We be churnin still one of my faves #10mil
The pink looks incredible!
the "I am one of you fellow kids" had me dying
"Control the memes of production" is the best pun I've heard all week.
I like the 2nd outfit the best but then again I am completely and totally goth, and a witch. Though I don’t usually advertise with “witch” written across my breasts. Hehe
I dont know how to describe how to pronounce minga but like less emphasis on the g? It also means ugly in England lol
Girl this Witch  shirt combo sis a must wear every week! Best outfit I've EVER seen on you!!! LOVE IT!!
after watching this video, i wanna go shopping so badly kdkd
It’s giving Ella Enchanted vibes
The "Pink" outfit is just screaming 90s and while i would never wear anything like it, it makes me happy cause it's very nostalgic 😂
I LOVE the witchy look 👏🏼👏🏼 Adorable!
Pull these shoes like wow i would wear them star shoes always
Omg the second outfit is to die for
I like outfit number two and with outfit number three I like the pink jacket
Saturday November 7
you should do a house tour video
Well done Tiller for the wig it is amazing
How did you guys live in California for so long and never learn how to pronounce 'Oregon.' As an Oregonian, this makes me sad.
No pink
The pink wig! 😍😍
As someone from Oregon.... Tyler is shunned for saying it like that... 😭😂
The pink hair looks so good! Love the contrast w the eyebrows!
I love how you don’t just follow trends, you have your own style and are true to your followers and yourself
I know I'm 2 years late to this video but I am very upset that I can't seem to find that pink denim jacket with the hearts ANYWHERE
0:35 i love how half of your feed is kpop 😭 girl same
i love the choke-hold mina from twice has on her explore page
How Tyler says oregon😂 obviously not from the west coast😂
Put the jacket with the witch outfit and bam!
Love the witchy shoes! If only I were 16 again! 🤣
I just want her to be my bff and do spooky but giggly tarot readings, the Morgan freedman voice and s’mores
I love you Safiya, thanks for always being a friendly voice, and always making interesting videos w an emphasis on keeping it factual.   I feel like Tiffany Ferg, you and a couple others have kind of earned the respect from me at least for just being honest and charismatic and relatable and reliable for such a long time.   You guys are dope 👏🏻🫶🏻🤍
Oregon is pronounced wrong. It's pronounced Or-uh-gun
I am genz and love totally spies
i think the blue jeans look amazing on her.
So I rewatched this many times but Tyler's nevermind to the comment about Sammi Sweetheart made me laugh
your always so pretty it honestly make me a little 🤏 jealous
LOL literally.  Hilarious..especially  the E girl outfit!
1:49 I love how the editing was a second late 💀
You look AMAZING in pink, Safiya! The wig/hair really compliment your skin and eyes!
Saw that Rogue and Wolf box and - hey I got a really cool celestial mug from them. Thing's huge XD
12:08 that enthousiasme is a bit sus ... just saying.
Safs in pink  yall should gratefull
If you wore your basic outfit in colonial  Williamsburg  you would be burned  because they would think you were a wich
So... did j&julien buy this house? 😳 randomly noticed the background and was like 🥲
Did you know that you tired your shoes wrong that why the shoelaces are so long 😊
Is it me or is that Jenna and Julien's house? (;w; )💕
i love 3
are u me sis
It’s so awesome that she kept getting cat called in the colonial digs! I love that.
Is Anyone Gonna Talk About Sayfiyas iPhone Background 💀
If I was rich, I would give Safiya an obscene amount of money to actually stage a one-woman Macbeth production.
Safiya Nygaard and Jenna Marbles are really out there giving us the wildest "E-Girl" definitions 😆
The pink outfit is considered e-girl , as there is pastel goth , there is pastel e-girl ❤️
I'd say the pink vine is less e girl more gamer girl
Hi❤i love your videos ❤❤
I feel like the wig really suits her somehow
I thought that e-girl outfit was what an e-girl is-… uh, so. I mean you aren’t the only one to think that!
As an Oregonian, the pronunciation of Oregon was jarring 😭😂
it's so funny how she's like "let's do this crazy idea" an tyler is just like "fuck yes!!" lol
The 3rd outfit, the pink outfit, is good but if you really wanna perfect it IMO the wig should have been braided into like a crown with possibly incorporate a flower crown with white flowers on it to fully embrace the feminity the ensamble is trying to portray.
i love her voice omg-
The pink wig suits you so much!
Sabbath night fever took me out 😆
She should’ve put like the pink hair up in a style
A+ for 'memes of production'
Today i learned Sofia’s Instagram is 50% twice, as of a year ago
bruh
In any aesthetic Safiya look amazing!
0:37 Chae's fancam👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻😂
Don't knot the laces again double bow them instead Hope that helps
I love those moon pattern shoes
The house in this video reminds me so much of Jenna and Julian’s place in their vids!😢😂
Those are some serious mom jeans. Love the witch look.
i hate how they say oregon, i love them but the way they say it hurts me as an oregonian
The pink wig looks good on you!
Does saf and Tyler live in jenna marbles old house???? Look so similar!
So glad she finally got to go back in 22
Ngl the last one looks like your a girl from troom troom who does not look like the vibe that they made them wear
i suddenly need safiya ren faire content
I was there when the pink outfit was popular the first time. Not the hair but the clothes. Those darn pants did the same thing back then too. It was so annoying. The waist would be way too small and camel toe was everywhere. I said the hell with it and did my own thing. Each brand couldnt agree on any sizes for us. They would have these stupid stupid tiny wastes and great big hips. I started wearing mens jeans. Much more comfortable. They looked great with boots and heals. I was over six feet in those boots and i was very slender and i made sure it showed without the embarrassment. Dont fall into the trap of these stupid fad jeans they are not worth the discomfort. A good jean should come about an inch to two inches below the navel not right on it. It will feel better and look better.
The wig looks so good on you. I love the not e girl outfit on you
the second outfit is so cute and i neeeeeed those shoes!!!!!
Omg I love your vids, shout out please
i love how Safiya's home screen is tyler doing a funny face 😂
Video concept I’d be very invested in - is your algorithm on Insta showing you diff stuff depending on what device you’re accessing it on?? This would show whether it’s affected by more than likes/comments, but rather what content you linger on or what is in that devices browsers history /cookies
No one is talking about how they pronounced Oregon ':D
Honestly I kind of feel like you can have a child
Hey sunshine I need to ask a question why may I ask you left all  those bill U made is totally all your leaf all those bill you know I'm not able to pay all those bills u left me with nothing it take me over 7 years to pay all that boy the mask you ware and that's really mean on your part I guess he participated along with you I hope you will fix this what more can you hurt me with  I never done a thing to you
Its like pastel goth vs regular goth . the color pop egirl look goes it more candy crash core vs e girl poison apple
I need the moon shoes! Why no links?
for the pink look: the jacket works with the top, and it works with the pants. but the pants don't really work with the top. I don't think the wig is doing anything for the look.
I like the wig
The wig could've used some space buns and butterfly clips. Otherwise I love the outfit as a whole!
lol safiya is getting a LOT of twice reccomendations lol 0:38
sofia at around 14:15 recreated LaurenZsides intro
the Maria reference
Omg the harajuku instagram photo of Safiyas is the best instagram photo I’ve ever seen lol!
I believe the third outfit is called preppy girl.but I might be wrong
37:11 control the memes of production
Tuck the strap into the rings on the overall dress!
i LOVE THE SHOES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
She did not slay
Me over here feeling pain over the way they say Oregon..... It's pronounced or-gin. The g pronounced ga
I love the pink, I think it works well funnily enough! Totally different look and vibe though.
LOL🥰🥰😂😂
Is no one gonna talk about the background..
Hmmm imo should've gone with a light purple wig instead of a bright pink one and maybe the outfit would work a bit better because Pink Wig and a Light Pink Jacket just a bit too much pink
You should do a whole fully goth look for a day video
@0:30:04 -- I think the "Whig" would go more with the colonial outfit.  _Please, God, let someone get the joke._
I'm having a hard time figuring out if you guys actually think Oregon is pronounced that way or if that's just the way you guys like to say it lol
It’s 2022 we want another one
mix every tea at davidstea and drink it in the franken mug
I live in Williamsburg, I do not work there, but I might be able to talk to people
LOL honey has NEVER worked.. not ever not even once. "Cupons found! >apply coupons> you already have the best price!"n   lol complete joke  not once have I saved a single penny, its "you already have the best price" every single time
“It’s me.” 🤣🙌
I love Minga London 🥺 so expensive but I absolutely love their stuff - quality of their sweaters is AMAZING
Omg! I absolutely love you guys!!! I need a Tyler in my life! You two vibe together sooo well…love watching your videos
Killed her husband whacked em 🤣  I definitely enjoyed this!
When you said "cabs are here", I shouted "oh yeah"!
TWICE!
Ok, this is what I have to say about the goth outfit: Teenage/early 20's Morticia Addams.
ITS THE CHURN N’ TURN GUYS!!!
that house looks familiar....?
I just really wanna see safiya do the Dwight schrute makeup tutorial…..I can’t imagine anything more majestic than that.
Loved the black outfit, pink jacket and wig. The colonial/70’s outfit was good.
11:37 look at her phone-- is that tyler??
The second outfit was the best on you, you looked very nice! It's not my style, but it looked great on you!
37:21 nice
SO SO SO BMMED OUT that you were bombarded with babies because the internet learned you got married. Like how fucked up is that? I recently learned I'm infertile and I'm engaged and the same thing happened to me. I don't look at baby content so I have no idea why I was being flogged that stuff. So lame.
i wish i could afford those #2 outfits boots with that shirt bc the are adorable
The rings in the overall skirt are so you can put extra strap ends in there
Why does her living room look like Jenna Marble's?
"Hello... fellow- kids." Safiya = Lauren real /j
Lol
Love outfit 2 so much looks so so good and love the pink hair
The first outfit with hair down gives me hair down mother Isabella vibes from tpn and just yea
I feel like this was  filmed durring PEAK start of covid were everyone was starting to get stir crazy... seeing someone in CWB garb would have made my day
"My cream bring all the boys to the yard! It's a hay penny a glass baby!" 🤣🤣
Dollskill and KREEPSVILLE666 are racist, boooooo
The “E-girl” outfit reminded me of teenager lazy town lady
Little did safiya know, she would get her wish
Ty did awesome
her colonial williamsberg wench dreams are finally true
Kpop Stan? LOL I'm joking, if anyone is wondering, the kpop group is called Twice
Too bad honey is not available in my region
But fd do
I LOVE  the witch look 😍 🖤
My uncle used to work at CW
37:24  I laughed at the pun but died at the expression
GOODS
🤣😅🤣😅🤣
i decided to look through my shop tab for the first time and if i had done this video i would've ended up with a lot of makeup, jewelry, skater dresses, and a trumpet.
2020 Saf: I could wear this to Colonial Williamsburg! I would love to go there for a video! 2022 Saf: *gets an 18th century makeover at Colonial Williamsburg*
This must have been before they sneakily re-did the interface so that the 'shop' button was in the exact spot the 'add post' button was!
Safiya you should give us a house tour
Ik you're probably not gonna see this- but the "all grown up" Powerpuff girls shirt, those designs are from an actual episode in Powerpuff Girls (classic), it's them remembering stuff that for the most part we didn't see in the show and they're remembering a time when the professor accidentally turned them into teenagers ^-^ !!!
I love the ppg outfit!💚💗💙
The pink outfit gave me Sam and Cat vibes
The graduation pics😅😅😅
Watching this in may 2022 when she has in fact been invited to do a video in colonial Williamsburg
You wear all the outfits very well! And that wig looks good!
"seize the 'memes' of production" - tyler i chortled aloud
look how many missed calls she has

I just can't stop admiring that whole "witchy" outfit - Safiya really has an eye for fashion. I would definitely wear that if I could
The laces would’ve been cute wrapped around
Omg girl the witchy outfit suits you SO MUCH!!
Me seeing Safiya's shop page and goes to look at my own... I had a whole PS5 on mine TvT
my faverate is the black one
Perfeser Snape from harry potter
Here home looks similar to Jenna marbles
Here after saf got her wish and was formally invited to colonial Williamsburg!
The wig looks super cute !❤🧡💛💚💙💜
I’m in an alley and this is up my alley. I’ll live by these words
She finally made it to Colonial Williamsburg 3 years later
She didn't churn the butter?
I’m here after the Colonial Williamsburg video :)
I love that Saf said she would love to one day do a video with Colonial Williamsburg and she just recently was able to! Ah! It's awesome!!
the pink hair looks so good🥹
Watching this after the Colonial Williamsburg video. Safiyas dream has come true
It's so funny the black clothes shes suggested, because Safiya isn't really goth... she's like... cute and fashionable, but make it black.  Wish an occasional dash of weird or adventure.
8:40  Safia finally got her wish.
I didnt knw minga London n kpop is on ur page too!!!
So, a year and a half LATER since I somehow missed this video when it was published...I have to say, I'm not a pink girl AT ALL, but when I saw that jacket with the black hearts, all I could think was how awesome it would likely look on top of the witchy velvet coverall dress (which could help hide the fact the buckles were right on your boobs). Assuming you still have these items, and assuming you didn't come to this conclusion yourself in the last year and a half, it might be worth trying. ♥
Your house looks a lot like jennas
Pink one no and yes
I love punk rave, most of my favourite items are from there, but i also wear really intense clothing so yeah😅
Whereeeeee can I get the holographic jacket in the intro?!?! ❤️
Do we not all live our lives with Sammi Sweetheart as our due north? Lmao
Thank you ☺️ 🤟🏻❤️     Last outfit needs a bucket hat !?
The baby would be Beautiful! At least do the app that shows you what your baby would look like from photos !? lol 🤟🏻❤️💋
If you ever go to Colonial Williamsburg please let us know ahead of time. I spend time in Williamsburg since my parents live there and I'd love to hang out
The second one is like ✨a beauty in the dark✨
Oh my god!  She is sooooo pretty 😍😍😍😍
Love, love this video but what is up with that picture at 8:06!!? -so confused by the view of her arm😳
The witch outfit was the best among the three
I once carried a full-on wooden spinning wheel on a train from Brighton to London (long story). I was approached by so many people clearly with joy in their hearts. People love some spinning, churning and baking #guiltypleasures I was once perusing one of those American homestead videos. A woman was showing how she made butter, two types of cheese, buttermilk...the whole dairy shebang, in one hour. I was advised that if you put some milk in a jar and shake, shake, shake you can make your own butter. I have just realised this is the most ridiculous comment I have ever left on a comment section  🤦‍♀
So is Safiya like a huge ✨Twice✨ fan or does Instagram just think that?
Am I the only one with a dirty mind-
You should do a SHEIN haul!
I laughed when you said that the pastel pink was E-Girl-😆
Tyler actually did way better on the wig then I thought he would!
SAFIYA R U A ONCE?? I SAW CHAEYOUNG ON UR EXPLORE PAGE
the ring from the suspenders goes w the strapss
lil peep with the hellboy/ hellgirl
Can't you tuck the belts through the hoops for the witchy skirt?
Lol I love how they say Oregon
Imagine how much money and work this gurl puts into her videos. YASS SLAY QUEENIE 😩💖💝💗🔥🥰💕❤❤💖💖💓💸💸💸
I think the wig might have worked better if you styled it around your face. It looked like it was decent quality and I'm glad it was on your head and not your booty. I mean pink ass hair probably would have YouTube flagging this video.
Love, love, love watching you two!  But..........As a girl from Oregon myself, gotta correct your pronunciation of the word Oregon - So you pronounced it Oreegone - when we say it like Oreegun. Just don't want you to feel out of place if you ever visit us here ~ <3
the pink hair looks nice on safiya i just think if the jacket was white or black it would look better
يكثر قرقها
its a really good quality wig it being a lace front, it was put on very well (:
I started flossing more regularly when masks started and it was a life changer lol I never realized how bad it was
e girl is like emo
hacks: watching this over 9 months later and knowing saf wasn't going to be having a baby- then you can be like 'smh insta u so wrong' along with saf and feel smug at your insider knowledge of the future
They all look amazing on you
"Mark Zuckerberg is trying to kill me" made me burst out laughing, ask my poor neighbors :D
All of the outfits go together nicely especially the 3rd
If you don't get the butter joke safiya  made your too innocent to know
The third outfit was my favorite!
The witch outfit is amazing
Okay but you look STUNNING IN THE PINK HAIR. unexpected but not surprised. Constantly slaying every look, no matter how ridiculous it may be. I currently have bright pink hair exactly like that, so it made me super happy lol. The pink wig is so so cute. You're adorable.
In love with outfit#2!
I still have a mighty need for that pink heart-print jacket from Minga London. It is 9000% up my alley. 💖💖💖
Is it me or is that Jenna marble’s house ?!!
OMGGGG THE PINK HAIR IS SO CUTE ON YOU
Love a married couple who call each other “dude” 😂 you two are amazing
Replace the laces with satin ribbon pleaseeee
A year late but if anyone was curious about the 90/ early 2000s style that saf thought was 'egirl'. At my store- its categorized as y2k angel fashion. Its big with bratz, powerpuff, sailormoon, winx club, care bears etc.
i only just realised there was music…
Girl answer your phone you have 183 messages
I think its vsco girl
wait but like i love the "e-girl" makeup look on u saf
idk if it was explained later but is she in Jenna's house?
8:25 "go big or go home" enhypen reference?? Safiya?? Have you fully entered the kpop rabbit hole?
I’m obsessed with the gothic outfit. I wish you had links to the sites they came from cause I want it.
If that shop is in London, I reckon it’s pronounced ming-a, not min-ga. Minga is slang for ugly, but I don’t think anyone says it anymore
I kinda want the witch one lol.... you rocked it
I'm pretty sure the Powerpuff Girls shirt is meant to be slept in. I’m don’t know what kind of material it’s made of but from the way it’s look like I would assume so. Also in my country you can often see lace and one small rose on top of a pj top (just like on this shirt).   Love the witch look.
Nope not e girl it’s soft girl
Put them through the hole
She cut the wigs lace wrong *crys
“Unwanted nipple flappage” 🤣😂
can I get the link for the shoes? bc those look awsome I am totally buying them😍
You look so good in the all black and not really that badly goth
You can tuck the ends of the suspender straps threw the rings into the skirt
I would have been a way more fashionable goth if there had been this fashion in the 80's lol. Instead you found that not all black dye was black 😂.
You where thinking about a soft girl look
Thanks for the Honey extension! I just added it and already saved by downloading it and paying for it on my First New Computer. My total all together was $496.86 my savings were almost half ! Saved $167
Is no one going to talk about Saffiya's phone wallpaper-
sorry to rage but THAT STYLE WAS NOT E-GIRL IT WAS SOFTY... sorry you may continue
give me those shoes right now
Lets go !
How come can an e girl became a soft girl?
I cannot figure out the difference between the backyard and the street.  And it's a tad distracting.
The third outfit is so kawaii and I love it!
These videos satisfy my addiction to shopping. You're the tobacco patch for this shopaholic
the witch outfit made you look 16 years old!!wow
Slay Queen 🥰
There’s a double knot trick for extra long laces that my mom taught me when I was little. You take the loop of the original bow and you make a loop with the loop and basically do a secondary bow. I wish I could post a picture bc that is not making much sense
Are we just gonna ignore her phone wallpaper😭😭
I’m obsessed with the pink wig and “egirl” makeup
0:36 Is Safiya a ONCE?
15:00 Tyler’s “never mind” has so many emotions in it 😆
Oregon = Or-eh-gun, not Or-eh-gone
Her skirt was on backwards
I was gonna send you a Starbucks Belfast Mug, but I won't if you're going to break it.
Sofia had lots of twice in her discover page
this is jenna marbles house or am i tripping
Hehe
I hope one day that safiya gets to go to colonial Williamsburg and churn the butter
I actually really like the pink outfit
Eh, it’s pretty egirl.
It looks bad
Your channel is Adult Saturday Morning cartoons for me!
Ok ur shop tab is my dreammmm
the laces is super long so you can make penagraph shapes.
ALL OF THE OUTFITS WERE SO CUTE ON U OMG
Shout out to Tyler for doing a great job on the wig!! I wear a few and he did awesome. Have to say the black outfit was my fave.
Where I am from, people dress like the first outfit a lot. We have a lot of Hutterites, and that is the clothing they wear for religous and cultural reasons
its now 2022 still not just a few weeks of covid :((
PLEASE PAIR THE PINK JACKET WITH THE VELVET SKIRT :) it would look so good on you and a cute way to tie it into your day to day fits <3
Good job on the wig Ty
tbh you slayed the jeans! perfect fit for mom jeans lol
lol I didn't know the lore of colonial Williamsburg but everytime it's mentioned I crack up
14:18 Lauren is that you hello
tbh she really suited the dark/ witchy look she rocked it
You do this for a week
I love rogue wolf I got a 30 dollar moon doll shirt from them I barely wear it cuz I don't wanna ruin it
when I heard my name said correctly I got a bit to excited 😂
Well i think E-Girl is more green and black and chains the 3 look is more Soft girl which is pink and soft with hearts etc.
is Safiya a twice fan? :D
I love all the outfits on you
Who noticed Chaeyoung , ryujin , nayeon , Jennie ??? 🌝🌝🌝
The "Not E girl aesthtic" is called indie or retro
Love the pink hair on you i think you would look good with a cool dye job a vampire red would be awesome
In the last outfit you look like a grown up Stephanie from Lazytown
I saw that chaeyoung fancam in the beginning 👀
I love how you chose dif styles nd the hocus pocus part made me laugh 🤣💖 love ya!!!! <3
I am loving the pink wig!!! All of the other outfits were awesome!!!
Twice
I think safiya tremendously overestimates how personalised and informed the algorithm is...
Micarah Tewers is drooling over the vintage dress, video collabs that are waiting to happen. 😃
As someone who lives in Oregon, I find it interesting how you both pronounce it. Love the video!
God I love Bratz so much
can we just appreciate how Safiya looks awesome in anything?
LITERLY IM JUST WATCHING YT AS U DO AND THIS DUDE IS SPOSERED BY HONEY AND I WATCH THE VID ECT. AND RIGHT AFTER THAT ONE I CLICK THIS ONE AND ITS SPONSERED BY HONEY TOO LOL also sorry caps
E Girl is more gothic
if you want to make the laces shorter on the shoes i would suggest crossing the laces behind you ankle then going in for a double knot
I like the witch  the most but I like alt clothes so I cant say for others but I can say for me.     You go girl!!
I still can't believe Gen Z are bringing back 2000's fashion! How anyone can look at our ridiculous fashion choices and think they're worth reviving is beyond me. 😂
oregOn
lol
Don’t mind me obsessing over the historical outfits
Second outfit heck yes love love love love 🖤
if you come to williamsburg and walk around in 17th century clothes nobody will look twice at you, its so normal even in the regular not colonial parts of town. you'll just see people at walmart in full 17th century dress buying their groceries and nobody cares at all lol (source: i grew up in wmbg)
The removal of the bonnet is such a drastic change! I think how long Safiya's hair is really helps, too
Went for e girl ended up soft girl 😂
Safiya you look great with pink hair! Also I love that pink hearted jacket on you 💕 you should make your own outfit with that jacket!!!
its honesty amazing how re-watchable her videos are, she does follow some trends in her videos but she always differentiate it from other youtubers and the video editing is always really good so a video from 4 years (like the decades fashion series) ago is still a great watch today
are you a kpop fan
I love the fact that at the end Tyler is wearing her "Historical" mask
How can she pull of pink so well ❤️😭 she looks amazing in pink hair omg
Wtf! Are you in Jenna Marbles' house??
This was fun to watch.
the wig is amazing on you
The pink wig looks hella cool on you with the makeup!
"Virginia is for LARPers"
13:30.  e in e girl mean emo
You should buy like a full face of makeup off the Instagram shop tab, only if you want to of course!
I would've put the skirt's straps in the  little iron skirt holder (how tf is that called lmao) and let it be under the skirt to not have them flapping
is it just me or is the house she is filming at look a lot like jenna's and juliens?!?! the kitchen and the TV!
Americans not knowing about the Polish butter churning milkmaids. :( #justeurovisionthings
With those dad jeans you can  turn the other cheek and truly be angelic
I think the Not An E Girl look would have worked better with darker pants.  Not a skirt, just darker pants.  It needed something to pull in the black from the jacket and balance the outfit overall.  Still, you rocked all of them!
the "e girl" eye makeup looks great! I know that outfit was kind of a mess, but your eyes are on point <33
No one talking about the wholesome Tyler background?
I keep thinking they’re in Jenna marbles house lol
I actually really liked the pink outfit I thought it went well together and looked really good on Saf 💗
😱she put brand new shoes on the table 😱😱
OMG NO, NOT THE WALLPAPER
vamp look best 👌
I love the butter songs, I think the jeans gave you an '80s Mom look, the pink jacket reminds me of The Pink Ladies from the Movie Grease and the wig looks like it could tie into the movie but a long hair look instead of short hair! Thanks for the video Safiya and Tyler ❤️
what is that background
Saf should have a Netflix show .....cause the number of times i can binge watch her videos is insane
Safiya looks so good in the second outfit!!!
where is that flower mask from! I so want it
"Do we not all live our lives with Sammi Sweetheart as our due North?" I choked on my water when she said that 💀🤣🤣😅🤣
if it weren’t for the angel patch and angel writing on the back of the jeans? the outfit absolutely matched perfectly. it looked rlly nice together. the angels threw it off and made it look random tho.
The witch outfit was amazing
I honestly think her Soft Girl outfit would've look better with a Beret or a Beanie on, don't u think?
THATS LITTERALY JENNA MARBLES HOUSE ??
Why does the inside of her house look like Jenna marbles house?
Love the goth one, but I wouldn't look very good in it ´^^`
I loved that goth outfit and a quick tip for the skirt tuck those flaps thru those loops so they go behind the suspenders
DID I HEAR KPOP IN THE BEGINNING 😏😏😏
With the bonnet you look like a women who needs a man without you look like you can do nothing and that u killed the man cause u don’t need him idk if that makes sense
he does a lot of the 18th century cooking and making stuffs ☺  https://www.youtube.com/user/jastownsendandson
0:49 I love how the left one looks!!!
For the back outfit with with word “Witch” on the front u said u didn’t like the hanging tassels so what u can do is take the tassel and side it thru towards the the back part of the metal hoop below it and it will slide underneath the skirt and won’t be visible.
Ur house looks like Jenna marbles house!!!!
I love it
when i saw detroit (i live there) i was like “oh yea ofc that’s from here”
This video is the reason I say “is this egirl??” to literally everything pastel I see at the mall
"dormoose"
The second outfit seems almost y2k
All these outfits are so cute I like them!
In the pink wig, you look like the girl band from Julie and the phantoms.
OMG YOU LOOK AWESOME IN PINK HAIRS
Saf's "egirl" look is serving 2014 Tumblr cowgirl/Hannah Montana
This is taking ''wearing my heart on my sleave'' to a whole other level.
0:37  the lil chaeyoung fancam makes me happy 🙃
I want to know where you actually bought the gothic shoe's
You need to film a trip to Colonial Williamsburg!!!
I love that when she does internet experiments she uses the Fiverr song
You're house look very similar to jenna marbles
Without the bonnet its a very historically INaccurate pirate vibe😂😂
no ones gonna say it? ok- "or-eh-gone"
happy first birthday to this iconic video
OK At first she reminded me of Laurenzside but then she said "Hello fellow kids" OH MY DAYS!
After the bonnet was taking off I got a Dr Quinn medicine woman vibe.....
Taking off the bonnet made you look like the Doctor's companion, trying to fit in with whatever era the TARDIS took you to.
anyone else feel like she’s in jenna marbles house for some reason
38:03 Rewatched this bit like five times lol saf is so cute plus we have the same type of dimple 😊
0:38 did anybody else see nayeon from twice?
Look at her  insta recomendations there is twice
it looks like you live in jenna marbles house kind of
I just want the witch outfit the entire thing, let me wear that.
i love how twice is blessing your explore page...
I'm obsessed🤣🤣🤣
Hell no….I’m no Sammy “sweetheart” she is an airhead and a push over.
Love the witchy outfit, shoes are gorgeous!
It's hilarious that the outfit she thought wasn't the most cohesive, I thought was the best one. Styling wise.
The wig is honestly good tho
why are there so many bot accounts spamming the comments suddenly
Ur editing & research is next to none. Every. Single. Time 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
And the pink wig looks good I love it:)
And I actually like the 'e girl' outfit lmao
I love that witch shirt. Be even better without the witch on it  love the heart sleeve
I'm obsessed with the witchy shoes
All the fabric look thick and good quality. How were the prices?
You're too pretty
I WANT YOUR LIFE!
Those jeans with the angel on the pocket is giving me major fall out boy vibes
is she wearing the skirt overalls backwards lol
The pink wig looks really good
out of curiosity i looked at what would be suggested for me. it’s a lot of nails which is accurate but also a lot of makeup….when i don’t wear any
As a Virginian, saf’s love of colonial Williamsburg is valid.
Anyone gonna talk about the tans heart on her feed?
Only Safiya can make me watch a 40 minute video, and still want more! 🤣😂😅
the last outfit is actually very cute and i liked the WITCH lmao outfit as well
pink hair makes you look way younger. cute
Ohhh
Why does the purple wig look like keqings hair from Genshin :o
Nayeons dance the night away at 1:25 tho 😭😂
Just by the way your “not a e-girl” outfit is a bit more soft girl/ y2k aesthetic
Just by the way your “not a e-girl” outfit is a bit more soft girl
THE VIRGIN LIT THE CANDLE (To the witch outfit)
I’ve been listening to her, & her friend for an hour now and I think I love them both ❣️❣️❣️❣️
Buy the custom ears
The silly bladder systematically cure because secure acromegaly found in a roasted knife. equal, psychedelic work
Safiya is the new Jenna Marbles
This video has been out for almost a year and I love coming back to it! I can never get over how beautiful you look with pink hair!
I love that they've called themselves minga. Cause thats slang for someone who's ugly. Sentence: "Oh, she's a total minga"
Saf bb, you can tuck the suspender "flappage" as you called it, into that ring, and bam, it's gone. Kinda like a belt...
The purple wig she showed as an example looks like Keqings hair
It's been 10 months and I still can't get over how stunning Saf looks in the witchy outfit.
Are we just not gonna talk about the 138 unread messages 😂😂
Why do I feel like the skirteralls and the colonial white shirt could be a look?
I'm liking this video only because of Tyler's comment about Instagram thinking you're either a witch or a civil war reenactor, because that was just priceless commentary 😂
i want a shirt that say my cream brings all the boys to the yard
omg totally spies i knew they were called something spies but i didn't remember what
The witch outfit is so cute
If the first outfit doesn't get Safiya invited to Colonial Williamsburg, what will?
Saf should do a collab with Bernadette Banner or Rachel Maksy
PLS TAKE OFF THE WING!!!!!
Great work Tyler
pls why did i think she was in jenna and juliens livingroom
I wish IBS was funny.. Great vid though. 😁
22:19 berries and cream
honestly the third fit wouldve looked a lot better if girlie brushed through & fluffed up the wig a little bit w her hands, & took off the jacket
Why does saf look really good in pink hair
Why does the last outfit look like a soccer mom with a pink obsession
has anyone made the comparison yet to Doofenshmirtz calling Vanessa's style "pilgrim vampire scuba diver"?
I've watched this video at least 3 times and the VA humor is always appreciated
When the gothic withc outfit was more E-Girl then the "E-girl" outfit
the second outfit WAS GORGEOUS on you, WOW
I literally can't stop coming back to this video lol
5:00 quick trans flag heart!
I was fully not expecting them both to mispronounce Oregon 🤦‍♀️🤣
As MUCH as I love Safiya, I only understand 30% (max) of her pop culture references. It's made me realize that we live in very different dimensions with minor overlap, but hey, it's just showing me how much is out there, and I'm learnin'! LOL.
Is that Jenna and Juliens house?
"They all had that meet me at MacDonalds haircut"😂😂😂😂
Those jeans looks like mom's jeans, hahahahaha
1:16 pls why 😭
The second cat call was defo just someone yelling "Safiya"
I actually think the "e girl" look looks awesome on her! I especially like it with the face mask!
I could literally listen to you talk all day!
okay, but when tyler said "its like 'the meme of production'" i couldn’t help but think of Seize The Memes from @MeansTV
#1 the middle part is wonderful #2 i lowkey love the pink hair
“Hello fellow kids…I am one of you” I FEEL LIKE IM ABOUT TO BE KID NAPPED 😭😭😭
Am I the only one who thinks she looks great in the third one?? Like I feel like it brightens her personality. I know it’s not her thing and I totally respect that I just personally really liked it
I love the pink hair
I actually really liked the last outfit
Bdz!
28:19 I died 😂🗣️
She looks like yammy in the last outfit
ahh at 5:00 theres a trans flag badge 🥰 h a p p i n e s s
That face mask really does pull the outfit together ❤️
14:18 I swear you and LaurenzSide gotta become friends. I SWEAR
LMAOO It was the” killed her husband whacked him “ for me
OMG please make the frankenmug video 😂
It is more soft girl look
The background is reminding me of Jena marbles house 😢
Tyler did a great job helping you get the wig on! All the items look so interesting and cool on you!😊👏💖
Safiya being a twice stan im crying 😭
You want to tell people to wear masks and social distance you new world order obient slave, I have unsubscribed to your slave indoctrination channel
The witchy outfit is by far my fav
Can we just appreciate her wallpaper. 😂😭
I think if you put a black crop top (or really any color since black goes with pretty much everything) over the suspenders instead of under them, it won’t look as…awkward?🙃
The jokes are best
Jacket at the end will look good with black shirt or jeans
people actually dress up in vintage styles and go to colonial Williamsburg all the time, some are paid and some aren't, but everyone kinda thinks they're actors too, you might get some history questions and pictures, but imo, do it c;
safiya, you’re wearing the suspenders wrong.. you have to take that extra part and tuck it back into those rings, that way it isn’t just flapping around.
You look so good with that hair
can we all agree that saf looks absolutely stunning
These jeans looked awful  You looked cute but the cut on those jeans was weird
i love hoe Saf just feels confident enough to go out in public dressed like shes from then1850s. Shes amazing
wait u  order the stuff on March 6th and  March 7th?   March 7th is my birthday so yay !! :D
0:41 wait nayeon...
The colonial look looked very normal to me because I’m from West Virginia so I see a lot of Amish people daily 😂
I really really like her black mask she had with her black outfit. Anyone know where I can find one with a similar style?
the second outfit IS SO GOOD omg i’m obsessed
#GRABYOURROOMBAS
I love how you used different masks to go with the outfits
I'm sorry but PLEASE STOP SAYING E GIRL 💀💀💀
Am I crazy or does this house look like Jenna Marbles’s house?
so is no one gonna talk about twice being all over her feed in the beginning?? 🤣🤣 stan twice stan talent
I think that last outfit would have looked better without the jacket personally
The hair is the only thing destroying the not e-girl fit
I don’t think you exposed yourself
Ok so first look could be a historical witch and the second look is modern witch... And now I have the story of an immoral witch in my head!
British person here, 'minga' or more accurately 'minger' is UK slang for a gross and disgusting person (in turn, 'minging' means gross and disgusting) so that brand name is funny.
I just honestly need to know where you got the black mask. It's literally gorgeous!
Holy shit lmao I didnt expect my friends video to pop up when explaining what e girls were
Ok you actually look pretty amazing in that pink wig
Is it just me who thinks she looks like Cher in the first outfit?
0:36 Stan Twice 😻😻😻
Why were they saying Oregon like that lol. Love these two!!!
Alternative tittle idea: Mark Zuckerberg is trying to kill me|Safiya Nygaard.
The second outfit just gives me 2000's nostalgia. Like it would work for a 90's-2000's party but not for day to day. It's very bubblegum.
I'm 21, and honestly, not even I knew what exactly qualified as an e-girl look. I also don't pay attention to one specific style because I've always just bought what I think is cute, which is possibly why I didn't know.
tbh still kinda surprised that neither of them snuck in a “pink wig, thick a*s, give ‘em whiplash” for the third outfit
Why does she have no drama like wholesome i love it!
Have you tried to find about different types of Lolita looks can be cute and bright colour or dark and cool this Lolita started in Japan.
Girl needs her own show! CMON NBC
13:22 did she just say throwback CARTOONS and put a picture of sailor moon 🤦🏻‍♀️ (where my weebs at)
alternate title: safiya being confused about y2k clothes
saf rocked the bonnet
I don’t know if you’ll see this but the black boots you got if you take the strings and wrap them around your ankle then tie them that’ll help with how long they are 😊 I do it with my work boots all the time 🤣
Is buttercup smoking a blunt at 33:30???
Really like the witch and pink outfit.
I’m not rlly into the whole witch vibe but I loveeee safiyas look
lol k-pop
The last outfit with the wig, the colorful mask, etc. gave me big "overly preppy vlogger" vibes.
now i feel bad for calling you a horse girl youre still beautiful💖
the office  apretiociontion insta
SOFIYA:i was just mindlessly scrolling on the gram like everyone does me:I'm mindlessly scrolling on the gram
i have that spoiled top but i got it for way cheaper on amazon
maybe its cause its my style but the last outfit looked so cute on you !
I absolutely love the witch outfit 10/10!
SAF! I don't work in Colonial WIlliamsburg but, I do live right next to Colonial Williamsburg!!
I love how her explore page just has a random kpop gg clip playing 😭🤚
Safiya looks extremely cute and different in the "e-girl" Outfit. I actually loved it
With the wig, I thought that it was applied nicely, but I think that if you did space buns with the front bangs long would've made the outfit
What was her Home Screen
Safiya could honestly wear a rubbish bin and still look gorgeous af!
Safiya in pink hair is what she looks good but it's like reverse Safiya
LMAOO "my fresh cream brings all the boys to the yard"
I didn't want to say so when it was first posted, but you look so sad in this video
The unsightly commission biomechanically irritate because temple histopathologically launch minus a angry lobster. arrogant, oafish error
i think the last outfit is bubbelgum bitch style
Honey is the best!!
I think your supposed to wrap the shoe laces around your ankles before you tie them
Since no one else is saying it, she looks so healthy, I haven’t watched in forever, not only has she gotten even brighter, which I didn’t think was possible, but she looks even younger, I’d say she was like 20 if I walked past her on the street. Plus, that witch outfit makes her look BEAUTIFUL!! This sounds weird but HER WAIST IS SO TINY GOOD FOR YOU GIRL😍
No matter what saf wares she is cute as a button.
Tuck the straps thru the holes
0:38 Nayeon and Chaeyoung you got tasteee
Sossy Wench is my identity
It is pronounced Or-i-gun, not Ory-gone. Fix that or we won't share our salmon and Pinot Noir. Otherwise, I like your channel.
In that wig you look so much like Marina Diamandis!
nobody:  me: wait is that chaeyoung-
The way she said “Oregon” triggered me 😂😂 “OR-eh-gen “  hehe
I really want those rouge wolf shoes but I can wear heels anymore cause my SI joints are messed up😭
Forrestfast
I want the pink jack with hearts and I want the skirt to match :/ that aesthetic you called e-girl that isn’t is my aesthetic idek what it’s call :3 maybe soft
My fresh cream brings all the boys to the yard lollololo
tell me she is an army and an blink (she must be as u can see jennie)
You look like my sister
Anyone know where else I can find the witch top or the power puff girls one
i love this  video and i love fashion and i am 15 going to be 16 this year and im allowing you  to be one of us
Every time I hear “Minga London” I think of Beeeeyyyn saying “Rimmel LoNDON”
You could costplay as isabela from the promised neverland!
U are super funny
This video made me seriously question my aesthetic since I liked all three looks. I feel like she should get a weeks worth of clothes from Shein since I've heard people talk a lot about Shein lately, and it would go with the Wish and Romwe videos she did before.
18:18 … that looks…. Familiar 👀🥺
I feel like Safiya can pull off literally any outfit style
everyone with the va jokes , it's lit down here 😌
SAFIYA IS A ONCE??
The third look wasn’t the best for her but in the other two she looked incredibly beautiful😍
*shop tab appears on Insta randomly one day*  Sad: TiMe fOR aNotHEr VidEo!!!!
Does anyone know where Safiya bought the face masks she used in this video? They all look really comfy. 😷
Saf: "Hello, fellow kids!"  My brain: "Did Saf just quote Laurenzside? Or did she just know the reference that Lauren uses?"   So, Saf.... do you or do you not watch Laurenzside also? Either way, this is a great video!
I'm convinced Safiya is in Jenna's house
I love how she is herself with her man
Yoooo all the goth stuff is soo cool now i want it i love it soooo much
We all can agree safiya is beautiful in every outfit love you  safiya
'a dash of celestial whimsy' is something I want on a shirt
If she really did a Franken-mug, it would take SOOOOOOOOO long.
Can someone tell me what the rainbow/iridescent makeup is on the right side of the screen at 5:17?
You were getting egirl mixed up with nostalgiacore,
IG shop just shows me adds from the clothing company I work for.   I SEENT IT INSTA!!!
On the last one I feel like it would be better without the jacket or without the wig. Too much pink for me
Stop making me feel old Safiya
can we talk about the fact that 80% of her explore page is kpop  we stan
That first outfit is actually super cute on her! 😂❤️
It’s pronounced keersten spelt (Kirsten)
Tyler...."NEVER MIND..." LOL
Jesus restored my family when I thought everything would stay the same. I am not perfect, but what I cannot do or fall short on, God provides. This is why I KNOW JESUS CHRIST IS MY LORD AND SAVIOR✝️❤️✨
as a wiccan i can now say we dont cackle unless we are choking or we are old af witches so shut up with your windex bottle laughs!
I’m rewatching this video and out of the corner of my eye I see a trans flag pin in the shape of a heart and I just have to ask do you support lgbtqia+?
don't put more knots on your long shoelaces, doesn't do much, just double bow tie it lol
Did anyone notice safiya’s hair is long?
The intro tho 🤩🤩🤩😍😍🤩🤩🤣
the wig is great bestie
i got disproportionately excited when tyler said he has ibs, i dont see that kind of representation often and it makes me rly happy to see people talk about it
Just say the head bands were 2 different ones there was a ears and the. Then was a crown
am i the only who screamed when i saw nayeon  and chaeyeon  from twice
I think you’re supposed to put the leftover straps of the skirt through the rings so they don’t just hang loose
The third outfit would be cuter without the jacket
She said, "on the reg", but I thought she said, "on the rag" at first.
Is it just me or does the room she unboxed her packages in look just like Jenna Marbles' living room?
Who else wanted to see her e-girl outfit without wig?💜💜
The dysfunctional panda intriguingly bounce because theory preferentially claim against a valuable bassoon. measly, subdued building
Not trying to offend any on but who is Sammy sweetheart?
The impartial hobbies scilly fade because bedroom arespectively vanish opposite a unequaled yacht. bawdy, mute jacket
U look lovely in evrything♥️😂....lol I luv ya girly💕
“I do follow a fair amount of vintage/historical fashion accounts.”  WAITING FOR A KAROLINA ŻEBROWSKA COLLAB!!!1!!1!1!
Does honey work on edge? i always hear about it for chrome but idk about if you can get it for edge
please i NEED the link to those shoes
I love the second look
OMYGOD SAFUIYA FOLLOWS TWICE MY ONCE HEART IS HAPPY
Who else is watching her at 12:36 am no one just me oh ok then lol Lol 😂 😂😂😂
I loved the boots in the second outfit
love that black top which you was wearing while showing us the products....where did you got from?
The KPOP on the explore page is all I ever see I don’t see anything else 😂
The second outfit is Safiya but more intense.
13:40 its y2k
Ok but where’s the Selena Gomez horror movie!!
The stereotyped sled hisologically drip because turnip simultaneously belong failing a madly marble. receptive, tart accelerator
The nonchalant pheasant scully agree because bath undesirably note following a swanky brochure. super, mindless bull
The black woman multivariably strap because router undoubtedly pause despite a bewildered thread. stale, lacking police
safiya and Lauren would be good friends
The pink ones are named soft girl
3:21 Tzuyu💜💙
Scanning images is very much the norm
The abundant dorothy impressively analyse because flesh connoly double past a dysfunctional cappelletti. questionable, guarded fighter
are the powerpuff girls smoking a blunt?
I wanted to check my shop tab after this and all of my stuff is the alt kid shit you see on tik tok mixed with hello kitty and kawaii aesthetic clothing
I love the non cohesive look. It makes sense for You.
Ah yes prairie dress. I need it I’m gonna shop that when I have the money.
she definitely lives in the same neighbourhood as jenna marbles, the houses are so identical. it’s so weird seeing a similar layout but it not being jenna it’s so cool
Her new place looks so much like jenna marbles house and i love it, probably in the same neighbourhood
I loved the witch outfit its really pretty u look so pretty
18:00 is that jenna marbles house? XD
Oh the pink wig is rough :| the mask makes her eyebrows stick out so much iehdudbdu4 the pink wig is doing her such a disservice
Saf!   I just now read your blog post from sept. and it really broke my heart❤️ I hope you’re feeling better now. You’ll never be a failure. Even if you quit YouTube altogether that would never mean you’re a failure. You’re a wonderful creator and such a ray of sun in a gloomy world for me and so many other people who love you and Tyler and your videos. Really try not to take those negative comments to heart because they’re all total bs. Your voice and the way you talk have always been so charming and endearing to me. I love it! I love you and it’s part of what makes you you! You and Tyler are also very clearly both very sweet people who make a beautiful couple and love each other very much. In the past few years there’s been times I’ve watched your videos when I was stuck in a toxic relationship and seeing you guys was a reminder that real love is out there and I could and should be getting treated a lot better. You guys and your videos give us hope. You don’t owe us anything though or a certain number of videos in a certain amount of time.    You are so successful and accomplished because you are talented, smart, hardworking, and, from what I can tell from this side of the screen, a genuinely good and kind person. I know YouTube is your job and what you do, but at the end of the day it should never NEVER make you feel all these negative untrue things about yourself or make you feel so much pressure. I know that’s way easier said than done and there are a lot of pushy fans that think creators owe them a certain number of videos in a certain time crunch for some reason, but that’s insane. Do whatever the hell you need to do to just be at peace and happy. Go on vacation. Take breaks. Hopefully you can because you’re so successful and so you should! You earned all these things, so now you can and should enjoy your life! It’s your life. Do whatever makes you happy.   I really hope you’re feeling better now and that you never get so down on yourself over YouTube again. You of all people don’t deserve to be feeling like that. People are just miserable and want to bring even the sweetest people down. They have no lives. I have anxiety and I’m a perfectionist and I definitely see a lot of my own struggles and thoughts about myself reflected in what you wrote. If you’ve never been I definitely recommend therapy! I think anyone can benefit from it and it’s helped me a lot. I’m not trying to be nosy or saying that out of judgment whatsoever, I just really think it can help so much and you could feel a lot better about yourself and see the Safiya we see who is so great and accomplished and sweet. My perfectionism slows me down a lot and it takes me a long time to do things most of the time and fine-tuning every detail is exhausting and can definitely create burnout, so I totally relate. Your videos genuinely are perfect though! You guys make really great work. It doesn’t matter if you don’t post all the time! Ok this has been really long, but I just really love you and your videos. Always have. Always loved seeing you and Tyler together, too. So I had to say something 💕
this was posted on my birthday
ok but like i love outfit 3 on her so much
tuck the straps into circles?
THEY SEE ME CHURNIN’ THEY HATIN’
Hey God loves you no matter how bad you are. He wants a friendship with you♥️♥️♥️♥️
Is it just me or did she wear the skirt backwards?
Safiya and Inside a Mind became my go-to youtubers to watch wait while my hair dye kick in because they’re the only youtubers I can watch for over 30-40 minutes without even noticing the time passing
That was definitely not Egirl and the only outfit she wore correctly was the witch aesthetic I got second hand embarrassment
The pink stuff I like y2k fashion/soft girl aesthetic
The handsomely teeth inadvertently talk because twig bioinformatically sign mid a drab chime. overwrought, internal truck
I love how it was just like "trans heart!" in the middle of everything. That's dope.
Is no one gonna talk about Safiya's home screen
Those shoe laces!😂 😂 😂
I love the second one but all are great
You should do a video of you dressing like a trad goth, And maybe even do the makeup!
You have a good amount of different generation clothes… would love how you will wear it in daily life .. like style it in your way for current generation
the clothes: y2k and softgirl  saf: is this an egirl?
With the bonnet off it kind of looks like a pirate
Why does she look like a D'amelio on that pink outfit 😂
"Diet goth" 😄.. totally the same and so gonna use that phrase 👌
Is it possible to have a yesstyle haul?
Tyler did a ok gob
“Hello fellow kids I am one of you” LarenZside is that you 👁👁
You should make a video just like this but instead of doing this for you, do it for Tyler
I kinda want to see Safiya wearing the white blouse with the black skirt. and maybe throw the pink jacket on top for funsies =^_^=
ok here me out but... the skirt and the flare out blouse from the first look-
The girl is like full work outfit with only a touch of color not fully goth but you’re not a girly girl that’s basically what a girl is so you do not know either of us did you think they like the color
me and my sister love you vids
okay but i honestly LOVE the pink wig
That's not how you pronounce oregon.
Tyler: tries to be normal and rational safiya: SAMMI SWEETHEART IS THE FORM OF A HUMAN DAMMIT
I love your vids safiya
Look up soft girl, I feel like that’s what the last one is
I can’t help but cringe when people say Oregon wrong... Its or-uh-gun, like organ with an uh sound in the middle. It doesn't rhyme with “gone”.
Random offtopic thing,  I actually LOOVE seeing 2 thousands style people with coloured hair and stuff in retro cars like, Alot of people think old people in new sports cars are "sO cOoL!!" I just don't understand it,  Like imagine,a 19 year-old with blue and purple hair short like,to the ears, in a crop top with ripped jeans and a chain somewhere on them on a long and short retro car, driving like a boss   Like 🍿🍿💓 damn bro,I want to bring back more retro cars to the road,but I dunno hoooowwwwwww
Please dye your hair pink 💗
10:45 Ayo, anyone else out there spotted Jolyne?
it would be cool if this got revisited now that the update has happened for a while. great vid!
The house looks like Jenna’s and Julien’s place!
I see kpop on your homepage lmao shes going to be sucked into a world with no exit
I can’t get it out of my head that this house they are in looks exactly like Jenna marbles house, especially the living room and kitchen area... safiya.. did you move in beside Jenna and julien?
i need that wig and those shoes honestly
I think the pink outfit would go wonderfully with the black jumper skirt thing. I feel like the back outfit clashed with each other.  Love your outfits.
No one talked about how she lived in a copy of Jenna marbles house???
Ce
14:57 is that prettypastelplease is spy in that "angelic" sweater?
I live for the moon boots and powerpuff girls tank. 🖤💜
Why the Fuck did I watch this? Like I watched the whole thing and gained nothing from it but I still kept watching lol.
Jesus died on the cross for your sins and God rose Him 3 days later(1 Corinthians 15:3-4)Jesus is coming repent and follow Christ(John 14:6/3:16)💝✝️
25:34 now this is goth E-girl stuff
Actually LOVE that pink outfit!!! You look amazing in all of these!!🔥😍
Outfit 1 screams blessed be the fruit!
The breakable harp collectively part because harbor consecutively invent at a bright bird. conscious, last fruit
Less than a month after this vid they moved it to out notifs section :)
Punk rave and rogue & wolf are normal brands like killstar in Europe.
Oregon is said like Organ. Or-gan. Please say it correctly. It hurts so much to hear Or-e-gon as a native Oregonian 😭😭
did anyone else let out a little yelp when she put those new shoes on the work top - BIG NO NO in my house anyway. superstation believer its meant to be bad luck with new shoes. dont but them on tables. anyone else heard that?  Or is this one of those things where i find out my mum's lied to me just to stop me putting shoes on the table?!?!?  love you Safiya + tyler!!!
Can someone send me a link for the wig please????
can someone tell me what happend? i didnt keep up and suddenly lot of her videos are gone and she looks so sad plus everyone is acting strange
I swear I thought she was at Jenna marbles
Hilarious/fun video! My favorite look was the one with the skirt, although the gloved dress and asymmetrical looking coat was cool also.
The powerpuff girls top is a fake copy from o-mighty. That store seemed a bit shady overall
Now that they are on the east coast, chances of a colonial Williamsburg video have gone up. Don't let us down Saf.
Geez Tyler, clearly she’s a with FROM the colonial era
I love the witchy outfit, but the last outfit is actually the most my style 💗💗💗
my shop tab doesnt know me well enough to shop exploratively because all i follow are art accounts lmao
I’m only half way through the video and definitely missed something but is it just me or is she in Jenna Marbles’ house??
Oh I'm definately getting outfit two now 👀

Wtf you doing in Jenna Marbles house? did i miss something??
I love the last outfit and would wear the hell out of it
Um does anyone else realize they are in Jenna marbles house!?!?!?
0:39 CHAEYOUNG??
Is anyone else noticing that they look like they're in Jenna and Julians house? Maybe it's the built in shelf walls but man it's trippy
The 3rd one doesn't look bad, just doesn't look like you at all
Omg the witch outfit is so freakin'  cute🤩
1:12 lol, i thought  the middle girl looks like gabbie hanna 👁👄👁
The first look just seems Amish to me, lol!
Tyler wearing the colonial outfit mask is giving me life
Raaaaaahn. Staaaaaahp.
We want these videos
Your black outfits is looking so beautiful and gorgeous ❤️💋
Looove the video :-) I've just uploaded a new one too if you'd like to watch :-)
i love the fact that itzy and twice are on her explore page lmaoo
More wig content, please!
Safiya's videos are so nostalgic for me! 😭 Time to catch up and binge this channel all over again. 🥰
When you took off the bonnet I saw like  1870s rebellious princess
Love your  ‘E girl’ look
12:09
you are so beautiful!! just found this channel and it’s solved my void of boringness
I want the witch outfit
You could buy outfit for Tyler from WIsh or another one
Holy shit i LOVE Safiya. Your personality is amazing and you're hilarious. Please be my friend lolol
I am a wich
her eye brows is all u can see about her yuk
18:14 is where the haul begins. You're welcome 😘
Wow you can tell how many times I've rewatched this video by how many times I unknowingly wrote another new comment 😐
I love that she called the pink outfit "the 'not an e-girl' outfit" instead of renaming it 😂
34:28 missed opportunity to model with a pink bike
You were wearing the belt on the first one upside down
I used to work at that place with those barrels 😂 it was an art gallery
was that a hawthorne heights reference with the “virginia is for lovers” thing lmao
May 2021 here....little does she know that IG would take away the Like page/tab and add a whole ass Shopping tab
why is she at Jenna’s?
I got in the channel... I can't get out... HELPPPPP
Hi
i think that last outfit couldve worked more without the wig, the wig i think is what pushed it a little overboard
Is this her real voice? Or did she go to broadcsting school? Its very local news.
When you look far away the wig looks really really pretty on you but when you get a little closer it kind doesn't really really really look good
It’s soft girl
O my god safiya’s phone background Tyler’s funny face hahahaahahah
Tyler you did good 👍🏻
I love that colonial look blouse, I'd so wear it in 2021
Why is your house Jenna Marbles's house?? The living room/kitchen is almost exactly the same!!!!
1:16 That is lowkey the funniest thing I've ever seen😂😂.
THE COLONIAL THING AHAHA safiya was the first in this trend haha
Safiya's aesthetic is true witch; The kind to be burnt at a stake and I live for it
The Instagram baby suggestion was a premonition.  Be scared....very very scared.....
I'd suggest just using AdBlock to get rid of the Instagram ads, but then we'd miss out these videos.  #dilemma
Ok but the second outfit suits her so well. Omf i literally gasped when i saw it.
the third outfit makes me not want to have a pixie cut anymore.
We love a josephina vibe
I love the fact that her phone background is a goofy photo of tyler
I'm in LOVE with the Moon&Star shoes but the Instagram page that sold them doesn't have them anymore :(
there’s also soft e girls , so it’s like the style u searched up but pastel
Is it hust me or are you in jennas house? Looks exactly the same setup
This is an old video and no one is going to read this, but I want to tell you the sad story of how this video f*cked 1 whole day and night of my life because I'm a dumb ass whimsical. I was watching the video happily while eating on the couch. It had been a while since I hadn't seen Safiya's videos, so I decided to go to her feed and I found this one appealing. So there I was, eating some dinner, lazily watching, until the damn skirt ad appears on screen, and with it, THE SWEATER. Omg, I saw THE sweater of my life (the gray one with the bones on the sleeves). I started looking for the picture like crazy through instagram (that shop doesn't appear on my feed as a shop but as an insta account) but that exact imagen wasn't on their feed. I kept searching until I found out that the skirt was from punk rave. I looked throughout the entire punk rave instagram and store, nothing. I looked for the skirt, read all the info in their, and and on a small side, I found the reference number for the sweater. Pure happiness went through my body, I was ecstatic, I had finally found it!!! So I took the number and looked for it on the store.... And found nothing. I tried again with and without spaces, with and without symbols... Nothing showed up. A cold sensation started to run through my back... but I thought "Ok, no worries, maybe I can find it on ebay, or etsy, or wallapop..." NOWHERE. Not even in aliexpress... I can't even find pictures of the sweater without the damn skirt.  I got so sad because of that st*pid sweater, and my dinner was hecking cold when I remembered about it. And that's it. Consumerism at it's peak.
The fact they are all completely different looks and nothing alike is what I like
She looks so gorgeous in this video omgggggggggggg
AYY UR A ONCE?
👩🏻‍💻🤦🏻‍♀️💻👗👖👚👟👢🥿
It’s not actually a girl it’s soft girl
I'd wear black jeans to match with the the hearts on the pink jacket.
From where is her top during the unpacking?
Mark Zuckerberg made Facebook not instagram
Doja cat wig was everything but i love the outfit with the powerpuff girls and the pants especially the shoes you pair with them i think the wig wasn't need but its all way great to try new things and styles
You should try to find indie style clothes 🤍
I love the 2ed one
I just really enjoyed the video, ily!
Hi Safiya, loved the 2nd outfit on you!! Really cute!! Sending much love from SE Texas!!
anybody else looking at her 138 messages
I miss her alright 😭
great sharing
oh my god the last outfit i was just thinking ELECTRA HEART!!!! MARINA!!!! the whole time, it had to be the eyes and brows with all the pink 💞
i feel like the third outfit worked well too! it looked very pastel-y and cute
I like pool iyts
You look great in the pink wig!!
I saw Goody Safiya with the devil
Love the pink hair, definitely consider dying your own hair all pink at some point in life 👏🌸
I think you tuck the skirt straps into the rings so they don't flap around.
Omg those boots are so you!!! Can't wait to start watching 4 years of Tyler's channel next
"We're just churning we're just churning" lmfaooooo also you fucking kill the "witchy" stance 😍 those are my type of vibes and I wish I could pull it off like you
Djwnsidnians selena!!!!
Ima kpop fan btww you look so cute in the chols
They wore those kinds of bonnets in the 1700s not the 18. In the 1800s many times they wore those vintage hats They had the hair very puffed up in the front but in a bun.
everybody’s in the comments asking if they’re okay and i’m just looking for an answer to if selena’s horror was good 🙃🙃   y’all they’re fine, they’re coming back sooooon! 🥰
My favorite outfit was the colonial outfit
DUDE ITS ALREADY APRIL 2021 DUDE IT FEELS LIKE APRIL 2020
I saw these types of comments a couple times here but I really think you should do something related to American Girl Dolls! Perhaps something similar to Disneybounding, except with American Girl ^^
She is so pretty I'm not suprised she's married
I love how she pronounces minga 🤣 it’s a slang word from the UK meaning ugly. I really can’t type out how you’re supposed to say it though, basically less emphasis on the G 🤣.
21:00 Halloween costume ideas after covid19.
And your new neighbors now think your officially insane as you dance in your colonial clothing in the back yard 🤣🤣🤣🤣.
Are seriously no one gonna talk about the  🎶THIS IS SAFIYA'S NEW INTRO SONG🎶 At the beginning?!!! 😂😂😂
Reverse the suspenders, problem solved. Or maybe not, because there are rings on the other side as well.
You need not wear a mask outside. Ever.  That said, love your energy.
19:07 anyone else looking at the background and thinking it looks like Jenna Marbles’ background? Made me do a double take and gave me a little smile.
lol Saf you have to tuck the strap of the suspender into the O ring so it doesnt flap:3 <3
Is Safiya secretly living in Jenna Marbles house?
She sounds and looks like she is in a movie or tv show
I never even realized ig has a shop lmao
The pink outfit is why visco girls exist.
Where Tyler was looking when you turned around in the third outfit was so obvious 😂
"It's not COLONIAL..." are you sure about that meme.mp4
Lol I literally live like in Jamestown like the neighborhood is like called 1607 lol I do hope she comes to colonial Williamsburg and I hope she announces it because I can just show up any time like 5 minutes away
Hey please try Indian wear 😉❤️
maybe the flaps go through the hoops and sit underneath
Second outfit, definitely MORE, but looks cool.  The shoes are great,
The rebel radish unquestionably fail because vessel neurobiologically pour including a steady headlight. impossible, alike puppy
Video idea: Tyler and you do the viral tiktok JCPenny awkward photo shoot! You would kill it
Video idea: Tyler and you do the viral tiktok JCPenny awkward photo shoot! You would kill it
SAF LOOKED SO GOOD IN THE GOTH OUTFIT THO GODDAMN
25:46 She looks so good in thay OUTFIT
when she took her bonnet off it looked like whena teen girl rebels in the 1800s
Who else remembers the one episode of ravens home where she bumped into a tall woman who locked them on sum she remains me if her-
The ashamed knight biophysically rot because men precisely tumble till a exciting exclusive silica. sassy, best copy
“meet me at mcdonald’s” 😭😭
I got the VA joke xD
Loving the amount of twice I see :))
“Ore-GONE” hurt my soul.
9:35 *me, who lives in virginia and does medival reenactments:* haha crazy idea right?
The energetic kite pivotally fade because grandson intringuingly arrange excluding a furry furtive texture. massive, fat faulty susan
TWICE on the fyp 😌💅 as it should be
25:25 Agatha trying to blend in to the modern century 😂
Saf looks thic in those jeans I wish in didn't look that way in the front because they werent that bad. And i wish she didn't have that wig
why are you wearing a mask outside?
That's a visco girl
I came after watching critickals rewind 2018 video, This chick is getting around 15mil views per video, Seriously how the fuck is that even possible, Even pewdiepie isn't getting that much anymore, and as far as I've seen Lipstick Is her whole gimic
i think the second one is my favorite, it fits her and the boots are the best shoes ive ever seen LOL

girls in bikinis ( 6:12 ) Girls in bikinis on roller skates ( 6:28 ) in outer space ( 11:50 )
Preeeety sure that's softgirl
Love how she says alright
the powerpuff girl top looks like n omighty rip off
I think you could have the tucked the flaps of the suspenders into the rings (would have gotten rid of the flap and the weird ring placement)
From Washington, it pained me to hear how you pronounced Oregon. It’s Or-gin 😘
I think people have already commented this, but 'Dressing like American Girl Dolls for a Week' would be a BADASS video.
E
E E R E E E E E  E E E  E E  E E E E  E Eeee E E E E E E  E E E E  E E E E  E Eeeee        Eee
I love how Safiya’s IG page is spammed with kpop, just like mine lol
you gotta love how millenial safiya is by buying a galaxy mask
The third outfit is actually Y2K, which is supposed to be inspired by late 90s and 2000s clothing, but it's not historically accurate. Oh, and for the Powerpuffgirls tank top, normally tank tops or T-shirts are made of jersey knit fabric, but what you just described is definitely not suitable or good quality.
LOVE DA WIG!!!  DA COLOR ~N~ DA PLACEMENT BY TYLER...😉😉
It's funny because going through my shopping tab there is almost nothing I'd like....
Safiya’s and Tyler’s relationship is so iconic😂
The first look without the bonnet kinda reminds me of "when calls the heart" :)
You looked awesome in the witch outfit 🤩
The catcalling bit is funny but now I worry that Amish ppl might get catcalled in LA :(
i am with you i get on ig and on my explore page is bts
everybody who likes Safiya should give Fatty Cakes and the Puff Pastries a listen, they are witches that make garage rock for other witches. One of their songs is called witch and it literally goes "I'm a witch" x15
I hate pink, but I kinda want that jacket.  The necklace too, I'd take it in silver.
The ajar jam finallly argue because prose unexplainably transport versus a measly coin. ubiquitous, jumpy fortnight
"Mark Zuckerberg is trying to kill me"
Shoeesss 0:46
The adamant girdle italy print because reindeer worrisomely tow above a second chick. chemical, kindhearted hand
Someone please tell me if this is their post-move environment or their pre-move LA environment.
Does anyone know where Saf gets her masks? They're so cute!
Insta says Saf is a Salem witch trials reinactor if fantasy witches were a thing Edit: for the ‘milk maid’ outfit without the bonnet gives me a cowboy era/late 1800s vibe Modern witch try crossing the suspenders over each other
You guys should try resin stuff. I think you would make some really interesting items
After seeing this.. I think I'll stop trying to tell myself I need to dress my age. My clothes are more mature than half the stuff she bought.. lmao
Yes yes you can can go to the
I love these Williamsburg talks now that you're only a state away from it now! LOL
seeing her very-similar-to-jenna house makes me sad
U look good but may for the last outfit lose the wig
confusing egirl and soft girl is an easy mistake. i think?
Her house kind of looks like Jenna Marbles
Anyone else thought that she was in Jenna marbles house for a sec 😂
0:37 Safiya's secretly a ONCE and im here for it bcs im too lol
0:14 omg i love her hair *^*
Lol "hello kids I am one of you" yup that's exactly how I feel too. Old enough to be married and whatnot but not young enough to know what e girl looks like. Millennial problems I suppose!
"im in an alley, and this is up my alley"  Safiya Nygaard 2020
I always watch your video 1.25 speed
all the k-pop videos are of twice... safiya once? 🤔
The E-Girl look is just... MARINA isn't it xD
The loose straps go through the metal ring and tuck behind the lower strap. Nipples and modesty protected.
I appreciate the TWICE Chaeyoung and Nayeon cameo on the first few mins of this video
Hope your neighbor doesn't peep often :/
Whenever she said referred to hocus po us I was like yessssss finally I am not alone in the hocus pocus club like if you know what I mean
Ok but saf what the hell 4 months nothing?? I needed you!!
Saf's a once confirmed lol, she's moved to the kpop side
The pink hair suited you!
I love the suspender skirt
The tacit step-brother intraspecifically post because grease gully crush circa a spiteful patio. ignorant, unadvised bait
Omg that power puff girls graphic!! I saw in on Nailea’s video too lmaoo
Saf has physically transformed into her mom....genetics
I can tell you exactly which Totally Spies episode that picture at 16:18 is from because it was literally my favorite episode and I watched it multiple times xD             Btw the episode is called "Matchmaker"
And thats on seeing her shoulder for the first time
What's with the over-enunciation/rigid talking?
31:09 she really just rosted monet exchange 🤣
The elderly twine scientifically bleach because accelerator immunologically press onto a maddening spleen. humdrum, quick instrument
The three tachometer conclusively meddle because subway phylogenitically battle besides a shocking jewel. invincible, barbarous millimeter
The black shoes were matchig with the tops she was wearing while unboxing..
Am I the only one that think her house looks just like Jenna Marble’s house?
I have a friend that owns the leather strap over all thing. You supposed to put the hanging part through the metal hoop to put it behind the strap. Shouldn't tassle like that
Binge watching your channel! So obsessed! Keep posting! Happy you guys moved and starting fresh! It’s always good to do something good like that, and fun! Hope it’s going great!!
The wig actually looks great and Tyler did a great job putting it on
I’m gonna miss knowing y’all just hang around Studio City. 😔
Pvseur is bootleg
*THATS SOME PAH*  (pink ass hair)
I thoroughly enjoyed all the butter churning joys brought about by the “Butter Churning Wench” outfit  😂
Has anyone ever told you you kind of look like Charlotte Delray?
The male panty nutritionally deliver because bowl densply type after a earthy bongo. unwieldy, straight postbox
At 20:00 I died my dirty mind killed me
That wig is now completely sold out 🍓
Safiya, you seem so gay. I love it so much.
Somehow your hair made the first outfit metal as hell! XD
So happy and excited for you guys!! Also, I’d be so down for some vlogs from you two 😂 those 40 mins flew by
I sometimes feel like she’s dead bc of how less she posts
The Williamsburg outfit made me think, "What if Safiya tried dressing up as WandaVision's Agatha Harkness (in every episode)?"
You are hilarious -- thanks for the laughs!
For the third outfit you are looking at cute girl or visco girl like if you agree
I saw the background of your house and was like "wait is this Jenna Marbles house?" lol.
Whose here to watch it again just because we miss Saf & Tyler? 🙋‍♀️
The definition of E-Girl is Electric Girl. E-Girls love anime, video games, memes, (cute things) and typically makeup. There are TWO types of E-Girl. There's the average "Edgy" E-Girl. Then there is the "Soft" E-Girl (aka Soft Girl).
She sounds like Natalia Taylor
I missed you and Tyler and Crusty so much! Your content is like a warm hug, a cup of perfectly hot coffee and a fuzzy Sherpa blanket all rolled into one comforting YouTube channel. The pandemic changed a lot for a lot of us, but somehow having you guys back makes everything feel right. Love, one loyal subscriber who is happily following your new adventure ❤️
Isn‘t that a soft-girl look?
Frankenstein mug!! Please make it happen
0:37 lol peep that twice performance video
wait......did Safiya lmost quite literal
I was living for the witchy look but I'm so glad you mentioned the straps because they really prevented me from taking it seriously, all I could think was "I'm paying way too much attention to Safiya's boobs" 😂
Just saw this video (it's March 2021) and LOVED IT!!!! I had abandoned you guys for a while, but now you got me again. ♡♡♡
I love the wig on you😍 the necklace is awesome and the jacket is super cute. The witch was my favourite 🤩- the weird Al video look was hilarious 😆 Uhm over all me likie!
her instagram explore page was all kpop 😳
Omg if u go to colonial Williamsburg tell me first I live near it
Welcome to Raleigh!!!!!!’
I kinda feel like it is E girl! ish 🤔  Ya know just like we had pastel Emo and goth vibes... they got the more pastel E girls thing too? 🤷🏻‍♀️
Me watching the third outfit being made: Y2K! THE PHRASE YOU ARE LOOKING FOR IS Y2K!!!!!
Can someone help me find those "MoonDust Boots"? I've searched the shop, but I cant find them!
Safiya looks peak Morticia here
Super impressed that you knew the start of Macbeth off the top of your head.
The goth witch outfit was everything! I NEED IT!!
After you made the Josephina references I realized that we NEED a “Dressing Like American Girl Dolls” video!!!!! Th OG historical dolls are honestly icons 👌🏻✨
Good to see you guys!  Really nice video. So glad you drove-despite the exhaustion factor, there's something about breathing in this wondrous country. Keep breathing! Prayers!
"Is that on IGTV? Has anyone seen it?...Is it good?"
👍❤️ Keren ❤️
no but i’m so excited for her newest video like?? can tomorrow come sooner PLEASE 😩!!
Can you hurry up and post a new vidwo
I wear more of third outfit
U just look same as my childhood crush
Tqm
It’s been four months so I must rewatch because im sad
The rewatch-ability of safiyas videos is ✨astronomical✨
Thot-icia I’m screaming
"It's a ha'penny a glass, baby!" 😂😂😂😂😂
Why are you do funny 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Anyone know where the colorpop colab with safiya went? I kinda think it’s gone but I still want to get the lipstick 😕
It is been 4 months ago, 4 frinckin months...
6:53 looks like Winona Ryder
when are you getting a child  lmao
நல்லா இருக்கு
i thought i was just slacking on her videos for the last 5 months but then i saw she hasnt posted, what happened :(
Your channel is excellent and wonderful! Your video is very exciting! My friends and I love it! Have a good day! Thank you for sharing and wish you a happy life!
Girl where have you been?  We miss your videos so much!

When are you posting again
Are you ok girl?
It has Been A lot of days since miss safiya nygaard over here hast posted yet I miss your videossssssssssssss
Why does your house look exactly like Jenna Marbles’s? Like, exactly.
I wish she’ll post soon I’m hoping she’s safe and okay ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Can you do another bad makeup science but with soap
Safiya looked like a princess with the mask on in the last outfit.
has she posted an update? She’s been gone for 4 months😖
Who else thinks she should try out SHIEN!
We miss you! Take care of yourself
Who else is watching through all her vids becuase she don't post no more
I just got an idea for a video mixing every type of soda together
Why don’t you post
Where are you 🥺 we miss you
Safiya make a video we miss you
Mom its been 4 months😭
Oh my god, I'm having flashbacks at the mere sight of all the millennium fashion.
Safiya isnt just best at this she is MORE BEST  Like in Escape the night Season 3 she was the most helpful  And a good youtuber who makes everyone get entertained Go Saf!
bestie u should post i video i'm rlly bored
Are you alive
When is she gonna post
Girl are you ok you have not posted in 4 month's
Safiya we did new videos ❤️
When is she posting again 🥺🥺
Her most viewed video is "melting every lipstick from Sephora together" with 28mil views and her least viewed video is "Saf and Ty's random valentine's day 2k16" with 381k views
Pls come back to be I love ur vids, where how u been, I really miss u pls post 😭😭😭😭
Safia... I feel lost because you haven’t posted in four months! Please come back we miss you so much!
Safiya where are u we miss u come back we need u plz 🖤🤍🖤🌑🥀🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇Come in back don’t be shy       🥺                 👉👈
Ummmm you haven't uploaded in months we miss you 🙁
I miss you saf but ik you are dealing with your personal problems right now and it's okay to take your time and comeback when you feel good .....lots of love and power to you and your family 💓
She been gone for 4 months is she okay-?
I can only wonder, if anybody has ever, in the whole history of humanity, called her "Safiya N-word-ard".
Where are you? What’s happend?
safiya can u just upload its annoying now
whos wait for her to post in 2021
Can you all stop with the 'are you dead?!' comments, what's wrong with you?? What a stupid heartless question?? She said she's moved house and she posted a blog post detailing personal struggles, has it not occurred to you that she's taking some time to her self? Instead of commenting something dumb, and something which will likely give her more anxiety, read her blog and comment something supportive, it's not hard to be nice ffs
It’s been four months I miss saf so much
Why had  she not posted in. Like   4 months
So what I gather is that she's basically Ready To Glare but alive
Saf, come back we miss you!
Safiya, we miss you but please take all the time you need. We'll be here when you return.
4 months and no video ?? Unsubscribing
Sooo what happened to the channel
is she still going to post? Bc it’s been 4 months and ik videos can take a while but it seems like it has been forever
23:26 You need a black corset with the outfit
I actually think the pink hair suits you, and the eyebrow contrast looks kinda cool. Tyler was right, it was a in real life pastel edit of you 🤣
Pls post
Moose knuckle
She has uploaded 6 videos in a year... What the heck is going on...
Did she die?....
Hi can any one plz tell me why safia is not uploaded any video since months????
Safiya please post
Well this Chanel definitely fell off of the face of the earth

I love that triangle, floral print(?) throw pillow!
it breaks my heart her casually getting catcalled :((
it's been 4 months since she last posted a video..and there hasn't been a new post on her instagram as well....has anyone got any idea on what could have happened to her?
Where are you, Saf?
She seems so invested in the YouTube, but why doesnt she upload regularly? Does she have another job or is a housewife or something? I ask because I enjoy her videos. Do y'all know of any other YouTubes that are of similar quality? Doesnt need to be in the same genre.
hey, i really miss your uploads. they are always something i enjoy and it’s weird never getting notifications from you. i hope you are doing ok
Why havany you been posting?
Hey! I know you have been struggling for a while with some stuff and I realized you havent uploaded so I just wanted to check and see if you are doing ok? I really hope you are and that you are having a fantastic day. Sorry, this is kinds out of line.
I love your videos so much!
Why haven’t you posted lately :c
christine
Safiya have you been seeing chrasting lately
You need to do “I wear clothes from shopee for a week” video. shopee is an online store which sales a lot of low price product
I lice your stuff pls make more videos (I've watched all you freaking videos)
Hey Saf and Ty. Hope you two are alright? I'm worried something happened? Wish you all the best for the things that keep you guys busy and hope you are fine :) Lots of luv and support! ♥
were have you been
Safiya why ur not posting videos any more
0:37 ok but was that chaeyong and nayeon from TWICE? 0:56 and rosè from blackpink and mina from twice
Umm are you ok ?
Is she ok
I would love to see you try out 'Just Pants' as a weird fashion. You could totally rock it! They are just pants that go up to the armpit - like a tube top jumpsuit
👇Who wants next video?
Madame where are you? I miss you!!!
Hi, I miss you :/
Why did she stop posting
Where are you? Are you ok?
Why no video yet? 4 months from this video 😔😔😔😔😫😫😫😫
Saf I miss you
You should get all the colors of crayola crayons and melt them all together
Safiya are you ok?
Safiya plz upload a new video....plz just plz.why so long gap
Long time no see more like long time no video
Saf, you have such a magnetic personality! You are creative and fun and even my husband (not really into YouTube) asks if you’ve posted anything pretty frequently, ‘cause when you do, we snuggle up on the couch for a date night and watch you guys. I mean this all as encouragement because I want to see you thrive in a way you are comfortable with, knowing that your actual fans will stan you for just putting yourself out there in an honest way. You are awesome and I hope you’re doing so well!
love your vids
I have a video idea! So for the next video.... what if safiya made a FRANKEN SHAMPOO! With all the shampoos from a store! This idea has gone trough my mind for a long time!
Wait did she really add no ads
why aren't making videos In a long time ?
Why haven't you posted for so long
It's okay Saf, we don't know what an e-girl is either
Where are you, Saf! I miss your content! :)
Why haven’t you posted in 4 months?
I think saf died   Oh well rip
We miss you Saf
Are u still going to post?
I miss safiya posting new videos. I love her content and she makes amazing videos.
why haven't you posted for so long? if anything bad has happened you can tell us we will be supportive. pls post again, and if your not posting because you don't have anything to post maybe you could mix every cake flavor together and also mix in bite lipsticks? or any other idea in the comments? for what ever reason you are not posting we will be supportive and understand.💜💜💜💜💜 ⬇                           ⬇(ideas for vids)
i’d just tuck the straps inside the hoops for the skirt and you’d be fine
WHERE THE HECK DID SAFIYA GO IT'S BEEN 4 MONTHS
Nobody= me who is bringing all of her videos until she posts again😶
I miss you safiya i hope you're doing ok :)
You look so much like superraedizzle are you guys related??
WHERE R U WHERE DID U GO???
I check every couple weeks for a new video! Hope you are enjoying a relaxing break or productive break, whichever you need! See you when you’re back!
Come back Safiya , we’re are starving over here
OMG HOW COOL. your videos are at their core, flaming garbage.
It looks better with all your heart. I'll enjoy the fun and informative video. If you have time later, please come and see me.♥😍귯

Where are you Saf?!!!! 😩😩😩😩 we miss you! And Tyler! And Crustee! 😩😩
WHEN ARE YOU COMING BACK WE MISS YOUR CONTENT EVERYONE ELSE SUCKSSSSSSSSSS. 😔
I hope there are some people out there willing to help someone go to University & better their life,   instead of encouraging people like Gorilla Glue people to do stupid things for money...   I am in a VERY bad spot in life, and I am trying to further myself and make life better and further my education... And I feel like people feel like they need to stoop to doing such dumb things, in order to have any form of successful campaign....  I wanted to make it to school THIS year.... But I couldn't raise the money by my deadline.... Not even close.... Yet I watch all these other fundraisers, (especially the really stupid ones......) get a lot of funds raised....... Now, I have to wait over a year to make it to the next enrollment....And that is VERY scary for me,  because I am NOT in a good life and living situation right now.....  If I want to go to school next year, I need to raise the funds by THIS November..... And I have to figure out what I can do in the meantime to not be in an unhealthy physical and mental environment...  So please, I ask anyone who sees this,  if everyone who ever saw this, even donated $1,  I'd be a good portion of the way there... I've spent DAYS Tweeting this to HUNDREDS of people and companies on Twitter, posting comments and messages on Instagram,  and NO ONE HELPED!!!!! Not a single person who I Tweeted or posted to on Insta.... The only people who helped are my sister, a friend of mine, and a friend of a friend... That's IT!  Not even my parents....And these people alone,  can't help me get all the way to my goal.....  So please,  help someone further their education, and get out of a bad situation in life..... I've already had a bad mental break down and I can't risk that again, or I could really hurt myself worse... And there's not even anyone I can speak to professionally in the area I live.. It's bad...    GoFundMe.com/f/JapanUniversity    I really hope some people can find it in their hearts to help.... Let's start helping people further their education have better life circumstances,  instead of people doing things like glue in their hair or body parts..... _________________  *For anyone who is curious,  the funding will go towards my schooling costs,  living expenses,  transportation expenses, and food expenses.  It helps cover EVERYTHING!!!!!! FOR 2 years!!!!*  And for anyone who wants to hate on me for trying to raise funds to go to school,  you should be trying to do more with your own life.... Because at least I am attempting to do something with mine... I don't have a big platform to have a successful fundraiser, so I have to do what I can to get attention to it....AND at that,  people can't say I'm not trying hard enough.... Because I've put SO much work into advertising this......
Are you done with YouTube hope you are safe miss you
Safiya i miss you.
Love you and miss you! Hope the move is going well and that you and Ty are safe and happy. Can’t wait to see you both again whenever you post next!
Anyone wondering where she went? It's been a while and I'm hoping she's  alright because this is what happened with Steve (the guy who mad the talking kitty cat series) died  I'm not going to mention how because it may be a trigger for some just look up talking kitty cat  and they're will be vids on it
Now I gotta spend my weekends at Colonial Williamsburg so I can see Saf churn butter 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Omg Safiya I really love you so much❤️😍 Miss your videos🌸
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT HER BACKGROUND?? - 2021
It was really cool seeing a peek of Bernadette Banner's shoes in the shop
Why isn’t she posting it’s been so long😔
Hey saf , you have youtube channel ... And we miss you
Hi Safiya, i love your videos, though i think i was a little late to watch your videos, i started watching your videos on the giant period product things, so i just want to say thank you for making these entertaining videos, and i hope you are taking care of yourself well:)
Is safiya dead?
Safiya why did you stop making videos again
the second outfit REALLY suits her!
Are you okay? You normally post once a month. It's been 4 months!
THE WAY THEY SAID OREGON IS A CRIME-
Please upload a new video pls. The fans miss you so much!
I NEED HER TO POST
Hi ! Love all of your utubes , your quirkiness , quick whit, and just you  being fun and adorable  makes me laugh and my day  .  Miss seeing you this year... 2021... hope all is well and ok with you and your husband. Looking forward to hopefully another fun filled year !!! many blessings !
🌹🦇🕷🕸🥀havent seen you much around here lately -  wishing you all the best,  love :)  hope you are doing really  great 🥀🕸🕷🦇🌹
Where are you Safiya?
I’m just telling you from Melanie Martinez’s stories on Instagram I’m pretty sure Safiya filmed outside or around Melanies house, the roses, bush wall, etc.
WHY DONT U POST ANYMOREE
dude it’s been over 4 months? and nothing on ig from either of them
It's been 4 months guys how's been the move back to Chicago?
Dumb
I hope Saf is okay 😢
Can we all report the bots who keep spamming the most upvoted comments with spam? I've reported every one I've found but there's so many. Let's keep the comments a wholesome place for Safiya's fans shall we?
Where are you why did you leave 😩  My brain: ohhh she’s probably on her honeymoon 😂
Honestly I am kinda obsessed w the witch shoes
Why havent u posted yet?
Has she quited or is she doin  crazy video
is she okay? she hasn't posted in so long. is it a break?
YOU HAVNT POSTED SINCE LAST YEAR HELOOOOOO
Still waiting for a new video 😭
Where have you been Saf! Miss you

safiya I love your videos so much and I have watched them ever since I was 8 you literally raised me just wanted to tell you that ahaha
Is this a dead channel, now? I haven’t seen a video in months? I hate to unsubscribe but damn that’s a long time with no content.

5:16 girl in green on the right is channeling Shego!
When is she going to post 🥲
I saw twice on ur explore page AHAHHA
I really love re - watching safiya's travelling videos
I couldn't remember your channel name for a sec and I feel bad about that but to find you again I typed in "Franken lipstick"
No joke, that colonial Williamsburg outfit looks amazing.
When are you gonna post again
It has been 4 months something is up
Can you please do a video where predictive text picks out your makeup items?
Where has she been it’s been 4 months!?!?!?!? Lol
Are you still alive
WHERE R UUUUUUUU?!
Is Saf ded [*] [*] [*]
Safiya and Tyler are editing their moving vlog! I just happened to notice that in the YouTube mobile app, they have stories like IG, and she just posted there yesterday or the other day. Can't wait!
Will saf upload videos again? Because i miss her🖤
We hope you're alright our beautiful vampire queen!
but when the world needed her the most  she dramatically flew away in her batwing suit
Hey Safiya are you doing ok? You haven’t posted in a while, it’s totally fine if you taking a break from YouTube. Just worried about ya.💜
Did u do the see through high tops
WHERE ARE YOU :<<<<
I hope Safiya's okay - does anyone know why she's left for a while or is she just having a break?
Plz make some cupcakes types of videos, soaps etc
I think she died.... hasn’t uploaded in 4 months
Nice👍👍👍👍
The witch outfit looks awesome 😍
Next video should be :trying different aesthetic for a week
The normal gym noticeably murder because octagon immunochemically hammer per a second lamp. painful, male swiss
I almost never laugh out loud watching videos...but you and tyler's humour is so damn perfect 😂😂😂
She will lose followers, if she doesn't post more regularly. I for one am losing interest. There are others that I follow who post once a week and they are just as busy. If you want fame and keep it, you have to work for it and keep your followers updated, otherwise get out of the game. We all have things going on in our personal lives but we still have to get up and go to work every day. We don't all have Instagram either.
Missing you and hoping you're safe and well. <3
Hope you're doing well, Safiya!! ❤️💕
She has not posted in a long time
You said hello fellow kids and I thought of Laurenzside
Where are you?? Are you okay, cause now I am legit getting worried 😭
Why have you stoped uploading safiya ????
ITS THE HOCUS POCUS REFERENCE FOR ME!!
Girl where R U?  We miss you💙
Who wants another video to be posted by her 👇
Where is she at i miss seeing her!
It’s been 4 months now 👁👄👁 wut happend
I miss her so much
Missing your videos Safiya.  Hope everything's ok.
Where's the next video??😭 I miss yyoouuurrrr videos!!!
SAYIFYAAA WHY DID U STOP POSTINGG
everyone in this comment section out here demanding saf make videos and no one even asking if she's okay. I hope she's okay :(
WHERE ARE YOU SAF?!
She real just disappeared
ayo saf where u at
Happy International “women’s” day!!!!!!! ❤️
We want new videos 😭
Idk I think it's rude af to promise your fans something and breaking that promise time after time. Jeez if you don't wanna make videos just say that instead of making empty promises
So when will you start posting more consistently, I knew after u married him u would post so much but waiting months is just bologna.
Why isn’t she uploading?
You should try a Shein haul. You could also try Torrid. They're smallest size is a 10 and the stuff is great I love it there. You look small so idk if that would work for you but you never know
Where are you?😶
Safiya come back please
It's been 4 months 😐😗
I miss your vids, i hope that your okay💞💞💞...
can you please do a shein haul? i think it'd be cool!
Are you guys okay?
Where all the content we need 😂❤️ with all due respect. We miss you .
So Safiya likes Twice (a Kpop girl group showing everywhere in here)
Who wants her to do another video ---->
Everyone being so nasty. SHUT UP. youtube isn't her entire life. She doesn't need to do things to make you happy. IT'S HER AND TYLER'S LIFE. They can do whatever they want. I hope you're well Saf and Tyler. You're wonderful 🥰
Want to see the white poofy blouse with the rest of the witch stuff!
I never even realized Instagram has a shop tab, I had to pause this video and check out what appeared to me. I found a few nice gothic shops in my region which is always a good thing.
Killerstar nice  brand for you safiya !
Safiya removes bonnet: colonial girl gone wild!!
I'm just so happy someone else remembers Kirsten and Felicity, American Girl Dolls were my happy place! I read the catalogs when I was little, and cheered when Addie and Josefina were announced.
I miss your vids when are u gonna post again😩
Mam
Colonial outfit with no bonnet gave me big pirate vibes
Saf looks like like a mix of the actress Kristen Stewart, actress Naomi Scott, and the YouTuber Laurenzside
Wow she just vanished
She is really a witch thooo
Safiya pls start posting again
She has forgotten that she is a youtuber
Miss u guys. Hope your both okay.
"Videos every other week..." Time to update the profile info... ;)
You are so pretty saf 😌
Usually you post every month sometimes every two month.. its been 3 month since i dont really have insta or any stuff like that, are you guys ok? hope you guys are 💕
So I just got to say 2 things 1 we need to see Tyler trying items meant for the male species & the 2nd thing is I can no longer say the word smash - its now shamash ,thanks for that!!
I hope your ok
She hasn’t posted for 3 months
The lively curler symptomatically surprise because potato tellingly enter at a hissing hip. necessary, like salesman
I usually use a sub roll as the "base" for my sandwich. Then I slap on some mayo on top of a few slices of turkey (about 3 slices is best). If I have any,  two slices of tomato and a handful of lettuce add just the right amount of savory flavor. I may even sprinkle a dash of pepper and/or salt on top. Now that's a good sandwich :)
Where are you????????
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCaxuM58DfE  So... I think this would be a fun thing for you to do! I wonder if you'd get Tyler?
why have u not been posting its been like 3 months
Dressing like American Girl Dolls would be such a fun video! They have great modern and period fashion!
28:19
So who wants to see safiya try out resin art, i do
Anyone else wondering if she’s okay?
Girl are you gonna post anytime soon??

It's crazy how it doesn't really matter how long your gone you'll always get millions of views because we love you so much lmao  Hope you're doing well you two 💗🦇
She haven’t post in a long time
Where's Safiya?
i think i know why she left... she could be in the next ESCAPE THE NIGHT
This is the channel I come to to cleanse my palette after all the drama stuff I watch on yt. We miss you guys xoxo
For bad makeup science you should do mixing all concerlers
Another every 3-4 months uploader, sigh...
Anyone else waiting for mixing every soap from the drugstore
whyy have youu not posted or uploaded
Where’d you go, Saf? Hope you & yours are alright, safe & healthy! Sending hellah good vibes 😊🌟😊
Safiya really needs to take off the videos every other week😂
Where is Saf...?🙁
SHE GONE
Where is she will she come back?
for some reason only ads i get on my email are for pp enlargement drugs...    ...i don't have a pp so my hopes are really high that i'll sprout one soon, fingers crossed!
Safiya please come back we miss your videos 🥺
i luv ur british accent with fit 2 its so u and plsss POST MORE ive been watching ur old vids :D

She is giving me Morticia Adams vibes for some reason and I love it.
YOU ARE THE BEST VAMPIRE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HEHEHEH
We miss you ❤️❤️❤️
I really want a colonial Williamsburg vid
Can you make more of these video plz😁
What happened to saf??? She hasn’t posted in a few months
You should combine all candles from all of he states it’s  on homesick candles all 50 candles smell like all  of the states, so you can find out the United States smells like. I did not originally call met this someone  else did. Keep copy and pasting so she can see it.
Hi saf I hope your doing well we miss you and can’t wait for your next vid take your time.
👍👍👍👍🤝🔔✍🙏🙏🙏
SAFYIAA! congrats on the move! i am so excited for you but you make my quarentine better! i neeeeeeed youuuu
I'm confused you say you're gone cuz you're filming a ton of videos so you'll be ahead to post a bunch of videos in a row but it never happens?? Can we at least get an update? NP if you need a break but what's up?
I seriously feel like Safiya is the only person that can pull off any color lipstick
I miss her vids 😭😭😭
https://youtu.be/DZiIUhK8Zl0
PLEASE COME BACKKKK!! OR DISCUSE WHY YOUR NOT POSTING, WE MISS YOU SO MUCH!!!
yesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
Yeah I was a teen when jersey shore was on
WHERE THE F R U SAF?????!!!!
Safiya I miss your vids please upload again you haven't uploaded in 3 months now T^T
So in English slang (2000’s) someone who is a ‘minga’ is like proper ugly, yeah? Y’get me? Dreadfully judgmental term tbh but pretty funny (in both senses of the word) in this case. 😆
“They see me churning” “My fresh cream brings all the boys to the yard” OMG 👏🏽👏🏽😹  Seriously though, it’s great that Tyler gets all of her pop culture references and jokes. With me and my bloke being 15 years apart it can be like tumble weed in the desert sometimes.  Me:🤣 Him: 😶
Digging the background R&B am I hearing the beats for “That girl is poison” at about half way?
Why did you stop posting
3:31 미나 언니 !!!
Hey Safiya <3 Just jumped up here to tell you I looove your videos and everything you do. You are one of my favorite people on YT. Hope you are well :) Sending hugs <3
When you are you going to post it has him 3 months
We miss you, safiya! 🥺 it’s been months now. Hope you are safe and healthy.
When are you going to post another video
Does anyone wanna see saf make slime as it would just be a Franken slime
SAFFF POST MOREEE PLEASE I LITERALLY LOVE YOUR CONTENT ahah
I would love to see safiya do a 'different aesthetic everyday for a week' video
I've replaced Saf with Mia Maples.
Why haven’t y up loaded ???
0:39 Nayeon and Chaeyoung on her explore page !! maybe she became a once hahaha
When will you be doing another video
Is Safiya alive?
Cracks me up every time I hear you talk about Colonial Williamsburg. My family lives in VA and as children we got taken there so freakin' often. We've been a few times as adults, too, and I think I legitimately enjoy it more now. My parents have season passes and took me there for Christmas a couple of years back.
So, I found this video particularly interesting for a few reasons...  1. I have *zero* fashion sense or coordination, or even interest in the topic...but Safiya videos are invariably entertaining, accessible, and interesting, so, thanks for that.  2. It's notable to consider that Safiya videos tend to have several months of production that go into them. This leads me to consider how many different videos are being worked on in parallel until one is actually ready to finalize and upload.  3. I looked at my Instagram Shop tab...and I was really, really confused. Lots of dresses and makeup and just general trendy-fashion stuff, when I follow none of those things...so I'm not quite sure how much individual tailoring the 'shop' tab is getting.  Thanks for the content; happy creating!
Do you like kpop
Why isn’t she making videos?
Safiya where are youuuuuuuuu I am waiting it has been 3 months!! Pls I love you and your videos pls another one and pls reply to this comment 😭😭😭😭😭🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺😟😟

Saf what happened? Why haven't you been posting?
i miss her content
Do more videos
If you like f.r.i.e.n.d.s (you make a lot of references) you should dress like them for a week!
Safiya we miss you. Please come back : (
Y’all should like up this comment if you want Safiya to mix all the bath and Bodyworks lotions together to see what scent makes!!! Just like all the candles!!!
Can u do a collab with Micarch Tewers?

She really DIPPED😭😭🤣
I hope you two are doing ok.
Pls post
Why don’t she post no more?
She stopped posting since 3 months ago
Safiya! Where are you? I miss your vids 😭 I hope you’re doing alright
Gotta love saf being a cool aunt
Guys, she's ok, she's just moving, she'll be back soon
Safiya - I would love to see you do a video on those meal kits, like Hello Fresh.
Come back... please

Somewhere around 15 minutes I started to get Real slim shady vibes  Wish she wore stays or gave a disclaimer

I miss you 🥺😭
When are you going to post again 🥺
Not e girl it’s soft girl
Why rarely making videos now? You done with YouTube?
This is my comfort channel
0:56 she likes black pink jennie
Where'd u go
You alive saf?
Weren't you working on a video? 🧐  Stay well. 💛
COME BACK NOW! IT'S BEEN THREE MONTHS SINCE WE GOT A NEW UPLOAD.
Why have u stopped posting?
so does she like not make videos anymore?
I miss your videos, hope you'll be back soon :(
Safiya, you need to post more often. You are going to lose subs.
It’s been 3 months girl we miss you😭😭😭
the last one is punching me in the gut with marina and the diamonds vibes i love it hadslfksd
I'd just tuck the overall straps through the rings so they sit behind the skirt!
What do you do with the clothes after the videos, you keep what you like, but the other ones?
I was so excited for the next video but.. when the world needed her most, she vanished.
We miss you
I Loved that bonnet it looks cute on her and I Love the witch outfit too it look Amazing on her I would love to have one if I had the legs for it lol
Hi Safiya, Me and my sister were thinking you could do a franken perfume. It would be the mid point smell of all the perfumes from Dior. What do you think of the idea?
Was fine til u butched Oregon
the name should be booty and the beast
XOWIE
UPLOAD OR I UNSUB
Can you post more I love youuuuuuu🥸🥸
I wonder where you are since a year or when you are going to post a new video..
Could all of y'all complaining that Saf "doesn't post anymore" or "why'd you leave YouTube" just stop? If you were *SO* curious about why that you felt the need to leave a hate comment you could have checked her Instagram where she has apologized profusely for the lack of content because they are in the midst of moving cross country. Learn your facts before you try and make someone feel guilty for prioritizing life over YouTube.
Can you post more videos pls 😭😭😭
Why have you stopped posting videos? I used to watch you all the time but you've not had much content lately. Are y'all ok?
Please come back to YouTube.
I miss you
missed u :)
girl where u at ??
3:55 my eyes just faded over to Bernadette’s American duchess shoe 😂
Have you tried shopping at RoseGal? I'd like to see you shop there and show us the outfits.
Where are you ? When will the next video come?
I hope you're taking care of yourself. Self care isn't selfish. 💜💜💜
I think Saf should put Tyler in drag when they hit 10 million.
Where are u? I really miss your videos, please be back soon and please take care of yourself
Oregon is pronounced like "organ" as in pipe organ or internal organ.
i love your videos you have such cool content!

DID SHE FORGET TO POST
"Are you a witch, or a colonial re-enactor?" "Get me to Salem, and who needs to choose?"
We miss you Safiya ❤️
Anyone else missing Safiya so they are going back and watching old videos? Just me? Ok 👌
Hey, I'm concerned by the lack of new videos. Is everything alright?
Please postttt
❓ question  Did you quit your channel because you never post any more
I think the witch outfit is one of the most flattering outfits I’ve seen on her, she’s so pretty!!!
WHERE ARE YOU !!
Post something againnnnnn!!!
Y is she not posting videos
I know you’re in the process of moving but you should make an update video.
Does anyone know where the masks she’s wearing came from?
Sofia you should shop for on Amazon make up

I need me some new Saf video!!!
But when the world needed her the most...... SHE VANISHED
WHERE DID U GO! COME BACK :( PLEASE HURRYYYYYY ;-; ITS BEEN 3 MONTHS
Where are you? I miss your videos
When are you going to post again
The “is this e-girl???” reminded me of my mom in the most endearing way!     (she is so fun and she’s so cool! So not in any way is this a bash)
I wish she would post because I am watching the same vids that I have already watched 3 times before
did u forget ur password or something?
Safiya is taking so long to post, someone knows if she is ok?
Make another video
After the "buying the first sponsored things" on Facebook and Instagram, I really wonder why  she never  did Tumblr?
Her new house looks so similar to Jennas
Miss you and Tyler and Crusty, so much. I'm always looking to see if there is anything new. Hope all is well and look forward to seeing your next video. Simple pleasures of life.
Still waiting for ur moving vid🤔😬😬😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴
Hey safia : your YouTube channel is thriving.    Safia : yes , existing.
Can you please try spin art
Does anyone know where she is? Because this is the second time she has taken a 3 month brake 🙄😥
LOL get rid of your banner. It’s not videos every other week. It’s every other 3months or so.
You should do a I wear tjmaxx suggested outfits. Tjmaxx has their clothes separated into sections: Women's  Athletic  Juniors And then pjs You could do an outfit from each section with the displays they make c: just a suggestion tho. 👽
ngl the pink hair works tho....like yeah you can tell its a wig but the color works with her skin tone and stuff
pls do a video of making resin stuff!!!
Why no new content!?!? Am I missing something??
Try the Lisa Eldridge Lipstick Velvet Collection. We need your thoughts on that 😉
i just wanna know what the main shirt is that she wears in this video :'( the blcak and wihte rose
yall she is moving from LA, check her insta. I think that's why shes not uploading
Heyyy It's been a long time Are you okay?🥺
Safia I miss u WHERE ARE U :(
I really like the “wearing Fashion Nova outfits for a week” I was wondering if you could do a part two.
Why you are making videos
SAFIYA COME BACK I MISS YOU 3 OR 4 MONTHS WITHOUT YOUR NEW AMAZING VIDEOS 🥺🥺🥺
God bless!  Believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is our Lord and Savior and died on a cross for our sins so we can live again in Heaven where there is no pain or suffering!  God is our Father and Creator and raised His Son Jesus from the dead!  Confess and repent of your sins and God will freely forgive you!  Trust in God and live for Jesus as He died for you! 💕 (don’t swear or take God’s name in vein).
I'm noticing how often the word "cherubim" seems to come up in your videos, and just fyi: that's the plural. "Cherub" is the singular.
Love U💕 but are you dead?    💕💀💕
New videos every other month
Why is Safiya not posting?
Is Safiya ok
Costubers Unite!!! Somebody get Abby Cox on the horn so we can get Safiya in historical garb to attend colonial williamsburg  Edit: OMG 😱 they’ve gone and done it!!!!!! My crossover dreams have come true!!!
Pls post I love watching your videos
I also love KPOP  SAFIYA   some of them are Twice Blackpink Gfriend
Hi Safiya, I know you probably won’t see this, but I read your post about why there haven’t been many videos recently, and I wanted to tell you that I and the rest of your subscribers completely support you. It’s ok to take a break if you’re struggling, you can’t try to force yourself to make content. In your post, you said you were struggling with mental health, and I think everyone has been going through similar stuff this year. I know my opinion doesn’t mean much, but I would recommend taking some time to do things that you’re good at and things that make you happy (excluding YouTube, which might make you more burnt out). That way, you’ll hopefully feel a bit better about yourself, and you can continue to create content, which you’ve said you want to keep doing. 💚💚💚from all of your subscribers. I would say I can’t wait for the next video, but I totally can if a break is what you need.  Ps- I hope you, Tyler, Crusty, and the rest of your family are doing well.
It's been 3 months..... It's 2021
Does any one know why she hasn’t been posting?
why did she stop posting?
Safyia why dont u post as much?
Hi new subscriber  from India
‘Control the memes of production’ was 12/10 🤣🤣🤣🤣
23:28 The still-frame for the timestamp (idk why) but it reminds me so much of my little sis who I hardly get to see. Tbh I just started crying when I paused it here. I miss her so much and I haven't seen her since Christmas Thank you for reminding me of her. If any grammar or spelling is wrong please ignore it, it's 1am, I'm tired and crying. Edit: You look so much like an older version of her.
safiyaa come backkk :(
I can rewatch your videos all day, can’t wait for the next 🥺
I really like the pink wig!
"IT'S A HAY-PENNY A GLASS, BABY!" i died.
Hope you're doing well
Bro you good you haven’t posted in three months
You NEED to do a shein videoooo
Crying over how they pronounce Oregon 😭
Awwww maaan you cut the lace on the wig to short😬

why are u not posting any videos ?
This one's strangely sexual the entire time haha! I think I liked the second lewk with the moon booties
anyone else think that the egirl look that she found wasn't really that 'e girl' its more,,, generally alternative. e girl Is the skirt and maybe a crop top but not really those boots or leg harness'. idk just my opinion
Good luck..
to be fair the care bears sweatshirts were very e-girl vibes, i'd take it
Hello fellow kids.......LAURENZSIDE VIBES!!  😱😱😂😂
Super video , I like this video 📹 👌
Why does she sounds Indian?
She’s giving me Nightwish vibes XD
When are you going to upload more content I really love your videos
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜 Safiya... Where are you? I miss you!!! 😭 I hope you're OK and well...  💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Its been 3 months since she has posted did she quit youtube
HOW IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT SAF HASNT POSTED IN 3 MONTHS, I'm worried.
Is she just gone from YouTube now??
Where are you these days?
What happened to safiya?
for the skirt overalls tuck the leather straps in the  mettle  circles under velvet so put the straps through then tuck it.
haven't heard from you in awhile, you okay?
Pls post
I think a wonderful idea would be something like 'I tried making lunchbox cakes' since they're pretty poppin' on Tiktok atm. If she makes them heart shaped and stuff they could be Valentine's Day themed! (✿◠‿◠)
Reminder for Safiya Nygard : You have a YouTube channel !!
We miss you 😭 come back
WHY ARE THEY NOT POSTING??
Why haven’t u been posting?
Saf what happened? Where are you?! I need more Safiya in my life!!

Can't wait until you upload again, missing you safiya! Moving is a stressful process and you gotta take all the time you need for that and we all understand 🙏 xx
WHY DO YOU GUYS PRONOUNCE OREGON LIKE THAT!!!! OR-GONE NOTE OR-E-GONE
Why does her face and hair reminds me of the 'other mother' from Caroline?!😂😂😂😂
A little warning: if you get a reply from a Safiya that doesn’t have a grey bubble around her name, don’t do what they are asking
Hi I'm big fan of your channel. Please stay connected
You need to put up a new video
omg at 3:56 I see American Duchess "Bernadette" shoes!!!! I'm wondering if Safiya watches Bernadette Banner, that would make me so happy!
When is ur ew video coming??
Safiya idk if you own a lot of perfumes but you should do a franken-fume video where you mix all of your perfumes, body sprays, etc. into one vial and see what the result is!
heyyyyyyyyyyyyyy why aren't u uploading new stuff

I'm watching the old videos bcoz somehow I feel excited when they go out just to walk around and get crazy food... the videos are really helping. I wish the best to the best couple in the world and I hope they get back to us soon. S2
Pls pls plz pls pls post I love watching you videos.
guys we gotta talk more about the TWICE content that ig is recommending to her, It's confirmed saf is a once!
If you use the Honey browser extension, it stands to reason why Instagram is profiling your brand preferences based partly on what you like and partly on what you buy for videos! Data. Mining...
the third look i guess you could call it "pastel punk"... ?
Soft-girl vibes
'1:32'  I would stick to *𝗚𝗲𝘁𝗳𝗮𝗻𝘇.𝗽𝗿𝗼* ^^ 📁 that's where we get ours 💙
Who else misses safiya? :((
Safiyaaaa! Where are youuuuu?? We miss you so much!!
25:12 you kinda look like hotaru , from sailor moon
The channel banner says new video every other week and it's been 2 months now  😑😐😶
TWICE dominationg your search page on insta
YOURE GORGEOUS
omg i loved the first look fuck
We miss you!! Please make more content!! You haven’t mixed lotions or all perfumes from Sephora/ulta 👀👀
Is anyone realizing the similarities between Jenna Marbles ' house
際
Anyone miss seeing her video constantly
Every time I see her I think of her getting fish gutted
anyone else binging saf's videos waiting for her to come back? just me?
She hasn't posted for 3 months
We need new videooo
It is an e-girl outfit but leaning heavily towards gamer girl.
love you
You can tell this video was done quite a while back by seeing the length of Safiya's hair
I'm sorry Sophia I'm commenting on this 2 months later after you've already posted this and I love you don't get me wrong but it seems like since you got married do you have better things to do you are one of my favorite YouTubers and you don't even post anymore
wow you are so pretty
The velvet suspender skirt was so adorable!
are  you quitting youtube ):
Does anyone know why she hasn't uploaded for a while?
GURRRRRRLLLLL!!! Where r u! I missed you and I've been watching this video for 2 months! TAT
WHERE DID SHE GOOO😪?
Can you please try liquid skin? They claim to be a band-add alternative, but more efficient. Like 100% water prof, and no pain in application or removal. They also say that the solidified paste will fall off after the skin has fully healed. I do not think that this will work, so I would want to see if it works. Side note: the bottle kinda looks like a nail/eyelash glue tube........... so it made me even more hesitant.
When she says Oregon she says it all wrong I’m sorry
I lost my phone and had to resub Sabbath night fever I missed tyler
Has anyone else noticed that Safiya is neck on Buzzfeed????
STOP DEMANDING HER TO UPLAD. IT IS HER CHOICE HER FANS DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE TO PRESSURE HER TO POST . STOP DEMANDING
saf I love you truely but ive been waiting for almost 3 MONTHS JEFHOIHFRIOUHEWIU
💜 Miss your videos and you/Ty!!!💜
Can you please post more videos because I love your videos
Why did you stop posting  videos ????????????
13:38 obi wan kenobi
I'm sad when you mentioned you got catcalled while wearing these outfits
We miss yooouuu x
Bro, where are you??!!
Safias pink Is asthetic I think
SAME I SO remember totally spies!
You and Tyler ok???? My favourite YouTuber but I hate these 2 month breaks in content. I miss you Saf!! 😭😭😭
is nobody talking about her wallpaper
Anyone else miss her? I liked when she posted more often
That 2nd "Witch" look is actually fire! Saf can really pull this look off! Hot!
Does saf still post
How is you and Tyler’s shared sock drawers?!😂😂👍😎😀🧦🧦🧦🧦🦍⚡️🌈
The wig is working tbh
What the heck is in the background at 27:56?! A burned down church??
it's called softgirl aesthetic
"they control the MEMES of production" oh my god I'm dying I think that's maybe the best joke of Tyler's that's made it past editing
When are new videos coming up????????????????????????????????????
She has not posted in so long... I feel worried 😓
Hi safiya mam I am a big fan of yours because of your beautiful videos.
Not even gonna lie you kinda look like Dua Lipa
need more of Saf in pink hair thoooo she looks so good
more videos plzzz
Is this a reupload?? Am I crazy
Your soooooo pretty safiya
we need more videos
Missing you guys! No pressure! Just saying hi and wish you well!
*i have a hamster*  *called soup*
When are you going to post another video
Hey Safiya! Just wanted to say, please don’t worry about posting videos every month or every two months. Don’t put a time scale on it. Honestly your fans including myself will still be here whether you post in a month or six months. Of course we’ll miss you but PLEASE put yourself and your mental health first! Take care xx
if you look at that powerpuff girls shirt you will notice "omighty" on their shopping bags. the 'poseur' brand appears to be one of those shady resale-from-aliexpress types that sell stolen designs from actual brands like omighty.
Gothmilk.. what's the pun?? Plzz tell😭😂
2020 really took her from us 😫
Wait a sec--  Did she actually have like 118 calls😶
I was wandering when your next video will come out?
That’s a weird outfit choice
Safiya during the whole video 😃☝️
Idk if you’re even reading comments anymore but we miss you guys!
Another youtuber who videos their cat has inspired me to make my cat his own youtube channel. Come check it out i post multi videos a day of him.
Its like she's fallen off the face of the earth...
If you don’t start posting more often I’m gonna tell 384,000 people to unsubscribe from now
Why don't you upload more?
When her channel banner says "new videos every other week" but its more like every other month (or 2)
Safiya please come back we miss you also I am a big fan and love your videos and you and Tyler
Why videos right now are soooo rare ? The last one was 2 months ago
Is anyone else wondering what is going on with Safiya and Tyler? They haven't posted anything in 2 months.
Tbh yes it is egirlish
Omg you look SO GOOD IN YOUR PINK HAIR!!!
It's soft girl look.
Has Sayfia quit You-tube?????????  Please please, I love watching your vids!
please post
14:16 that is pink goth
"Minga" means "dick" in Spain.  I can't stop laughing to hear call a fashion brand:  "Minga London". XD.  Nice vid btw ;)
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE VIDEOS
Part 2?
RIP this channel. Ill always keep checking back.
Sophia you should do a full Franken face of make up
Why u always ware black🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
did you die again
Omg, you bought a Hannibal Lecter murder suit in unicorn skin!
IM SCREAMING 0:38 SAFIYA IS A ONCEE
How many times can I watch a Safiya Nygaard video? The limit does not exist!   In all seriousness, I love her videos and wish she was still posting at least once a month. But I get she's going through a lot. And even if she isn't, that's okay too. She doesn't need a reason to take a break. I just miss her though. Her videos really brighten my day. She's one of the most genuinely funny YouTubers I know.
But if you are a Witch and like reenacting, just get a T-shirt with Fire on it.
Pov:she hasn’t posted for to long so u decide to rewatch her old vids
So instead of adds now they just put shops in apps... I wonder if they want our money?
Where is she anyways.hasnt posted in 2 month
Hey Girl! I would love if you would do a video on the at home laser hair removal‘s. There are so many. And I’m not sure if they work. I heard that they work best for pale skin & dark hair folks. But I am still skeptical. I saw one pop up when you did that video where you bought the mystery boxes and it got me thinking. If you can, would you please?
Great work
When will you upload again 😫
Need a new video fix.  Can’t wait for the next one!  Miss you
why does she always only post once a month
Egirl fashion is legit the same as pastel goth/emo fashion
Zuckerberg? That’s Facebook l’amo
Safiya... when will you come back?
Is safiya okay? , she hasn’t been posting for 2 months :(
Pls post soon it’s been months
As someone from Oregon I cringed at the way you said it but don't worry a lot fo people who don't live here also say it like that hahaha (god I feel like I'm being mean but I promise I'm not trying to be)
make more videosssssss🥺🥺
literally 2/3 years ago i started wearing “soft girl”/“e girl” clothes, i done the thigh highs, inner eye liner, the blush across the nose and cheeks. and people BULLIED me for dressing that way.. and now everyone is wearing it 😭 it just annoys me, it would be fine if i wasn’t made fun of for it but now like my “uniqueness” is taken ):
What happened to this channel? I hope she can update sooner
Pls make more vids love you safiya
Pls make a new vid love you
why does safiyas new house look like jenna marbles’? 😭
Minga London reminded me of Beyyn saying ' Remel London' when they re-arraged Cristine's nail polish
At least that I know of
Where are you are you okay ??!!! She hasn’t posted in a little while
This actually makes me so happy because Saf's excitement and the reactions from other people while she was wearing the colonial williamsburg outfit is exactly how I feel wearing cosplay at conventions. I'll just be walking around super happily enjoying the con and someone in the distance will scream "It's [character name]!" and run up to ask for a photo.
Can you make a restaurant with amazon products?
Did you quit yt?
The painstaking karate distinctly mate because produce concurrently regret pace a high-pitched eyelash. lamentable, detailed competitor
i was unsubbed?! I thought you quit YT. wtf?!  i got 3 videos to catch up on
SAFIYA have you seen rat ( as in the song) tiktoks your in all of the good YouTuber who helped and raised people!!!! Good job 👏
k
Petition for a new video 🥺
WE MISS YOU SAF <3
For the wig cut had me laughing so hard 😂
So, ya know...Miss you guys. Hope everything is okay. You can come back and hang out whenever, just saying. Would love to see a collaboration with the Ladylike/Buzzfeed escapees, maybe through Zoom. Maybe everyone buys the same DIY kit on Amazon and competes to make the best, maybe you all pick a theme and do a makeover on your spouses / quarantine buddies, like 1920s speak easy, or Disney character. I dunno. Just, ya know... Checking in. Be safe!
Without the wig u will look good in pink outfit
and then she was gone
When will you have more lipsticks???
Why did she stop posting ..?
where did you go??? whats up? you still there bro?
Did you die I haven’t seen you in a long time
Do a wig video 😆
The colonial Williamsburg outfit is normal where I am as I’m near Amish country, although they don’t usually wear so much white  Also you look like princess bubblegum in the last outfit
Safiya,are you just pick whatever as long you could made punny puns with it?
where has she gone !!!
Come back we miss you
COME BACK. i NEED you!
I love the office
You never post!
Best youtuber ever!
Please make an updated makeup routine 🙆🏻‍♀️😍
twice on insta broo
Ate Safiya , Where are you 🥺 I've been waiting a long time to watch a new video from you 🥺 I always check your channel every other day to see if you have a new video 😍 Please comeback.  (Ate) means older sister / sign of respect to the people (woman) who is older than you in the philippines.  Thank you. 😍❤️
Miss you Saf. Just dropping by to say I'm thinking of you. Hope you're well in this pandemic
The e-girl outfit would have looked bomb with a perfect wig fit with space buns 🔥
Your skin tone clashes with the color...GREATLY!!!!!
Why is no one asking why she isng posting at all its been 2 months someone please tell me why
I feel like since the Dolan twins lurediy and many more youtubers are quiting im scared she's next because she hasn't posted in 2 months
Hey the pink wig could also be repurposed for a toy for crusty
Miss you
Why are not posting videos on YouTube
Is her channel dead ? She hasen't posted in 2 months and its been a year now. Btw her videos are so re-watchable 😂😂
A a a a I miss herrrrrr!!! 💕
first of all we love our kpop queen  second of all I CAN NOT BELIEBE SHE DIDNT GET THE SPIDERWEB PANTS
For the third look, If the wig was black and the jacket was white or black then this look would have been my fav😭
Its y2k not e girl
ok but why is no one talking about tyler in her wallpaper lmfao
A middle part looks so good on her wtf
Come back SAF PLEASE COME BACKKKKK
I remember she talked about Colonial Williamsburg in the candle video, saying that one of the candles smelled like the gift shop at Colonial Williamsburg 😹
jenna marbeles?
The fact Safiya has over 9million subscribers but can't even be bothered to post every month...
who else saw the caos costume? LMAO
You probably won’t see this as this video is almost 3 months old but you should definitely try mixing every chapstick together if it’s possible
Where did you get that floral mask? It's so cute 😍
Is she like...Ok? She hasn’t posted in awhile or have I not seen something just I’m not used to her not posting but love you saf
where did Safiya goooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!
Good
Yum
let’s get saf to 10 mill subs
The first outfit if u wore it here u wouldn’t get a second glance the bonnet is a little off to the actual bonnet hat things they wear but it is very Amish
Hey Safiya, you should collaborate with Liza Koshy or would be really fun since I love both of you a video together would be great if you don’t that would be ok just some recommendations
Where is she😭😭😭😭😭😭
hello there, i just wanted to pop in and say lately I've been safiya deprived. ok thats it.
Okay but the witch outfit on you 😍😍😍 you  look SO good
She should have worn both skirts with the first outfit
Hey safiya! How are you? I wanna knw about ur well being.. And when are you posting ur next video.. I am really really patiently waiting for the next one..
*If Safiya really put out a remix to that song called "Churning butter" I would hit play* 😂
I like how she matched her mask with the outfits
Are you done with youtube? you rarely post anymore. Just curious :)
Who noticed TWICE KPOP GIRL GROUP
my cousins dad used to play george washington at williamsburg!!
Post a video please🙏🙏
Has saf forgotten about us 😔
Can you make a new videos
Missing your monthly uploads Saf
Does anybody notice that the video he posted before this on was 3 months ago so if you watched this at the time it came out that would have been one month ago now if you look at it this one is 2 months ago so she should POST THIS MONTH because we are all board and wanna see somthing funny like her vids  If you read that whole thing I support you
she briefly mentioned shopmegoosta... which is all over my shop tab and i HATE IT
I don’t have a shop tab
*I don't understand how this was just November. Three months again. Feels like three years. Wth! Miss u Saf, x*
how come you haven't been posting? i Miss you!
The ✨kpop fancams✨ got me
Seriously girl where are you?
oh, my grandparents *live* AND *work* at Colonial Williamsubrg and I go twice a year  not suggesting anything but....
When will you post new video ...?
Saf u r gettin more n more Morticia Addams...
you either take this youtube thing seriously or just quit and dont make any "comebacks" with stupid promises ever again... it's like you're doing this under gun point, it's really irritating and disrespectful to your audience. unsubscribe...
Is this a repost? I swear I've watched it before
anyone else getting a lil nervous she isn’t posting?
what happened???
“E girl is a species of emo”  What the hell does Wikipedia think we are
where is safiya???
can u pls make a video like "i wore shein clothes for a week"
I am really good at roller skating and I am 10 😏
This video 1 year old it. 2021 c, mon
The 'E' girl look looks dumpy.
Ok so I’m kinda super late on this vid but did anyone see her wallpaper on her phone😂😂😂😂
Honestly, Saf reminds me of a modern-day (or millennial) Morticia Addams or like a vampire that has been around since like Viking times and done everything she wants to and is now looking for new ideas.
You look sooo good in pink🥺🥺
loooove
Food Theory: never by mc Donald’s medium fry  Stole your “ SHA MASH “ that subscribe button line
You you should play Among us
Did those skirt suspenders get you demonetized? 🤣
Can you do mixing all drug store deoderants?
Instagram wants me to buy Lolita, babycore clothes, anime apparel, wigs, and makeup. 😂 Honestly Instagram is correct there.
Are you when are you going to post again I love your videos so much 😊😊😊
Now that you have moved what's next
Why havent u been uploading
0:37  *Like a tank like a bulldozer-*
Please upload ❤️
Are you a Cancer ? ♋
Its been 2 months new vid pls.
💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Is anyone worried that they haven't  posted in so long
https://youtu.be/fr2XgqZdxeI
Girl I fucking miss you. You like my best friend.
I feel like a skirt would have looked better on the 3rd outfit, rather than jeans.
I feel like a “Goodbye” video is coming from Saf 🥺😭
She uploads less than technoblade
Yeah I think those cherub jeans were supposed to be really loose lol and so if you got the next size up they would probably be longer too
Wow they really took it the extra mile with the Powerpuff Girls shirt.. it's literally printed on the exact shirts my sisters and I wore as PJs/under shirts in like 1995 lmao
Who else remembers the internet stone age when we used to make those "dolls" that we just little pictures of generic, way-too-skinny people and you could like drag different outfits over them and accessories. They even had little bubble gum bubbles to put over their mouths lol they were soooooo popular and now looking back it's just funny to even think about kids/teens doing that now
For all the gen x/millennials.. what was your nickname thing back when they were a thing? (Examples: Angel, Princess, Goddess, Babygirl etc. there were a bunch) I had "Angel" everything lol and my sister had "Princess" everything
Wait a minute are the fashions of the 90s finally coming back???!! Omg I need this 😭 well some things can stay there ofc like overalls with only one strap hooked and boy haircuts with the tail 😂
Hey Saf, I don’t know if you made a video about this. But can you tell us how you and Tyler met? I love rewatching your videos and I’ve always wondered that. 🖤
I don’t use Twitter or Instagram - have any of you any idea if there’s a new video coming up?
I need those black boots!!!! .... Running to ig 🏃🏻‍♀️
I'm new here.. what is Tyler's stance on being on-camera? Just curious bc I think it would be really cool if next time she does one of these, they get some men's stuff for Tyler to try
Omg I want every single disney princess AND villain bathing suit lol
Omg my name is Kirsten and I'm so glad you didn't pronounce it as Kristen
Omg me and my wife watch this channel all of the time when the kids are out there friends houses and Tiler we do enjoy  Your fun personality and Sofia your doing great this kids stared watching this too so now please stop cursing in videos because  My kids some how found out we were watching this so they are too.
Wow
The witch dress looked the best on her
Dont tell me I’m not the only person who watches/listens safiya’s videos to fall asleep
How about saf and ty being zero waste for a week. 👍if u wnt that vdo. It would be awsm😍
Where’d you go???
I really want a collab between Safiya x Tyler and Suzy x Arin.
Its been 2 MONTHSSsSsSsSSsSsSs🥺😢💞 (4)
I love this wig. Imma buy it.
The one style is soft girl
is she ok? r we ever getting a new upload
GIRL WE MISS YOU PLEASE POST🙏🏼
Are you a saggitarious?
I feel personally attacked that my instagram suggests me to buy cheeseboards, brownies and loungewear.
She has sofie dossi phone case
I’m not the only on seeing twice in first second
Why are we even subscribe to her she only post once a year lol 😂  🧐🧐
Bruhh why isn't she posting it's been 2 and a half months😕
Can u please make more YouTube vids     PLEEEEEEEEEEASE 😖🙏🏻
I have a good idea for a video! There is this thing where you shave your face. basically, we all have peach fuzz, and when you shave off all the hair on your face that is not noticeable it makes a difference. Apparently, the color of your face changes and it is cleaner.
Same name squad😂👀😄
Next time you go to the Tokyo can you go to the haikyuu hotel by and my siblings are going when we go again
the fact that that's not an e-girl outfit is news to me also--
OMG your e-girl makeup is the cutest makeup look you've ever done but also it might be the cutest makeup look I've ever seen in general, just wow.
Hey the witch outfit actually looked AMAZING on you and the unwanted flappage could be remedied by tucking them into the nipple hoops and then down the skirt waist!
wE'rE jUsT ChURninG, wE'rE jUsT cHuRNinG
i had actually forgotten that selena gomez was an actress before she was a singer until you mentioned her being in an igtv promotional horror film lmao
i wish wish wish she could post more oftennnnn
I want her to upload😥
I love how two of your Instagram recommendeds were twice (kpop)
I had a Josephina doll. Still have her somewhere. Good memories, god I feel old...
I wish she would post more often i love watching her videos
Can you please do Etsy shops!!!          Mine is happyvibesbycarley
Sofia are you dead? You haven't posted in 2 months
NO VIDEO FOR 2 MONTHS?????!!!!!!!! STOP SLACKING AND GET TO WORK!!!!! BTW: Love you <3
is anyone else wondering why she has not posted in 2 months
It's been 2 months 🥺 where are you safiya🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
ITS BEEN 2 MONTHS!!🥺♥️ WHERE YOU AT
It’s been 2 months, r u ok Safiya?
I need those freaking shoes so bad
I wonder if Pinterest pick your outfits for a week 👀
Saf can you do a video mixing all the holo taco collections together 🖤
who is this sammy u talk about
Waiting for ur next video! It's been Sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo long !🙄😭
Ik this is totally random but you should mix all the bath and body works perfumes together 🥺
The only person who used to be on buzzfeed with a brain.... Kidding Tyler seems to have one too ;)
So when are you going to post the 'We Break All Of Our Coffee Mugs, And Then Glue Them Back Together Again' video?! Can't wait!
Hoping all is well with you two. I miss you both and can't wait for more videos 🥺
Do a nother pirod Prodect
I can never get bored of watching Saf’s videos no matter how many times I watch them
the way they said Oregon  bothered me lmao
I saw Chaeyoung 👀 0:38
Youtubers: Are sponsor for today today is honey, now if you've never heard of honey it's *expalins*  Me and few people: I KNOW WHAT HONEY IS I WATCH LIKE 30 OTHER YOUTUBERS AND THEY ALL GET SPONSORED BY HONEY! (No offense to you tho I've watched you for like 2 years)
Outfit #3 reminds me of the BTS Boy With Luv mv
Even Kpop idols have more comebacks then you! PleSe some back
https://youtu.be/NtceFoa3GgQ safiya please try these hacks
I have the Honey google extension and have for some time. It's actually gotten me quite a bit back (in increments) on sites like forever21 (their deep discount sales appealed, cheaper than thrift stores here), ebay, and even got me $15 off a restaurant order! So that's cool. Especially since I order stuff for my friends and my mom a LOT, I collect the rewards and do the shopping. Nice!  Also, @Safiya - have you ever considered a video where you dress like paintings where the subjects look (at least passably) like you? Emile Vernet-Lecomte painted "Aimee, a Young Egyptian" which you might like for the fun, drapey fabrics and lots of gold jewellery. Or the mysteriousness of Theodor von Holst's "The Wish," of a card-dealer. Or go Classical Greek beauty with roses and marble columns with John William Godward's "The Bouquet," which should be pretty easy with some rose-coloured curtains, buttery-coloured gauze and wide ribbon, and a pale blue curtain. I could probably make the whole costume with very, very, very limited sewing skills (read: no actual training or anything) in a few hours. Oh, and I think she's wearing some sandals, so any leather-look flats would be fine. If only I had the dark hair and facial features for this repro!
each video she comes closer to looking like morticia addams and absolutely kills it
You should go to Williamsburg. Lots of fun go to www.visitwilliamsburg.com/shopping.
witch is E-girl
New video????
hi Safiya what sound equipment is it you use you know for like when your walking around so your camer sound actually sounds good
The power puff girls top had been put on a kids school vest(underwear)  and not sure i would trust a outfit called minga ...in the uk it means someone who is unfortunate looking ...kinda fits the jeans lol
hey could you do a vid were you buy a outfit/makeup from only 100% vegan/good for the plantet product and say what it's like
I really wish she would do more videos I really love her content been watching her for YEARS BEFORE SHE LEFT BUZZFEED!!
2 months late,I’m new and I love your videos
The last outfit looks very good together. The only thing that's a bit off is the wig💕
The first outfit looked so comfy honestly. Id wear that outside and feel pretty as hell.
I don’t like you 😑
Did they move?
“nestled” *shop tab is now in THE MOST inconvenient place possible*
I live in Va near Colonial Williamsburg. Come take you outfit for a spin😃

0:36 OMG SAFIYA IS A ONCE??? ALSO A KPOPERS????? AAAAAAA
One more excellent video from you  Sweet voice  Excellent explained  Cute princess 👩
Why hasn’t she posted?
Are you taking a break? :(
I take it you’ve never been to Utah??
ummm we miss you. Have you abandoned us?
I'm sorry, but like what happened? We used to have something akin to 2 videos a month on 2019 but only 7 in total on 2020...
It been 2 month since this video can you pleeeaaaassssseeeeeeee upload another one I need it 😔😔😔
I think the not-e-girl outfit looks best at 33:10, like when the jacket is off the shoulder like that
Happy New Year, I miss y’all💕💕
When will you post again 😟 i have watched all ur vids POST MOREEEE
she was mixing up e-girl and the kidcore y2k mixture type thing that’s trendy right now but honestly they mix in with each other
0:40 peep chaeyoung and nayeon 😩
I really like the black one and I love black colour 😍
Are we not gonna talk about her wallpaper on her Home Screen? Lol it’s at 3:14 😂
Well, now I want to see the Franken mug!
Are you ok Safiya? İ hope everything is ok.
Ronnnn Stahhhhhp!!!!🤣💙
Just when Safia said I saw, Chaeyoung just popped out
I misss you
It's been 2 months now!
Nice upload sis
the fact everyone is so shocked at her 'pioneer' outfit???? You guys clearly don't have any nearby mennonite communities lol. Borderline uncomfortable to watch, but at least they'll never know...cuz no internet and all...
I am from Oregon and the way you guys said Oregon trail was totally nails on a chalk board 🤣 but I still adore you and love your cute clothes !!!
When will she be back?
Couldn’t stop looking at how satisfyingly neat Saf’s eyeliner was 😍
Did she quit yt???
I miss your videos so much :(...Your old videos have been on repeat consistently...
Where is she?
♡ hope you two are doing good ♡
Where have you gone 😟🥺
love the style of the jeans on saf! i've been loving my mom jeans lately and they look awesome on her!
What’s wrong with Lele Pons
Should go to grave face museum
Whats sad is that she hasn't uploaded in like 2 month
who all saw the trans pride heart at 5:00
who else saw the trans pride heart
Wow she really rocked those looks
Thanks for watching my videos. Still learning youtube!
I think Saf looks sooo good in her last outfit, like the jeans look GOOD, the booty was JUICY and the jacket was CUTE
man i miss the time when the activity section hadnt been fucking overtaken by this bullshit

I love your channel as well as your YouTube stories...but can you make the funny info blurbs last longer. You have them in for so short a time I need to go back and attempt to pause at the right moment about 3 times before I actually see what you said. Again, love you guys, hope you are well. Love from Boston

I actually love the pink wig! I think the pink looks so pretty with your eye and I like the dark eyebrows with it! Maybe pink hair in the future?! 😉🎀
Its a Frankenstein - Stein hehehe

Hi to anyone reading this I hope you know that god loves you and cares for you no matter what you are going through right know put your trust in him and you will be fine. He knows your pain,he knows the mistakes you have made but he will forgive you if you ask him to. When you feel all alone go to his word a talk to him and you will no longer fill that. You can ask him for anything he will never leave you nor forsake you. Have a bless day god bless❤️❤️
anyone else scared that she has posted ?Is she dead?
It’s good
I loveddd the pink look I wou D defenatly wear the jacket and the skirt that would Mach it
We love you Saf
you are so beautiful and have a beautiful heart so sweet face
Yes I'm very late to this party. YouTube never showed me this one when it was uploaded. Side note, how much does their house look like Jenna & Julien's house? Like I had to do a double take when she was on the couch with the kitchen in the background.. Also, how come I've never noticed this before🤔 maybe I just miss J&J and haven't seen Saf in too long... 🙈 Anyway, love the vid!  I love the celestial shoes the most! So unique and looks hella comfy... I'd like to see Saf try to give Ty a couple different styles using the Instagram shop tab. I think that would be entertaining
Like 🌺🌺🌺🌺
When are u posting again,?
31:22 You look like that Lazy Town girl lol.
idk what happened over quarantine but Safiya somehow got so much hotter!!!
where did you get that black floral top!!! it’s literally so cute
Why haven't u posted in 2 months?
Honestly, you look so good in pink hair in my opinion.👍❤️
Safiya!! where are you??? it's been two months!! there are two things in my mind 1. she's taking a break like everyone else  OR 2.She's prego. hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
the pastels and soft colors that is called a soft girl 😂😂
safya in the i sta witch outfit hits dif
Tbh I’m getting dirty candy from Julie and the Phantoms
Saf when are you going to post a next vid?
Safiya: Aren't we all in spied by Sammy Sweetheart? Me: Who is Sammy Sweetheart?!?!?!
The exasperation in Tyler’s “never mind 😒” has me DYING 😂😂
25:37, id say your way more casual goth than anything based off your style
How do u get that many subs if u don't upload that often?
18:56 her house reminds me of jenna marbles
Am I the only one who has been a fan for like 4 years 😭😭
SAFIYA IS GLOWING SO BEAUTIFUL LOVE
Miss gurl post 😭
I seriously dont care how i ever look. It more about how i feel physically or mentally. So this is the only beuty channel i will ever watch bc this woman is so adorable and funny.
you should post soon again
I need to say, a resident of the uk. A minger is someone disgusting. Said with an English accent specifically London it sounds like “minga “
you like never post anymore :( :( :( :( :(    ): ): O: ): ):
looks great ....dont complain about witch outfit cause its hot
Holy hell, I wish the only thing I had to do all year was to make 4 videos...
Fan that TWICE appeared in ur feed!!!
The last outfit would look great if you ditch the wig lol
A challenge for u please please please do it wear saree💞💞💞💞 ,a Indian outfit for 24 hours. U can see tutorials from youtube😇😇😇😇😇
A challenge for u
came back again after 2 months WHEN R UPOSTING SAFIYA WE MISS U
That black dress was looking awesome with the mask ❤️❤️
How many years do I have to wait for a video 😑🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑
here me out.... Meal boxes reviewed
Oh to have the old instagram layout back. I would do anything. ANYTHING
Did she quit YT?
and she's gone!...again
I LOVE the last look and the Witch!!!! But that galaxy mask is waaay too big!
Your backdrop looks IDENTICAL to Jenna Marbles lol
Pls post it is killing me😭
This channel is dying
At least show SOME respect to your subscribers by giving us some content. But you’ll travel across the entire country 🙄
The laces on the Moon Shoes seem like they could be boot laces or it could be trying for the...fashionably untied/undone look. Wig tips: Brush through the wig, check how the wig reacts to heat and heat treat to possibly style, and consider dulling the tone possibly.
Alright
We need new videos
All the e-girls watching this video are having heart palpitations
I am the bruh boy.
I am the bruh girl.
I am a girl.
U say u will post 😬😬😬🤔🤔
👈👈💐💐💐❤❤👍
Can you try cosplaying an anime character it will be the best ❤
I actually liked the wig. I know black is a little more your thing, but that shade of pink really flatters your skin tone, and that particular hairstyle that the wig is in is also very flattering for your face shape. So yeah. It may have been a little out there for your usual taste, but for what it's worth, it looked great on you.
Why don’t you upload video every weak
LET TYLER DRESS U FOR A WEEK!!!
Rip 😭😭😭😭
I have since found and ordered those celestial boots for myself and i have with them just about everyday with the exception of a few days the week before Christmas when we got a foot of snow and i had  to switch them out for my snow boots. For anyone wondering, they are even cuter in person
What if you try some Indian look
I love the Pastel colour dress
I think the belt is upside down
Bonus idea: viewers pick safiyas next peircing :D
what you thought was e-girl vibes was more soft girl vibes :)
can someone please tell me how to pronounce safiya’s last name 🥲
so why are you subscribed to game and film theorists and aren't subscribed to food theorists?
Dude, Ty did great on the wig!!
Its halloween every day for Sof
Safiya we need a new video pless Safiya . plesssss.
when are you gonna post again your videos are soooo good i miss you
Is she quitting youtube? She dont Upload Any more :(
In the witch outfit i was seriously getting addams family vibes
The pink jacket would be cute with the black velvet skirt.  And the white colonial shirt would work with the jeans
22:14 pretty sure they said “weirdo”
I love the belt in the first look 😍
Lots of love from india. I have one request , please keep QNA session. And my questions is how u edit videos and how u make videos also what tools you use for editing videos.
I love the Not an E-Girl look, but I would probably swap out the really bad fitting jeans for a burgundy-colored legging! I think that would make the look fit more cohesively.
Safiya’s closet Black dress Black pants Rare pink shirt Black shirt More black items
All 3 of these see outfits were such fun looks! Taking off the bonnet completely changed the vibe of the first outfit, with your hair down I loved how retro that outfit became (rather than prairie lol) those moon dust boots are amazing!  this is such a cool concept for a video!
Can you post more videos you stopped but why?
I found this channel by looking up weird Indian YouTube people  I’m pretty sure she’s not Indian but I’m not disappointed
Lovee
i love u roleplaying every outfit
“ore-gone” yall it’s oregon
I wish I had the confidence that Safiya has in all her video's !!!!
Safiya seems to be a Once😂
okay so can i just say.... i'mma just drop it hehe... in the third outfit when wearing the mask safiya looks like some form of janet from the good place
girl where are you its been 2 months already  update: now its been 3 months WHERE ARE YOU
Why is she not posting anymore..
I like how her banner says new video every week xD
When I saw Mina I screamed.
Wait didn’t you do the cabbage man outfit
Why did she stop posting vids?
It's been 2 months where did you goooo ;-;
Ngl they all looked really good on u 💗
does anyone know where safiya got that black mask she wore with the witchy outfit? its so cute and I cant find anything like it.
Wonderful idea😍😍👍👍👍
Plz frees like an American girl doll for a week
That overall skirt... you probably should have tucked the ends of the straps into the holes... that’s what they look like they’re for 😂
Me watching this at midnight be like 😂😂😂 my parent: bee quit and go to beddd
I feel like the bonnet is on backwards
You should mix all the crayola crayons together to make a frankencrayon.
I WANT A NEW VIDEO SAF CMON

I love how her explore page is filled with kpop now 😭
Pls do the red light make-up challenge
Should do one of every bathroom every make up I meant eyeshadow and everyone of candles!
When will u post  another video??????
Who else is missing her old intro      👇
YOUR VOICE IS REALLY WEIRD. IT GIVES ME A HEADACHE 😑  if you don't agree read more:                 YOU'RE RIGHT! Anyone who doesn't like her have a serious problem 😠 👁👄👁
First of all how are you so Beautiful?
Me as soon as she shows her recommended page- " OH WOW THATS NAYEON FROM TWICE!"  "OH WAIT THATS RYUJIN! OH WAIT THERE ARE SO MANY KPOP THINGS"
I literally don’t care about the topic of the video but I feel like I haven’t heard your voice and laughed at how corny and goofy that you guys are so I just watched the whole video just because 🥰
Hlo.. Saiya  I lam obsseesd with your videos that you have made on bad makeup science please keep making more .#LovefromIndia
Where did Saf and Tyler go?
Saf smelling a flower while wearing a mask is the best thing to happen in 2020
They got rid of it lol
outfit 2 is EVERYTHING
when is next video
whos watching  in 2021  ;) also why is she not posting
At 11:06 did anyone else see the tom nook " i am once again asking for your financial support"?
Can you please do disenybounding again??
Hi:) . I was wondering if you would do a video of trying stuff from shein:)
Love your videos ❤️ keep up the good work😁
TWICE ON HER EXPLORE
TODAY IS MY BIRTH DAY
Saf: looking for shops Me: looking at all the k-pop stuff-🖤💗🤣
when are you going to get out another video its been a month
18:49 each mask goes with each outfit lmao
My boss used to call that a "smiling crotch"☺ and was strictly banned in the office! Only mom jeans allowed. Lol.
I would actually buy the second outfit.
I love the intro cause it’s cracks me up when she dances in that clear jacket makes me cry laughing
I love how she said she likes ti get in character
Need more videoe..miss Watching you
The instagram shop tab has been here for YEARRRRS. I love looking through it and bookmarking stuff even tho I'll never buy it
I love kpop
Kpopppppp
Video idea: Buying one of every soap from lush and melting them together
Happy New Year!
House tour?!?
How about wearing/eating/using every Franklin-makeup or every Franklin thing you made?
i missed your videos
https://youtu.be/5_Yq_II8J6M
As an Oregonian the pronunciation of Oregon killed me lmao
Hi, Saf!  We have the same b-day!
Is Safiya a witch?
When is the next video
Can we talk about how she owned the witchy Gothic look? She looked stunning in it!
Tonight we fly!!😂🙌
please upload  new video  please
Her videos always remind me of a 7th graders presentation that drags on
after covid, i think you would definitely enjoy Jamestown! you can churn butter there (:
I got catcalled all the time in my polonaise gown when I was a walking tour guide in Philadelphia 😂
Happy 2021 and I hope all is well with you @Safiya Nygaard
Safia looked really good in the pink outfit
Where’d you go!!!!! We miss you! 🥺
Why isnt she uploading any more
You look beautiful in all these outfits♥️♥️
i dont know why exactly.. but i like your content.. i love to sleep to it.. good job, not many channels manage to do that.
Did she just say "okaayyyyyy" instead of "alraaaight
Can you try the diamond painting?
i miss crusty😅
The tag line on your header should be changed since you're posting every couple months or so.
Harajuku decora makeover pleaaaaasssseee :) google it it’s insane
She made her money and now uploading whenever she pleases  Good stuff
PLEASE POST MORE!!! i miss your uploads!!!
Can you mix every soap to make a franken soap
The folds are called whiskering in fashion industry fittings- too small. Cute though!!!
Ahhhhhh the 90's faux far bucket hat. I STILL have one.
I just watched their stories on yt. Can anyone fill me in if they are moving or not? if so where? thanks y’all😂😂
*when you live in Virginia*
The intro lyrics I hear is this is safiyas nye intro song like AAAAAAH
You should do a video buying stuff from TikTok ads
Upload🥺😭😭😭😭
This video is so long, but because it’s so engaging you don’t notice
Ik Safiya has a video where she dresses according to her body type, but there is a different classification of body types that are a *lot* more thorough. It's the Kibbe body types, no fruit like pears or apples, it is a lot more detailed too. And I'd really like if she discovered her body type and dressed according to it for a video, that would be really fun
SHE NEEDS TO POST MORRRE
Where did she go she hasn’t posted for a month
You should make a Franken perfume or a franken soap! :3
Where have you been
The "E-girl" outfit kinda gives me Marina and the Diamonds vibes during the Electra Heart album and I'm not quite sure why.  I think it's mainly the jacket, makeup, and wig.
Safiya LOVE the witch look  !! Tuck the overall flaps into the loops that way you can get wear out of it without looking like nipple flips
I actually really liked the last outfit the one that you call the emo girl outfit
I remember the video in when Safiya got the intro used in this videos
I miss your videos... you posting so little now. And even when you posting it's old stuff...
E-girl just buy one.
Used to like her channel but the lack of consistency regarding uploads and the similar themes makes me surprised she still has so many viewers  Only clicked on as it said new video coming and shock ,nothing there again !
Hi Happy 2021
Hi I'm coming sei your videos please you coming sei my videos help me 😘😘😘
Yo it’s Yo it’s 2021
video idea: acrylic pour 2: revenge pour 🙏🏼😂
Your idea are always amazing
Safiya when will your next video come!?you make videos in a gap of months?😨 please do reply to my comment.
I love the witchioutfit 😍 you're cute and funny. Thanks for this video @Safiya
not to be sarcastic your home page of youtube still says new videos every "week" so make that a "month " just a random topper and a bitch from high school
Some f the out fits look really nice on you imma real big fan
The freaking cupcake soap
pause at 1:06 ......hol up i look like mona lisa right now
Love you
I think she should mix all the lotions at Bath & Body Works
Where r u queeeeen?? It's been more than a month since you uploaded!
Make a I dress in Halloween costumes for a week vid
At 11:37 look at her phone there is a face is that saf or no
The products are very good and very high quality I definitely recommend you to buy  https://amzn.to/3hyYORE
She should do a house tour   Thumbs up if you agree
C'mon Safiya it's been a YEAR it's time to upload again :/
In your first outfit you remind me of Drew Barrymore in Ever After after taking off the bonnet
R.I.P.
U don’t talk about ur marriage i wanted to know how it was going and whats it like. Q and A please.
Here’s a MineCraft happy new year to one of my favorite YouTube channels and all its fans:    youtu.be/io-ipw3rX24
hey Saf I saw u at Safeway in Gallup New Mexico today. I really wanted to take a picture with u and Tyler I was in the red pants a hoodie with a red mask idk if u saw me but I hope u see this comment and I hope u and Tyler have fun in New Mexico.
Ahh honey... the spawn of Mr beasts crazy ideas
Pastel goth girl i wear it XD
If the gram recommended more black, this would make more sense for u cause 19:58 is just... well, and 25:21 is not, well, you!
The last one is more of a soft girl mixed with an e-girl
29:37 Was this shot in Jenna Marbles’s house? This looks EXACTLY like her house
i didnt notice saf's eyebrows till tyler mentioned them and now I cant see them the same way lol
Saf we r waiting for ur next video soonnn....
Happy New Year 🥳🎉
Can you do another IG study by using a totally different phone than the one that has your main IG on it? I'm curious to see the difference in searches. ;3
I love all of them😁
0:38 so we're just gonna ignore the video of twice? okay
Hey I am a big fan and I have this video idea so we all know you are a morticia stan and a theatre kid so you and Tyler can dress up as morticia and gomez for a day also follow your usual day acting like them
The pink thing is calld soft girl teehee
i saw nayeon and chaeyong of twice in her explore page...she's a once
I've been watching you for like 3 years and your videos are the light of my life and have gotten me through so many bad days I mostly rewatch your videos like the Franken videos and spa videos because they keep my brain occupied :D
Did anyone noticed that Safiya's looking like Morticia Addams every day.😰
Ever since I found your channel while in quarantine, I've been binge watching your videos
Is no one gonna talk about how she ghosted ur for a whole month 👁️👄👁️ yes ik she needs to order and let it go in blablabla but like 👁️👄👁️ you know what I'm talking about
"Sabbath Night Fever " lmao
all 3/10
Where is she moving to NY?
Pls pls post more I love your vids they are amazing and I love your style 😊
Enjoyed watching this a 2nd time! Love you guys! <3 <3 <3
Sometimes i wonder if she still has all those candles from mixing every candle from bath and bodyworks just lying around the new house somewhere
I hate myself for how much I like the third outfit, especially considering how the second one is so much more "me"
10:50 it kinda sounds like she’s saying poopy
🙏🏻pls post a new video soon
https://youtu.be/YvkHorMkqT0
Guys the reason she's not posting is because she is moving. You can read her blog post for more information on that but she is filming some moving vlogs but editing her other videos isn't her number one priority right now what with packing and all that so just give her some time and she'll come back when she's ready
Did Anyone else hear her say “how ya doin?” and Think of Bang Chan from Stray Kids?
The ubiquitous australian naturalistically arrive because desk rationally claim from a lively birch. delirious, third graphic
Do a Cleopatra makeover!!! Please please please
Why does she never post
I love her but y does she only post like once a month?
yo where she go? she hasn't posted in like a month, is she dead? i hope not....
Were you worried you would order from a company that wasn't real? Some of the costs seem too good to be true and you can't verify many of the companies.
There are soft girls
So you taking a break
post more often
When is she posting again? 😔
Do a video of trying everyday outfits or wedding outfits from different countries.   Like India  Pakistan  Saudi Arabia Mexico. Phillipines
Hey Saf! You look awesome in all styles! The vintage and historical one looks especially nice on you! ^u^ I would love to see you melt lipsticks or mix eyeshadows/blushes together sometime
safiya why dont you mix all the creams from bath and body works  like you mixed all the candles
You've been gone so long .. you better be coming back with a baby bump!!
Have you heard of Rosegal??? I would  love if you did picks from there.
no one gonna pay attention to those unread messages and missed calls-
Btw, the last look would be called a “soft girl”
Remember when we thought she was dead
So loving those Celestial boots!!!!!
girl, where are youuu!!??
You can tell with Tyler’s little giggles when Safia is making jokes during the witch fit how in love he is you can tell these too are genuinely happy together
hey are you muslim ?
"fellow kids-" she's coming for Lauren's brand
u should mix every ice cream flavor
And I guess you like black
I like those black ones 😍
Why you're not turning anymore
Why did she stop posting
🌸 I think the last look is my favourite 🌸
Had to get new phone and had to find my favorite channels 😊🎄🎁
Nice video
https://youtu.be/KDJ7CFN3bAI
The witchy outfit is soooo cute, like soo nice. Loveee itt
Hello Safiya. I think that the only mixing video is with soap. I mean you have done bathbombs, lipstick and candels so why bot all soap. Becaus its whould be fun to see when you small, buy and mix everything. I like all of your videos. Hope you see this comment from Sweden 🇸🇪
ok the last look the pink hair suits you a lot and the jacket would be so cute on some black skinny jeans and beats with a black tank top
When you are waiting for another safiya video and you realize twice is in safiya's channels section 😮
Apparently they're moving to the Midwest and this excites my wife.
I want that second outfit
Safiya should get those tall goth shoes The demonia ones
Her wearing the first thing reminds me of myself cosplaying
20:05 I do
Wigs are actually really easy to use Well cosplay ones  I cosplay
My Instagram shop tab is VERY goth vintage vampire
the "e-girl" aesthetic is called soft girl aesthetic I believe
Haii Safiya sorry I'm so late!
she's like this aunt that everyone has that just tries a bit to hard to be cool and young....
Never seen that movie
uh- please tell me your just taking a long break. :,)
when she was saying e girl it was soft girl all the time lol
Hi Safiya! Just came to wish you Tyler and Crusty a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! I just read your blog post so I know you're working hard on everything. I just wanted to tell you that you can do it! Take all the time you need and try not to internalize everything or feel guilty. You do you at your own pace!
not e girl outfit is called soft girl they egirls without all the black
As a person who lives in Oregon, pronouncing it ore-gone brought pain to my heart.
It’s a hay penny a glass 💀😂
they show baby accounts to every woman over the age of 23, as if we all just gave a shit about that because we have a vagina 🤷🏻‍♀️
Hi Safiya when are you going to try soap art of bad science again I love them bids also the ones with Tyler congratulations on getting married your wedding was beautiful I only just saw it been in hospital a long time now Iv got COVID-19 so I’m binge watching your vids. Take care of yourselves. Lv Rachy xxxxx
heyy can u pls make a q n a video
by the way that tank top is from princess polly the people how shipped you that just put a rose on the top of it and put there tag on it and branded it as there own hope this helped anyone because i think you can get it cheaper of of the princess polly shop.🤯😘😁
Could you do a mixing all my perfumes together
Ok but why is no one talking about her phone wallpaper? 😂😂😂 It's at 3:15
Im new to your channel and i love you in a non weird way I love your narrating voice and your beautiful in the many different styles I see a star getting ready to shoot pass the moon and shine
id say the last fit would look really good without the jacket. i think the word that would fit the style better is soft girl, not egirl
I think the "e-girl" outfit could have used a high waisted skirt instead of the jean pants and maybe thigh highs for a more e-girl and cohesive look
I love the outfitters
She is just amazing.....I love watching videos so much..lots lots and lots of love fromm india❤
https://youtu.be/aTMDzu1rJoY ❤️🔥
For real when I was watching this my insta started blowing up no joke owo

I think that with the suspender skirt the straps are supposed to thread through the rings and be under the skirt
Crusty in the intro is so cute
Anymore  videos?  Missing them!
Longer hair
omg when you watch an old video and then you watch this one and your like something looks different OMG she has LONGGGGG HAIR
I am a big fan of Billie eilish so can you do a billie eilish look pls 😊
I haven’t seen anyone comment the Declaration Of Independence yet so here  When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.  He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.  He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.  He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.  He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.  He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.  He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.  He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.  He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.  He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.  He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.  He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.  He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.  He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:  For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:  For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:  For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:  For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:  For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:  For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences  For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:  For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:  For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.  He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.  He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.  He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.  He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.  He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.  In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.  Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.  We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.
Can you make your own candles? Like you did with the soap.
Egirl doesn't mean "emo" girl it means electronic girl.An egirl likes anime a lot has her phone always with her (lol we can't live without electronics) and because of the anime and all the "cartoonish"part they have "weird" hair colours (they dye their hair). So,  hope that cleared your mind cause all the girls (and me)  were a bit triggered 😂BTW the skirt that you bought for the witch look would also match for an egirl look and the hair was perfect don't worry about it😂. I love you on your videos!
Why hasn`t Safiya been posting lately? It`s been a month..
Saf, they think you're the Witch of Blackbird Pond!   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witch_of_Blackbird_Pond
These are basically my 3 aesthetics
*i like the phones wallpaper*
This is totally unrelated to the video, but you should try SHEIN's new cosmetic line. It is sold on the website/app. They have a whole face on there, and I would love to see if they're at all good!  Btw, love your vids! Keep up the great work!
The pink outfit is right up my alley. Im a pick articles of clothes and throwing them on
Dress like a animes Characters for a week please I would love it 😀

SHE IS LITERALLY GLOWINGGG✨✨
Everyone: tginking about the video 1% of people: thinking about her wallpaper. Lol
Yo Safiya Made my childhood the best, With her funny Jokes and Ridiculously huge lipstick made i can say Saf Is the Best
There's a reenactment village in Mumford,NY - they have been featured in youtube videos before.
The starkid reference made my day
It's cold a crop top 💢💢💢
I'd love to see her go to a ren faire! She could make some awesome outfits
The capricious libra surprisingly wash because pond coherently pull atop a voracious brother-in-law.  far-flung, recondite hexagon
love this - ty and safiya are adorable
Anyone else want her to try products from Aliexpress? 🙋‍♀️
I love that pink wig and the pink jacket on you. Those jeans are nice but I’d try either getting similar ones that or bigger or ones that are just that blue in a bigger sizes. Great job safiya.
Hey love from India please try wearing saree.♥️♥️
Safia, wardrobeshop.com just popped up in my Facebook feed. I think you'd really like the clothes.
I love that she still uses this intro song
3:15 Best wallpaper where'd ypu get it safiya?
The way you say oregon hurts my heart 🤣🤣🤣
I feel like some white shoe laces would look really cute with those star boots! And maybe lace them up in a fun different way?
Is no one going to mention how tylers face is her wallpaper lmao
The second look is really pretty and it suits you! I like the witch-top LOL
my favorite, hands down, was the witch one. She looks so good !!! It was basically made for her
ih
I just now thought of this: Since Safiya has so many dark clothes, she is a black Cousin It/ blob 😂
MAKE TWISTED CANDLES😱❤
Love the detail on the soft girl pants and the skirt of the goth-ish look
bruh when she took off the bonnet she looked like winona ryder in the crucible
Plz post more videos plz
Wear a kimono
i love sayfiya but she has been posting less only once 2 months or 1 month
Miss you. Post more please. :)
Do I miks all my Franken blush
Replace the shoelace with a wide black ribbon!! Satin would be easy, but velvet would be cute too <3
Mix every flavor of Ice cream 🍦, and mix every brand/scent/odor/flavor? of soap and/or shampoo
Happy holidays  I enjoy  all the vlogs and mix of everything....have a nice holiday  an crusty  also.
I want to see Saf in the anime outfit from JoJo
Can you do a franken eyeliner I can really spell that well
At 24:39 you kinda sound like Melisandre from GOT lol
We must appreciate the fact that Safiya probably s-ends hundreds of dollars on these videos.
Please bring back your lipstick collection soon! I never had a chance to buy it before and would really appreciate the opportunity to own some. Thank you and I love your videos!
I’m scared why hasn’t saf posted in a month!? Is she ok?
first time watching her and I can't get over how much she sounds like natalia taylor.
Honestly this is the bes channel ive ever stumbled on. Keep it up 💜
the velvet skirt and witch top outfit looked really pretty. it's all black and everything, but it read more cute than intimidating to me, since there were cute motifs like the moons and hearts. but then again i often end up wearing things that fit goth style so maybe i'm just desensitized to it lol
Hey I know you probably won’t see this but I would really love if you did a review of the the clothes on dress-x.com!! It’s digital clothing and I think you could make a really cool video while spreading awareness about the problems with the fashion industry❤️
Could you check out dhgate? They have some cool stuff for fairly cheap and I bought my wedding dress there. But I'm curious about their other products. dhgate.com
YOU SHOULD MAKE A VIDEO GOING TO THE MUSEUM OF ICE CREAM !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
PLEASE try to make a spiral wick candle that burns around  and around the candle!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I think all your critiques on your outfits were on point.  The first look was kinda bringing back the retro little house on the prarie look. (I actually think designers could make it even more modern and bring it up to speed to today's time with bolder colors... neons, hot pinks and blacks...etc) The second look, I didnt even realize how many little details were off, but overall it looked good. (but I totally agree that straight up "Witch" on the front is probably a bit deterring to wear openly even if the material and silhouette are nice) That last look DID admittedly look a hot mess, but I think is had to do with the jeans kinda looking like mom jeans. The upper part of the look seemed fine to be. I honestly think the wig was something different. Something did feel off about it and I did wonder if it was the length that was wrong or if it was just a case of needing bangs to make up for hair line. To me the color was actually nice on you and it did make me wonder if a Victoria Beckham bob wig in that shade being a better look for you.
Question: how much are those shoes with the moons?
Have u met any drag queen?
The first otfet remanded me of old lithuanias close
I love the pink jeans jacket 😍
Have you disappeared!!!!
Why are you so late at posting
Need Your Support https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChgmpXk_fZIx-kIYKk80y7A
Does anyone know where her black shirt with the flowers on it  is from or what it's called ?
Chromatica threw up on her on the last outfit
I love how Saf’s personal style is like BLACKENED ABYSS and then her house is a chic, modern WHITE. 😂😂
IS NO ONE GONNA TALK ABT HOW MUCH KPOP STUFF SHE HAS ON HER EXPLORE PAGE-

The “witch” top totally stole that logo from the cover of the book Witch by Lisa Lister 😬😬😬
Who else thought this looked like Jenna marbles house
She looks so good with pink hair
I’m just here thinking if she is a kpop Stan
in the last outfit it would have looked nicer with a black jacket
thanks so much
You should dress like in the 1850s
Because I just saw someone that looks JUST like you
Hey quick question do you live in AZ

Can we get Safiya to 10 million before the end of the year?? Sub to her lets get her to it as soon as possibleeee
Heeeeloouuu frieendsssss          .
The rewatchability of Safiya's videos is actually insane 😂
The angel pants ruined the last outfit. If paired with a different pair of pants would make that last outfit alot better.
Love you in the black outfit.
honestly you rock the pink hair colour .
The painstaking train inherently transport because may oceanographically watch including a unruly meteorology. ugly, nonstop chemistry
girrrl the makeuppp daamn
Excuse me I need my seat 🍿
Saf you should mix all the soaps together and make a Franken-soap
I'm obsessed with the witch look and u looked great in it
You somehow manage to make every style you try work. You look good in everything!
You don't even need to tell me to smash that like button. I did it before video even started!
Why does her house look so incredibly similar to Jenna and julien’s house?!
twice on her explore page
Why are you in Jenna marbles house? Lol
HAPPY 9 MILLION SUBS SAF
Can you do dressing like Harry Potter houses for a week plssssssssss
I don't get why an old style now has a new name (egirl). It's not new.
The second look was it for me! I was practically drooling on my phone when I saw the boots! Oh my goodness those moon boots! Okay, I'm going to stop now because I will compose a poem to those boots!   These are my favorite Safiya videos next to the wedding shopping!
Oh look is period blood 🩸 girl from buzzfeed 😂
why isnt anybody talking about ho they sell that poderpuff shirt and all the other ones from that sketchy insta shop for like $4 on aliexpress and they charged saf $24 and its still the same terrible material
Ive seen so many honey ads but none had made me look into it but her description of it.!?!? 😦
After the wedding content hasn’t been up to date anymore....
I need to know... Are the shoes comfy? I adore them so much!
Post more!!!!!
The petite quotation implicitly ski because barbara structurally book in a whispering internet. damp, gainful latency
post more pls
3:16 who else saw her wallpaper
Hi I'm from indonesia   KAMU CANTIK💛
Im still waiting the i got a 1920s makeover
Well since safiya got married and she posts less now .. and although understandable.. I really liked her videos so does anyone know of a similar chanel that provides the same "ooh I am curious " vibes ... thanks and peace to the world ✌ ☮ 🕊
Isn’t your wedding anniversary coming up. Are you gonna film that.
Her videos are so rewatchable
19:20 "that's the face whole" 🤣🤣🤣
Nice👍👍👌👌👌🙏
"Comfortable vampire" 😂
To me that nostalgic cutesy pastel stuff is definitely a branch of the egirl tree so to speak
I KNOW ITS ONLY BEEN A MONTH BUT I MISS YOU! 💕💕
I think the word you were looking for instead of e-girl is Y2K style
Plz can you try " Wearing Traditional Indian dress for a day
anyone else realizing that saf and Jenna marbles literally have the same house
Hey!! You should do a 'I tried resin art for the first time' video
Was it just me or did her house look almost identical to Jenna marbles
When quarantine is over or the next time ur in Japan you should make a video about staying at the one dollar hotel lol they also have a youtube channel
Hi Safiya ❤️ have you ever heard of Monat hair care brand? Can you please do a review on that please. Thank you. I love your content btw ❤️
honestly for the 3rd outfit the only thing really throwing it off was the wig. dark hair would have balanced out the outfit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZdctutjfVA  DIY christmas globe 😍
anyone else shocked by how glowy and lovely her skin looked after the second look?! 😍
I checked my shop tag watching this video.... I had cars, soccer shoes, hoddies and men's underwear... I don't know where this stuff is comming from ...
I thought safiya hadn’t posted in months & in fact YouTube unsubbed me. How is this still happeninggg 🤦🏽‍♀️😭
Your house looks exactly like Jenna marbles' house, at least the setup.
Tyler’s “never mind” @ 15:05 🤣🤣🤣
12:59 DKSKSKAJWAK
Safiya should do mixing every beauty guru lipstick or liquid lipstick
Why don't u most more often
As someone who has spent nearly their whole life in williamsburg, jamestwon, and Yorktown, I love that you love it. I have my own williamsburg dresses (made myself and 1 I made extra pieces for). You got yours right, its not williamsburg, it's little house on the prairie 🤣 its still super cute and I love it. Loved all of the outfits. Id wear em. 🖤
i loved all of these fits and she deffinetly pulled them all off
When will you post a new vidio
0:37-0:38 **screams because I saw twice**
Me a pagan watching this weird lady try on "witch clothes" 😂😂😂
Shout out to my fellow Oregonians cringing hard at their pronunciation of Oregon.
The pink outfit looks way better with the jacket off the shoulder kinda just resting at the waist on your arms
Anyone else wanna slap Joey Graceffas ex in the face for what he said about Safiya? No just me? Okay 😂
It would’ve been great if at the end of the episode you combined pieces from all of the outfits to create your own. That would’ve been interesting to see.
That pink wig with her witch goth outfit would be perfect
Omg when is the Franken-Mug vid coming out??????????????
Oh I remember Totally Spies, they were so epic haha
I need a resin pour from you guys pleaassssseeee
Colonial Williamsburg is sooooo much fun!
25:25 she looks like Mortica from the adams family
❤️
Only OGs will question what happens to the GIANT LIPSTICK! SERIOUSLY where is it? What did they do with it?
She should try modern style aesthetic looks, like dark academia, cottage core, modern hippie, actual e-girl, etc.
I absolutely love you and your videos 💗 *And Tyler
I love the witch outfit 😁😁
"hello fellow kids" now it's like Safiya wants me to cry about the fact that I think that laurenzside and safiya should do a collab. (Yeah, I watch her, I'm like a adult child leave me alone)
Safiya you could now possibly have a buzzfeed reunion now that I believe all the members of ladylike has left
i love the fact that there’s a girl group fancam on her igtv
Her living room looks like Jenna and juliens
I love you so please stop saying Oregon like that. x.x It's OR-eh-gun
Is there a way to not have videos of a certain YouTuber play automatically. I'm sorry but this womans voice hurts me.
Why am i getting total SWOOP vibes?
Saf in that black jumpsuit will go down in history 👌
did she change her house cause idk because i haven’t watched her in a year  :-:
Safiya why don't you make a video on trying Indian food.!?
Sooo boring..
do a wax seal video
I love you Sophia so much and Tyler do you not be worried because I am a girl
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VXintM-xDk
My shopping tab has no clue what I like. It just suggets random shit, like sneakers, even though I only ever wear black boots LMAO
Us Cancers be obsessed with them moons, baby 🦀🦀 👌👌
Stay safe everyone 🤗 we are all in this together(btw I'm not a bot I just wanna share positive vibes😃)
Safiya‘s turning more and more into Mortica and I‘m absolutely here for it
"pink ass hair" 😂😂 I love that skirt on you
I love how it has been "Safiyas new intro song" for 2+ years😂
K now gimme the wig
I have a question to safiya why are you now putting out a video once a month now? Not anything bad but I’m curious
Do a soap Franken
THE BONE ME SHIRT
23:20 you turned into Maria from Eclipse once your hair was down!! Super sexy!
you speak so slowly now the videos are nearly unwatchable on 1x speed.
I'm pretty sure that the "e-girl" look that she tried on was actually a soft girl look
You should do a video where you buy from small businesses
I just want to say thank you for being amazing, I’m going through a really tough break up and watching your videos is the only thing which bring me joy I love you so much 💕💕💕
I think safiya is a twice fan, once...  Omg
The mask on the first look is actually what made it look pioneer womanish and really completed the look! I also think part of the reason it got a lot of attention is because it could be seen as a morale-boosting sign during the pandemic as it hearkens back to some of the origin traits of the country - obviously these include negative and positive, but in this case it'd be the positive
I’m currently dressed in a banana costume
I literally love all three outfits
It seems like Safiya has lost some weight..... She looks super thin!!BTW love her videos🖤🖤
Why they livin in Jenna and julens house
So  The pink jacket and the skirtalls that’s a combo that I think would be precious on ya
Hey, saf please do frankin ice cream
You should put the shoes, blouse, and skirterall together
Good Morning! Nice to meet you  New friend
It hurt to hear ore-gone lol, she looked so good in all the outfits!
You're either my cool aunt or my mom that's trying to relate to me
The shoe laces you wrap around the whole shoe than tied them.
Safiya’s next video: mixing all my wigs together
Your final look was a mash-up of “soft girl” and “Y2K baddie”
Loving her new style 😁😁
anything with selena gomez is so far from watchable its an insult to the eyes to even think of watching her
I’m convinced safiya is slowly turning into morticia adams
Dang really rocked that middle part for real! Looking good, that’s hard to pull off
Here's a fact she's a STANFORD GRADUATE !!!!??  smh
I love her second outfit I would wear it :)
I love her second outfit I would wear it :)
*When* *you* *see* *Nayeon,* *Jihyo,* *Chaeyoung,* *Ryujin* *&* *Chaeryoung*
Pink color hair suits her should try often
is it only me or does her house really looks like Jenna's house?
Who else noticed Chae young!!
i like the pink wig but i think a darker shade of pink would've fit you more (as individual object, not with the whole outfit) BUT ALL OUTFITS ARE SO COOL
wear the pink wig with the 2nd outfit 😂 1st outfit makes me think of a villager who would chase the 2nd outfit out with a pitchfork
The bored citizenship conversantly shade because dill ganguly fetch absent a spicy sled. cooing, malicious hate
Omg I’m dyingggg at “it’s a hay-penny a glass, baby.” You are the perfect youtuber
The 3rd look is like... 00's nostalgic weeab
When i was growing up in the 00's i thought it was a horrible time f0r fashion.... Why is it back? It's FUCKING AWFUL 😭
When is the next video coming out
*crying in she ignored my melody*
okay but, pink looks SO GOOD on you
You need to see michara tewers YouTube channel
I was doing some numbers I've been following Safiya for at lease 6 years
Could someone please explain how Safiya has gotten drastically younger in the past like 3 months??? I need to know her secrets
i cant be the only one hating the new update still. I would like the heart and the new post back in its place 😔😔
Great video, I love your content! I'm trying to grow my subscribers. Would you mind checking out my channel? ♥️
i’ve been to colonial williamsburg it’s a beautiful place. definitely just as good as everyone says it is
CHAEYOUNG
Pls another video  🙏
not chaeyoung & nayeon on ur explore page in the beginning LMAOO
I know it is a matter of preference and style, but I never understood why you would prefer the creepy Addams Family makeup to your "naturally brighter" look.
The amount of Twice content at her Instagram's explore tab. SAFIYA R U A ONCE. BREATHE IF YES
Moral of the story : they think she's a witch
I love that pink jacket on you!
SALEM WITCH TRIALS
I like the pink jacket and wig but most of the outfit....meh
They way you guys pronounce Oregon kills me 😂😂
"You wear your heart on your sleeve." Is the reference missing for the 2nd look.
That would looks amazing and I hope it makes many many many appearances in future videos.
Ok...who else screenshotted the F*** out of this video to go Instagram Xmas shopping for themselves?!? Cuz seriously my wishlist just grew about 30 items longer...
i need more safiya with pink hair
Hey Hello Its Me, Jen and Kristen quit BuzzFeed y'all should colab
Hellooooooo friendsss andd welcommmme 🤭🤭I can never get tired of this  : 3 can i please get a heart ❤ Btw love you🤟 from India
safiya: talking about instagram shop tab *amazon ad pops up*
its soft girl
The best outfit was the goth one, I love it 😀  And I loved the pink wig too
You look like Dua Lipa with the pink hair!
I went to colonial Williamsburg six years ago
Are we really just going to ignore Safiyas screen saver 11:36
The torpid archeology enzymatically zip because pain evidently explain like a fallacious aluminum. known, abnormal cement
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT HER PHONE BACKGROUND?!?!?!
This video, as do all of yours, sparks so much joy 🥲💕
The cynical sentence theoretically rock because consonant fundamentally sneeze aside a judicious mitten. ancient, imperfect element
you look like a Hutterite in the first outfit
Please Williamsburg TELL HER SHE CAN COME! Give her all the spooky tours!
Wait I’m actually confused. Was the third outfit kidcore, 90’s aesthetic, or indie kid,
I NEED to know where that blouse is from
Can we please have a house tour?I love you🥺
as an Oregonian, I think your pronunciation of "Oregon" is horrifying
https://youtu.be/9G-1GlLco6k https://youtu.be/9G-1GlLco6k https://youtu.be/9G-1GlLco6k
me : sees twice also me : directly subscribed
omg I see twice everywhereeee 😭😭
Ok but are we not gonna talk about all the kpop on her explore page is she perhaps......a kpop stan👀
This made me want to buy y2k fashion immediately from Instagram ads so now I am
You should mix a 100 perfumes to create a master perfume!!
Did you guys buy your place from the same home builder as Jenna and Julian 😅 the kitchen/living room layout is identical
Omg i want your witch outfit sooo cute 😍😭
I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS!!!💕💕
Hey, Safia!  *You should do an ABBA make-over!* And visit Sweden. :)
i would die for the pink jean jacket
That bonnet gives me Offred vibes
i saw chaeyeong in her explore page...we love to see it <3
When she said at the table with the living room behind her I had major Jenna marbles throwbacks
Change those d’s to t’s.. does she realise what she did there?
I saw nayeon
Omg I saw twice I jump
I miss this queen can u style me queen safiya
your adotable! your skin is pretty olive so i would suggest a blue wig or any cooler pastels. Love your vids. my fav is the cspsule hotel!! me and my husband want to see all the vending machines!
Hi Saf! Could you try resin art some time?
That blouse is so cute!!!
I want your floral mask 😩
I actually really like the wig
thats a *soft girl* safiya. there the two categories
THE KPOP ON HER EXPLORE PAGEJEHE
Saf, I’m loving the little stars for your “e girl” look, so pretty on you!
Me:*sees belt chain with skull*  Also Me:"NAGITO IS THAT YOU?!"  Pls forgive me
My favorite part of this video is Tyler’s giggles behind the camera 🥰
i’m a local in williamsburg! i’ve been here all my life and i swear everyone has worked at colonial williamsburg (we call CW) at least once during high school 😂
Hi everyone! I just started an instagram page that shows products/food that are vegan/natural and cruelty free! it’s @naturallychoosingvegan
time to binge watch Saf✌️
20:44 can we PLEASE make this a famous dance 😂
Your current hair length suits you so much!!! And i loved the second look on you
17:55 The style is called Y2K... If I hear you say e-girl once more...
Wait y’all say Ora-Gon? Is that a normal way to pronounce it? I say it like Ora-gen
Give us the franken-mug!
I think if she didn’t have a pink jacket it will look better and she looks good in the pink hair
Honestly the last outfit would’ve looked better with some type of skirt and heels maybe. Especially when you’d put the jacket over the shoulders. It’s super cute. lol
I want the shoes
although that last outfit wasn't an egirl outfit, who else wants to see an actual egirl outfit?? 😭😭😭😭😭
Did i just saw nayeon??
DIS MY 2 VID I AM SING OF YOU XD :)
..
My favorite outfit was the second one
Tyler giggling in the background is ADORABLE. And Safiya looked SO good in that witch outfit!!😍
Try the “rent a friend” software!!
She looks like Robin from how i met your mother
You’re a flyyy witch 🌝
How in the world does your hair grow so fast??
ITS NOT EGIRL ITS SOFTGIRL
I like the pink wig on you haha
All outfits are good. Strangely like you in pink. The black outfit was absolutely the best
Please stop saying Oregon like that 😂
Colonial Williamsburg at Christmas is to die for. And Ty in Victorian era would more likely have syphilis.
Safiya, can you please order a family portrait from that guy fabion on makeofme.ca I really wanna order a cartoon portrait but I’m scared I won’t like it !
I completely ADORE the way the wig looks with the dark eyebrows 😳❤️
She should try modern style aesthetic looks, like dark academia, cottage core, modern hippie, actual e-girl, etc.
Holy shit I love those jeans
Laurenzside be like she stole my line fellow kids
I hate Instagram's new layout why do they put the notification so far away and put the shop button next to my thumb?
I love that moon boots for you
The wig looks great, but if you had wig glue to glue down the wig it would look even better
Do you have anything witchy?
honestly this intro song is still a bop  also I laughed way too loud at "control the memes of production" at 3 in the morning
Is it just me or does their living room look like Jenna and Julien’s?
I never realized that Safiya's house is a similar design to Jenna Marbles' house and it made my heart smile for some random reason🤦‍♀️🤣.
did the pink wig give anyone else belle delphine war flashbacks?
i dont have much money for clothes vould you please buy me summ please
13:30 OH MY GOD I HAD THAT PHONE! I threw it away a couple years ago but I had it for at least 10 years
It's a called soft girl.....
You should give Tyler a makeover for your next vid!! Love you Saf!!!! 💕
Moral of the story: they think she’s a witch
What is the screen saver
i LOVE the second outfit!!!!
you can try and tuck the fabric of the strap dress thing inside the hoop
I say now you have to do some shuffle looks for insta
we love an inactive QUEEN!
I love ur vids keep it up! ❤️👍
I like how her kpop videos are TWICE!! HAHAHA
I have been obsessed with watching pottery vidoes. And I feel it would be a good and fun idea for you to try out.   Not exactly the easiest but hey I feel it would be cool and personalised a few of them and sell them. Or do a giveaway.
Your last look is more of a soft girl look
I mean "the memes of production" was an excellent pun
Did anyone see her background on her phone.......
Who is here cause of the escape the night For safi ya:pls come back to etn 👇
I love the e Girl  look so cute
Damn that second outfit makes me want Halloween back
So definitely targeted advertising ... my 'shop' tab shows me nothing but stationery and cute baby clothes!
Ok so am I the only one who thinks safiya is a skinny legend in this video like she lookin sliiim
Ok so no1 is going to comment how her natural hair is amazing like she looks so pretty with her hair like that not that she's not pretty but like prettier
True Nygaardians notice the change in her beautiful voice overs 😍 I could listen to her talk forever
E girl is now the new emo ✌️👍🤣
I think for your 10 million celebration should be getting another tattoo with Tyler
My shop tab shows me things I follow, styles I sort of like, plus things that I don't really like.
maybe try one instagram style midnight goth.
hurt me when she didn’t understand the hellboy/hellgirl shirts 😞😞😞
Do “I mixed every ice cream flavour” please!
I love how she just has an entire closet full of costumes at this point lol 😂
Safiya: Hellooooo box! Tyler: It's me!  LOL XD Did anyone else notice this?
I feel like you are getting a great video idea here. I dressed like 1820.
I feel like the brown skirt with the apron on under the belt would have worked amazingly.
DO  house tour bc your house looks so pretty  plz plz plz
So if everyone saved $1 million and you have 9 million subscribers then not a lot of people like honey or maybe people just saved one sent
i watched a video today and that girl exactly wore that powerpuff girls tanktop. this is weird.
Is this safiya? https://youtu.be/qtAL0RM6sGo
Awesome
You are the only person I can listen when I'm sewing your voice is so calming

pls post something
Am I crazy or is she living in Jenna Marbles’ house
Does Safiya and LaurenzSide really have some resemblance or am i just blind?
You know how you tired the soap tutorials? You should try crocheting! It's so fun and I think you would like it.
I live in a very Amish focused part of the country and what you wore for outfit one was very much like what they wear. I think it's so funny/interesting that people were surprised at something I see all the time and is so normal where I live.
Why haven't u posted in 3 weeks
You are looking gorgeous
Try to draw  Indian rangoli
25:46 definitely giving the same vibes as fashionable chinese tiktoks
why tf do they say Oregon like that lmao
Who else is trying to grow their YT channel during lockdown let’s help one another much love 😍
The shop button is so dangerous for people like me who love buying outfits. lol
Safs homescreen tho😳🤣
Crap this might get me to cave and get Instagram.
I found a brats clothing!!!!!! I dm it to you on insta
I want dressing as a goth for a week like seriously ... I want her to ask Black Friday for help or Toxic Tears
I like how her explore page has a whole bunch of kpop in it lol
YOU NEED PINK HAIR!
with the bonnet off I got West World vibes
I wish shops would stop putting "witch" on things unless it's run by practicing witches. It's like wearing a shirt that says "catholic" as a non-catholic. I'm not even a witch myself i just think it's not a cute look to lable yourself as something you're not.
𝓖𝓸𝓻𝓰𝓮𝓸𝓾𝓼
I love you with pink hair it is so cute
PLEASE DO SOMETHING KPOP THEMED  IM BEGGING YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!
On the witch outfit you can tuck the end of the suspenders straps back into the hoop lol
You did good in escape the night 3

"i mean  the powerpuff girls not my boobs" lmfao
Get a store
Please can we have a house tour? ❤
Safiya would be like the person who researches everything in a project group ....
Is it just me or does safiya look like she's in Jenna Marble's house???
I’m absolutely OBSESSED with the second outfit.
her house looks a lot like Jenna marbles house
The style you were looking for on the third look is called indie I think
It’s Y2K
You should mix bars of soap together. Love your videos!❤❤
Wait, can someone explain why this isn't a true e-girl look? Is it more soft girl? I'm trying to figure out what a "real" e-girl is because of this video.
Heyyyy..... can you do a shein review please
No clue who Sammi Sweetheart is.....dont care
Yalls account do be dying
these vids are so much fun
Can we please have a video about amazing face mask fashion?
Oh my goodness I just really love the pink pastel look on you and that mask is so pretty with the pink hair and the entirely pinkypinkster vibe 😍
How on earth did you master that perfect little star on your lower lid?? That looks like it went with a lot of accidental stabbing but in the end made it out alive - the eye - the saf and the Death Star are aliiiiiiive!
Love the long hair saf! Maybe a intensely colored ends hairdo would be amazing on you like ice Blue or pastel lilac or multicolored ends
TRY BLOSSOM PHOTOGRAPHY LIFE HACKS
a full face of makeup with the shop tab????
Your skin is glooooowing 😭😭😭 share your skincare routine!
0:36 woah i see twice, bp, and itzy i smile
I watched you from 1.1 million and was not subscribe 😭but now I am
yay there's kpop on her explore page (mostly girlgroups)  😂💜
The black outfit was so cute!
Ngl I was super disappointed when she didn’t pick the spider web yoga pants 😂
Oh no... The super retro videos are referencing things that I remember from college...
With the historical outfit, with the bonnet on, it's a little more 1800s' and with it off, it's more of a 1970s or pirate look.
Girl you should have plucked that wig down the hairline.
When did Naomi Scott start a youtube channel?
why does insta think shes a witchhhhhhh
Ok but am I the only one to see kpop when she opened her Instagram. ( it’s not hate. I like kpop)
we love you
No to be creepy but their house looks ALOT like Jenna and Julien's...
I feel like Saf would be a fan of the Mrs. Crocombe series from English Heritage....
I always love the theme music and the finger wags
She has a news lady voice it is so amazing
I was inspired and tried it.  I was recommended mostly candles and art supplies.  I found two clothing ads.  One was a "White T-Shirt", the other was a "Basic White T-Shirt"
0:58 rose fancam dancing to the song 'playing with fire'
Did anyone else think that was Betty White on the pants at first?
Safiya! Abby Cox (a dress historian, historical costume maker, and youtuber) mentioned that she would be 100% down to take you to Colonial Williamsburg and make you a costume to wear there!! Abby worked at Colonial Williamsburg for years and also would make you a historically accurate garment! Just putting it out there!
i love the wig so much ! safiya really suits it
Hey saf don’t worry about posting stuff all the time you have a life too do t worry we get it it’s ok being a big YouTuber can be stressful so I just wanted you to know we understand and I love your videos
The second outfit with the pink wig would look killer!!!
Can you bring back your ugly clothing series with this romper??? https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DNWV4BF/?ots=1&tag=wtclickymaster-mj-ios-azc-20
Hello Safiya I have been watching your videos continuously and also eagerly waiting for the new ones  . so (just a suggestion) why don't u try a video on wearing traditional Indian dresses for a week.
Well all I can say is (as a Gen Z child of Tik Tok) the last outfit definitely COULD be “E-girl”
Make a video on Mixing all your perfumes 😂 bad makeup science #badmakeupscience ....
✨aliexpess✨
2:11 SHE LOOKS LIKE MORTICIAAAA!
Hey love your videos, I was wondering have you ever tried those lip plumping lipgloss, inhale and their really weird, looks like some sort of wired makeup stuff x
I'm really loving that black floral top Safiya was wearing while unboxing. Any ideas where I can get one?
I'm in love with the second outfit, its gorgeous on you 🖤
Trick for tying long laces: tie them normally and pull the loops so the loose ends are as short as you want them. Then take the loops and make another bow with them!
Can we just have time to thank her for how much editing and how much time she puts into these videos ❤️❤️
Didn’t Sofia have 10 million subscribers?
Safiya can you pls post more i am sorry if this sounds rude i just think your vidoes are great and i want to see more
*watching the intro 100.000 times just for the kitty eating cord*
Please try indian clothes ❤❤
Hello the boss witch thing was referring to Doja Cat’s boss b!tch I think just to let you know
the pink wig reminds me of the girl from lazy town
How about a video showing prom dresses throughout the decades.
Can we pay attention to the Jedi Robes please.
SHE LOOKS SO MUCH LIKE MARINA IN HER LAST LOOK
HIII, SO YOU PROBABLY ARE NOT GOING TO SEE THIS, BUT I HAVE AN INTERVIEW AT COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG
You do know you said Oregon wrong right Oregon isn't gone I grew up in that state
the tshirt that took the longest to arrive was definitely from aliexpress. they dropship from there
I never see your videos even though I'm subscribed.
i wish we can see the wig in you future video with your usual outfit
I think the pink look would have looked better without the wig. Over all lover the looks they all looked really cute on you Sofia!
You are supposed to put the "flaps" in the ring (for the goth skirt) LMAO
Yo I am a dude like watching your videos but I don't watch many of them cuz I'm a guy and you do mostly fashion and female oriented stuff I was wondering can you do something universal something all inclusive well good luck
Your videos help encourage me to get out of my clothes comfort zone. I just went to goodwill and got some very interesting choices for when I go larping but after cleaning them and trying them on i think I will just wear these when I go run earends and visit with my nana.
DIY Hot chocolate bombs plz
I love your sass, it's so refreshing ❤
This is on an entirely different note from your video I was wondering if you wanted to join Jacksepticeye in his #thankmus fundraiser. Here's that link https://youtu.be/YfJ_ptCTLms
19:25 -- WH- WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY? 🤣 LMAOOOO 😭🤣
pls pls PLS cosplay as Castaspella from She-Ra you literally look EXACTLY LIKE HER
i lived for the witch outfit
Her skin is beautiful. She was literally glowing lol
OMG SAFIYA YOU'RE GLOWING YOU LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL IN ALL THOSE FITS
1800 witch, 2020 witch, 2000 soft witch
I'm gonna need a full cover of Ridin Dirty in a colonial style now, and it has to be Saf singing it. Who else is with me on this? 👀👀👀
living in Oregon and hearing yall say oregone hurts my soul.
You never post why tho?
#Thankmas https://youtu.be/YfJ_ptCTLms
Also it’s kawaii style the pastels
Your voice hits a similar happiness in my brain as corpse husband’s voice
instagram was like: she's either a 2020's witch, or a 1690's witch
i NEED the entire goth fit
Don’t say Oregon like that
Good job with the wig Tyler!
Everything is impossible until you do it. Don’t know where I heard that from but it’s not my quote.  Great content 👍
Seeing the Jenna and Julien clip made my heart hurt. I miss them so much
Where is her phone case from? I love it
" SUGAR SPICE ANDD EVERYTHING NICE "
Mix all the. Foundations at Sophora that are your colour together
mina 🥺🥺
super impressed with the stars under your eyes! great makeup job! fun video!
Did you guys get a house have you had a house?!!!? I’m out of the lupdeloop...
You look like Just sharon @justsharon
I screamed when I say mina❤️
You look like an anime character... have you ever tried cosplaying?
I'd wear that pink crop jacket with a little black dress
You should try Swedish candy and cookies
IM SORRY BUT THE TZUYU FANCAM AND THE VIDEO OF MINA DOING MAKEUP
I thought the suspender dress was slightly reminiscent of your K-POP video. You might do an episode where you see how many K-POP outfits you can make out of clothes you already have, both from your own closet and videos.
I kept putting off watching this video because I thought, "I don't have time to watch a 40 minute video," but it doesn't feel like a 40 minute video. The production quality is good enough that there's no point I'm like, "Is this over yet." Which I think shows why we keep coming back.
I Love the witchy shoes, I legit want them—
Hello, dear. We're professional factor for nail tools. Can you please make review tutorial videos for our products?  Thanks https://www.amazon.com/stores/L%27UGX/page/9813E113-33EC-445B-94F9-4D95ADF6B45C
You absolutely killed the goth lewk
Lowkey Instagram is trying t o create another Amazon for clothes
I post modest clothing outfits and social justice, and Instagram is showing me a combination of both.
Mark Zuckerberg is trying to kill me is totally the thought of Hawaiian Natives when he was trying to occupy their land.
I love the Minga London style and I have so many of their items on my wishlist on instagram.
Did Tyler say Safiya is going to have "pink-ass hair" or "pink ass-hair"🤔
*the internet* safiyas pegnant  *safiya* I'M A BAT
I love safiyas background 😂
31:00 i would get rid of the jacket, maybe put the wig in pigtails
Honey has sponsored literally EVERY youtuber oh my goshhh
please do more kpop stuff
Your black skirt was on backwards
the intro song gives me phineas and ferb vibes i don't know why, does anyone else agree?
Safiya is slowly becoming more of an adams family character
I actually love the last look!!! I love the pink!!!!💗💗💗
How do you know about ag ( American Girl)
Hey Saf, Igot an idea.  How about another lipstick melting experiment, but every color has the same amount of lipstick. Like 10 reds, 10 pinks, 10 orange, 10 green? Idk something like that. Maybe you would get a different color of frankenlipstick. You always get the color of idk magenta (?) because the red, pink, and nudes are always has a bigger amount than other colors. Just an idea.   Like this guys, so that Saf will see :)
the "e-girl' Is Baby doll and kawaii retro i would say !
The 3rd look is y2k
Is she a fan of 𝐓𝐖𝐈𝐂𝐄🍭나무위키? I see nayeonandchaeyoung
22:15  I'm literally crying of laughter
When is the next video coming???
Saf is so pretty without makeup :3
Is it just me or does safiya looks just like Dua Lipa
Hi saf! You probably won't see this but, Do you think you could do a Franken-Perfume? You just LOVE bad make-up science and I thought this might be fun to watch!
Corporate America sees your life going marriage, babies, then you must buy Disney.  I think there is a secret mailing list you get added to when you get married.  They do it to everyone 😂
I love minga london
She should try modern style aesthetic looks, like dark academia, cottage core, modern hippie, actual e-girl, etc.
Why is nobody talking abaout her glowup
Why are you always wear black cloths
i like the outfits but plz remember goth isn't just an aesthetic
Where did you get your masks? Did I miss that park? I’m obsessed!
I love the Witch shirt!
is no one gonna talk abt itzy and twice on her explore page- omg i didnt know she likes kpop
looks like she had some kind of cosmetic facial surgery. Don't you think?
pink one is soft girl  lmao
I actually really like the pink look 💗
the virginia joke.. i feel seen
She should try modern style aesthetic looks, like dark academia, cottage core, modern hippie, actual e-girl, etc.
How come you only post a video once a month?
Saf: *Thinks that an E-Girl wears pink and that sort of stuff* Me: E-Girls are kinda gothic.
The Jenna and Julien bit made me just 🥺😢
DRINK FRANKEN-TEA OUT OF THE FRANKEN-MUG!!! (Or coffee if you're not into tea...)
Ok ok I have a video idea for you so there a these vitamins called beervana there suppose to make you tits and booty bigger so could you do a video testing them out 👀
This looks super similar to Jenna marbles home from that one angle. Maybe it’s just me.
Anyone remember about Safiya's tattoo?
Okay listen I know nobody looks at these because we think they are spam. (Trust me I have just skipped right by them) I downloaded this app because my friend had it. It lets you earn points for gift cards, you don’t even have to buy anything you can just scan them in the store. But you get more point if you buy them. With in the first two times I went to Walmart and scanned I had enough for a $2 Walmart card but it goes up to $50 if you save up your points. We both get 250 points if you use my code. Please try this out and also help a broke college kid out 😂 ps you don’t even have to use the link if you don’t trust it you can just download it on the App Store and put in my code.  Try Shopkick and we'll both get points toward a free gift card! 😀 Use code EASY219538 or download https://getsk.co/easy219538
I must have really bad style because I think the e-girl outfit works together.
Okay, but honey is actually super useful and everyone should have it
I see TWICE❤️😂
Most of the pictures shown on that site are stolen from other brands I.e. the power puff girls top is actually from a brand called omighty, and that spray painted mannequin is from their shop and site
0:38 .....Once?😏
8:29 IS THAT MEME MOM???
Answer your insta DMs you have 4 lololollll
Frankenmug! Frankenmug! Frankenmug!
You could also dye the witch lettering black to make it less in your face because ooooo that top is freaking cute
safiya and tyler said oregon like or- A- gone..... its ori-Gen not gone bruv. (im from salem and this hurt my ears) thank you for coming to my ted talk.
Why does she sound like the ms mojo lady O-o
honestly the last outfit wouldve looked better without the jacket at all
"Sabbath night fever" underrated Tyler joke
do a gothic make-over
As someone who dresses kind of early 2000s grungy that also works at a house turned museum from the year 1795....the phrase “she’s either a witch or a civil war reenactor” really reeeeeally spoke to me
Is no one else going to point out the fact that everything was listed in pounds???
Ok but she looks so cute in the pink wig and jacket lol
I love your videos☺
Rogue+Wolf has this giant coffee mug I've been contemplating buying for a while now. Was surprised to see them here 🙂
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Romans 10:9-10 KJV
my little sister loves you
I have honey
CHURN THAT BUTTER!!!!!!!!!!!
I LOVE THE PINK WIG!
The masks thooooo
God the second look is absolutely gorgeous on Safiya.
Me, the friend who plays the ukulele and is secretly emo *turns on Pretty Odd*
Safiya: *Wears Pink*  Me: Wait, that’s illegal
Lovingggg that 2nd look ❤️❤️❤️
Sabbath Night Fever. I just died. 🤣
i just came from daniel’s video im having second thoughts on why she never promoted to show or why he would say he was not a fan of her
OMG Imagine the pink jacket with the velvet skirt!! <3
Is anyone curious how she remembers the exact name of the American girl dolls? Lol
EDIT: as of 11/13/2020, it looks like instagram has actually put even more emphasis on the shop tab in their newest app update by placing it on the bottom bar of the app, just to the right of the "reels" tab! So, it looks like it's here to stay - and if you're looking for your shop tab, check the bottom bar! xoxo, saf  HELLO FRIENDS!! here is a quite lengthy deep dive into the shop tab that i had a really fun time filming - i feel like i'm lowkey exposing myself & my instagram habits in this video, but that's ok 😂let me know what's on your shop tab in the comments below! xoxo, saf
I'm p sure the powerpuff girls shirt is poor quality bc that shop stole the design from omighty and not v well either since their shopping bags still says omighty 😂 imo tho the pink looks good on you!
LOVE that you matched the masks with the outfits HAHAHAHAH
Mix all the cheese!!!!
Around 10:00 : Yeah, scanning your photos and letting an AI analyse your outfits is maybe even easier than a facial recognition filter, especially considering the pages you follow.
You should try indian outfits too
Tutti insieme uniti bambini compresi rivolgiamoci al Padre Eterno!!! * Indicazioni terapeutiche * www.padreceleste.com* Carissimi fratelli, invece di pensieri inutili compresi altri progetti senza valore, ottimizziamo il tutto e quindi colgo l’occasione per proporvi una collaborazione reciproca e collettiva effettuata tramite la preghiera. Mi spiego subito: insieme ad alcuni di voi, ho formato un gruppo di preghiera che ho battezzato “Rete Trinità ", la quale, consiste in una comunione di fratellanza universale fondata sull’amore di Dio Padre. Tutte le sere dopo cena o comunque prima di andare a dormire, svolgiamo ognuno da casa propria, le orazioni insieme agli altri partecipanti, sparsi in diversi luoghi del mondo.  La preghiera si svolge mettendosi in ginocchio ed a mani giunte esordendo a voce moderata con il pater, l’ave ed il gloria; (Importante …non disgiungiamo le mani, poiché l’Eterno comunica con l’anima e si perde il contatto). Nel momento che iniziamo a pregare, potremmo essere disturbati da forze esterne, come i pensieri, le cose inutili le divagazioni ed altro.   Attraverso diverse ripetizioni delle preghiere, si allontana il tutto, poiché anche se volessimo pensare qualcosa, sarà impossibile farlo.   Successivamente inizieremo con un saluto rivolto a Dio e con la frase "Ciao Padre Eterno."; di seguito, vi e' un resoconto dei problemi o del problema che ci preoccupa, con una richiesta di aiuto all’Eterno.   Il nostro gruppo di preghiera attinge dalla chiesa le tre principali preghiere, pater, ave e gloria, (le più facili e conosciute dalla gente) e le potenzia con una conversazione familiare con Dio, in cui si può parlare di tutto con l'Onnipotente, spaziando dalle banalità quotidiane ai problemi seri, in una parola un vero e proprio dialogo a 360 gradi.   È necessario fra un aneddoto e l’altro ed al termine della conversazione, ripetere una volta pater ave e gloria. Per questa ragione, pregando assieme, la presenza di Dio e' simultanea in tutti i cuori e ciò facilita il Suo intervento.   Avendo provato beneficio, si e' deciso di ripetere la preghiera mattina e/o pomeriggio.   Ovviamente, se gli impegni della vita di ogni giorno non ti consentiranno la preghiera del mattino o del pomeriggio, non preoccuparti: la puoi spostare ad un altro momento della giornata, L’Eterno comprende e sa perché lo fai.   Fondamentale e' però che l'orazione serale venga fatta improrogabilmente. Ti garantisco l'assoluto beneficio dell’insegnamento fin qui utilizzato e ti assicuro che il dialogo con il Supremo libera l'anima dalle impurità e porta pace e benessere.   Accludo i miei più sinceri saluti, a nome mio e degli altri fratelli del gruppo di preghiera, sperando di essere sempre più numerosi. Un abbraccio Oksana!   Ho ricevuto questo insegnamento di preghiera in un social network da una ragazza, la quale mi ha consigliato, di leggerlo attentamente, di non eliminarlo, di offrirlo in famiglia e donarlo agli amici, perché sarà gradito meglio di ogni buon cibo, poiché è utile a migliorare l’anima! l’inviava per fare conoscere DIO   ti allego le preghiere!   Il segno della croce,   in nome del Padre, del Figlio e dello Spirito Santo.   Padre Nostro che sei nei cieli,   sia santificato il Tuo nome,   venga il tuo regno,   sia fatta la Tua volontà, come in cielo così in terra.   Dacci oggi il nostro pane quotidiano,   rimetti a noi i nostri debiti come noi li rimettiamo ai nostri debitori.   Aiutaci a non cadere nella tentazione, ma liberaci dal male. Amen   Ave o Maria   piena di grazia, il Signore è con te.   Tu sei benedetta fra le donne e il benedetto è il frutto del tuo seno Gesù.   Santa Maria, Madre di Gesù, prega per noi peccatori,   adesso e nell'ora della nostra morte.   Amen Gloria al Padre, al Figlio ed allo Spirito Santo.   Com’era nel principio, ora e sempre nei secoli dei secoli. Amen
138 missed calls Lol Safiya your popular
Great seeing you wearing matching masks to outfits
Love your product reviews lol
Too much Pink Safiya
I love all 3 looks! Looking gorgeous!!!
That pink wig with the "witchy" clothes would be pretty. I love the "witchy" outfit the best.
Pfft, I LOVE that last look!  It's like cotton candy colors, and the older I become, the more I become obsessed with that color scheme!  I'm gonna be the most pastel granny EVER by the time I'm my grandma's age!
Hey I love you guys and you are amazing and are you a good witch or a bad witch
I feel like ALL youtube influencers live in the exact same house :|
THEY SEE ME CHURNING, THEY HATING!
NOW YOU BE CHURNING!!!!!!!!!!!
this is probably a weird thing to say but this channel just makes me so calm...listening to Safiya helps my anxiety and actually puts me to sleep. i just love the way she talks and articulates herself and her videos are always interesting. I'm so glad I found this channel and I hope she keeps making content :)
Woah is her hair really this long already?
Anyone who knows British slang is wondering why tf there's a brand called minger
omg you look so good with pink hair!!!
I’m appalled by the way you two say “oregon”
wow I did not realize this video was 38 minutes! Saf is so easy to watch
Tylers face on her phone :)))))))
Bruh I will legit pray for you to break all your mugs in your house and then glue them together again. ✨
Dear god don't buy graphic tees etc. from stores like this, a lot of the times it's stolen art and it's just shitty
Can u make an vid in which u go to "thrifting" as its very famous these days  😄
the "E-Girl" look kinda suits you actually, I love it!
If you were on the east coast wearing that first one people would have just assumed you were Amish
I love these kind of videos. Do more like these please 🙏
so happy to see minga get some light, theyre an ethical company so if this is your style i highly recommend
The way she says oregon HURTS MEEE. Its pronounced like "organ" not oreegone
This made my day
Hey Saf, I will say Sunday Riley Luna is absolutely worth a buy. I saw it was recommended in your feed a couple of times 😊
Why does this look like Jenna Marbles house when she’s in the kitchen/living room
28:38 that's literally a bitmoji outfit top😂
I wonder if she speaks with such perfect enunciation because she's just trying to be well understood, is trying to cover an accent, or a mixture of both -- idk why this is what stuck with me, but if she ever mentioned it and anyone knows, definitely let me know because it is fascinating me for no reason...
what you where thinking was e girl is more soft girl
Ok but can we talk about how cute the stars under Safiya's eyes are in the last look?
if anyone else here is a lucifan: 8:45
That gothy dress is totally backwards lmao
Where I can safely stand without a mask.... yall are really that brainwashed  I fucking cant
Ooh I want the skirt in the second outfit!
Tyler’s “never mind” after Safiya going on about Sammi Sweetheart....
the twice on your home page😎
honey is doing the spam sponsorships again
Ok you need to link those boots and skirt because I need them 😍😍😍
You forgot to say honey works on Amazon, the one site I use like every week 😬
I love your channel but... All this money spent on silly things is hard to watch when people are losing their homes. Not trying to be rude, just giving you a normal person POV. Its getting scary real out here for a lot of us. You are entertaining however.
Ty did a pretty good job at applying the wig!!
They’re both egirl fashion and some is pastel goth ;)
When Tyler finally admits that her breath is stank LOL
A lot of what she thought fell into the egirl aesthetic actually does. Will she never know that she's not as boomer as she thought.
I’d love to see a video of you guys experimenting with depop 🤩🤩
I think safiya look good in pink
I feel like the living room looks like they are in Jenna marbles houses
20:00 unlucky for me, I have a dirty mind.
This video ✨sparks joy✨
the pastel clothing style is called soft girl
i miss safiya soooo much...
Try going to beijing or shanghai china plsss
Your charm is irresistible!!😁 You look energetic.💪 You have a great smile. I love you!!😘 ❤️
what you thought was e-girl was actually soft girl but honestly, there's so much grey area that idk most of the time bc then there was some cottage core also
😀😀😀
Pastel stuff is either pastel core or Kid core
I would love to see the pink wig with the witch look. Super cute!
omg girl that is NOT how you say oregon
Please do the Frankenstein mug ideaaaa
Soph: in a surprising turn of events Me: you mean, a surprising churn of events?
Either you're a witch or from the Addams Family. If you're a witch then please make me one too!
Aww, she changed her intro song 🥺 her old one will always be missed .
honestly the hair looks rly real
Well I have been there
EEE she said hello fellow kids! Like if you know who that's from :D
yknow what, this makes me question mom jeans. when I tried them on in the shop, I had the same problem as you - my legs and crotch area looked really weird and too small but since I'm a bit chubby I just thought "okay those are just not for me" but now I see you walking around in them and you basically have a perfect body and... are they just or those really slight boned girls? do you need to have really skinny legs to rock them? please, somebody, help me.
Saf maybe doing this for a very long time but her voice is still as soothing AF😍😍😍❤️❤️💯💯
i missed this intro
guys watch social dilemma on netflix social media is making us dysfunctional and more obessed esp insta
Unsurprisingly, at least for me. The Insta-Goth outfit was my favorite and I may buy that too.
Safiya you should try plastic wrap Nail art
I want to know where the masks are from, they look awesome C:
I love the not an egirl look
I used to own that pink toy rotary phone! It played music when you pushed the numbers.  Edit: Timestamp 13:30
When she said hello fellow kids I was like Loren z side
Saf can you do a review of the PMD face brushes??
Are you at Jenna and Julien’s house?
My husband, his brother, his dad, and I do civil war re-enactments. They have been to Gettysburg for a civil war reenactment and other states.
ot looks like shes in jenna marvles house when she opens up the clothes like seriously
Please post more
haven't watched safiyas videos in a while, but listening to the intro i thought it was going to say "weekly respill yeah" because its same intro as one of those drama channels
Ore-again, not Ore-ah-gone. Just like Safiya, not Sophie.
You cursed instagram it became a shopping app instead of a photo-sharing platform now... 🥲
I loWkEy got pissed that people was cat calling her being fully covered what the fUCK
I just love safiya!
Can nobody find the shop tab in Instagram no more?
safiya: egirl - ironic ninety's memes jaja
SAFIYA we NEED a Balenciaga Vibram Heeled Knit Booties Review!!!  https://www.bloomingdales.com/shop/product/balenciaga-womens-toe-knit-booties?ID=3815421&pla_country=US&cm_mmc=Google-PLA-ADC-_-tROAS_FOB_Campaign-_-womens_shoes-_-889300610535USA&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI9-OG8cuR7QIVxlPVCh3YHwO3EAQYASABEgKiDfD_BwE

saf could pull off pink hair
All together, including the children, we pass to the Eternal Father !!!Indications for the treatment * www.padreceleste.com Dear brothers! I take this opportunity to offer you mutual and collective cooperation through prayer, let me explain it right away: together with some of you, I formed a prayer group called "ReteTrinità", which consists of a community of universal brotherhood based on love of God the Father. Every evening after lunch or before going to bed, we hold prayers in each of the houses with other participants scattered around different parts of the world. The prayer takes place on the knees and with the union of the hands, starting moderately with Pater, Avemaria, Gloria; (Importantly ... we do not share our hands, because the Eternal communicates with the soul and we lose contact.) The moment we begin to pray, we may be disturbed by external forces, such as thoughts, useless things, delirium and much other . another. everything leaves the prayers, because even if we wanted to find something, it would be impossible to do, so we will start with a greeting addressed to God and with the phrase "Hello, God .."; Immediately, there is a message about the problems that concern us, asking for help from the Eternal. Our prayer group draws from the church three main prayers, pater, ave and gloria (the simplest and best known by people) and offers them the opportunity to speak with God in the family, where you can talk about everything with the Almighty, from small everyday  things to serious problems, in a word, true 360 degree dialogue. Between one joke and the other, and at the end of the conversation, it is necessary to repeat once Pater, Avemaria, Gloria; Therefore, praying together, the presence of God is present simultaneously in all hearts, and this facilitates His intervention. Having benefited, it was decided to repeat the morning and / or afternoon prayers. Obviously, if your daily duties do not allow you to pray in the morning or in the afternoon, do not worry: you can transfer it to another hour of the day, the Eternal understands and knows why you are doing it. However, it is important that the evening prayer be performed without fail. I guarantee you the absolute benefit of the method used so far and I assure you that dialogue with the Almighty frees the soul from pollution and brings peace and prosperity. I express my most sincere congratulations on my behalf and on behalf of the other brothers in the prayer group, hoping to be more numerous. a hug Marcantonio I received this teaching of prayer in a social network from a girl, who advised me to read it carefully, not to delete it, to offer it to the family and to give it to friends, because it will be appreciated better than any good food, as it is useful to improve the soul! he sent it to make God known   The sign of the cross,   Our Father   who is in heaven, holy is his name, your kingdom is coming, your will is being done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us our bread day by day, and forgive our sins as we forgive those who trespass and sin against us, and help us not to fall into temptation but deliver us from evil. Amen   Hail Mary,   full of grace, the Lord is with you. You are blessed among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb Jesus.** Holy Mary, Mother of Jesus, pray for us sinners now, and at the hour of our death. Amen   Glory be to the Father,   to the Son and to the Holy Spirit as it was in the beginning, as it is now and as it will be forever to come. Amen
wait does safiya stan twice-
I own that punkrave shirt omg
Kpop fancams😂
YAAASS! Do the FRANKENMUG!!!
I loved this so much! Ngl think the colonial one is my fave 😛😛 They see me Churnin’ 😅😅👍🏻👍🏻
I love u saf but why u still doing buzzfeed voice
اطيب كفتة كباب عقناتي ادخلو واشتركووو♥️♥️🍩🍩☕️
did anyone see xowie jones from tiktok as one of the ads 11:15
I don't know why I've never noticed this before but you enunciate words so clearly and speak at such a not fast pace. Very easy to understand! Also I just really like your voice. :)
I sew the tran flag
Safiya just cosplayed Seraphine from League of Legends and I am just loving it <3
Please leave your support for Tyler and the wig job! She looks amazing with it ❤️
Y'all should come to india
You  look so good.
PLEASE COME TO COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG! I went to William & Mary and throughout the years always wished you would show up at CW when you mentioned it in your videos! Try out aroma's and cheese shop while you're there!
The e-girl look reminds me of the SNL skit “mom jeans”. 🤣🤣🤣
I wound love to see a I dress like my childhood Idols lmaoo
I liked purely for 'memes of production'. Hilarious!!!
Um, so yeah...did anyone else get like, strong LazyTown vibes from pink haired Safiya? No? Just me?
11/10 will probably end up randomly re-watching again
Oh my god I want that Marie dress at 14:17!! Holy Shit!
Is it just me or did Saf and Tyler move into Jenna Marbles' house??
The pink hair gives me lava girl vibes but it looks soft and flowy
I’ve never heard oregon pronounced like that but you learn something knew every day
So I know she was being slammed for it and I don’t in any way mean to add to that, but does anyone think they know why she did slow down her speaking speed so much? When you watch her old vids or watch her talk to friends, the speed is so different. And it’s quite slow now to point that it seems very very deliberate but I can’t figure out why - for a native English speaker it’s quite frustrating but perhaps it’s for non native speakers benefit?
Oh you should come see us on Instagram in the #historybounding community we sew a lot of historical clothes
1:39 I stopped my 9-5 because of, *n o w o r k p  a  y .c o m*
I will be waiting for the mug video
I’ve lived in Virginia all my life; Safiya, it’s not great here
Interestingly enough the women who worked in the dairy doing things like making cheese and butter were considered very attractive at the time because they had to be very clean to make sure no bacteria was introduced to the products that would cause them to spoil so getting catcalled was technically historically accurate
So, they know what a Meet Me At MacDonalds is, so when is Tyler getting his new hairdo? His channel had over a million subs, he has no excuse. 😁
Tbh in the thumbnail to the left I thought it was LaurDIY
you should have gotten flared pants for the y2k look xxx
Are we gonna talk about how much Twice there was in her fyp        also Jennie too
It's "processes," not "processees." 🤦🏽‍♀️
Getting Mortica Addams vibes with the outfit during the sponsorship part of the video and I’m loving it!!
I spy a Bernadette Edwardian Walking Shoe...
I love how her intro is so simple but amazing 👁👄👁
Not really a bonnet, a mob cap.
@safiyanygaard I swear to god I just saw you in a Desjardins insurance commercial
We (me and my two siblings and parents) went to colonial Williamsburg when I was a kid and we were dressed up in period outfits and people took pictures of us because they thought we were part of the experience so if you have random photos of yourself with small children dressed as colonial kids, thats me.
YES COME TO COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG WE LOVE YOU!!
I REALLY like the witch outfit on you; supra-cute!
I dead ass thought u where in Jenna marbles living room where she used to shoot all her stuff-
EDIT: as of 11/13/2020, it looks like instagram has actually put even more emphasis on the shop tab in their newest app update by placing it on the bottom bar of the app, just to the right of the "reels" tab! So, it looks like it's here to stay - and if you're looking for your shop tab, check the bottom bar! xoxo, saf  HELLO FRIENDS!! here is a quite lengthy deep dive into the shop tab that i had a really fun time filming - i feel like i'm lowkey exposing myself & my instagram habits in this video, but that's ok 😂let me know what's on your shop tab in the comments below! xoxo, saf
you should try instagram influencer makeup/skincare tutorials! i know you did the hacks before, but you should try the full-on tutorials and see how it turns out!
Saf, what do you use for your hair? It's grows SO QUICKLY!!
Lol…when Tyler says “Nevermind” 😂😂😂
i have friends that dress like this gHn
The pink wig looks so good on you!
38:40 You look like Olivia Wilde from Cowboys and Aliens~ XD
It’s a soft girl look
makes me so happy to watch this hehehe
The longer the section on the third outfit went on... the more I started to like it? Like idk how but she looked even MORE edgy in galaxy colors and pink than black? lmao
Nice video..  Stay connected...
Am I the only one wondering why saf was gone for entire month and no ones asking why ?🤨
I screamed and my soul broke inside me when they said ore- *gone*
The insta witch outfit is a vibe I’m here for
Safiya's videos are different. I'm  watching her videos and I look, its 3am! Meaning I totally didnt watch 10 of her videos... whaaaaat that insane...
1:23 TWICE!
Soft y2k saf is everything 😭
bro i cant wait for you to hit 10M subs
those boots are actually uber cute
0:38 am I the only one dancing to bdz too? Just me? Ight. ALSO LOOK AT HOW PRETTY NAYEON IS. I APPRECIATE THAT SAFIYA HAS KPOP IN HER EXPLORE PAGE
I have a mighty need for the witchy outfit
You literally look great in every single outfit!!!!! Plus they all looked so cute!!!!
I LOVE the long hair for you it’s beautiful!! ❤️
she pulls off literally everything
omg i saw twice
you look so beautiful with a middle part and glowing, no-make-up skin!!! so good ... also your house looks like jenna marbles?
I see TWICE nayeon and chaeyoung
That 70s video. You were made for that look.
When did she get a new house 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
I definitely do not like those jeans.  I think they were the weakest link in that look.  Outfit# 2 was my favorite.  Love the look of the shoes.
Is it just me or with her outfit she kinda looks like mortisha adams from the Adams family, like she looks really gooood ✨
Saf you should have tucked in the extra straps on that black skirt into that big silver ring. So that it wasn't just flapping. Lol. Just an idea.😂😊💕
PLEASE MAKE A FRANKEN-MUG
I love how she uses the intro audio to these types of videos that the random dude made her. Only OG's would know.
I love the pink wig on you without the jacket. With the jacket it’s still cute but too much pink
Webster Wigs is literally one of the BEST wig companies out there. I bought all of my lace fronts from them, they're soooooo perfect
y'all sleeping on 2nd look it's so pretty!!!
Safiya was literally glowing in the opening part of this video
I have a suggestion as far as the "nipple tassels" you could try to put them through the hoops and tuck them into the skirt section.
Safiya:Or-re-gon Me from Oregon: it's Or-re-gen
If you don’t want to keep the wig, Jaymes Mansfield is a RuPaul girl and he styles wigs that people send. He’s hilarious and does so much cool stuff with the wigs people send him. Just an idea. 😊😊😊
I just realized at the end that her hairs much longer
dude i live near there!
YOU LOOK STUNNING IN THE LAST ONE OMG
Come on Saf that’s not how we say Oregon
Safiya's videos never disappoint, love it! Also Safiya looks so gorgeous omg. Ily Safiya!!
One interesting video idea would be if Safiya did a Franken Candle using candles from Magic Candle Company (their candles smells like Disneyland) to make a Franken Disney Candle since Safiya often visited the Disney parks in the past.
Time to go bug Rachel Maksy, Bernadette Banner, and Karolina Żebrowska about how accurate the "vintage" clothing sold on IG are and trying some on!
Looked up and saw my Goth Milk purse lmao its a great purse if you have a tiny phone
safiyas shave your brows off just once
She should try modern style aesthetic looks, like dark academia, cottage core, modern hippie, actual e-girl, etc.
the witchy one WINS and looked even better with the mask on.
13:21 "throwback cartoons" *shows sailor moon* (cries in 'its an anime')
had me until you pronounced oregon in a funky way. but honestly this is a great video lol
Upload more
Ehh safia you do know Instagram actually Tracks how long you Look at a Post, even If you dont interact! And they definately Scan the clothing in your ig Posts!
Safiyaaa why do u still have the hush app LOL. They shut down :(
I think the last outfit could have worked by switching the top with a black one and taking the necklace off. (just a suggestion, you rocked it tho ❤️)
am i the only one getting jules from euphoria vibes from all of the shots of safiya walking in the street in the "e-girl" outfit?
Pink was nice on you.. it was realy butifoul on you..
is it just me being weird or the whole 3rd outfit is really good?! is something wrong?
im trying to figure out my aesthetic any ideas to help me know what to buy so far i have like a gothic retro
Wow. I see a lot of kpop in your insta feed. I Blackpink and Twice Stan. A woman of culture I see.
*Churn that butter Safiya, churn it*
Am I the only one that LOVED the witch outfit on her, it's so flattering and she looks 😍❤️
Would totally wear the witch shirt (without the print) and boots.
I wear wigs a lot (cosplay lol) and honestly it looks like you did a fantastic job!! 10/10
JAJAJSJ TWICE IN HER EXPLORE PAGE SJSJSJZ
I would love to be a witness to you being you up and down the sidewalk 😂
Now I need to see an egirl transformation video lol
Maybe it's just me, but my immediate thought was that the pink and funky patterns come from the Japanese fashion you model and interact with.
I love how the explore page filled with some k-pop
I hope to see a complete egirl based video soon
Ty did well with the wig!!!
Omg do a video of going and getting like coffee mugs and shmash them and make a Franken mug!!! I think that's a great idea for a video. I would definitely attend that video watching.
The pink is so good, especially off the shoulder
Witch outfit 100/10
The black one just WOW
The safiya's new intro song is back
I actually think she looks really good with the pink wig. She pulls a lot of these looks off which is cool considering how and why she gets the looks.
The pastel/throw backs is called “soft girl” aesthetic.
0:39 is that chaeyoung from twice 😳
Yaassss! Hi Once!!!
I'm waiting for the house tour....🤟 Please include Crusty I love him so much, to adorable to exist
Do you know about David Kibbe's body types theory? It would be so fun, if you did a makeover on yourself using this!
I saw Twice and Blackpink 👀👀
I don't know if anyone has written this yet, but Abby Cox worked at Colonial Williamsburg, I think? A colab would be nice :)
The pink stuff is so cute in her legit
like the witch one
Please tell me you'll go through with the franken mug idea 🤪
Safiya is slowly turning into Wednesday Addams, I'm hyped about it
wait that last outfit would look a bit ote nice without the jacket
Did y'all redo and move into Jenna marbles house lolol your loving room shot and kitchen setup looks like her house with different furnature
Lol Its organ not or-gone, please pronounce it right lmao
Last outfit gives BTS boy with luv vibes
I love how she uses the intro audio to these types of videos that the random dude made her. Only OG's would know.
I would have loved to see the black skirt with the pink jacket.
Where can I find those boots!! I looked on their website but they are no where to be found!!  If anyone knows the link to the boots can you pls comment the link for me! Thank you loves
Pink wig looks great!!!
"Mark Zuckerberg is trying to kill me" should've been the title
Kinda cute when she open her instagram explore page and sees twice lmfao
There's definitely an intersection between the pink aesthetic here and e-girl, like they vibe in the same crowds, and some egirls would definitely wear a lot of it too honestly
24:22 those shoes are so coooool
Wait why does your house look like Jenna marbles lol
Love to see you in the pink.
I'm so glad I'm not the only one who had the issue with those jeans!! Mine fit so well around the waist and legs but that crotch seam is just too short
I always luv this intro song!!
Why is Safiya literally my personality but in her body
*sigh* they said Oregon wrong everytime...
I love the wig!!!
I wish there were not frequent videos that are shorter.  They make for an easier watch
The fact her explore was covered in fancams is amazing. I mainly saw Twice
I think the pink hair looks good on her and I LOVE LOVE LOVE that length of hair on her. I think it would’ve looked better with maybe a side bang or front bangs!
okay i’m sorry but when she said e girl i was like “noooooooo that’s y2k “
"There's NO pun there."   🖤   Ooooooh!!   🤯
Your house looks like Jenna's house but no wine cellar
I love the pink wig!
I think that the pink wig worked well with your skin tone. I think it would be cool to wear the witch outfit with the pink wig for a little pop of color to the outfit. Though I think that the witch outfit was the best buy, very cute.
Bleh u r so like me XD
I hate to say this, but I would like you to know that you did mispronounce Oregon.
I want the 2nd outfit omg ♡♡♡♡
without the bonnet I got suffragette vibes and I love that for you
11:18 check out @maaikesan on instagram!!
I think the pink outfit looks good... it just isn't your style, and it's not that you look bad, it's just a bit off cus it's just not you. Hope im making sense.
I think the pastel y2k outfit was really cute 🥺
pretty sure poseur is just an aliexpress reseller 😬
For the last one if she didn’t have the wig or jacket on it would have looked 👌 perfect  still looked good tho
twice all over her explore page... taste 😌
the witch outfit looked incredible on you!
Can you do full outfit from shein
I just want to know on which blessed day safiya started putting her hair in a middle part because she looks gorgeous
Wow as someone from Williamsburg I never thought I’d hear of someone being so infatuated with Colonial Williamsburg, but I’m loving this!
You look great as per usual
I think she's soooo beautiful OMG 🥺🤩😍
Love watching you. So bittersweet for me because your personality remind me of Jenna Marbles 🖤
The shoes would have fit their wedding so well
not at me getting excited when i saw twice in her explore 👀🕴️
Where did u find that wiggg???
I'm obsessed with the gothic/witch look. She looks powerful in it!
Don’t get me wrong I love saf, but I kinda makes me mad when she is wearing a mask when literally no one is around her. 🤔🙄
I swear she and Jenna Marbles live in the same housing complex.
I LOVE SANRIO  MY FAVE IS MY MELODY SHES SO ADORABLE THATS WHY SHES MY PFP
That pastel last one is (pastel) y2k baby!
Okay I think the last outfit is e-girls ulter ego let's name her!
I love the intro song
Was rewatching all of your videos and then I got to this new one and if possible you got even prettier! :D
most forbidden documentary in history: “Europa The Last Battle” at archive dot org.
I also identify as "diet goth" so thank u for giving it a name 🖤😂
Love you, Ora gun  is how Oregon is pronounced....LOL. I am from Portland...  I forget how smart you are when I am listening to the repartee I have missed you....
why is nobody talking about how GOOD she looks with pink hair
The mom jeans in the final outfit don't make sense.
Can we just appreciate that TWICE appeared on her Ig explore tab. QUEEN!
omg the "Egirl" outfit is so good on you. I don't love the color pallet but the silhouette is amazing. mom jeans look so good on you!!!
I live in Virginia and have been to Colonial Williamsburg a few times! If you go there or any other historical places in VA (there’s a bunch), you should make a video on it!
long shoe lace hack, wrap the the laces around the ankle one or two times as needed!
I swear she has done this before. Maybe not the shop tab, but it's basically the same as buying from IG ads.
Safia should definitely Collab with Natalia Taylor
All these shops just dropship their items and sell it via Instagram with huge profit...
The trendy witch gives me dreamcatcher (kpop group) vibes
YOU LOOK AMAZING IN THE TRENDY WITCH OUTFIT AHHHHH
Nodoby is talking about the kpop post and fancams in saf's explore page.    We stan saf 😎👊💖
Not the backwards suspenders
Safiya please tell me that that twice stuff wasn’t just a coincidence and you actually like them cause that would be amazing!  If you do I have a couple of questions as a fellow once-  Bias? Bias wrecker? Fav album Fav title track Who do you recon owns I can’t stop me era Fav song  Please respond or other once’s pls respond
did anyone notice that safiya had 118 missed calls when she opened her phone 😂😂3:14
I love the pink wig 🤩 it really suits safiya and I think they did a pretty good job putting it on!
the mask looks so good with the witch outfit though!!
Tyler I laughed at your memes of production joke lmaoo
I paused the video just to say I love your egirl makeup look and you should wear it more often!! 😄
OMG THE MASKS THEY ARE PERFECT
why does the last outfit give me gabbie hanna vibes????
It’s soft girl not e-girl hahaha love it
Your next video should be "mixing all the shampoo I bought"
Anyone see that tiktok video where that guys mom says she loves safiya
Frankenmug? No, it’s a Franken stein. (Get it?)
I live near colonial Williamsburg and I have see some of the colonial actors out casually getting groceries at like Publix and it's a great time
"Oar- eh- gone" C'mon, people! It's just "Oar-gun". Oregon. Not as complicated as you think.
Saf is a closet once (twice fandom name)
Safiya.... girl..... if you don’t want that pink jacket with the hearts, just send it to me for Christmas 🤣
the Power Puff Girls shirt is actually a Knock off from a Brand called Omighty.. On the bags you'll see the logo(the bags at their feet lol) Correct me if I'm wrong but I think Omighty is a "small" clothing brand, soo I mean I personally have an issue when ever other people copy a small business's designs but ehh there's a hustle:))
Hi saf love your videos 😘
Safiya missed ‘wearing my heart on a sleeve’ with the second outfit!
Not the foopa region 😂😂
As someone who was born and raised in Virginia, I appreciate the Williamsburg and VA jokes
You should dye ur hair pink :)
did she loose weight?? she looks amazing!
I am such a huge fan of yours. I finally converted my daughter to you. Guess what? You and she were born on the EXACT same day! July 16, 1992! She is SO jazzed! I know what your mommy and her mommy were doing that day!
Holy shit, YouTube updated since I've been gone and it's crazy (⊙_◎). Oh, and hi!
Love the pink on her
Please actually do the frankenmug video!
I love how she called it pastely and light color trendy look 😂 correct me if I’m wrong but isn’t it called the “soft girl” look or the “90s baddie” look 😂
why is nobody talking about how GOOD she looks with pink hair
I think the pink hair looks really great! Makes your pop!
Omg you looked so pretty as a not an e-girl
Chae looking good in that BDZ video
I went and checked out my shop tab to see how well Instagram knows me, and I’ve concluded they think I make a hecka lot more salary than I actually do 🤪
Me when my friend trys to get me to watch someone else other than Safyia   Has anyone seen it ?       ....... Is it good ?
I missed this intro so much!
Tuck the straps into the circle on the dressall! Then they won’t flop. I love the outfit !
I LOVE that wig on you!
I now want to see someone go shopping on the Instagram shop but on an account that has no followers and posts and isn't following anyone. Like I want to know what would happen
ok am i the only one thinking this is lauren z side long lost sister?
The shop tab has always been on Instagram
The intro song gives me such nostalgia
I’ve forgotten how much I love savs voice. It’s so calm and relaxing.
This helps 30:20 https://youtu.be/lFGKOTvTWik ;) _________ Edit: Sorry guys but I linked the wrong video, the video that I'm linking now is the one that I wanted to link and also the one that will help =D  https://youtu.be/kslQI5-k8dc
Im Wheezing when Safiya quoted McBeth 😂🤪
Honey has been there since 2018.
Can u make a tufted carpet please!!!!
omg she looks like marina and the diamonds in her 'egirl' look
Saf is losing weight.  Ok if your wanting too, if you’re stressing, take care chica
the only thing i could think about in this video is how similar their new house is to jenna and julien's
Safiya says that the last outfit doesn't reallyyyy work and I'm out here thinking that it all looks great together
Being offline for 8 months plus after your wedding kind of gives everyone ideas...
That powerpuff design is from the official show, actually. One of the season 5 or 6 eps where rhey had a fake flashback clipshow
u talk like a news lady
omg Safiya are you a ONCE!
am I the only person that thinks the feathered hair looks good on saf
The jeans do be cute though
When u we’re filming on my street— 😀
The Virginians are quaking!!
Ngl, but that pink wig does it for me
The non-toxic YouTuber we needed 🥰
i think the shoelaces are supposed to criss cross up the leg like gladiator sandals maybe?
omg im loving the y2k style fit tho???? it looks great together!! smth id wear tbh!
Hey Um I have a video idea: Do a Frankinperfume video where you go to a perfume shop and get the miniature/ tester bottles of perfume both for men and women and mix them together  Love you guys from Ellie in England 💕☺️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Not related but did any of you watch unus annus?
keeping the jacket off the shoulders with that tank and a pair of like 90s light wash short would be sooooo cute for that last outfit. it took a minute getting used to pink on you 😂
That black outfit was my FAVORITE on you 🥺🥺😩
You should post more often
the powerpuff girls top without the printing looks just like a top i used to wear for pjs as a little girl
I love how long the hair.  Like if you want her to to diy it again.
Can I say that looong hair fits you better than shirt hair? Woooooow, you're sooo beautiful ❤️😍❤️
Henlo
7 colors of the rainbow, 7 days of the week.....u see where I'm going with this 👀
My mom was making me do online homework but she fell asleep😅
I just wanna mention the amazing subtitles for this video! I really appreciate it when creators make sure to include those :)
THE SECOND OUTFIT OMG YOU LOOKED AMAZING
0:34 twice so conclusion she knows twice exists
Saf the milks made's tales. Yas!!
okay i would die for that black outfit.. those boots.. i mean COME ONNNN
That Colonial looks more Victorian
btw the 3ed one is called indie girl i think it an alt subculture i cant say for sure becus i am not indie so yea
I love the pink wig on you!
idk why but whenever i hear that intro it makes me want to go grab snacks
Anyone else think that from the back of her pink outfit she looks like an Instagram bad bitch 🙏🏼😌❤️
Need a churning butter song video in my life.
I want these shoes but i cant find them
Pinterest actually has a "visual search" option where if you tap on the picture it will analyze it and show you similar content. Google also has a visual analysis option in their photos app. So  "scanning" your outfits is really not that out there
ok but like where did she get the top she's wearing going through the stuff??
People in Oregon when they said Oregon like that 👁👄👁
Reminds me if Pinterest’s shop this look that they add except none of the things match
Sometimes I feel like she's trying to hard to be something she's not. And the way she talks 😅
Tuck the suspender flaps into the ring and they will stay put
Tuck the nipple tassels in the circle kind of like a belt.
Safiya must have done well in her English exam if she quoting Macbeth ( 28:18).
as a witch, I'm offended .-.
I love her masks! Do you guys know where to get similar ones? I really like their shapes
Love the phone background
Let's SPAM!! Abby Cox sent us to tell you she'd like to collaborate with you when you go to Colonial Williamsbourg (she worked there for a couple of years) and you could make a dress for it together! :D :D :D
In conclusion: Safiya is a Once
IG is being so weird. I have 4 accounts and they all look different. One one of them, the "no likes" thing is being tested.
Tyler deserves credit for the 'meme's of production line
I really love that pink jacket.
the suspender skirt had questionable placement of the metal hoops
sorry I'm late! But I never saw you wear pink like a whole outfit xD
I love how she talks about Virginia. I’ve never heard anybody talk about VA on YouTube. #vagirl
w i s h t a g r a m
I love how she uses the intro audio to these types of videos that the random dude made her. Only OG's would know.
Her ig feed is kinda full of K-pop...♥️😻
the goth/witch outfit looks really really good, and i thought the bonnet looked very cute on you.
Mine is only egirl fashion 💀
Do you talk Swedish? I did hear some Swedish words there!❤️😊
Thank you for still sticking around Saf ( ◜‿◝ )♡
I think if you combined the witchy and last one it would look great as an awesome pastel goth vibe ❤️
As an Oregonian the way you said Oregon made me legitimately gag OML, I love you guys tho!
Dress as K/DA character plss😊😊🙏🙏
Insta witchy outfit is so cute
She looks like morticia Addams at 8:14 it’s a compliment btw 🥺💞
you look so pretty with the “e-girl” makeup ?!?
Good job tyler on putting on the wig. Also, I loved the  Pink outfit!!
I love that you have twice in your recommendations
Safiya: hello fellow kids, 14:20  Me: Lauren? Is that you? How did you get on this channel?
To be fair, the witch outfit definitely needed more accesories, rings, tattoos, piercings, and something with the hair.
Actually really like the wig. Haha. She looks really good with pink hair.
"This girl is either a witch, or a Civil War reenactor" is the best descriptor I have encountered for myself.
I hadn't realized that you follow a bunch of historical fashion accounts, and I audibly gasped when I saw Bernadette's American Duchess line in your shop feed.
I hadn't realized that you follow a bunch of historical fashion accounts, and I audibly gasped when I saw Bernadette's American Duchess line in your shop feed.
Prepie? Hey? Where are you from Safiya? If you are saying prepie, oh and I know what a prep is but I thourght you lived in the U.S?
This girl is a witch or a civil war renactor  -ty 2020
WHY IS THEIR HOUSE LIKE IDENTICAL TO JENNAS WTF
I wish you could make videos more often.
5:02 now rihanna (via fenty) is coming out with clones of those ugly boots unfortunately
it looks like you're filming in jenna marbles' house
you CAUSED the NEW INSTA UPDATE
Thank you for the virginia jokes. Never hear VA mentioned lmao
For the moon shoes wrap the laces around your ankle / up your leg like they’re lacing up!! It takes care of the longness and it would look cool with the look :-)
I know you didn’t love but you really rocked that bonnet!!! But the look with your hair down....... literally incredible pls wear that all the time
Your phone wallpaper is the best 😂
you look gorgeous 🌹🌹
On the suspenders I'm pretty sure she was supposed to tuck the extra bit of the straps into the loops so they don't flap out.
I'm feeling the McBeth moment she's having. We had to read it outloud for my highschool English class and I did all three witches in freaky ass voices, turning to indicate that I was doing a different witch each time. My whole class looked at me like I was the girl from the ring, afterwards.
Aha I love Sammi sweetheart too 😭 lol
That looks a lot like Jenna’s house
I live in Gloucester and my US History teacher from high school does Revolution reenactments in Yorktown and Williamsburg...I bet he can get you to the butter. :))
Did she just quote hocus pocus?? And make a parody of weird al's parody?? And the last outfit is more of a soft girl/girly look  And this is coming from a pre teen so I know what im talking about
twice on her explore page i love to see it
THE GOTHMALL MODEL WITH THE GREEN HAIR IS @PHONYGHOST ON INSTAGRAM AND SHE'S THE SWEETEST!!!!🥺🖤🖤🖤
No matter how many times I watch it over and over I will never get over those ✨butter turning skills✨
Safiya you live on the west coast how could you say ore-gone.
"Killed her husband wacked him" best quote from safiya
Oreh-gone? :(
Oh my goodness I LOVE the colonial outfit. You’re living my dream in it
“We think this girl’s either a witch or a civil war re-enactor” hahaha that’s spot on
Sofia is a mood!!
Twice (Kpop girl group) being featured in your video unintentionally is legendary ❤️
I've missed seeing your videos. I hope you start to post more often again!
I absolutely love the black outfit!!
who does your house remind me of one of the old what's up moms houses
Williamsburg is soooooooo much fun! We went there last summer (just clarifying: 2019)!
The 3rd is more passable if you take off the jacket or the wig
Get you a man who will joke with you abt your theoretical only fans
I actually love the “e-girl” look on Saf and the wig looks awesome and I love the natural brow with the bold color! I think the black skirt situation could be remedied by lengthening the straps to see if maybe it hits you differently.
The skirt on the witch outfit is amazing, i want that so bad!!
Time for the TikTok Sean Paul remix......Everyday She B Churnin’ not concernin' what nobody wanna say 🎶
the pvseur brand steals a lot of clothing, including that tank top (which is actually from Omighty) so I wouldn't buy from them!!
Little House on The Prairie vibes hahahah!
It kinda looks like you are a time traveling witch.... 1800s, current black gothy witch, and futuristic galaxy witch.
I call that last look soft girl it’s basically whirl but softer and more girly
I live 20 mins from colonial williamsburg!!! pls come visit me
11:37 Can we just talk about Safiya's lock screen!?!? Lol!
Does Honey work on Shein?
maybe the laces are meant to be tied around the ankle
People watching this realizing they catcalled Safiya in a bonnet 👁👄👁
My oh my have I missed this
I was so hoping you’d pair the last outfit with the pink platform crocs and I’m sad you didn’t do that.
how did you just know the American girl doll names ? also your house is literally the double of jenna marbles’ I’m convinced you two are neighbours now 🤩
okaaayyyyyeeeee. allllriiiiiiiightttt.
You both are great and make me laugh and I was singing along with the churning butter song.  I want to let you know how to pronounce my homestate though.  Oregon is Or-eeg-in, not Or-ee-gone. It's awesome that you've played the Oregon Trail game.  That was my jam back in the 80's. 😁
God, I missed this intro.
This video is amazing, I love you saf you are so awesome but uh as someone from Oregon why do you say it like that? You say it like ora- gone but its supposed to be said like or-e-gon or organ is another way I can explain it. But besides that keep up the amazing works you beans!
See if there's a little loop on the back of the boots to wrap the laces around and bring them back to the front the tie I have boots like that where the laces are really long but you're just supposed to wrap them around your ankle
Lol gosh everybody hates that Lele Pons
Love the looks! Try using permanent marker over the word 'witch' it won't be so in your face !
*ha’penny (short for half penny)
I NEED to know where you got the sweater with the skull on it and the sleeves!!!
I LOVE ENCHANTED BIKINIS!
the third outfit will look better without the wig
Well now I wanna see the breaking cups video.
Me seeing the thumbnail and wondering why she's cosplaying as Carrie's Dirty Candy look from Julie and the Phantoms
Safiya, Abby Cox is a youtuber who worked at Colonial Williamsburg and American Duchess. You should contact her!
Moral of the story: they think she’s a witch  Edit: OMG 1K LIKES THX
Instagram sus
not twice being on her explore page
i actually really liked the pink outfit on you!! i can totally see you wearing the pink jacket with an all-black outfit
The shoelaces may have that length so you can wrap them around your leg on the top and then tie them. A lot of my alternative style shoes also have long laces, if they are too long I wrap them around and in a lot of pictures they wear them like that.
loving that 2nd outfit. I WANT THOSE BOOTS!!!!
I really want the witch shirt! Where can I get it?!
I think the only thing that didn't work with the last outfit was the pants. Maybe some tighter jeans or the skirt that was with the jacket in the original photos would help bring the look together. The second outfit was definitely the best though!
My "shop" button is the first option. Hmmmm what does that say about me?
I LOVED ALL THE LOOKS! stunning and beautiful 😍
Love your vids
the witch outfit looks more like an e-girl outfit
I love the witch outfit.  I love this video. You are so funny 🤣
the last look is more kinda soft girl
Thanks again Safiya and Tyler for a very entertaining video. I enjoy them all. 😃🥰
i’m so confused as to how you know the american girl doll names and remember their outfits perfectly????
Who noticed her wallpaper ???
Safiya would be like the person who researches everything in a project group ....
What's the best way to grow such strong and long hair as yours ? <3
Loved the witchy outfit and thanks for always adding captions to your videos!
The third outfit looks better with the mask
The Witch outfit is my favorite.
It’s crazy to think that she only uploads around 10-14 videos a year. But is such a successful youtuber.
I think you should try making a candle from lipstick🐇🌌💋💄
So weird seeing you in light coloured clothes but it's such a cool summery change, love the second outfit the most, definitely want them shoes 😍
I think the pink hair looks awesome on you!
Anyone else notice the Bernadette Banner shoes at 3:55 ?  Just me?  Alright... 🤣
I live in Williamsburg and have friends that work there 😬😬😬
I am sorry, I will unsubscribe even though I like you. It deeply hurts to know that no one liked a comment I made about you maybe trying to be a little more sustainable. It shows that your audience doesn’t care about our future on the planet or the future of every single animal and therefore I do not want to be a part of this audience anymore. To every person that reads this: our world is dying and with supporting consumerism you are contributing to it
I LOVE LOVE LOVE THE ALL BLACK OUTFIT! IT MADE YOU LOOK SKINNY AND REALLY ROCKIN!
I finally understand why her videos take so long. That’s a lot of visuals from the phone she had to edit in! Dang Safiya you really giving us the good content.
11:35 the lock screen lmao
this woman didn't let the fame get to her and i LOVE that for her
Said Oregon wrong
Mark Zuckerberg is trying to kill us all!.... I can't roller skater too
Gathering of Goods IG gained 3,000 followers from this video 😅
:O
I missed your content!!!! Your notifs weren't pushed to me as much as you used to! Late but loved! Its a good day 😂
Its or-eh-gun lol 🥰
Hehehehe we all saw the twice fancam on the explore page, we love to see it
Hey Saf, for the shoelace problem I would say that you could wrap them around the ankle part of the boots once or twice then either tie it in the front like normal or on the inner side of your ankle 💖
In love with you!
the first fit is like cottage-core attire
just clicked this video to hear the weird way she talks again
omgggg we have the same shop tab !! thank you for testing the waters for all of us
Loved your info and you both together
as an Oregonian im putting it out there that its pronounced Oreg"en" not ore"gone" its a pet peeve for most of us
You in the pink wig, with the makeup, and the hearts... My first thought was this: https://i.quotev.com/img/q/u/14/6/23/0bb8e20587-Scre.jpg ( Marina and the Diamonds ) <3  You are gorgeous! And all of these looks are so fun. The Witch outfit might be my favorite though. Stunning! :)
The set up makes me think of Jenna 🥺
i see a twice stan HAHAHHAA
Honestly the wig doesn’t look that bad!!
I love the wig! It’s so cute!  Above the waist you look adorable in outfit 3! Below the waist those jeans are not great.
The print on the back pocket of the e-girl jeans is probably digital printing, which is effectively the professional version of those DIY iron-on transfer printer sheets
black outfit was so good
MEET ME AT MCDONALD'S
Not me wanting to buy the second outfit
Re: insta scanning your posts As you said, it’s unlikely that they can do this, but it might actually be able to get a good idea of what kinds of things you post based on what other accounts your followers follow.
you NEED to come to colonial williamsburg!! I go to school there :)
Didn't like the mom pants on u .lol
I think each outfit was appropriate for your personality, also you looked great in all of them.
Did anyone see mention of where the flower embroidered mask came from? Too cute! A tip for the “nip tassels” lol if you tuck the ends through the metal rings, the ends will be hidden inside the top of the skirt. Might be something to try. 😅
Safiya this is a hilarious video and I am only partway through. The trying to pronounce the site name (Pvseur) was adorable. I love the closeup with it. I kept going back. HAHA I'm happy that you are back. I've missed your batty self.
Without a bonnet you look like a Salem witch ❤️❤️❤️
When she’s a once 💞
I love shopmegoosta!!
With the bonnet off, you look like a cowgirl about to grab a shotgun and kill the raiders who burned your farm and killed your husband.
She looks like Vaani Kapoor (Bollywood Actor)
Is it me or is she filming at Jenna marbles house? I mean the kitchen and the living room shot look eerily similar. And it would be my dream come true if Jenna and her did a video together. Especially what she’s referencing E-girls. I love them both so much!  Also.... love Saf’s long hair.
who thinks safiya looks like she's glowing and super pretty omg
I don’t work at Colonial Williamsburg anymore but you’d love it! I did the Ghost Tours
I think the pink jacket looked good
oh as a goth/punk, i can tell you punk rave is quality clothing.  wish I could afford it
@ 2:02 the blonde chick looks like Safiya just blonde
I need a Safiya dressing like american girl dolls video
Not BDZ on the explore page lmaooo
SAFIYA IS A ONCE AIDBRN
Saf is a witch from the Salem witch trials
Safiya they have way too many different versions. I have 1 business (jewelry), 1 for my cats, and 2 other accounts. ALL 4 accts are completely different. It is ridiculous.
Tyler's puns get better and better
So we’re not gonna talk about how Safiyas wallpaper is Tyler’s whole face💀🥺😭😭
The pink wig looks really good on you !! ❤️❤️ You should try to incorporate it in other looks, it might be cute to mix it with black / actual egirl stuff :p
Am I the only one who juat couldnt get over Or-uh-gone?
Yes, we do all live our lives inspired by Sammi Sweetheart.
Safiya! The poseur site is actually an account that buys clothing and sells it for a bunch of money, usually the actual prices of the clothes are 3-10 dollars and she raises the prices super high. That's also why the quality isnt good and it takes a super long time to ship. I hope anybody who sees this does not buy from them and tries to find the original product- they are usually on AliExpress, as people have found and they're super cheap clothing with good quality
saf- you loop the other part of the suspenders into the loops 👁👄👁
Safiya looks good in her third outfit but the vibe was more 'trendy instagram selfie persona' than 'diet goth' like we're used to.  It looked good, really pulled off the hair, but it wasn't safiya like we know her.
please bring back the frankenlipstick  collab with colorpop i miss them
“DIET GOTH” i’m literally screaming
Love the witchy-goth outfit (ooh those BOOTS!), looks great on you.  Can't believe anyone who's ever even BEEN to London would call their brand 'Minga' haha!
DID PEOPLE NOT KNOW WHEN UR PANTS ARE MAKING FACES IT MEANS ITS EITHER TOO TIGHT OR LOOSE WHICH WOULD BE IN THE CROTCH AREA
The “or-eh-gon” brought me physical pain
is that jenna marbles house😳
THE FRANKENMUG YES PLEASE MAKE IT HAPPEN
If you don't know now you know
I need to see a video where safiya tries a new style everyday, here's what I'm thinking:  Cottagecore, E-girl (or some form of alt),  soft girl, indie, and streetwear
Ok but no ones talking about how well the pink hair suited her!!
You should do a video of buying things from tictok small businesses that pop up on your fyp! It would also be a really fun way to support small businesses and help then grow more during a really difficult time :)
The black outfit with the mask was amazing and she looked gorgeous in it.
Can Tyler shop and dress up one day, if he wants???? 🥺
She looks so cottagecore without the bonnet
May I introduce you to Bernadette banner
I would totally wear the witchy outift
Thanks so much for the content you make! I don't mind if it's late or not and just appreciative you put this out into the universe. Keep doing you. It's working for you. :)
i use instagram everyday.... i did not notice this shop until today when i watched this video... HOW have i not noticed this? lol Thanks Safiya :)
I'm dead serious I have no clue who she is
Who is Sammy sweetheart
okay so is it just me that is very angry that we didn’t see sofia in just the shirt and pants without the pink jacket and hair?????
SAFIYA I just want to say how much I appreciate the tone and the pace of your voice! There are so many youtubers who speak SO FAST and fast talkers literally give me lowkey anxiety, so it makes me so happy to watch and listen to your videos <3 I know people complain about your "slow talking" but I hope it never changes, because I LOVE IT
For the pink outfit the pants has to go
love seeing kpop on safiyas explorer page
The cabs are here... its T-Shirt Tiiime!
E-girl has a TON of flavors and is more about the makeup and hair than it is about the outfit. I’ve definitely seen e-girls wear outfits like that
You are so adorable!
MingaLondon is amazing! I think Saff looked amazing in the third outfit
Is no one going to talk about how they pronounced Oregon💀💀💀💀
Black nygaard fav Black
love #2!!!
My shopping tab looks exactly the same. Was it sponsored by 4 brands? 😂
The second one is my favorite! i LOVE those shies and the skirt!
I'd definitely go for pastel purple, because purple is my favorite color and I think pastel purple would work out for me.
Her screen saver tho 😂
I love your videos so much. They always make me laugh, and the content is always something I want to see. (no matter what mood I am in)
i would still consider that diet goth but she looks cute!!! did not expect a colonial fit from this but i love it
If u aren’t gonna wear outfit three can I have the jacket Lmao 😂
Hiiiii
She looks so good in the witchy outfit holy shit
I love how all my fav styles are the same as hers lmao
Honey has saved me so much money!
Every drag queen in the UK was a little bit excited seeing Webster's Wigs here. The goth look was gorge, though I do hate that WITCH logo on the shirt, it's too reminiscent of when I was 13 and thought quirky tshirts were a personality
ok I want that second outfit
I would like to see you with the wig, the black dress with the black boots, any black top you are comfortable in, and the pink jacket. 👌😎😍
I love the witch clothing! and the pink theme reminds me of Marina and the diamonds
Pleas
Post more often
I am SO mortified that folks are so brain washed by the MKULtra mockingbird media, and dumbed down by fluoride etc, that they worship vacuous robots like this and PAY to watch this BULLSHIT.  The cabal LAUGH at the sheeple that care more for crap like this, then caring about: Vaccine Injury and Death Stories. Boobtube is DELETING the link. But see my Tumblr if you actually CARE about your children!   Or: https://vigilantcitizen.com/musicbusiness/the-disturbing-meaning-of-billie-eilishs-bury-a-friend  Wake up folks!! This is why they call you sheep and laugh at you for caring more for Youtubers than your own family!!   What is OperationPaperclip? How do Chemo and AUSCHWITZ link? What is the "Depopulation by ANY means necessary" agenda?   GOD BLESS ALL THOSE THAT GIVE A FUCK! And who FIGHT for us daily.
it’s twice’s split second exposure for me lol
vicariously buying cute shit through safiya, the series
Halo Chocolate!!!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3T_KHbfhs
I CAN’T GET ENOUGH OF YOUR VIDEOS!!  You guys always do super interesting things ❤️
is saf a kpop stan-
ily
When I first saw the video i was like omg that video is soo sooo long but as I started watching it I really enjoyed every minute of it 😍🥰
Most of the clothes from shop pvseur are copies of actual brands, such as Omighty, and they buy them on aliexpress and sell them for more.
My favorite outfit was the second one because it's just so safiya (and honestly my aesthetic) but the other stuff was really cool tho! I actually loved the wig and her makeup for the 'not e-girl' look
i just don’t like the wig+jacket combo but the rest of the outfit looked good to me!    I LOOOOOOOOOOOOVED THE GOTH OUTFIT I WISH I COULD BE THAT WAY OMG
omg safiya is a once
I always get excited when you post a video .I know how much works goes into these videos quality content. Keep up the good work 🌼☀️💫✨
Safiya was dating her self with that e-girl talk 🥴 also the wig isn’t awful! The line is a little harsh, but if you do it a little more you’d be there!
I don't see to go to Williamsburg when I was younger
Deeeyymmmm, that shoulder shot was nothing short of DIVINE.        33:10
0:37 my girls twice and itzy
Hearing people not from Oregon pronounce it OR-GONE 😑
When u have notifications on but YouTube literally HIDES the video from you 😔
Franken-muuuuuug ! !
Monet is an impressionist- what do you even mean?
the soft pastel fashion you confused as e-girl is actually a newish fashion trend often referred to as early 2000s or y2K ❤️ there’s a good video by moderngurlz about it all, just search y2k fashion and it’s the first video that comes up ☺️
can u do a Q and A vid ! PLS
"They see me churnin... "   Thanks so much Saf, its  1:43am and I burst out laughing so hard that I startled my sleeping  husband and child!
Wait.. the e-girl make up LOOKS SICK, it suits you so well you should do your eye makeup like that every day
I didn’t notice the nipple tassel I think they’re more to the side, but I think it looks so good on you!
The karate moves after the bee attack 😂😂😂😂
Safiya and Tyler! Check out the Eurovision song from Poland in 2014. That is inappropriate :P
https://youtu.be/OMntJbn0BIM 🎵🎵
HEY SAF, YOU SHOULD DO MIXING EVERY LOTION FROM BATH AND BODY WORKS TOGETHER!
Good game my idol safiya with mr beast challenge or competion u were out standing and gorgoes among the my other favorite youtubers sorry for my bad english im filipino thats why
Oh man I was cringeing everytime they said "Oregon." It's Oregun, not oregone. We're just a state away from CA, please learn how to pronounce it :[
hey guys please google how to say Oregon i'm gonna go insane
Soo nobody is going to talk about twice on her page🥺🐧
Ok the pink outfit once you take off the jacket is HOT 🔥
That witch outfit was MADE for her!!!! 🙌🖤
Stream BDZ by TWICE 0:38 ❤️✨
THE WAY YOU SAY OREGON. MAAM!!!
love the hocus pocus reference
they thought you were amish.
That laugh at 3:25 was adorable 😍🥰. Also I really hope she adds that jacket to a diet goth outfit 😂
Omg I work at  colonial Williamsburg please come I will give you my employee discount
It's almost as if they recommend what they want you to look like, rather than what you enjoy wearing.   That pink was just...no.  You are so much better than that lol.
0:37 btch isee that twice blackpink itzy
Without the bonnet she looked like a pirate just needed a few more things to complete that look.
can we talk about how they say Oregon?
🎉
I'm disappointed that there isn't enough Tyler cred for the wig
i LOVE the pink wing on you!
Idk what it is but the few months later time skip she’s literally glowing like just absolutely stunning and I can’t put my finger in why but it’s such a good look for her
i LOVE your floral mask where did you get it???
*gives Tyler credit*     Honesty I loved all outfits. The last one reminded me of an edgy pink girl. Maybe that's why I like it so much XD
Safiya dropping the jersey shore lines cracks me up so hard😂
I think that the shoe laces where supposed wrap around the ankle and then tie
Hey Sophia I really like your videos but you barely ever post them so I was wondering if you could maybe try to post more. ☺️😊🙂👌
I watched this and realized how much I missed your videos ❤️
My eye hard twitched with how they said Oregon....
does anyone know where she got her shirt from? the one she was wearing throughout the try on part the black floral blouse
I think the last outfit was cute!
Love the black outfit soooooo much . And the pink outfit was nice.  . Love the look . Just you seemed uncomfortable in it.
Safiya proving once again that she can rock any outfit
I died when she said killed her husband whacked him 🤣🤣🤣
👀 i see that american duchess ad for Bernadette shoes, i can appreciate that
This is so an ad. Otherwise, I still enjoy your videos 💜
okay but now I want a smash mug and glue them together video.
Mr. Kate vibes with the last one xD
I’d just like to take a moment and appreciate the insane amount of editing that went into this
My goth ass immediately recognized all of the killstar products pfft
Is anyone going to tell her that Minga is a British insult slur?
i like how tyler laughs when i laugh, that means it was extra funny to everyone.lol
The black outfit looks SO great on her! I wish I could pull off that look!
We Stan the pink wig though
I watched totally spies EVERY DAY
I see Twice videos in your explore page👀
Excuse me. I have lived in Oregon my entire life. its pronounced Ory-Gun. NOT ORY-GONE.
Not me wanting that second outfit sooo badly!!🖤😍
I think the pink and hearts thing i think is called a "softgirl"
Why does no one know how to say Oregon correctly? Lol I’m an Oregonian btw
WHY IS THE BLACK ONE MY WHOLE AESTHETIC AND SO CUTE
no mirror not even on yet and she says im already rocking it lol its the confidence for meeeeeee !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I actually really really love the E girl makeup 😍💕
oh my god i'm in LOVE with the second outfit,the skirt is just beautiful
Ooh there are aspects of each outfit I love! I really like the ‘Witch’ top and the pink cropped jacket and think they would actually look cute together with a pair of black skinny jeans!
The pink jacket is hella cute
I'm here because I miss watching Safiya
tbh im kinda vibing with the last outfit
Safiya: I feel like Instagram is just throwing a bunch of spaghetti at the wall and sometimes they nail it. Me: ...so there is a reason you throw spaghetti at the wall and it's not so that you can nail it there.
Not to be all sappy but the velvet heart on the sleeve of the witch shirt reminded me of Tyler's velvet jacket from their wedding and I thought it was cute
That last one was like....Stephanie Lazy Town but make it Fashion
I would just be wearing leoatards because that’s all it gives me 😂 I do look up ballet stuff s lot tho
You're giving me Dolores in Westworld vibes in the first outfit sans bonnet!
The boots are out of stock😭
Safiya, of course Instagram is constantly analyzing what you post on your account, (your images, your tags, etc) that way it knows who to recommend your account for and also what to advertise to the people following you. Why wouldn't it just apply that same marketing to you, the owner of the account?  100% what you described about them analyzing what you post is what is happening to all the content on Instagram so that they know what you like. It's not a conspiracy. It's right there.
The witch outfit looks so good on you!!
I AM SO OFFENDED BY THE WAY YOU PRONOUNCED OREGON. ITS OR-GEN. like an organ.
I saw that American Duchess ad for the Bernadette shoes on your more recent screen recording. Are you watching Bernadette Banner for her lovely relaxing content?
Ok but what's the Goth Milk pun about??
SAFIYA BEFORE U HAD 10 SUBS RIGHT NOW IT IS 9 PLS TELL ME IM WRONG
you believe in quality over quantity and it’s shows. love you saf!!!!!!
Safiya needs to follow ex-Colonial Williamsburg-reenactor-turned-youtuber Abby Cox STAT.
I feel like the last outfit would’ve looked better without the wig
I kind of feel like that would be considered pastel goth but with like a little bit of like e-girl influence
This was entertaining Thanks Saf I was hella bored  before watching this video. I didn't even realise it was almost 40 mins that time flew.
Uhm so is no one going to mention how twice is on her discover page uh 👁💙👁
I love the 3rd look! I think it’s cohesive and I can def imagine an Egirl wearing it! So cute regardless!
Removing the bonnet got me SHOOOook
The black skirt with the colonial blouse 🤔
2 million dollars???? Cmon thats gotta be a hoax right.. how many do we shop?
You rich rich.  Must be nice white privilege at it finest 🤔We needed to see you do this video during a PANDEMIC ...keep up the white...I mean good work👍#isaidwhatisaid
off topic but I feel like you could be Eugene Levy's daughter.
Anything pink or brightly coloured.  *Safiya: Is this E-girl?*
A velvet ribbon on the goth boots? ;)
It took forever to get to the part where she got the first package... Too long video
Amazing great upload your new friend coming with full support keep safe all daym waiting your support stay connceted 👍👍👍
They see me churnin, they hatin. Patrolin they trying to catch me churnin butter! 🤣😂😭☠
Y'all are crazy that last outfit makes perfect sense. I mean it's a little out there, sure, but it makes sense.
I love the movie Hocus Pocus
Here i am paying over 10 a month for no ads and there youtubers STILL put in an ad in their videos! Wtf. This shouldn't be allowed when we are paying for no ads!
imagine if she did a tim burton inspired makeup look 😍
the pink hair on safiya is SO GOOD
I hope she’s in a bunch of tik toks for the pioneer outfit 😂
you're supposed to tuck the skirt straps into the circles like into the skirt
I think the las outfit would’ve looked better without the jacket
Love the American Girl references! 🥰🥰🥰
So no one's gonna talk about how they pronounced Oregon? 💀😂
🥰🖤🤍🖤These shoes are great 😍
after 3 months finnally u postedd!!  ❤️❤️ luv safiya
I LIVE IN COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG OMG, if you did a video here that would be amazing
I like the 3rd outfit :3 (( I love all the outfits))
Id skip the jeans and wig near the end. Keep the top and jacket for another look, cause they actually look cute imo.
Baby? Pah! Gimme a Disney villain bikini and a set of Maleficent ears, STAT!
I forgot that they dont live near Colonial Williamsburg because I live in Virginia 😂
I feel like the third outfit would look better without the jacket
In the philippines, our shopping apps have the ability to suggest products to you just by taking a photo using the app’s camera or uploading the photo onto the search bar. The tech came from china and stuff so 🤷‍♀️
Safiya looks really pretty in pink 💗 she looks like a cand
Greetings from Malaysia. Dear Safiya, you can try put the remaining straps into the ring loops so that it doesn't hang aka flappage. hehehe
Aw, I would have loved to see the pink wig with the witchy shirt or the pink jacket with the black skirt! <3
As a British viewer, I feel that Minga London is probably pronounced like MING - AH rather than MIN - GAH, and might be a play on Minger; meaning "an unattractive or unpleasant person or thing". Though I cannot confirm, that's all I thought every time you said Minga. And since it's from London and that's how we'd pronounce minger, I feel like it's supposed to be an ironic name for a fashion outlet.
i see the twice photos on your explore page, safiya 👀
The powerpuff girl shirt took really long to arrive because they just drop ship from AliExpress
Rhaaaaaanieeeeee!
You look good. If i wear pink clothes my mom is like (Go and change dumb you are a teen now wear black or white get it)     Joking
"We're just churning,we're just churning"
Fack
does saf live in the same neighborhood as jenna and julien because that living room and kitchen is almost identical
"I'm usually a diet goth..a comfortable vampire"😂😂😂😂😂
10:53 MEGAN MASSACRE 😍😍😍
Considering how the E-Girl from Riot known as Seraphine wears similar outfits, I think that title suits it well.
Memes of production 😂
the last look gave me LazyTown vibes-
idk why but her cringy face is so creepy😖 Don't take this personally😅
Twice ❤️💖💝
I would never wear the witch outfit, they make your boobs look alot bigger and mine are big enough. Outfit warning: doesnt suit big tatas lol Apart from that I like it
Saf is a witch, thats why the two haven't aged...
that witch outfit is EVERYTHING!!!
Become a mermaid for a day!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love how she still uses the intro song
anyone else feel weird abt the 'colonial' outfit.
anyone else feel weird abt the 'colonial' outfit.
Are you a witch ? The notifications tab got moved next to the dms and now there’s a shop tab instead of my regular notifications, I’m confused Instagram !!! lol
I love that twice is in her explore page
I’m pretty sure the supposed e girl looks more of a soft girl or just pastel girl
Why douse thier home look like Jenna marbles home,like almost exactly
I would love to see the black skirt, white blouse and pink wig together on you!
Can we just take a few moments to admire how pretty saf is, she is giving me very much Business women CEO Elvira
I love how she enjoys herself ❤️
okay but the black outfit was KILLER, seriously, saf looked gorgeous
Bro is that not Jenna and Julien’s house
“Hello fellow kids” how could you copy Larenzside 😂 😂 noooo
Are you a TWICE STAN!??!!? 💜💜💜💜
Can you trust the businesses that are selling this way?  Most of what I see on instagram turn out to be scammers that I ignore all but the ones I know.
I just you realized guys look like Dave and lori from alexa and Katie
Safiyaaa is back:3
saf in the first fit and hair down was doin sumfing to me 🥴
Guys. Guys. ORegon. Not OreGON. Lol
That Which look and the colonial!
Tyler, did you just made a pun out of a marx quote??? I stan.
you should do a video recreating american girl doll fits!
Loved the witchy look!
The American Girl doll references are giving me life. Molly for life
The pants is actually perfect for the  ✌🏻✊🏻e girl look✌🏻✊🏻 because it balance the pink and doesn't over use the color.
the 1st look is very "handmaid's tale"  Outfit #2 needs holo laces.  (tuck the flaps in to the rings) #3... the wig looks good on you.
You guys say Oregon weird 😂
Try buy outfits from Shein, I'm a bit curious about it!
Her without the bonnet on gave me Huntress vibes from dead by daylight
Very cool outfits the black one id my fav you always look stunning
Anyone else love williamsburg? high key? just me? okay. i miss vacations there high  key
i want everything that looks like it would be in the bratz movie or game. my dream
.....YET!!!!!
24:11 OMG LOVE!!!!
" My fresh cream brings all the boys to the yard"  😂
The DDLG vibes in the pastel suggestions are intense
Love the witchy look!
The black outfit was def my fav, but I think you look so good with pink hair!!
Wow crazy!
I feel like if you added a French hat lmao 😂 I forgot what it’s called but the witch outfit felt incomplete without a hat
You should make Williamsburg in your house
Frankenmug video drop when?
I think the black skirt with the blouse from the first outfit would work well, actually
OKAY first off why do you look SO GOOD in the williamsburg outfit 😂😂😂  omg can I have the demim jacket if you dont want it.... SO CUTE!!!
:)
You’re the modern morticia Addams and no one can tell me otherwise
What about a franken-hair dye (mix all the AF hair colours together and put it on bleached hair)
Honestly I actually really liked the pink outfit on you, and it takes A LOT for me to like pink when it comes to fashion
THE WIG IS STUNNING 💓💓 I want it but I am wayy too poor
I hated those angel pants before she ordered them, and I hate them after.
I neeeed to know where these masks are from! Not even a huge fan of pink but the pastel galaxy mask is gorg!
I went to colonial Williamsburg in elementary school! I live in VA so it’s not too far.
First outfit gave me Amish vibes 100%
Me at 11 pm: I'm gonna go to sleep a bit earlier tonight Me at 5 am: * Googling "what is a meet me at mcdonald's haircut" *
Ty is the hilarious side commentary that we all needed in this vid.
YESS AMERICAN DUCHESS IS SUCH A COOL BRAND. both with style and ethical manufacturing
I also have ankle boots that have too long of laces, I just wrap them around the top of the shoe like the ankle area. Then I tie them like normal and that usually works perfectly!
idk if Safiya has ever dressed up as morticia adams, but she would do an amazing job. when she talked about her in the video it made me realize lol
Note: OR-Eh-Gehn not OR-eh-GONE
Ok she lives in Jenna’s house
If you took the blouse from outfit 1, skirt and boots from outfit 2, and hair from outfit 3 you would be an egirl.
u got the neklace!!!
The last out fit was like a soft girl they wear things like that
I am obsessed with the witch shoes and the pastel mask!!! ahh where did ou get it<?? Also you were so pretty in all 3 outfits <3
I LOVE the all black look like everything about it and it looks great on Safiya
safs face at 27:29 is so funny
You should try the Pinterest shop tab  Not that bad😜  Anyways love your content   ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I SAW TWICE, I SAW BLACKPINK, I SAW ITZY, I THINK I SAW LOONA
Wow. I’ve missed this intro song 😌
5:21 is that Kimberley Margarita/Colour Creep!?
Why is their house practically the same as Jenna Marble's and Julien's house??
I love your videos so much but I would love to see a mixing all of my bronzers together I feel like it would be an amazing video like all of your videos
Good job Tyler :)
Saff; take the top half of the pastel outfit and the bottom half of the witch outfit and you'll have yourself an EGirl outfit. I HOPE YOU SEE THIS BECAUSE I WANNA SEE THE PIC!!
Safiya you should do a review/ haul from Shein
That's the link to thredUp.
Under is the link to the video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQp_dOwWRhA&t=107s
If you like Thrift Store or at least don't mind it. You should really try threadUp. (threadup.com)) They have multiple cloths for inexpensive prices. But they are still some that are expensive like the designer clothes. But it have tons of clothes and it have a percentage off. (20%,30%40%,50%) It can be one of those only thought. I don't know if it have your style but it might see for yourself. Rachel Masky have more information on that you can talk to her if possible or watch Modern to Retro Disney Villains Edition Halloween Thrift Haul
Did anyone else notice the 118 calls and 138 messages ?! Safiya what?? Lmao
Dress historian Abby Cox mentioned you on her channel. She previously worked at Colonial Williamsburg and would love to go there with you to show you around. Also, she said she would love to make a gown for you. That would be a fun collab for post-COVID-19 times. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBCwxd48lHc   time stamp-16:21
Any one else notice that safyia's house looks a lot like Jenna marble's house
Me whenever I buy something stupid on Amazon “tHe InTeRnEt MaDe Me BuY iT!”
Why why do you have 138 messages
Safiya with pink hair, that's it, that's the comment
okay, but all of these maks really worked with the 'fits
Last outfit take away the jeans and maybe put that black skirt with powerpuff shirt and it would be totally cute
23:41 SHES SO GORGEOUS OMG
Honey also works on Hot Topic for all the people who are alt.
Rogue +wolf is on my shop tab
okay but can i get those masks??? anyone know the brand?
I would have guessed pastel goth.
Do a collab with Abby Cox!! She wants to take you to colonial williamsburg!
i like how you almost said i like myself T-T
Why not try rogue+wolf clothes ? Xx
23:51 really missed a there’s a bee in my bonnet joke :(
Ahhhh yes i would love to buy a nayeon and chaeyoung
the witch one honestly did something. the whole ensemble looked so amazing on you!! they all looked really good tho!
Where’s that mask with embroidered flowers on it from its so cute?!!!
I was literally screaming at her, “you need a hoop skirt”
Can we talk about miss Nygaard's phone background? What is that?
girl you were really serving that colonial look when the bonnet came off whewww
"She's a WIATCHH"
Your insta shop tab looks like my pinterest feed
"Go to colonial Williamsburg in that" "Normal Williamsburg then" Ahh yes, as someone living in normal Williamsburg I can attest that in the 21st century everyone definitely walks around like that...  If they're as cool as soph! :D
Saf tuck the straps into the ring so that they fall under the skirt. Then you won't have nipple tassles.
The second filming location looked just like Jenna and Julien's house
Pretty sure at least some of the yelling was my fellow costuming nerds who are still sad about Ren Faire getting cancelled
Your colonial butter churning outfit reminds me of a "Whose Line is it Anyway" skit where Colin Mochri was wearing a black bonnet saying "I will churn thy butter" 😂
Tip from a Londoner, Minga is probably pronounced with a soft G, not a hard G, like Ming-ah, seeing as minging or minger is a British, and especially London, slang term for someone or something who is ugly or gross.
Soft girls that what u prob thinking of
OMG I WANT THE WITCH OUTFIT
What if Safiya just ends up dead one day and it really WAS Marky giving her that ZUCC
Bruh, when it cut back to her with her haul I deadass thought she was in Jenna marbles house
Feeling sad that I can’t afford that pink jacket ngl lol
You have to check out ABBY COX's channel and do a Colonial Williamsburg visit together!
Safiyas explore page HAS exposed her and told me everything about her.
that ppg shirt has their cannon teenage "forms"  it was in a ep.
i love the second outfit. and it looks extra cute with the black mask. i didn't notice that the skirt was like a nipple tassel until she pointed it out! Those jeans in the last outfit look amazing!!
Your house looks like Jenna Marbles' house... or am I losing my mind?
u filming from this part of ur house reminds me of jenna :(
I really love the black mask, does anyone recognize it as being from somewhere so I can get one?
She looks so good in the witch outfit
"I wear my heart on my sleeve ha. Ah ah" lol reminds me of Nadja from What We Do In The Shadows I love that show and I know you will too
hey... the buttergirl actually worked on ya
not me finding out youre a kpop stan through thus
Why did she say she uploaded a new video today if this is 5 days old?
i love your videos!
EGirl more like safgirl
The way they said Oregon lol. Had me rolling!!!!
okay wait i really love the witch outfit and it really suits safiya so much
Girl omg you look amazing in the second one 😍❤️
Wow, Mia Maples did this first! :o
Just FYI safiya, I wouldn't be recommending Honey as a browser extension. Amazon identified it as  malware and I don't think that a service collecting data on shopping preferences with credit card information being handled in the same transaction is the wisest sponsor you could take. Yes, it apparently saves people money,  but how then are they making money off their users? DATA. nothing is good and free anymore except our natural spaces,  and even that is disappearing through climate change!  So please,  reevaluate your sponsorship with them.
The pink wig would have looked good on the witch outfit
Instead of e girl, maybe soft girl ?
Love the wig on you! Nice video!♡
Never in my life would I have ever thought that i would see Saf wearing pink
10:47 is that a version of the Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge album cover?.. Or is that just a coincidence? Eh, either way, we stan
Loved all the outfits! Felt like I was looking at the pure form of sides of your personality. Like when Raven split into all the sides of herself in teen Titans (not Go the original cartoon)!
Cheru-BUM!
the “not an e-girl” one is just called the Y2K aesthetic i’m pretty sure!
The witch outfit is CUTE OMG
😂😦did anyone notice that she had 138 text messages!?
the HARD mortica addams vibes at the beginning of the video is everything
The music that started at 15:27 gave me hardcore nostalgia for The Real Slim Shady wow
I love the jacket and the wig is amazing!
please try resin art give me a like so Sofiya can see my comment, please
Totally spies were better than kim possible, you can't change my mind
Omg Safiya you look like the grown up version of Stephanie from Lazy Town with that “E-girl” look
I mean..i loooooved the jeans on you
Guys...I KNOW her. Sammi Sweetheart. Her dad is our flippin neighbor!
love the back shoes and pink jacket!!!!
During the shopping scene, I thought I was going to hate the third outfit but I actually really liked it.
it looks to me like those williamsburg skirts don't have as much volume as the photos, meaning they might not be wide enough to put the right size hoop skirt in.   I wonder if they're using someone else's images and ripping off the designs?
The pastel fashion is called “soft girl aesthetic” but a little more 2000s  This is coming from very cool hip 13 year  old
You look good in everything
Is saf getting skinnier?
Instagram: are you a witch or a civil war re-enacter...?  Safiya: yes.
So no one is talking about how her house looks SO SIMILAR to JENNA MARBLES HOUSE
The lolita shop tab is gorgeous
i love your wallpaper it looks great
I think you're suppose to tuck in the ends through the hoop on the suspender skirt!
A cool thing with the suspender skirt is that if you don't like wearing the straps, you can just have them hanging at the side and it's still a really good look.
As a child of the 90s, them jean cuffs are rolled wrong! lol
okay totally not the point of this video, but Tyler has IBS??! I do too and found it weirdly comforting to hear that, because so few people in the public eye have it(or speak up about) despite how common it is! It’s the little things🥰
I am the among us guy
Hello
You look like Marina from Marina and The Diamonds with the pink wig on, I like it.
I mean that pink was more soft girl but still cute
I love the Witch outfit. I have to get that shirt now.
Tried this. My instagram shopping page is birkenstocks, athletic wear, down coats and knives. And now I don't know.
Oregon = Or ehh gen
She looks really good with the pink wig
Do tiktok too 😆
She was feeling that black out fit and I love it too
As we are all want to do 😁
I'm definitely NOT inspired by Sammi "Sweetheart"
Safiya, where did you get that black top with white flowery details you were wearing while unboxing the items? It is so cute. I love it! Pls. Answer. Thank you in advance!
Just me that doesnt have the magical shop tab 🤔
Kintsugi !!!  I’d love to see you smash stuff then fix it 🤍
@23:54 you had a western vibe to it.
Do you know that minga means weenie in spanish? At least in Spain. I cant stop laughing XD
I love how you know the American Girl Dolls
ok but like how do you pronounce Oregon??
She should turn into an Instagram baddie ! <3
Psveur is a bootleg brand that has ripped off multiple peoples' designs 😶
OMG! Tyler cracks the best 1 liners!
Honestly, you have the same body type as me and if gives me so much confidence to try new cuts and types of clothing!
where she was sitting for the “egirl@ unboxing - looked like jennas “set” like where she’s make the paintings n stuff.
As someone who uses wigs (in cosplays), that wig looked awesome!! I might me biased though, because that wig is exactly what my real hair currently looks like 😋 Also, I will steal the term  "diet goth" as that's my style too ^^
The intro she looked like someone from the Adams family😂😂😂
Anyone else notice that Safiyas house and Jenna Marbles house is like ... the same?
Anyone else just waiting for a Franken-tea or Franken-coffee video? She's got the perfect mug for it, now!
Okay I’m 3 minutes in but I have to just say you are serving a young, color tv version of morticia addams and I am LIVING for it
Love see your videos again guys
Ok, you gotta give Tyler credit: “memes of production” is a 10/10 SOLID quip😂😂😂
i feel like safiya looks sooo much better without makeup im not saying that oh girls should be natrual type stuff i just love how clear her skin is
I have to giggle at the way she pronounced ‘minga’ hahaha
she looks so good her skin is glowing
hey safiya have you seen boku no hero accademia
I think you're supposed to put the flappy bits on the suspenders into the loops.
I love the way saf introduces her every video you can tell she’s put a lot of effort in each of her videos ❤️
@safiya nygaard - girl, I need to know where I can get those MAGIC stars you've got under your eyelashes?! Please and thanks?!
Omg the pink outfit is my favorite!!!!! Because so much nostalgia and pink. It's just so different!
Two things; i wanna know where she got that flowery top from the unboxing section, and two: i need those boots in my life.
KAROL BASKIN KILLED HER HUSBAND WHACKED HIM
Bonnet = Felicity No bonnet = Joan Baez
I'm here to comment. I'm here to say that I love you saying a word "Okay".
Okay all the looks kinda slapped
She looks like Lava Girl with that wig! 💕
31:08 tailor is so supportive he knows how to handle everything 😊
So glad you are posting videos again. I love the Oregon Trail joke when Tyler mentions he has IBS. My husband also would likely die of dysentery on the Oregon Trail.
18:15 her natural skin is so beautiful she doesn't need that tans of makeup😍
Safiya is totes a "Gothic Civil War Witch, reenactor" 🤣💓😘
Gosh I love the flower blouse she wore when unboxing the boots 😍😍 this shirt is so damn cute
As a Virginian who lives less than an hour from Colonial Williamsburg; The Virginia joke was pretty on point lol
18:14 - "Many Months Later"  !!???!!! Sorry sister but I am a Prime child.  If it does not come in two days, a week at the latest, I am outta' here. The pink outfit is fine particularly if you want to go out and not be recognized.  We would all be, "Hey, in another light that could be Safiya."
Genuine question - why does she upload so rarely now, I think there's someting I must have missed, didn't she upload once a week earlier?
Safiya, just wanted to let you know that what you refer to as the "e-girl" look is better known as the "soft girl" look! You can actually search Youtube for "how to look like a soft girl" and it'll show you even more examples. But it is exactly as you described it, a girly 90s nostalgia throwback that zoomed in on the pastel trends going on at the time.
I really love the wig on Safiya, and Tyler did a good job, it looks more natural than most I've seen
PLEASE try clothing from Shein!!! I see it all over social media but I would love to see what you think of them!
I think what you're calling "e-girl" vibes is actually VSCO girl vibes.
Saf, wow just realized you have 9MILL followers now.....YOU GO GIRL!!
Cottagecore vibesss
Wow, Minga, that's terrible branding right there... Spanish speakers (not sure if all) will understand :'D
The neighborhood they shot the milkmaid outfits at seems like the one from bestdressed video
Saf with e-girl makeup looks so good! And the wig is cute too
you looked totally badass in that all black outfit!!!   As a lunar witch I welcome you to the witch community XD
9:46
I LOVE THAT WIG ON YOU!!!!!!!
I don't know about you Saf but I LOVE the pink one!! I would rock that and the skirt with suspenders! :D
I never feel so proud to live in Colonial Williamsburg than when I watch Safiya
Minga Is ming like ring. Not minger like finger tehe
Those outfits that you thought where E-girl, where actually softgirl outfits😊
Oh that pink cropped jacket is tooo good to ignore😃🥰
There's nothing in my shop tab I wanna buy 🙆‍♀️🤷‍♀️
Pink coat white crop top looks great on you..
Hey Safiya! I don't work at Colonial Williamsburg myself, but I live in Williamsburg and I THINK I have a family friend that does! I'll check in on this for you and see if I can't get someone to contact you for your dream vid (LOL).
Honestly the jeans look so strange in the front buuutttt the overall fit wasn't bad
Saf should do Hocus Pocus looks cuz the voice was on point ngl
Oh gosh, watching Safiya wearing the prairie dress was perfect.  I could not stop laughing, that was fantastic.  Love you Safiya!
the amount of TWICE in here is 👌
The catcalls in the first outfit just goes to show that covering up or wearing  different clothes does not prevent catcalls
Omg I've miss this vídeos 😍
https://youtu.be/UZ1rwdrATFw funny
11:40.. OMG see her phone's wallpaper.🧐
I am the new generation but I feel like a boomer
Some say that wigs are part of the trend because they do look nice, I remember someone wearing one and she looked great
THE TWICE VIDEOS ON HER EXPLORE PAGE AHSKAJKSJSKS
0:40 Safiya's Instagram has a twice in it.....
This video make me want to buy in the instagram too but im poor and I'm just a kid so yeah 🇵🇭❤️❤️
Its all good thanks Tyler
Sisters tonight we fly! Thank you safiya mom and dad for safiya.
I love that you showed off all these small businesses, especially in the instagram scrolling! Also, webster wigs is amazing good choice! They are a lovely company :)
A challenge for you: find a video in this channel without safiya in the thumbnail
Safiya you look like Mortician Addams with the long hair😍
When you bought the non-e-girl outfit I was like „ahhhh does this really work together?“ but as soon as you put it on (and questioned it lol) I fell in LOVE this outfit gives me everything!!!!!!
I think that the vid was too long so it took me 3 days to watch it as a whole
Saf lost heaps of weight or is it just me?
Kpop stan me saw chaeyoung (Twice) and was like “OMG CHAEYOUNG BDZ”
Regarding “Colonial Williamsburg,” if you don’t know Townsend and Sons’ channel, I think you would love it. It has a great 17th-18th century focus.
Put the excess strap through the rings then you‘ll have no „flappage“ ;)
Thank uuuuuuu for uploading. No one's quite as spicifically entertaining as u.
the pink wig didnt really look best with your skintone though if you dye most of it black with keep some pink streaks i think it will look better.
Holy shit the black witch outfit with the mask is a LEWWKK!!! Absolute fire
I actually roller skate   I have 2 gold medals  I'm on my grandpa's account
Wait, are you in Jenna's house?
Did anyone else cry a little when they said "Or-e-gone" instead of "Or-e-gun"
See im glad i saw this because i was wondering about the shop tab that appeared out of nowhere and wanted to buy some stuff but didn't trust it. U always coming through.
IBS gang where you at 😂😂😂
Safiya, please, we need the Bernadette collab
Only youtubers who's 40 minute video I'll watch no questions asked
"50% angel, 50% devil!" Omggg im getting old lmao
Is minga London meant to be pronounced ming-a? Like minging? Like the slang for nasty/gross? I’m English FYI
YOU'RE SO PRETTY IN EVERYTHINNNGG
"skirt-erall....overskirt" safiya....baby.... pinafore
Saf and tyler remind me of gomez and morticia but silly af instead of stoic
WHY DID YOU SAY OREGON LIKE THAT
Very good webesode. You're the best host on the Internet, Sofiya. Keep up the excellent work. Hi Tyler!
You look like a pirate without the bonnet!!
Wasn't the shop tab always there?
The second set up giving me major Jenna Marbles
Me who lives near Williamsburg confused at first why she said colonial 🥴😂 ( it’s not exactly the nicest area in va )
okay but Safiya's feed is just twice and I love it
Your looking fabulousin these outfits especially the black one what is suggestion from my side you should try something you haven't tried like Indian wear like saree
Their house has the exact same layout as jenna and juliens lolol
Cristine would be proud of me, first thing on my shop tab is TEA 🤣
omg she’s a once <333333
The town I live in is three miles south of the California town that nearly changed its' name to Got Milk, CA.  Also, I graduated from 8th grade in 1976, so I have seen ALL the colonial costumes over the years.  Virtually EVERYONE had a colonial costume.  Also, I can attest that 70's jeans, which were ALWAYS skin tight, DID, in fact, crawl up CONSTANTLY.  Camel toe was a REAL problem for those of us who had to lie down to zip our jeans, at least the first time we put them on after washing.  Of course, there were people who rather enjoyed it, like ALL the straight men and lesbian women, but some of the women did, too!  I had a friend who could sit on the bus on her way to or from anywhere and sit on that seam just right and have orgasms all the way to her destination!  Weird, I know, but she was an odd bird.  I suppose she'd be called a pan-sexual today.  Everything turned her on.
Fashion sites have zero idea what the heck punk is
I'm glad you thought the last look was E-girl! I love your makeup! I feel like you were too worried about it girl 💖  Also, the Powerpuff girl top with your shoulders showing is smoking HOT!!
Where can I get the couch? Anyone else obsessed ?
Woah! Safiya's glass skin is so beautiful!
Who’s sammie sweetheart ?
shouldn’t the black skirt’s straps have been tucked into the metal rings
At 3:55 it recommends the Bernadette Edwardian Oxford from American Duchess and I'm dying to know how that came to be.
Honey doesn’t work anymore :(
You know my phone is the love of my life if it doesn't even know what I wear I'd be insulted
You do look good in the pink hair 💗 as beautiful as ever just brighter lol 😆
Omggggg stop lol the last outfit is not a egirl outfit its a soft girl outfit!!!!!!!!!!
Idky but with the mask the pastel look looks a bit like trying not to be supper draggy drag.
You should do a collab with moriah Elisabeth even tho you guys are nothing alike
The second outfit feels like it fits the fashion of Japan tiktoks
12:37 The font for witch is used on the cover of a very transphobic book that says that a person who practices whichcraft can only be a "biological female". I, as a nonbinary witch, just wants to bring awareness to that issue.
I think with the pastel look maybe it was the make up being too bold in the opposite direction that threw it off. I found myself either looking at the pinkness or your eye brows. But overall I liked the look even though it's very different from your usual.
I’m obsessed with Saf in the pink wig omg
you look so pretty with pink hair!!!!
We love the twice things on here Instagram, Chaeyong and Nayeon 💗🙈
why you in jenna marbles house
Video idea: buying items from small businesses and similar items from mass production companies....or something about small businesses!!   (The Peache Shoppe on Facebook. Saf, please lemme make you stuff 🥺🥺)
that wig is everything
I actually really like the milkmaid shirt haha
honestly, I like how the pink wig looks on you. same with the jacket.
You could do a decorative lace up for the extra long ties on your boots?
this chick is super cute... and she would make a great Morticia from Adams Family.  Even her accent would go perfectly.
Did you and tyler move into a house? The background kind of looks like Jenna Marbles (I miss that lady) house. Is there a video of you in this house? I love this video and haven't noticed the shop tab on instagram at all. I think pink in clothing looks great on you but pink hair no, I think the pink hair washes out your skin and makes you look paler than what you are, if it was a more darker pink on the wig it would have looked so good.
Or-gone... *Sighs in Oregon*
Have you tried cosplaying? You definitely should, you can be any character so there’s plenty of options.
This skirt is backwards the zip is in the front bc you wouldn’t want someone to be able to pull the zip down
💕🦇💕🦇💕🦇💕🦇
okay but like safiya is literally robin in friends 😽😔
Please wear Cottage Core for the week
oh my god I haven't been on this channel in almost a year- that intro sent me into nostalgia of freshman year, bringing cup oats to school every morning, and watching a video while eating my oats and studying for whatever test I had that day. Glad to be back 💛
We need a house tour!!❤️😌
“We’re not there yet” YET SHE SAID YET YALL
Loved this video😂
NOT THE TWICE POSTS-
“I got 3 looks, 3 looks, 3 looks...”
I dont know why but your voice is just so soothing and i feel safe and at home when i watch your videos i feel like your my mom
The most relatable comment that was made for all married couples was when safia was talking about her breath smelling terrible and tyler replied with "yea, it's not great."😂😂😂
The skirt on the goth look is hella cute.
I adore how Tyler is always laughing in the background encouraging her and thinking she’s hilarious. ❤️❤️
Destroy every mug in ur house and glue them back together... as one whole mug
I can't exactly pinpoint why, but I really enjoyed the model pose at 33:45 of the necklace.
I adore you, you also have the strange ability to make me shop.I just wish Tyler would stop interjecting and only talk when he is on camera.
This is the most we’ve ever gotten fed. Thank you! 💚
the wig looks great.
My mom also has IBS
I think you had to tuck the ends back into the little hoops 27:18
Oh my gosh Safiya I thought the jeans looked so good!!  I think they were the perfect mom jean fit where they're tight in the right places while also being a looser fit, I loved them!
Saf trying to figure out what an egirl is just cues the "I've connected the dots" "you haven't connected shit" "I've connected them
“Ore -gone”😂 I love hearing others pronounce my state😂❤️
Oh my god this was hilarious!!
off topic but your hair looks so silky
She’s the Unproblematic Shane Dawson
The witch outfit screams Corrine from theadbanger to me
You always wear black also I’m not judging u you look good anyways
omg hi nayeon hi chaeyoung hi mina hi tzuyu
6:30 don't feel too bad I'm bad at skating too 😂last year I subluxated my knee cap roller skating so I decided I'm never doing it again
Please Pleaseeeee tell me where you got the flower mask  🙏  I love it!
Connect the dots between the recommendations: Victorian/Colonial + Goth + e-girl/pastel = Pastel goth
Love your vids and keep being you and us fans out here love ya and you inspire me. Keep up the good work and don’t let the COVID-19 break you. It might be rough but u have managed to go this far and you can continue going on. Keep doing what you do and have a good day, year, month, idk what ever the people these days say. U INSPIRE US SAFIYA AND WE ALL LOVE YA. 😊 {I am sending this to many great, awesome youTubers please reply if you see one}
I love the pink hair.
The "e-girl" outfit with the wig is actually more y2k. Y2k takes more elements from the 90s/2000s
As a witch I approve of the witchy clothes
Yeah.... you caught me
Although she hasnt really done anything personally, this girl is prime example of why creativity is being switch for quick and easy content for a quick buck on YouTube. She is so user friendly that Youtube pumps her vids all day everyday on suggested instead of content creators who invent or do cool and hard videos but might not be user friendly. This is why i dont watch these creators. Just came on here to tell those who dont know.
Love the pink hair. And I think the eye brows not matching is ok. Looks better
DYSENTERY’S GOING AROUND THESE PARTS. Better watch out...it could kill anyone of your family
i swear i seen this video months ago, same video and all but it was posted 4 days ago😳
Saf I think you're looking for the term soft girl instead of e-girl. Lmao I love this video🤪
bro safiya lowkey had a mini glow up
Safiya I need to know which Kpop groups you Stan!!!
Giving me Morticia Addams realness
19:58 no one going to talk about this hahaha
OMGGG Safiya!!! You never put new shoes on the table!!!! that's legit worse than walking under a ladder. =O
The witch outfit gave you a gorgeous silhouette!! Extremely beautiful on you! :)
Every east coast kid growing up has been to Colonial Williamsburg 😂 I use to have Chorus competitions there too.
Not to be that gal but your house looks a lil like Jennas 😳
I want the masks!!
I literally thought you were at Jenna marbles house
The "e-girl" look is more of a soft-girl look
i really like how her youtube videos feel like episodes
The wig looks super good! And it’s a lace front, which look more natural and typically are way more expensive. But you guys put it on super well!
Honestly Saf is working that pink outfit 💕💕
The second outfit suits her so muchhh
YOURE A ONCE???
Id say that the pink look is like a weird indie style soft girl look, tbh
I want that jacket and they don’t sell it anymore 🥺 so sad! I love it!
I think the "egirl" outfit would be more cohesive if you styled the wig better. Maybe a similar hairstyle to your kpop makeover video :)
I love how she uses the intro audio to these types of videos that the random dude made her. Only OG's would know.
Abby Cox mentioned she would make a 18th century costume for you to wear to Colonial Williamsburg if you guys collab...
I love the e-girl look!!! And I think they do wear that
mia maples did this in april no hate just information :)
HOLY SHIT U LOOK JUST LIKE OLD SCHOOL MARINA DIAMANDIS IN THE PINK WIG
girl, that PPG top is HIDEOUS!
Does anybody else appreciate how she matched her masks to her outfits as much as I do?!? (Like if u do;)
This video was so fun, but just a heads up you're mispronouncing Oregon. Not Or-Gone...closer to Or-gun. Sincerely, an Oregonian
I love the pink wig on you.. and the face mask with it was a cherry on top
You look so cute in pink 🥰
Hey
That Josephina reference took me wayyyyy back
that close is not e girl it's soft girl!
looks like jennas house ?!?!??
Ohh now honey has her I mean mr beast is going crazy
Crush every mug into a powder and then use a mug mold and clear acrylic to make a frankincenmug
is youtube not working for anyone else??
I been trying to see the video on my phone and laptop & it says “something went wrong tap to retry “ but it lets me see other videos
Is it just or is the video not working? It keeps saying an error has occurred no matter how many times I refresh and it doesn't work either if I use other browsers.
Ughhh it won’t play
Oof my internet's having a hard time loading this video 😭
Missed you guys...glad to see you are back. Love you nuggets
R
now THAT'S referencing e-girl fashion RESPECTFULLY
This video is unavailable
I was scared for the wig. The wig turned out fine. Cosplayers approval
Where did you get your black mask?? It looks like it fits so well! I need!
I learn so many new words every time I watch a Safiya video🤓
The pink out fit it just too much I love pink but all that is just to much
for your own education you have to do an egirl  video now
I miss the old intro☹️
Twice on her explore page😄
Her explore page is full of Twice content~ she’s a secret Once haha
I love a lot of the stuff you bought! I think the shoelaces may be meant to wrap around your legs since they're so long! Also love the witch shirt, but I'd probably take a seam ripper to the 'witch' embroidery to take it out! XD Love the sleeves and heart tho!
so Safiya stans TWICE, taste
Safiya! I heard that you watch or watched Supernatural! Have you seen any of the new episodes and do you ship Destiel???
I loved outfit 2 so much I asked for all the items for Christmas including those epic shoes. Except the t shirt with the cutout heart no longer exists on that website and instead of the black skirt I found a plaid mini skirt with black suspenders. In place if they shirt I found a black long sleeve t shirt with shoe laces on the shoulders showing some skin♥️
Where did you get that wig, I want it!!!
"the beginnings of a camel toe" ... is that a graphic novel or naughty movie title? 🤣🤣🤣
Try tucking the flaps of the black skirt into the rings of the suspenders
Giving me morticia Addams vibes
Please do more Colonial videos making butter and cheese etc
I hope you have a wig brush, for all of the money you spent on that wig it’s worth it
when you live in colonial williamsburg lol
0:41 SAFIYA IS A ONCE
The wig isn't bad actually- *imma little jelly cuz i want that to cosplay*
Safiya sitting at her island is giving me major Jenna Marble’s videos vibes😢 24:12
i actually love the "e girl" outfit it is so cute
You guys are adorable 💞
"either a witch or Civil War reenactor" My future self is yelling
I feel like I’ve never seen Saf wear colors.
saf: "her chain is up her butt crack" tyler: "it has a skull though"  this made me laugh so hard just cuz he ignores it😂 idky
I would love to know where saf bought the shirt she is wearing when unboxing. It’s lovely
Why did i just now realize at the ending of the video that shes trying out a middle part
The pink look reminds me of Carie from Julie and the Phantoms.... just me ok   🖐😭
Video suggestion: Recreating Disney princesses’ outfit to be accurate with their persona/time period.   This idea is based off a video “series” by another youtuber named Mina Le called “Rating Disney Princess Dresses on Historical Accuracy”.
I’m most impressed by specifically knowing the American girl doll names dressed for that time period.
Anyone else notice how they moved into the same exact house as Jenna and Julian. Except Jenna’s is nicer because he is as a wine room😹
I missed this song
I was watching this with my 2 year old, and every time you showed the colonial outfit she kept calling you a princess 😂😂❤️
I *love* that witch shirt! And that whole outfit. This was great fun to watch!
I’m strangely uncomfortable of the background change without much mention 😅
Wait she’s onto something! The women in 1800 churning butter were the first to throw it back! 😦
25:35 "I'm more like diet goth, comfortable vampire, this is like WITCH" 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Paused to go follow the enchanted bikini IG stat!! No association, just mind blown!
The witch outfit is soooo good
Do you guys not know how to say Oregon...? Wtf.
Lmfao twice, itzy and Jennie on her explorer page tho
lmao her phone background 💀😂 11:37
You and Tyler have the best vibe. Love your videos.. need these in my life. 😁👍
never give permanent feelings to a temporary person  😏💥💥💥  https://youtu.be/tqBTGJ3FXRE
as a william and mary student i would be SO EXCITED if you came to colonial williamsburg
I lost it at "my fresh cream brings all the boys to the yard"😂😂😂
I love the e-girl outfit
*sees a tzuyu dance the night away fancam*  Me at 3am: 123 LETS GO LETS DANCE THE NIGHT AWAYYYYYY
It's nice to see someone else who thought e-girls were pink.
y is nobody talking abt it???  HOUSETOUR,HOUSETOUR,HOUSETOUR,HOUSETOUR,HOUSETOUR.......PLS PLS PLS PLS ✌✌✌😇😇😇😇
how did i never notice this feature?! like it’s right there
Tyler did a great job with that wig!
Anyone else notice she got a new phone rip old phone
also..pls do a one woman macbeth show
Off topic u look rlly good
Saf the colonial outfit *is* neat...but it's not versatile. lol
colonial williamsburg vid 2k20
The pink wig looks amazing on you thoooo 🙌🏻🥰

I think ur natural hair would balance the pink from the jacket out cuz right now its all pink and the jeans do seem a bit tight, but overall its not a bad look and I just love love this jacket. It would look so cool with a black dress underneath
The girl-e-girl outfit
I love everything about this <3
Anyone know where I can find the mask from the first outfit? 💕
The American girl reference was spot on!
speaking of Josefina, Saf, can u do a "dress like an American Girl" video?
It's pronounced Ory-gun. There's no "E" at the end.  Great video though 😊
Safiya's house looks a LOT like Jenna Marble's house... 🧐
You can hear how in love Tyler is by the laughter on thr goth outfit . Also the goth putfit edit she just looks amazing
I'm pretty sure the pink and stuff is actally pastel goth witch is my style
Look its the top three types of lesbians. Cottage core, goth, and soft uwu.
Hi I’m a historic clothing geek and no offense I’m triggered. Safiya please don’t go to Williamsburg in that one outfit. It’s more civil war so go Gettysburg in that and get a colonial dress for Williamsburg please.
I think this is the most successful ‘___ Pick’ video. She look good in those 3 looks. And the stuff she got, almost all of them, seems legit and good quality. IG shop got it right
Spiders and centipedes HATE the smell of peppermint! Not only is the smell enough to keep them away from your home, but coming into contact with the oil burns them. They will retreat immediately!
There's a doll with my name what the hell 😂😂
You should do a draw my life
Lmaoo i didn't realize until the end of the video but that top is an Omighty ripoff. Like they didn't even bother to remove the Omighty logo from the graphic
Ok but the pink wig reminds me of Rydel Funk(maiden name Lunch. Sister of ross lynch)
I was a pre-teen when Jersey Shore was popular. Jay-wow was my favorite
The first look combined with 2020 pandemic world is so handmaid's tale
I could watch Safiya churn butter all day
Its the gamer girl fit
Safiya is slowly becoming Morticia's look alike 😍
that memes of production joke was top tier
Everyone is talking abt other things , but..... IS SHE A FAN OF TWICE ? 😳
Stick the flap inside the rings 😳
She rlly said softe girl
https://youtu.be/V-CpzdfvfjM
I love how her explore basically bombarded by K-Pop stuff
I think you would be good friends with Caitlin Doughty - Ask a mortician. Ya'll have similar vibes.
You are beautiful Sophia ❤️
You guys say Oregon wrong
Soft girl safiya soft girl
Seraphine, hello ?   . .  Hello?
Shop tab. Goes straight to instagram. 🥰 Edit - shop tabs looks totally diff, Maybe cause in europe.  But I bought something 😂👌
Lol it's so interesting to try to figure out how the algorithm works. "i followed a wedding account so it must be time for a baby account next"
you remind me of Marina and the Diamonds with the pink outfit
I love the witchy boots. I already have the perfect  stary black velvet dress with mesh long sleeves to got with it.
Yes! Safiya’s intro song!!!! I love it so much
ok, so parts of this video are making me think that Saf needs to collab with some of the CosTubers, like Costuming Drama, Bernadette Banner, Abby Cox, Morgan Donner
The last one would have been amazing if you just had the wig or just had the jacket, with both I think it’s too much pink in one place
I wanna be a gender fluid e-girl
I wanna be a gender fluid e-girl
I love her long hair 💜
*me on break at my job at Hot Topic, hearing Saf mention Hot Topic* : :)
Ore - gone
hii
E-girl is just our Scene Kids.
0:36 i spy TWICE 👀
petition for safyia to make a video on colonial Williamsburg
At 10:51 I really really REALLY love that halloween dress!
20:28 I dressed like it was 1777.
Just waiting for the historical fashion people to start yelling about the absence of stays
1:34  She looks like Morticia Addams, doesn't she?
Why do you say "Oregone" instead of "Oregen"
i think the pink wig suits you when you have that pink jacket on otherwise.. maby no? :D
Baby things are advertised to young women as a general demographic.
oh no... please don’t say or-gone...
11:07 at the start of the video in got a lily Singh ad 💀
Anyone remember when she said she wouldn't use the intro song. But I guess she is 😂
The full goth witch outfit if my fav honestly
safiya has an only fans? I mean.... 👀
Tryin to catch me churnin curdy...🤷‍♀️  I'll leave now.
Love the wig on you! But he's right, you're eyebrows are a bit weird beside them 😂
Ur skin is glowing 😻 Share ur beauty routine/ skin care ❤️
wrap your celestial boots laces around your ankle twice before you tie and you won't have that problem they'll also look a little extra witchy.
I'd wear the in your face witch outfit
The e-girl thing was more of a soft girl look
The pink outfit is more of an soft girl
I feel like I’ve seen that Powerpuff Girl artwork before ages ago online and I wonder if that shop was stealing artwork for their products.
I’m so late 😢
I don't feel like scrolling through the comments, but are you filming in Jenna Marbles house? Did you buy her house?
You can get rid of the little floppy tassels on that cute skirt just by touching them underneath the large rings and then literally just took them straight so they lay down properly underneath your skirt and nobody will see them. But that outfit looked amazing on you I mean all of them looked so good on you but I just like I wish you would liked it more because like it looked so good on you!
Have you considered shopping small businesses?
I kinda want to see what it would look like with all the outfits mixed together- like the colonial blouse with the goth skirt, maybe with the pink wig? I think it would work XD
if you quit the wig tcute he e-girl ish outfit will look so freaking
Everyone has a chapter they don't read out lead , be lucky to feel it https://youtu.be/tqBTGJ3FXRE
Is your house like the same exact layout of Jenna Marbles? Or is this just what all houses in LA look like?
how come Saf is wearing a mask in open spaces when there's nobody around lol
Love the wig!!!
anyone sled notice that twice and bp are just all over her explore page ?  no just me ok
Aw Safiya (and Tyler) you both seemed to be more settled and happier during this video and I am here for it 💕🖤
i think you look really cute from behind in the pink outfit
The all black outfit is so cute! The sleeves, the silhouette, the shoes! All so cute!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBCwxd48lHc&ab_channel=AbbyCox Abby Cox would totally take you to Colonial Williamsburg!!
I think that third style is part of pastel goth / kawaii goth so maybe that's why you got it
Aloha ears! I love them!
How does no one talk about how her skin is literally glowing?? It's so pretty!
i love that jacket
when she said the last one was not cohesive but I dress like that: 👁️👄👁️  SHE LOOKS SO PRETTYYYY THO
Can you make like a Frankenstein soap
She said "minga" heeheeeheeeheeheeeeeeee (yes, I speak Spanish and I am 10 years old in my mind)
On loop, Can't get over this 🙈 https://youtu.be/tqBTGJ3FXRE
Please make a house tour
she thought e-girl was the fashion that i've started calling "sanriocore without the mental illness" or basically, early 2000s but make it actually wearable
I loved this so much!!! ❤️❤️❤️ But also how much we’re the shoes in U.S. dollars??
MY GOSH SAF YOU LOOK SO GOOD IN THE SECOND OUTFIIIIIITTT IM DYINGGGG
Y2K 💗
That frankenmug idea at the end 😂😂😂 gold xx
I really loved how the second look looked on u omg
Safiya you need to do a dressing in bright colors for a week or blindfolded picking outfits and wearing them in public
I’m on the shop tab all the time it an diction
I love your cat I bet my cats would get along so well with crusty🥰🐈
Absolutely love the pink hair and pink jacket on your for a pop of color! It makes your eyes pop.
About the butter churning: check out Polands 2014 Eurovision song "We are slavic". I was so innocent before I saw that the first time...
You should try a white or black long top with the pink jacket, velvet skirt and moon boots ♥♥♥
The pink wig is everything on you!
Love you in the pink wing!
I so wanted to see you blend outfits at the end! I think the white blouse, with the black "skirterall", with the pink cropped jacket, with the moon boots would look amazing!!! (playing paperdolls in real life!)
At this point, we're just watching Safiya do her regular shopping
The not e-girl outfit was my favorite ngl 🙈
I love the pink wig!
Is she in jenna marbles house? 😅 it looks same
0:36 the TASTE (blackpink, twice, itzy)
Do a trying on wigs video. Trying to make them work for beginners!! Plz!!
Without the bonnet ,you look like Hailee Steinfield in Dickinson.
I live in Williamsburg lmao
it really bothered me how she didnt just tuck the skirt-erall straps through and under the rings, like that wouldve solved both of the issues she had with it??
Safiya says cohesively and my science obsessed self is screaming behind my computer lol
You nailed the e-girl soft girl outfit!!!
On tiktok please go through the fyp and the first few “small businesses” videos you see, BUY THEIR STUFF (:!
Why does her background look like Jenna marbles living room
Why does her background look like Jenna marbles living room
HOW TO FIX IT!  The Punk Rave clothing dress - you could have put the "tassel" that was awkwardly hanging on your boobs, back through the ring that was underneath it! Then the "tassel" would have been tucked inside your dress....does that make sense??
Saf with pink hair!!!! In love omg
Safiyas skin is just WOW!! She’s always had beautiful skin but she is absolutely luminous DAMN
The "witch" outfit is fantastic!
The trick to memorizing what e-girl means is to think of the e as in "Emo". E-girls look a lot like what emo girls looked like in the 2000's, even if the "E" doesn't stand for "emo", I'm pretty sure any emo girl would have been an e-girl if not a millenial, but a Gen Z.
That shop tab has been there for a year or two now lol
Please drop your skin care routine!
I loved the historically inspired look!! As a self-proclaimed historical costumer I am, though, a little sad about the lack of proper underpinnings. A corset, though important to the look, is of course quite expensive and might need to be custom made, but a proper chemise and a petticoat/crinoline cage would have improved your silhouette by a lot. Just a heads up if you're planning on wearing the fit again :)
It’s always fun when people watch the Jersey shore 😂 do have to say though, as a Jersey girl almost no one in Jersey (the whole state) talks like they do
Omg the spiderweb yoga pants!!! 😍😍😍😍
I love the Williamsburg outfit!! I want to run the penny candy store, while you churn. You should buy frankenmug x make candles in them. 🖤
I'm wearing my black sock. Hopefully, it wont get too moist. x
"Kind of like a prairie dress look.." she keeps dodging cottagecore lol
the wig looks gorgeous on you Saf
i wanna know why i only ever get cheap knockoff vintage and historical clothes and have never once seen anything like gatheringofgoods be suggested. i literally follow historical fashion people!
I see Jade The Libra at 10:30 on this video OMG she's such a cool Youtuber too! <3
She said STAN TWICE!!
I LOVE YOU SAFIYA
I love how all of Safiya finds video content by accident
do a franken ban and jerry s
She's my favourite Morticia Addams
put the extra strap thru the ring??
Love from India 🇮🇳
That pink jacket is so cute!! I also like the pink wig. It looks good on you. Missed watching your videos!
Anyone tik tok haul?
<<<<< Crazy Scary Channel
the 3rd look is called more like a "soft girl" look....
She heard someone laugh and then continued to try and make them laugh . It kinda made me cringe lol
I’d say keep the pink jacket and pair it with a black outfit 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Outfit 1 and 2 were so amazing! I have no idea how she always makes them work but she rocked those two styles so well! I kinda love the blouse of outfit 1.
This has made me so happy idek why????
welcom in Brielle. where we wear old fashioned dresses and skirts once a year. i love it
Boyfriend doesn’t like it,digs hole , and finds any excuse to redeem himself  “ now that your talking it looks better “ What?
Hear this now. God is real. Jesus is real. Very, very real. Sexual sins are high sins. Turn away right this instant !!  What goes around, comes around is true!

All lustful thoughts.  Jesus died for every lust. Every time you perv on a woman, is Jesus' pain. Please learn this. Let me be a testimony: incel, former masturbation addict, I am not alone! Please heed this warning!
I love you're videos but I wish you mad more
The "e-girl" make up Safiya did REALLY suits her! (maybe not with the wig)
You Look so healthy!!! 🥰🥰🥰
With the 3rd look, the jacket covers the t-shirt, and combined with the wig, it's a wall of pink. That said I still like it a lot (I like all 3 looks)
Every time I hear the word cherubim, I think of Sister Act!!
Sorry but that didn't need to be 40 minutes. Honestly, I've been scrubbing through much of the excess "flashback" and filler footage or just leaving videos lately because they just jump around so much, visually. I read your post regarding feeling overwhelmed and  behind and perhaps a more simplified approach would help? Maybe don't add a video clip of every sentence you say..  thanks though, you're still cool.
It's not e-girl now we changed the name to "alt" And alt is soft goth it's not pastel. The pics you showed are more indie
omg she looks like seraphine from league/kda with that wig!!!!!!!
OMG. I wore a tri-corn in high school!  I was a semi-goth in high school (basically I went as far as I could with dress code) and it went great with my dresses, tights, jeans and tuxedo tails and morning coats, as well as velvet smoking jackets!
As a girl who lives in florals, the goth outfit is absolutely stunning!!! You look incredible!!! 🖤
The Witch outfit was my favorite !! The shoes are so perfect!!
Whatever you wear suits you safiya ❤❤
Safiya plz do a house tour ... I really want to see your beautiful house
Ilovethatpinkoutfit💯
Please do an 1890s fashion video
She looks like electra heart with that wig ngl
mine is so bad, like i scrolled for 2 mins ish and nothing id like popped up 😂 i dont follow any brands or fashion influencers plus im nonbinary so it cant give me a gendered recommendation either, so its just a mess lmao
Tyler did amazing with the wig and the wig looks amazing on you
Outfit 2 tabs. “Creepy cute” sat here like yeah, that’s emo. It’s all the stuff I wanted as a teen and still want haha
okay but like can we get the link to the wig?
iiiii love the witch outfit on you!!! you look awesome safia!!!
HOUSE TOURRRRR!!!!!!!!
Her skin looksss soo gooddd
I so love watching you. Welcome back!!
The latest suit is the coolest, looks and fits well. I think jeans and jacket are worth wearing, just match differently)) The wig is also gorgeous)
i love how creative ur videos are
Love you guys, your videos are well presented and always pep me up. Thanks for your hard work
This was uploaded on my birthday! :D
safiye deserves so much more love for these videos
Maybe try wearing the dress with the zipper in the front on the second outfit because some of the zippers belong in the front and usually they don't have tags to tell you and see if it looks better if it's better
You should replace the laces with black ribbon ♥
When your name is "Angel" XD
Auto Comment with Whitelist option for Instagram and other features. This app only costs $3.
I had to pause and come to the comments to say that Safiya's skin looks so fucking good at 18:15
It’s been along time since I’ve heard that jingle…         A loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong time
When they pronounced Oregon[oregen], “Orogone” 💀👎🏻
So apparently I can’t have notifications on for you bc you have “kids content”? WTF MAN
Pastel pink and stuff are vsco
You could tuck the "nipple tassle" in the hoops
The witch outfit suits you so well!!!
IM OBSESSED WITH SECOND OUTFIT!!!!
Ha, if you’re in BH I think you might be my husbands families neighbor.
me: wait, there is a 'Shop' tab? BRB --> checking my IG
I think the pink one is super cute, too bad for the fit and quality. But then I just died my short curky hair pink haha
you lowkey remind me of bones from bones
nobody: safiya: i would love to go there for a vidEyOW-
Hello Safiya, here is a heads up. A former worker at Colonial Williamsburg is interested in collabing with you. They are a YouTuber now and mentioned you in their recent video. They are Abby Cox. Here is the video that they mention you time stamp 16:20 . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBCwxd48lHc&t=4s
I’m not used to seeing safiya with longer hair😭
What size did you get in the jeans?
in the Nicest way possible she sounds like a news anchor, I think it's awsome personally.
I really liked the moon boots dude they are so my style
So, my thoughts are that, if you tucked the suspender ends into the rings and tucked it into the waistband... Both issues would be possibly abated.
Thank you. As a gay boy, I was not allowed to play with dolls. But now as a gay man, I can enjoy seeing a beautiful doll playing with so many amazing looks... Thank you so much.
XOWIE!!
did safiya not hear about the roller skating boom (in mainstream culture - it never died in some communities, notably Black communities)
Who else loves her phone wallpaper
not them pronouncing oregon wrong...nooooo
THE ALL-BLACK OUTFIT WAS SO FLATTERING!!! Safiya gets prettier and prettier every video 💓💓
ur hair looks so good
Dearest Safiya.  Are you aware that @abbycox who worked at Colonial Williamsburg for some time, has in her videos, offered to take you there and also to make you an outfit to wear?  Just thought I'd point it out in case you hadn't noticed.
not to be that person, but i love that more than half of her explore tab is twice, blackpink, and itzy ✨
Holy crap those lace up boots were like a tourniquet ffs..useful if a black mamba bites ur ankle.
the 3rd outfit is giving me marzia vibes and i'm LIVING for it
Now that Jenna Marbles is nowhere to be found, Safiya's content is what's keeping me from sleeping early at night
Safiya you are the cutest! I love your videos. :)
im not on instagram but i just might for the gothic fashion because I want all of it
You make my day. Thank you love your videos so much.
Pluck the part of the wig a tiny bit more and then use some darker eye shadow/ contour to make the roots look more natural so your eyebrows don’t look mismatched and the wig will look good with anything, think blended dye job
I knew I wasn't the only one who thought my face mask gets a weird smell (not often though because I chew gum a lot, but still). I guess it's because we only brush our teeth a certain amount of times a day and our breath plus food/etc isn't expected to stay that fresh.
I'm watching at 9pm under my blanket hiding from my parents. Tomorrow is vetrens day so I get a day off so no school so I can sleep in which is why i ain't sleeping
Hi. I’m sorry if this is rude but all of my favorite YouTube couples are having babies nowadays. I think it’s your turn 🖤🦇 baby bat saf/tyler 😍
You look so good with the pink hair!
Omg I literally have that kill star goth milk purse I screamed when I saw it in this video 😭
Wow she looked SO GOOD in that all black outfit! Like it worked for her
Hey what shop did you get those shoes from?!
Just what I needed. I needed a break from politics and you delivered. :) Thank you so much.
The way you both said Oregon 😬 but you are adorable so I forgive you
I don’t know why but the mug smashing video idea really appealed to me. 😆
I don't know if people have already talked about this, but the image on the tank top is actually from a real PPG episode: https://youtu.be/aY_Ac3FNzuQ it's pretty funny.
the two "spy" girls you saw are fairies from the TV show called winx
I have no clue who sami sweatheart is.
Your telling me I’ve been binge watching jersey shore and Safiya just happens to mention it and never had before ..... the simulation is glitching
Can you and Tyler make the first 5-7 recipes you see on Pinterest?
Does anyone know about the Selena Gomez movie saf was talking about?
Just went to the shop section, omg so much good stuff... this is indeed dangerous.
Y r u posting  lessssss..... miss u gurl
You look amazing in the witch outfit!!!
YES I WAS WAITING FOR ANOTHER ONE OF THESE
Didn't Abby Cox work at Colonial Williamsburg, and totally would love to do a collab with Safiya...? 😁
I love the witch one so much 😩
Ore I gin (pin) 😂   Not Oragone
Can we have links on items please! 💕
i love the cap in the first outfit instead of a prairie bonnet 😂
idk if anyone else notice but girl me is so happy you got a new phone! You needed to treat to self!
I had fun playing spot the Elhoffer in your shop tab while watching. Also, where did you get the mask you wore for the not-egirl outfit? I love it.
Think the “colonial” outfits are from Christian fundamentalists. They love that sort of thing.
Love the wig
She really thinks alot before buying or doing anything
I live super close to Williamsburg and will gladly join you on your Colonial Williamsburg adventures
I do not get the churning part I know I'm only 9
me yaaa she posted
Dang that ?overall skirt? looks so flattering on her
You are not one of us
Wow thanks Saf now I need to buy a new witchy outfit I don't need 😫 but it's so cute 🖤
My heart on my sleeve hahahah
👀
SAFIA PLEASE BUY A REBORN AND TAKE CARE OF IT
Pink looks so good on you Safiya!! You should wear more pink i think.
Why you say Oregon like that
the "e girl" outfit is so cute! i think it's pretty cohesive, it's just the makeup that doesn't suit the mellow vibe the clothes have
Abby Cox here on YouTube used to work at Colonial Williamsburg and said in her most recent video that she would love to go with you/take you around and possibly make you a gown as a collab.
You look actually cute with the "E-girl" Outfit 💛💛💛
That's not Safiya, that's Carrie from Dirty Candy.
okay but I would like to see Safiya dressed as morticia
Come on you people pls get this girl to 10.00M subs.
Your screensaver 🤣
I'm glad you actually corrected yourself on the e-girl thing, most people will just call anything trendy and colordful "e-girl" without understanding the origins and the actual look of the style.
i do in fact think of sammi sweetheart more than i would like to admit. Specifically, that phrase.
Okay but Safiya being a TWICE stan, YEAH I STAN an INTELECTUAL <3 love youuu
“Cabs’a hea” My boyfriend and I’s favorite quote to say since we’ve watched the show on Hulu 😭😭👌🏼
why do you look good in allo of these
i used to tell people to use honey for free!! wheres my promo @ honey lol 😂 but seriously honey is worth everyones time ive been using it for 3 maybe 4 years now?  do it now
i love how u saf can depend on Ty to catch her references, i love them so much
saf you're so gorgeous ahhh
i loved every single look,  you looked so good !!
Please don’t say Oregon like that again lol
Smells the flowers, forgets the masks existence hahahahaha
Smells the flowers, forgets the masks existence hahahahaha
I loved the last outfit 🥰
22:13 did they yell out "weirdo" cause if so... rooood. lmao
sis i live next to colonial williamsburg and it’s not that cool
Oo! I want to see a picture of the white Josephina top with the velvet suspender skirt, moon shoes, and pink heart jacket. That would be so pretty!
Safiya is literally the coolest person
The powerpuff girls top is a cheap knock off omighty top it even has the omighty branding on it, that’s why it’s bad quality
Safiya *sees y2k fashion* ‘oh e-girl right’ 😹😹😹😹😹
Screw it! If you think it’s eGirl, it’s eGirl!
its more of a soft girl but shoure
I would love to see that pink wig on with that witchy outfit! Please post an instapic!
0:36 We love all that twice content in your explore page lol
After all of these years, I'm not sure if I'm allowed to say your last name.
try wrapping the laces around the ankle of the boot before tying!! my favorite thing to do with long laces!! great video btw safiya!!  edit: typo
As Hermione granger would say... it’s “Oregon, not Or-E-gon” Essentially say it like the piano like instrument the Organ.   Loved this video though 😘😘
26:33 don’t cut the shoe laces! Instead bend each “bunny ear” over about 1/3 of the length of the loop from the shoe (so 2/3 flops back down) and tie them like usual! It makes 6 little hoops all the same size!
safiga you looked so beautiful in this vid!
Oh noooo you both said "ore-gone" hahaha
Mariana and the Diamonds looking!!
Random idea. O_O What about sowing different pieces of your wardrobe into a franken-onesie? O_O
Ok but, why is no one talking about how beautiful she looks through the whole video 💕
Okay, you were absolutely ROCKING the pink jacket with the pink wig 💗
That’s literally been there forever. For like a year now
the twice recommended things ... i see u saf
I can’t even get on my Instagram it’s buffering all the time   -turns out I was hacked lmaoooo💀💀💀💀💀
The mask to the outfit gives me heavy Lele Pons vibes
Yes a virginia joke!
I think the wig looks great!
That soft girl 28:42 Lol 😂
I love when you do videos like this!! Yay!
Lol June and post it in November 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️
Ok now I need to see you break your mugs and glue them back together
Safiya looked like a Manson girl with her hair down in the American girl doll fit 😭 in the best way😌
It's pronounced Ore-gun, not Or-e-gon.
Your home reminds me of Jenna Marbles home.
Was she wearing the overall skirt thing backwards??
I've started playing with the vampire/gothic/steampunk looks and let me just say I've come up with something great 😉!!!!
When you had the witch shirt it reminded me of the Adams family mother or daughter
How do you buy from websites with currencies that arent usd i'm dumb
Please take these pieces and style them how you would wear them, especially the egirl pieces!
thank youuu
LELE PONS AHHAHS IM DEAD!
Not her explore page being mostly twice and Jennie ?!?!
with shoelaces like that you wrap them around the ankle of the boot!
Come to Colonial Williamsburg I live here 😳
SAFIYA WE NEED MERCH!!! ❤️
Is anyone else thinking about the straps possibly being tucked in at the bottom of the ring????
AHHHHHHH YES GOTH LITE LADIES UNITE
Credit is definitely due! That pink wig looks amazing on you!!!
Are you from Norway?
Hi Safiya!  I have the same bday as you!!!!!!!!
The last syllable of “Oregon” has a schwa
I wanna see the second outfit with the pink wig.
I think the pink wig with the pink jacket is a bit much- like having a differently colored wig or jacket would help the outfit out!!
I liked the last outfit. But I might just like it because that’s basically how I dress. Mom jeans, tank top, and loose jacket.
I love that first outfit so much :o
She looks so cute with pink hair!!!
Hmm colonial skirt very big and poofie.. behind the desk the whole video and dare I say looking super glowing and DDG! I love the pics! Going to see my shop tab to see what I need to have.
I went to Williamsburg when i was like 9 or 10 and i got to churn butter (I think i may just be misremembering i'm 13 now)
girl that pvseur shop is such a scam, everything they have there is like 1:1 just like from aliexpress, just for the triple price. it‘s even from china, sent by china mail as you can see on the package.
It may sound strange but the last outfit I liked the most.
The intro never gets old
FOR STARKID FANS ONLY   Them: act like ur on the oregan trail Me in my head: ok so she’s either gonna go skinny dipping, do a speed run or get visited by her granddads wife-stealing lobster brother named cornwales
I liked the witch outfit skirt a lot! The whole outfit was great. But funnily, I kind of liked the pink outfit aswell, especially the jacket. Maybe you could cut the power puff girls out of the top and then sew them to a nice cotton top? You could make a video where you diy fix your clothes 😊
I reeeeeEeeAaly like your “E-girl” makeup, you look like Lily Collins
i love the amount of twice on your explore page lmao
I think pink looks GREAT on you <3
I did not just hear yall call oregon ORYGON
"Killed her husband *Hexed* him."
Honestly my favourite look was the last one it looks so good on you
You should post moreeee
As an Oregonian I feel it's important to point out Oregon is pronounced Oregen not Oregone. Otherwise love ya
Not that anybody cares, or even asked. But babe.  Colonial times was 1700s.  The mop cap was more 1900s.. Nevertheless. Cute video as always ☺️
OMG Saf You look incredible in this witchy outfit! 😍😍
The intro song is back!! Yay!!
The sammi sweetheart references had me dead
I like your home screen 🤣
Please try the dress with a mask incorporateddd
Love your content! Quality as always... funnnnn
It’s all the Twice/blackpink content safiya has in her search page for me 👁👁
did you kill jenna and take her house
her: skirterall? me: pinafore?
taytay at 3:17 <3
I can't roller skate either, but I can roller blade very well.
All of these Jersey Shore references are giving me life 😂 “cabs are hea”
THANK YOU SAFIYA FOR PRONOUNCING JOSEFINA CORRECTLY MY HEART!!  SINGS!!!
Pastels= Soft Girl, but i dont blame youu for not knowing, i would be lost too XD I am dark alt and i didnt know that soft girls existed.
i think the problem with the not-an-e-girl outfit was the lack of color balance. you can have the pink wig, or the pink jacket, but wearing both brings too much attention up⬆️ and make the look top-heavy. also, having that much going on on the top half makes the bottom half look dull and boring by comparison
Love Saf's phone wallpaper/background! 🤣
Gosh I love that second outfit, I want it 💕
webster wigs have such good wiiiiigs
I gotta say I was a little surprised when I saw Chaeyoung and Nayeon and Tzuyu from Twice on ur phone well on Instagram
Whoa Safiya is getting hella skinny
you could just tuck that strap under the ring so it’s not flapping around
why is no one talking about the fact that the third outfit is perfectly great at all angles? Am I the only one who thinks so? I think it looks great!
LMAO LOVE THE TWICE MOMENT IN THE BEGINNING ✨💘
Wait no, did you not get a hoop? A bustle? A bum roll? Nothing for the historical skirts?? Oh geez that's not gonna look great, but hats off to you for trying :)
So many double entendres 🙈
Lol you look like Lady Gaga with wig and masc
Churning butter has never been an innocent act after the Eurovision butter churning lady from a couple of years ago.
21:21 Hehe me being from Oregon and giggling at the way they pronounce it 😂 It’s “ore-gin” not “ore-gone” 😂
But did you try code simply for 10% off instead of honey?
i-im sorry but thats not how u say oregon
I wonder why your video was recommended by YouTube... I wonder if those clothes fit me at all..
3rd outfit it's a softgirl vibe
I think the wig would look so good with the gothy outfit tbh
Lmao the hocus-pocus reference
The last outfit is just a jumble of aesthetics
where she was sitting for the “egirl@ unboxing - looked like jennas “set” like where she’s make the paintings n stuff.
please do Shein!
Did anyone else cry a little when they said "Or-e-gone" instead of "Or-e-gun"
the way you say oregon is so different from the people who live here 😟
Could you put the straps of the skirteral in the loops so they aren't flapping?  Otherwise, I wouldn't know what to do with them either.
I hadn't even noticed the tab...I bet mine will show some pinup and burlesque items, lol.
Hehe
PLEASE come to Virginia
Safiya promoting TWICE’s “BDZ” as she should!
0:35 the amount of kpop girl groups on her explore page 😌💕
SAFIYA LOOKING LIKE ELECTRA HEART.
That blouse for the colonial look gave Safiya a like, pop of boobage where she seems to lack in her regular wear. All in all, a great video.
does anyone know where safiya got the flower face mask???
I LOOOOOVE the 2nd outfit!!
The pink jacket and wig (as separates or together) are AMAZING. I love that jacket on you Saf!
Hi Safiya! I live this series, Sunday I turned 13!
Oh dang I want that witchy skirt
I want them moon boots.  Those are cool af.  The witch outfit as a whole was my favorite.
I frighten looooove the churning butter look sans bonnet!!!!
Don't soft girls usually wear pastel colors?
I think the last look would be killer with dark jeans
the 'pink e-girl' look is literally everything I aspire to be, and my hair is already dyed pink so it's all downhill from here. very different than your usual fit, but I think it still looked gorgeous on you, as does everything you ever wear!
I like the Kpop themed Explore page ✨😈
did anyone peep her lockscreen of tyler at 11:39 that's so cute
Safiya’s excitement finding the Disney swimsuit Instagram is the excitement i strive to have daily in my life
The chaeyoung bdz fancam 0_0
Come back sooooner
She got catcalled bc she looks like a cottagecore lesbian ngl
Safiya with pink hair is giving me life.
Okay but why is nobody talking about how they share masks with each other 😭
I liked the first two outfits so much!
We NEED a vlog Channel 👀👀
Watching these videos makes me eager to play around with my wardrobe and go for some bold and fun stuff 😊😊
The pink outfit looked amazing, in my opinion! :D
I’ve had honey for I don’t even know how pond and it is sooooooo amazing everyone should get it
Instagram: saf you will be a witch take it or leave it
Ok you looked so pretty in all of them 😭
Offended by how they said Oregon as OReGONE
Instagram: are you a witch or a civil war re-enacter...?  Safiya: yes.
ok but when she's in her living room/kitchen... looks exactly like jenna & julien's house wtf
I think the wig looks fine on Saf. I just feel like that outfit in particular didn't need more pink. Also, the skirt straps could probably be pulled through the rings to be less tassle-y.
I love those pants!!
lolol I think the shoelaces are meant to be wrapped around your ankles then tied...
I can’t watch your videos. They have too many “ding” sounds
PLEASE do another fashion-exploration type video with all the popular styles that people are doing lately (alt, egirl, cottagecore etc)
The way she said “the skirt I got from wish 3 years ago” and he was just like “yes.”
Lmaooo all the twice posts on your search page
SAFIYA IS ONCE OMG
God, just all that Killstar and Rogue Wolf is just calling me out. Safiya just came and fucking murdered all the goths out there. Also, Safiya, Casual Goth is a thing
"As we are all want to do" yes, yes, I are want to do too! ❤👽
Watch Abby Cox. She worked at Williamsburg... :)
sailor moon isn't a cartoon-
haha this is so funny! :D
The one with the “secret” posts is just dropshipping. That’s why it took so long lol, all of that stuff is on aliexpress for like $7.
3:16 beautiful background
I live in Oregon and I can say I HATE the say they miss pronounced my states name 😂
OMG SHE LOOKS SO HOT IN THE WITCH OUTFIT!! With the mask??? *chefs kiss*
AlohaEarsDesign!! 🥰🥰 highly recommend their ears!! I have a whole collection going!!! 🥳
haha love your content, you have to learn how to pronounce Oregon though ;)
When she took off the bonnet she looked like Jo from Little Women
10:05 Pinterest and Google have that technology to scan a pic and find similar images... So yes it's plausible they do that with your likes and whatnot for pretty much everything now...  I suppose that's also how ads have gotten *SO* personalized too..
I don't work at Colonial Williamsburg, but I know plenty of people who do...does that count?
Her Instagram honestly looks like mine.... I'm weird person with A LOT of interests so... Same Safiya. Same. Lol 🤍✌🏼
Oh GOD can you do a collab with Abby Cox?? She used to work in Williamsburg, and collects legit antique/vintage dresses. PLEASE it would be AMAZING.
Oh my gosh girl. You crack me up! I used to do Civil War re-enactments, and you kill it in the prairie outfit. 😂 Also, I appreciate how willing you are to experiment in different outfits. You are my spirit animal. I’ve lived overseas with the military for the last 20 months and you’re making me miss all my costume clothes in storage! Keep up the good work. ❤️
The way in which I immediately thought of Sammi Sweetheart too when you saw that bracelet😭😭
I love the witch outfit!!
I wanna know what brand those masks are cause they fit her face so well ❤️
This is my music playlist.
I know it was not the fit but daaaaaamn I love the jeans <3 so much I´m thinking to buy some for me, maybe....
I love how Saf's poses are either seductive and sexy or just wacky motions like gyrating her hips back and forth lol
Watched 13 mins in and first thought was         SALEM WITCH TRIALS
WHY DO YOU HAVE 118 MISSED CALLS LOL
Generals are coming forward saying this election has been stolen using an inteligence tool called hammer and scorecard.  They stole it from the american people.
without the bonnet you look like winona ryder in the crucible lol
but the shop tab has BEEN a thing for a while now...... also aloha ears are the beeeeest
35:07 When the outfit worked.
Safiya was clearly a witch in the Salem witch trials. A normal pagan woman during the day, and a broom flying, black dress wearing witch by night.
Im sorry but am I supposed to go to honey.com/mrbeast or honey.com/pewdiepie or honey.com/mattstonie or honey.com/safiyanygard
At around 33:00, you realise that the outfit would work better without the jacket. The wig and the jacket clash.
Instagram just told you that you would’ve been burned at the stakes during the witch trials
I like all three!!!!
26:43 sb plz tell me whats the song in the backround
I'm obsessed with the pink outfit tho ;-; its so cuteeeee
The pinkish pastel style is Y2K, I love that aesthetic
I have not been watching YouTube lately and I’m so glad this is the video that brought me back😂🙌🏽✨💖
Drinking game: drink every time safiya says witch or throws up a piece sign
This really made me wanna buy roller skates I wish we had a skating ring where I live :(
YES once you took the bonnet off and mentioned the 1970s, that's exactly what the frankenAmericanGirlDoll outfit is. 1970s-does-prairie.
Do you guys think you'll ever do a house tour? I cant help but notice what pieces I do see in insat and vids is so cute!
Pink hair and goth outfit would be sooooo cute!
Sometimes I feel like, “Hello, fellow kids...” is my brand.
I saw 2 chaeyoung there.
5:11 ayyyyy! I know the owners of Aradani studios in Nashville (they make all sorts of badass cosplay elf ears). SO COOL to see their insta ad pop up here :)
When you’re from VA! Lol I live right next to Monticello and go to UVA. Veryyyy historic
U sure u aren't ready for a baby? bc that sounded like a dad joke 37:20
The witch outfit.. i need it RIGHT NOW
I want to see u in more pink it suits u 🤩
Now you kind of NEED to make a E girl makeover video
EGIRL
To the person that's reading this:     You're very intelligent and adorable human! Stay healthy during quarantine    My dream is to have 1k. I been struggling to get there!!🙏💞❣️ help pls
THERE’S A COLONIAL WOMAN ON THE AIRPLANE WING!!!!
you actually look so cool in the witch outfit with the matching black mask on! Couldn't stop staring
OK BUT I AM OBSESSED WITH THAT PINK WITH HEARTS JEAN JACKET
It’s because you’re wearing your heart on your sleeve!
The pink outfit is cute just without the wig
Loool why the quadruple knot? You can simply use the 'bunny ears' to make double bunny ears. Much easier!
11:36 nice phone wallpapers
memes of production is everything thank you tyler
OMG SAFIYA! please do a video where you find out your Kibbe body type and put together outfits for your body 'type'! It would be so interesting to see!
Just churning 😂
Please do a video where you wear randomized Sim looks for a week!!! It would be gold!
saf ur glowing!!!!
Please smash all your mugs and put them back together?? 😂😂
Oh no...friends, I really hope you were joking about how you two were pronouncing my state, Oregon 🤦‍♀️ lol
I used to work @ fb marketing, the baby stuff is 100% targeted based on you guys getting married (-: one of the easiest targeting options to pick
Why is the 3rd look straight up the same energy of Dirty Candi from Julie and the Phantoms?
Great video love the 3 dramatic different looks but I was also interested in their house...looks like they moved into a really nice place! I know it’s kinda basic but I’d love to see the rest of their new place! I think it’s interesting to see how someone like Sofia with such a unique style shows off her style in her home.
I think Saf looks amazing in pink clothing! 🌸
10 to 80 years old are learning Arabic online. Can't believe, just search bayyinah tv at YouTube and watch an dream intensive day 1. I am 11 years old and in just 10 days I am able to open the Quran and tell what is jaar majroor, mudaf mudaf ilaih mosoof sifah. I can tell why in surah yusuf Allah uses sunbulaatun instead of sanabil although they mean same but one is for decreasing and other is for increasing. Just go and at least check. Please please please
Girl i just love you
PAYUP
I think you should do eyeliner mixing video #bad makeup science 👍👍👍😎
So much historical fashion...
I LOVE colonial Williamsburg! For sure bought a dress.
love this video!!! the second look is definietly my favorite.
The pink jacket looks super cute on her, she should keep it and wear it with a short black dress underneath
I have never used Instagram shop tab before
https://youtu.be/oEzbNbiBJX8
You looked soo cute in that witch outfit! And I love how long your hair has gotten.
I love the last outfit all except the Jeans Saf looks so good
she...skipped...blackpink... 😢
I have never worked at Colonial Williamsburg (CW) personally, but I grew up there and my parents have some wonderful stories about working there, including how they met! My father actually grew up in a house on Duke of Gloucester.
Safiya getting in character in the colonial Williamsburg garb. 💯 I’ve never laughed so hard.
Please do dressing like American girl dolls for a week! 🤣
Sammy "sweetheart" 🤣
Safiya whereeee do you get your masks from theyre so cute
i am so obsessed w the pink wig, esp w you in it!!!
what if you tucked the end of the suspenders throught the rings and under the skirt? I think that would look nicer.. maybe
When she said sponsor why did i have a feelin it would be honey -
5:49 WHY IS FEMALES HAVING CHILDREN SOMETHING EVERYBODY SPECULATES ABOUT. IT'S SO RUDE. IF THEY MADE IT WITH THEIR PRIVATES, LET IT BE PRIVATE. it's none of your business. Sorry for the screaming in caps, I feel it was necessary.
Saf, I don't mean this in a creepy way, but I could listen to you all day.  I'm not even into things like lipstick and fashion and could forever watch those videos by you.  You can make absolutely anything interesting and your videos always entertain me.  I like you just the way you are
SAFIYA HEAVY METAL RAP SONG  BOSS WITCH OMFG YESSSSSS
the witch outfit suits you the best but I like the pink outfit the most.... might be because I love that kind of style and would wear it
As someone who has done reenacting in my younger years: I can thoroughly day it is a joy to do! The dresses are incredibly heavy, and a bit hot depending on where you do reenactments, as well as what materials you are using, but over all there is a wonderful little charm about all of it C:
Next video she is going to have pink hair
Saf are you secretly a Once???
I love your masks! Where did you get them?
Love the pink wig.  Super cute
Twice twice twice
We have people in my town that unironicly wear the "little house on the prairie" dresses and bonnets. I think its a religious thing though.. I live in the Bible Belt
"It's a Virginia joke for ya" if only it were actually a joke.... There's a lot of that in Va.
I would watch a franken mug crafting video.
Dude....stay with me on this one....what about...Colonial top, skirt overalls, and the wig with the bonnet...I could be way off, but I feel like that would be kinda cute lol
happy anniversary! Y’all are my favorite and cutest couple ❤️
'She's a weatchhhh!!" 😂
Really kills me to see saf buying this stuff with no comment on sustainability! This stuff is all cheaply made fast fashion esp that powerpuff top, made to trend and then go into a landfill. :(
Oh waaat! I had no idea that shop tab existed
Laughed out loud at the, “Catch me churning butter.” Then I was talking out loud trying to tell you how to pronounce Orygun...most commonly referred to as Oregon. All this while pondering if I’d called my daughter’s American Girl Doll by the wrong name back in the day.
Hi. I used to watch you because of Sammy the lambo and then I realized you had a lot more content
Love her videos but 40 minutes is a bit long
I think the outfit is solid! not fitting you just right and not being something you usually wear might make you think not, but I liked it! And pink is not my color!
Girl! Please come visit us at George Washington's Mount Vernon!! We'd love to have you.
Some videos ago I noticed a huge similarity to Jenna and juliens kitchen. And now... yes, it’s the same design. Might be Julien in the background at 28:57🧐
Loved this! Those moon boots are awesome! Pink hair is working for you 💜
Please don't say Oregon like that.       Its more like or ah gen
ok but who wants to see Safiya and Lilly do a collab?! Just me? Safiya please make this happen! 😍😁🖤🖤🖤
Please make a Frankin Chapstick!!!!!
I don't like anything from my "shop" tab, I feel insulted that my phone doesn't even know me. T_T
Wait that witch shirt..... you’re a witch that wears her heart on her sleeve!!! 😬
Why is just a video of clothes 38 minutes long what do you even edit
Possibly just found a lost video from Vietnam.... would you wanna see It? It’s a throw back....
E-girl fashion comes from the heart, it can be whatever you want it to be!
Why did Tyler say Oregon like that?
CREDIT TO TYLER
What she gonna do with the cloths thooo👀
Any idea where I can those masks? Especially the first one?
GameCrook looks like the single functioning site where you might get free points.
about braking your mugs, something like Kintsugi? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eO9CnS-NqO8
Heeey, Safiya! Try the wig on again, I think the parting is supposed to be not-centered? According to the insta pic. Might look better! But, yeah, those jeans were horrid, dunno who they would fit... 😅
"I think those are trashcans."  Best Quote Of 2020
My bro tested all of these websites believing they were real, however only real one is GameCrook. I hope I saved your time as well.
30:50 she looks awesome
Thanks a lot
I don’t work at Colonial Williamsburg, but I’ve lived nearby my whole life and I’m up to help you with some responsible nonsense while you’re there. I bet we could totally get you a butter churn. The have educational sessions for all kinds of things, they MUST have butter making.
The pink look was my fave
lets talk about how safiya's entire explore page is twice content lmao
safya i love ur style, but can u do a video where u challenge yourself to not wear black/dark colors? I would love to see how you style more colorful clothes.
They know about your old fashion videos!
Don't cut the shoe laces😂make 4 loops instead of two!
It’s okay insta thinks i’m a witch too lol your house looks so very similar to jenna marbles. Love the black outfit 🖤
The moondust shoes omg 😍😍😍
I find the fact that Tyler is equally excited as Saf so adorable 🥺🥺
y'all... 11:37 her home screen
are we really not gonna talk about her face in the unboxing??
oregon is said like organ not or-gone 👁👄👁
The aestheticsss, the posing,,,, I love this vid so much
Honestly I kind of love all these outfits!! Also yesss Webster Wigs! Nearly ally wigs are from them!
Take a shot anytime Safiya says "e-girl" and Tyler calls her "dude"
THE AMOUNT OF TWICE ON THE IG EXPLORE
Lol, next time you're in Williamsburg PM me on FB.
She is a twice stan
ig shop has been around for ages ? easily near on a year or summin
You look like an Actress we have in India
i don't know why but i love your face at 27:28
I thought Egirl was just a scene girl with more colour and nicer hair? 😅
I absolutely LOVE the insta witch outfit on you!!!
I love it i love love love love love love love love
Ok but why did I instantly think of Grimes when you showed the third outfit?
Ok but please break mugs and make new Franken-mugs
in my opinion, the last outfit would've been cute without the jacket!!!
I didn't know the Instagram shop tab existed until seeing this video, and I kinda hate that you introduced me to it.😅 Sincerely, an online shopaholic
where were you i thiught you were dead lol , i forgot you are a witch you cant die lol
I love the witch outfit!!!!!!! And pink hair looks fabulous on you.
Sam, the first night at BED when you left, Ron made out with two girls and put his head between a cocktail waitress's breasts. Also was grinding with multiple fat women. When you left crying at Klutch, Ron was holding hands and dancing with a female and took down her number. Multiple people in the house know, therefore you should know the truth.
I love your videos so much. I always appreciated the thoughtfulness that goes into your editing. Three audio is always great, you incorporate a lot of fun camera shots or screen shots of relevant things etc. Honestly, I didn't realize you guys were editing your own visors, I thought you had people editing your videos. I definitely understand why you need a break, that is so much work! But seriously, it shows how much time and consideration you put into them.  I will happily wait patiently whole you guys work tirelessly on your videos for the next upload.  You guys are awesome!
I don't know when Saf filmed this but I'm very sure she fell to the kpop hole so bad, she even got K-POP DOLLS ON HER IG SHOP LOL
Wait, Tyler has IBS? How do you guys do it with dinner and such? Do you both eat low fodmap?
What are talking about a tab on instagram I don't have one
You are funny, original , & captivating.
More soap making...make a soap bed for Jenna Marbles dog Kermit 🙂
tbh the last outfit would’ve looked better without the wig
It’s the BDZ video for mee 🤩
Cuteness! My tab has the same goth looks 🤔🤔 Also.... Oreg IN.... not oreGONE 🤣 we aren’t gone yet lol
I ABSOLUTELY LOVED the second outfit, I think that everything was cute and trendy and it really looked good on Saf❤️
Love the historical outfit, having worked for Colonial Williamsburg in costume it's definitely more civil war reenactment but it's still super cute!!
Webster wigs is a really great brand. I love their wigs.
Thanks for looking into Instagram shopping. Seems like there is good and bad points, for example it’s somewhat where Etsy was a few years ago, before it was flooded with Aliexpress junk. My issue is the same as you, I would have problems with being fed what I should buy.
the hearts on the eyes are because of marina + the diamonds hehe
It's so comforting to see someone who fits clothes the same ways as me lol. I always have that issue with mom jeans
I love the witch look so much you looked hella good
On the velvet skirt just tuck the strap tails in through the rings it should help
Seriously can people start using perusing properly! To “peruse” doesn’t mean to skim through something, it means “reading something thoroughly”  ...  #peruseawareness #2020grammarawareness
You should so wear more pink hair....it looks awesome
The first two outfits are fun, the last outfit is awful but the wig works 👍🏾
How very different these looks were!
The third look is Electra Heart in 2020
Wait, y’all don’t really say Oregon like that right????????
I wish I could watch a safiya vid every day 🥺
The pink hair gives me lava girl and shark boy vibes.
I have been using/seeing shop for over 8 months
I'm obsessed with those moon cut-out shoes
Does anyone know where her black floral top is from?!
You can wrap long laces around ur ancle once or a few times to shorten the laces.
lol the wall paper
Those skirt straps didn't look weir ar all. But you can just tuck the straps into the hoops on the skirt
I, too, am diet goth. 😂
Yu can pull off anything lol but the 2nd is my favorite bc it's so yu lol
shop poseur definitely is one of those shops that dropships from aliexpress. theres a lot of legit businesses on instagram but there are also a lotta scam shops lol
Use make up that’s past it’s expiration date as paint on a canvas. Draw portraits of each other and Crusty. Please let us see him once more.
Hype that CW is now down for the collab!!!
Okay but Thot-icia was a LOOK!
Looooooove thie witchy outfit! ^_^  And the colonial one looked great on you too! ♥♥
Congrats on 9 mil!
Soft girl or pastel goth is what I'd call that girly pastel looks.
I FRIKIN LOVE YOUR WALLPAPER 💀
The third one is such a Bratz look and I am so down.
lava girl grew up so stunning :')
dang why twice in your thing lol u once?
I'm honestly confused as to what "egirl" has become. Originally (circa 2010-ish, for me at least), "egirl" was a term used by guys in the competitive gaming communities for females who they thought were just there for attention (putting it nicely...). Like the term "buckle bunnies" for females at rodeos. I guess having it as a fashion genre is an improvement.
PLEASE DESTROY ALL YOUR MUGS N GLUE THEM BACK TOGETHR PLS OMG PLS
the screen recording of ig... i see a lot of kpop,, specifically a lot of twice and some itzy and blackpink HAHA o and a lot of the bachelor/ette franchise  (hi hannah b) hahaha
Did anyone else here "Surfing the Aligator" in the back?
Okay I have to be honest, idk why but this is my least fave video. I just had to look at it because I missed you guys, you’re not here that often anymore😣 Please bring back more crazy things like mixing videos and some random things you did in the past. Love you guys♥️
Omg the wig looks so good on you!!!
she looks soo good with pink hair.. and i love her with a mid part ;3
if you don’t want those jeans with the angel, i’ll buy them from you😂😂
I feel like the Frankenstein mug was a missed opportunity.  It could have been called the Fanken-stein.
My fave part: “Oh they do!!! They really do! Oh they do!!!”
you look just like marina diamandis!
God, she would love rogue and wolf so much if she just looked at their page lol
Am I the only one who saw her 'search' page has kpop!!! 👁️👄👁️
I like how the wig suits you
...... It's oregon like gin not gone
I legitimately love that first outfit!
The wig looks awesome on you. And your "colonial" look reminded me of Amish. But no matter what, you're beautiful!
Awesome video! Missed u
she looks absolutely AMAZING with pink hair omg
The "E-girl " looks great all together , I thought it wouldn't . But I'm actually impressed and happy about the whole look
Omg I when I heard the intro my head automatically finished will “weekly respill, yeah”! Tea spill used the same intro melody guy like you!
honestly the "e-girl" outfit would be perfect with a skirt. the jeans have some serious "mom jeans" vibes 😂
I wish so bad she would have tried on the pink wig with the witchy outfit. That would be so cute 🥲😍
I love her skin , she’s like glowing !😍
We love VA
That memes of production joke tho. She didn’t give credit where it was due. That was gold
Is that not Jenna Marbles house? lol
It would be cool to see safiya try out trends. I need some education on those anyway lol.
The way you pronounce Oregon 😂
That witch outfit hits different. Oof- amazing.
*love love love these videos 💕😩👏*
She looked so amazing in the second outfit. Like, she rocked it. I think she could model for a similar brand. XD
I love that the references range from 90s tv shows to Gen Z pop culture and Shakespeare 😍
OMG, I have seriously missed you guys!!
Yaasss the introoo sonnggg
Those masks are cute! Can you provide a link to the shop(s) you got them from?
YOU SHOULD DO DRESSING LIKE AN AMERICAN GIRL DOLL FOR A WEEK
Can we all just admit that Saf looks great in every outfit?  Also good job Tyler with the wig
Unplug the generator! Lol!
the shirt from the second look gave me goth Hisoka from hunter x hunter vibes
I actually think that the pink look was really good and worked well together (except for the contrasting pinks of the wig and the jacket). Is it actually cute or am I just fashionably blind?
the first look was very Anne with an "e"
I think the pink wig is such a vibe on you!! I like it!! It is fun!!
Such a big mood incorrectly referencing E-Girls. It took me way too long to understand....I’m only 26 but TikTok has aged me a lot 😫
As someone from Oregon, your pronunciation made me cringe 😬
I’ve never heard it called Oregon before, I have always pronounced it Oregon.
Hello fello kids I am one of you  The best pick me up really made me laugh
Please try out crazy shoes from the insta shop tab
I'd love you if you would go full  blown cyber goth. With neon and black and your hair done too.
I predict Saf and Tyler go to colonial Williamsburg in 2021
I think I saw totally spies or whatever those spy girls are from on TV at a hotel in Italy?
I think she got plastic surgery when in Korea
Okay, but why have you got so many missed phone calls and unread messages 😱 i can't stand any notifications on my phone!
ILYSM SAFIIIIIIIIIII
Love you saf and tyler....its a big wait for all your videos that's why its a sissy request if u guys can make vlogs ik with vids its take a lot of time to edit so you can make fun vlogs and challenges maybe in tyler's channel
Once again, I have spent 38-minutes watching a video on a subject I care absolutely nothing about, just so I can be awash in the splendor that is Safiya: The most gorgeous woman I have ever seen in my entire life.  Thank you, Saf & Tyler, for making me so happy.
when talking about a baby, she said “we are not there yet”. emphasis on “yet” !!!!
Can you do a ASMR?
Do a collabe with Abby Cox, historical costumer and used to work at colonial Williamsburg.
house is so beautiful
8:42 “I would love to go there for a video if anyone who works there is watching” It’s me! I work there! Please come! It would be awesome!   Though I will disappoint you on the butter-churning up front. (Especially in this, Our Year Of Plague 2020!) I know of one butter churn and it is very very broken!
Looking back to when Nathan Triska played 'Guess The Post' with Marina Leigh! https://youtu.be/3zkBonNZkA4
The laces are too long bc you are suppose to wrap them around the boots ankle
You look cute with pink hair, just like a bubblegum biker. ❤😊
I used to work at colonial Williamsburg and still live in the area. If you come for a visit i would love to meet you! 😁💜
Loving the attention to Virginia from this video
That black outfit is really flattering on your body!!
Everytime I see a nee video of yours in my feed I feel so happy <3 I really liked the second outfit, and I'd love to see a whole video trying historical-y fashion
The girl group in the igtv is twice
He is doing this to save his life😩💛 https://youtu.be/tYjyTBZLdS8
SAF... COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG IS DOPE!!! U GOTTA GO! As a local virginian, I can assure you that it is one of the best places in va! I reccomend you stay at the Historic powhatan resort, and plz also visit Jamestown as well as Busch Gardens! I love the feel of thetown, and there is also good shopping downtown! I love your channel!!! PLZ DO COME TO COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG... ITS LIT!
Omgggggg I’m obsessed with the wig and the pink jacket!!!!!!!
Tuck the extra leather straps into the hoops and it'll feel less awkward. Hope that helps. :)
The Witch outfit was 👌
I wish you posted more love your videos 😢
Oh my god you’re so cute!!!! In every single outfit!!
Happy anniversary you guys. You make an awesome team. My husband of 35yrs passed away from cancer 4mths ago. I spent many hours watching your video's. Thanks for making me smile. Wishing you many years of happiness!!!
WHERE WAS THE “SPOILED” PINK SHIRT!?!?!? I thought you ordered it!
If you ever do a video at Colonial Williamsburg let us know in advance I live down the road from there.
Okay so answer to you question, yes it is a E Girl But it is a type of fashion called Pastel E Girl. My Best friend found that style a while back and she hasn't changed since
I think you mean...cherubum. 🤣
Theres kpop on her insta 😍😍😍😍
Safiya's videos are amazing
This is  Safiya's  New  Intro soong!!!
when you showed up to open the packages i genuinely smiled like wow... you’re radiant.
The black skirt and the power puff girl tank would slay together
Not me thinking that she’s at Jenna Marbles house. 😒 I literally love them both and i think that would be iconic😆
I would've thought you tuck the excess over-skirt belts into the rings?? But maybe that's just me XD
You look so pretty with pink hair!
I would genuinely love for someone (preferably Saf) to investigate all the 'innovative bras' that instagram advertises to me... plenty of them look sus... but maybe some of them are good
Anyone remember her sims life videos
The wig definitely looks great!!! I definitely want one 😂
The witch outfit looks so gorgeous!!
I post nail art on occasion. I follow a couple goth accounts, and a Jewish bakery. I got nail stuff and merch from the bakery on my feed. 0 goth stuff. -.-
do you live in jenna marbles house?!
As someone from VA, I greatly appreciate the "virginia joke" haha You should totally do a Colonial Williamsburg video. I went there to hang out all the time as a teenager/young adult.
Following you on ig and seeing the effort you put into your vids= auto thumbs up
colonial safiya with her hair down looks like a girl who would definitely get burned at the stake in Salem, MA for witchcraft
Watching Saaf walking around so happy in her outfits brings a smile to my face
Your house is super cute! Can we get a tour?
lol was that jenna marbles house?
Colonial Williamsburg is amazing! My grandparents live near there, and my mom worked there when she was a teenager.
Safiya, you and Tyler should get custom-made leather jackets :3
Instagram keeps giving me ads for men's underwear, especially ones that have a pouch for the peepee so it doesn't stick to anything. I fear the more I talk about it, the more ads I'll get. and as a cis woman, I really don't need these nor do I need more ads for them
I love your shirt during the unboxing. Where did you get it?
safiya the middle part with that hair length is so flattering on you!
you look good with pink hair!!!!
I still don't know what the hell an E girl is so as far as I'm concerned you dressed as one 🤷🏼
Y’all she straight up raised me
The 3rd one is my daily color scheme 💕☺️ I even have a pink mask covered in diamond gems to match 💎👌everyone stares/smiles/asks where to buy it.
I want those moon shoes
time sure flies fast when i watch your video
The witch outfit would look better with purple lipstick.
I loved the second outfit and the pink jacket!
I really love the wig it looks super cute!!!
I LOVE THE JACKET!!!
SHE  Y E A R N S  TO  C H U R N
ok Saf's face is glowing here! wow
With the last on if you had matching pants or skirt to the jacjet
Did Saf sniff a flower through her mask?? What?
We NEED more mixing things
Since you enjoy making fashion related videos, I thought it'd be cool if you made a video (or more) about "Kibbe Image ID's" or "Kibbe Body Types".
Maybe I’m saying this too early because I haven’t seen all outfits yet but.... that alternative witch outfit is ABSOLUTELY the best and I feel suits Safiya more.
I could legit watch her for hours
Am I crazy, or does it look like she moved into Jenna Marbles's house when you see her doing the unboxing??
I love the amount of effort that you and Tyler put into your videos!
I can see Kpop on your recommended feed uwu 😂🥺
I mean.. I bet Tyler likes the skirt overalls ;)
I love the wig!!! Also you and jenna marbles have the exact same house omg
Anyone know where I can get those face masks? 🥺
Is no one else gonna talk about her home screen?
the third outfit looked good from the waist up!
I’m LOVING the pink hair!! It looks so cool!!😎
god i MISSED watching you. your videos are so chill and filled with good vibes this is just what i needed today
ok but lookin like a straight up snacc in the third outfit i'm shook
Safiya how on earth did the colonial outfit look good on you? You have such a way that makes everything look beautiful on you no matter what. I love your videos! Sending you love from the UK <3
With every video, you look more and more like morticia adams (I’m PRETTY sure you know that this is meant to be a compliment but just in case you don’t...it’s the biggest compliment I can think of because she is goals)
i do not like how they pronounce oregon
saf is giving me straight up morticia vibes with the long hair
Safiya pulled of that second outfit great.
Loved this
For some reason when she put hearts under her eyes she looked a lot like Sandra bullock
I LOVE all three looks! <3
Love this video girl!!! U always have me bagging up!!! I love the witch outfit but I had an idea for you... try tucking the straps inside the wholes. Then you won’t have “nipple tassels” 😂😂 and maybe it will make it less awkward feeling!! But girl keep up the funny content! And I LOVE how Tyler is ALWAYS down for anything and his cometary bags me up! I look bomb in that pink wig!!!!!!
Check out Abby Cox's channel, she mentioned in her livestream sunday that she wants to design & make a dress for you for CW. Her stuff is amazing btw!!!!
when I'm literally from Colonial Williamsburg and used to volunteer there in middle school
NEVER USED THE SHOP TAB... DIDN'T KNOW THAT THERE WAS ONE, TRUTHFULLY! HERE IS MY OPINION ON YOUR VIDEO:  I absolutely LOVE witch outfit the BEST❣️ (tuck in the straps through the hoops into the ACTUAL Dress! See how much of a difference it makes in the look...) I think it will make a WORLD OF DIFFERENCE❣️ Second favorite was the COLONIAL OUTFIT, WITHOUT THE BONNET (loved the hippie look)❣️Sorry, did not like the 3rd outfit for you😂🤣! You don't match in pastel colors. Keep these COMING, LOVE YOU GUYS ❣️ 💞 ALOHA FROM HAWAI'I 💞🌹 LYSSA 🌹
I feel like you're meant to thread the extra strap from the suspender skirt through the rings so they're not flappy
i'm glad i'm not the only colonial williamsburg lover! we went my sophomore year for our choir/band trip, and i fell in love! i'm hoping by next summer, covid will be under decent enough control so i can go again! love you, saf! x
Cottage-core Saf for life.
why is no one mentioning the fancam at 0:40 😭
I’m so jealous of the witchy boots, I’ve wanted to get them so bad but they’re so expensive
I love that witch outfit skirt & and the egirl eyes!!! 🖤
All yall
I love this video. I bought my sister a hoodie from insta shop and it wasn’t the best
i love honey ..
Omg I go to William & Mary (a university right next to Colonial Williamsburg) and it was so exciting seeing you talk about CW! I'm sure you'd be very welcome lmao
You should dress like American girl dolls for a week.
can we get a house tour
The one brand that kept putting the links on random pictures really is irritating
Me when looking at her explore page: OH MY GOD IS THAT CHAEYOUNG
You and Tyler are literally soulmates
I LOVE rouge and wolf. Their stuff is adorable
The fact that you kinda look like dua lipa. AMAZES ME
“I watched jersey shore when I was at a very impressionable age so the lines are seared into my head” *my brain INSTANTLY with “BURGERS FOR THE BOYYSSSS!!!”*
I love the wig on you! =)
“She’s a witch! Oh a witch! Killed her husband!”
the last makeup look and the wig are actually really nice
The black flower top she is Originally wearing before the outfits is so cute, I need it
You guys should a house tour!!!!
How do you go good with like every style
Hi! I just wanted to say that these looks looked amazing on you!
the not an egirl look is more like a soft girl look
Tyler's "Nevermind." spoke to me in every way possible lmao
Love Colonial Williamsburg.  And hot apple cider.  And your videos
I keep getting distracted! I start watching your video and then a few minutes later I’m trying to shop on Instagram 😳
She is absolutely beautiful in this video! She's gorgeous anyway but a global pandemic has been kind to her...which come to think of it seems very on-brand for the bat witch queen :)
they'd wanna be comfortable good quality shoes THEY COST 120 POUNDS..... This aint no wish haul.
i think pink looks sooooo good on u girll
Your 'e-girl' look SCREAMS Marina Diamandis
the house layout looks like Jenna marble's house.....am i missing something?
Ok but side note: where did Safiya get her mask those are definitely super cute
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78d3Z8yzp6A&t=4s great joint
you look so good in all the outfits! I’m obsessed!
I didn’t expect to love the second outfit but she looks badass!!! LOVE IT
I want all three of these ‘fits
She thcki tho
How people not from Oregon pronounce it 🤦🏼‍♀️
Oh my goodness such a great video (as always), and I would be here for a collab between you and @abbycox for all the Colonial Williamsburg butter churning!
You’re giving me HUGE mom Addams vibes and I love it!!!!
safiya was really SERVING looks in this video. Hair was on point, makeup on point, like she really was giving the girls LOOKS
You look SO GOOD with pink hair!!!!!
My virginian heart loved all the references  ❤ ♥
The witch outfit was the best one !!! the shoes were so adorable 😍😍 though i also like the 1800-1900 fit, too
all the twice stuff on your explore page 😭😭😭😭😭 exactly!!!!!
Ok but if I had that second outfit I would wear it ALL THE TIME the second one was my favorite
Safiya is a honorary Gilmore Girl.
i literally never heard about the selena gomez igtv movie until you mentioned it😭
ok
The pink wig gives me lavagirl vibes
Looks great love the pink hair
I absolutely LOVE the all black outfit on you!! ALL of it, even the straps with rings. It’s cool AF. You should keep it and wear them altogether. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Honestly, I love the third outfit! 😍😍
i would say its more of a soft egirl for the last look
✔✔✔✔✔✔
I can’t use Honey on my iPad. What!?! I did really enjoy the video.
sorry, i can't hold it more ¡JEJEJEJEJEJE! xD PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, PLEASE, FIND THE TRASLATION TO "MINGA" IN SPANISH... xD sorry, i love you both and the way you work, but... ¡YOU JUST SAY: my *_-"PEN IS"-_* blue ahem, ahem, AHEM... NOT A "PENCIL" i mean...that your *_PEN IS_* blue AAAAAAHHHHHHEEEEEEEMMMMM AHEM, AHEM xD  so please, STOP SAYING "MINGA" I'M GONNA DIE BY LAUGHT RIGHT NOW xD    ¡¡Chaoo!! ;-)  Edit: look here if you don't trust me xD https://www.spanishdict.com/translate/minga  (Also... is used ONLY in SPAIN due the "traslations" that i see... but... MINGA, STILL MINGA xD)
Okay but you KILLED that second outfit!!😍
Let’s face it, any other youtuber would clickbait-name the video ”MARK ZUCKERBERG IS TRYING TO KILL ME” because of 6:44 😂
Safiya : arent we all inspired by sammy sweetheart  Me : who the f*** is that
For the last outfit the wig and the tang top doesn't match xD.. the pants and the jacket go well together.  I want the moon shoes, the black skirt and the pink jacket💜💜
What’s your skincare routine Saf:(
@BurnleyandTrowbridgeCo 8:41 she wants to visit Colonial Williamsburg - please make it happen! <3
The jokes and commentary during the pioneer outfit had me DYING! 😆
Loooove the pink wig but I’d recommend plucking it a bit and adding concealer to the part ❤️ you could totally pull off dying your hair that color
The wig looks good. Well done 👏 ✔
Nipple witch!
That looks e-girl to me
Try tucking the akward straps into the rings and under the top part of the skirteral
As somebody from Oregon, I was lowkey shocked & repulsed by the way they pronounced Oregon lol
0:38 haha same that’s what my recommendation ig page looks like too
Ok but the second outfit looked SO GOOD ON YOU
As a Brit, I feel like Min-ga London should be pronounced Ming-eh like the word minger.
Okay some one tell me where to get that witch shirt thing cuz it’s awesome
I’m waiting for the “fashion through the ages” mask edition. Plague masks. Death masks. Terrifying 70s halloween masks.  I’m sure there’s non-creepy or morbid options too, but...I mean the options.
Oh my goodness "Gluing Every Mug From Cracker Barrel Together" video idea :)
im having flashbacks to the time i got heatstroke at colonial williamsburg as a kid and puked all over one of the historical rooms
This was a lot of fun!
Why is your face so white?
I love the implications that Safiya watches enough TWICE content to have it all over her explore page lmfaooo
Is it just me or dose anyone else want to see more full goth Safiya?
wow her channel turns 9 exactly today. Happy birthday
I guess you could say....she had her heart on her sleeve
The pink jacket would be super cute over an all black outfit!
Jeffre star velvet trap review .... maybe...please.
25:48 Hocus pocus.  I approve of this reference.
Tyler:  points out some small detail on the chain near her butt me: why is he looking there?
I love that you looked at a photo that I had almost fall the clothing pieces from and went "Now, that's straight up goth!" I can die happy now
You need to do a Mary Shelley week because she is the mother of all Goths. Also, you can help do some reeducation on corsets.
bro 2 mil saved?? jesus thats like- a lot
Am I the only one who keept shouting soft girl at there computer while watching this
I love the historical love. I just wish for the money, someone who is putting out actually accurate or even accurately inspired 18th &19th century clothing was being promoted 😒
do we not all live with sammi sweetheart as our due north?
You’re the best! :)
Pink hair suits you so good!
I love those shooeeessss !!!!!
3:54 oh hey there, Bernadette Banner x American Duchess colab shoe! EDIT: 4:41 American Duchess full screen yeeesss
the last outfit is so cute 🥺
I feel like a beanie would have been better with that last look and tied more of it together Tho the cherub jeans definitely didnt go and was the most random lol
Lol Saf trying to be Weird al's wife in Amish paradise!
I love that Tyler is just as excited for every item if not more than Saf 😂
SAFIYA FOLLOWS theyasminbenoit!!!! :O
The last outfit is “the baddie”
instagram was like: she's either a 2020's witch, or a 1690's witch
theres an igtv app ..??
That pink outfit is SO CUTE and is giving me alter-ego vibes for you
That Hocus Pocus reference was SPOT ON!! Loved it
I live in colonial Williamsburg!!! ill give ya the GRAND TOUR! (there's a ghost tour too!!)
Oooh! Think the belt-like straps on the skirt-eralls are supposed to be tucked into the rings! Not that it helps the placement, but maybe will minimize the "tassel" look? :)
I SAW TWICE
The black outfit looked really good, and the wig looked great.
I can attest that Virginia is for reenactors. (And lovers, tbh!)
ok but her kitchen/living area is IDENTICAL. did she buy her house?
Saf, why didn’t you tuck the straps into the skirt lol
*who would love to meet Safiya?*
gotta say, as an Oregonian, hearing "ore-gone" kinda hurt my soul a bit
omg you look sooooo good in jeans like in the soft girl outfit
First outfit...eh, it looks good for a costume but hard to comment on it as anything else.  Second Outfit, the boots are amazing, tuck the strap ends into the rings, I'd either remove the stitching of everything but the moon or put a patch/applique over the witch part.  I think all 3 parts are great just not together.  In fact I'd wear the top from the first outfit with the skirt-all instead.  3rd outfit, love the idea. love the jacket.  the wig looks like it is REALLY good quality if it looks that good without proper prepping. The top and jeans I'd throw in the trash though, or maybe cut out the power puff girls and use it as an applique on something else XD.
HIII💕
does anyone know where the floral black and white blouse she's wearing is from???
Lowkey, I want her to try out Cottagecore or Dark Academia styles, just to see what she thinks
I love ur content!!!!!!
middle part safiya is such a vibe
There’s got milk! OHHHHHH! It is a pun! 😂😂😂😂😂
i see in your explore page there’s itzy twice and i think blackpink 😳
I love how in this video she is just know getting to know the CORONA lol and now we know all about it you can tell this was filmed a little bus ago lol 😂
I love how she still uses this intro song
Safiya what have you done. I'm too broke for those boots
Would love to se you make a video with wigs!
There's something so satisfying about saying the intro at the same time as Safiya
18:15 she so shiny like a porcelain doll with her big cheeks and glass face, who else is completely jealous of how pretty safiya is?
I need that mushroom mask!!! Where did u get it?
Let’s go trending
I love twice on your explore page yeah
If you were to wear the "colonial" outfit in the Midwest, people will assume you were Amish.
you know in every sponsor video I will just skip that part and they would still make money soooo.......
Minga London is all over my shop too!!?
I can vouch for anything from Miss Patina, I LOVE that brand
That black outfit is like OMG SO YOU And aslo I'm buying these boots, they are gorgeous
I think Saf looks really cute in the pink outfit! LOVE IIITTTTT~ <3
You looked AMAZING with the pink wig! and it looks great with your eyebrows!
This was great! Found some new sites to follow.
You look so good with a middle part 🥺🥺🥺
Hey Saf - when I have shoes w too-long laces, I actually just tuck the excess laces (or even the whole bow) into the top of the shoe!  It gives a pretty slick, clean look (as long as it is tied well enough that the motion of walking doesn't rub the knot undone.  This doesn't usually happen though).
She looks like Nikki manji
What would u do without social media ???? https://youtu.be/YhoqofwQ2TI
Am I the only one trying to search for the moon boots 😭😭 I want them so bad!!!!!!!!
ONE TIME I BOUGHT SOMETHING FROM PVSEUR AND THEY TOOK LIKE 5 MONTHS apparently its someone just reselling stuff from alliexpress lol
If I get 100 likes on this comment saf will dye her hair pink  Thanks for the likes
we need the frankenmug
"OR-GONE TRAIL" whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
i’ve heard ne-vah-duh for NV, but I was SHOOK when I heard or-eh-gone
That tank and jacket would look v good with the skirtall.
Hello from williamsburg!
Well now I'm going to my instagram and check out the shop tab 😅.
Only OG's will remember when Saf went on Fiverr to get her into
I love those jeans and top together but not the jacket but the outfit looks great on you
“hello fellow kids, I am one of you” I AM SCREAMING
The “not an E-Girl” stuff is more Y2K fashion (fashion inspired by the 2000s and, sadly, a lot of stuff (mostly stolen) from feminine black fashion) With a little bit of like.... lowkey lolita? (Idk the specific fashion style name— but it’s kinda under pastel goth and lolita)
Daddy saf posted
Okay Safiya now do an e-girl/cottage core transformation video
19:08 100% thought this was Jenna and Julian’s house
Honestly, if you ever want to try changing your look, the colonial wench might be up your alley. You looked really at home in it!
Why did you stop posting afton I got really worried when you didn't post for 3 months
"Story Time: MARK ZUCKERBERG IS TRYING TO KILL ME?!?!"
They aks me if I know honey...HA! I follow Macdoesit
Is it me or safiya lose weighttt????
Pvsuer is just drop shipped from Ali express u just bought a top for double the price 🥲
TOTALLY SPIES was my jam back in the day
I really hope a kid  who watches this and whose parent works in Colonial Williamsburg pleads with them to hire her to go churn butter there!
Merengue's goal is to be a pastry chef, and with that, we put up a baking area outside her home where you can have a free taste of her sweet creations. 🍰🎂 (done filming, gotta edit in a bit) 🌟
OreeeGON sounds like a trading card... Oreeeegon cards. It's Or-eh-gun  Oregon
I think Tyler did a good job with the wig!
27:02 I think you could probably put the flappy ends of the straps through the rings so it lays inside the skirt, and it'll kill two birds in one stone since you'll no longer have the whole ring framing the nips and the ends of the straps will be tamed.
Nevermiiindd
the colonial outfit made me cackle so hard
obsessed with the second outfit tbh
The third one the pink is a visco girl
oh my god I just love Safiya with the pink wig
Those black shoes thooooo I’m in love I want those so badly
Yeaaaa!! the intro song is back. I love it
I love the mask you wore with the witchy outfit 🥺
the pink outfit looks perfectly coordinated to me
no i hate your new intro I miss the old one i dont have the same vibes
The guy at 14:32 looks kinda like Tyler. With the velvet skirt, try tucking the strap flaps into the buckle circles so they're inside instead of awkward.
Nooooo it's not Ore-ih-GONE, it's ORE-ih-gin! Like origin but with a hard G! Also yes, first outfit is 100% Oregon Trail vibes.
As an Oregonian, I want to help. Please say Oreg-In, not Ore-gon
Crusty is the only baby sofia and Tyler need right now
Can I just say you are adorable for having matching mask.
mirrorverse jenna marbles mansion monkaS
0:37 chaeyoung is that you?!?!
lowkey want her to do a drag show and have Trixie do her makeup
Lowkey wish I could have seen the last outfit with your actual hair instead of the pink weave
Blackcraft is a great brand🖤🥀
you look so gorgeous in the wig :3 <3 :O all those outfits are super cuuute
Oh MY BANANAS 🤩 Safiya looks like a whole different w long hair, you look amazing Safiya 😻
Congratulations on your baby, Brynnleigh Fern
We love how twice popes up everywhere
Please dye your hair pink or maybe a dark purple pink! It suits you very well!👏
Minga.. m ing ah 😂. Like minger, like if your British you get why that ain’t a great name.
i started a separate insta to cultivate the perfect insta shop page, im an indie/cottagecore/modern vintage style with hints of goth and egirl, anyone got some brands to recommend?
I think the white shirt from the first outfit would look so good under the black dress from the second outfit
That sugar, spice, everything nice move killed me 🤣🤣🤣
ok but i need a "dress like a e girl for a week" now
part 2 pzzz
safiya as a cosplayer the way you are handling that wig is making me stressed
I’m sorry what!? A Selena Gomez horror movie!?!?!?
It’s not e girl but it’s kinda soft girl fashion
You guys are Jenna and Julians neighbors aren’t you 😉😏
I looked at the labels on the tank top packaging and cringed. I worked at USPS and those particular shipping labels are an absolute nightmare to ship! The scanner rarely picks up the barcode so they have to be put into the system by hand every time they need to be scanned.
was it only me who saw that twice was on he explore page????
also; ITS TEESHIRT TIME
Actually love that skirt over all situation with those shoes! Loveee. Be super cute with a white top under it 😍
that poseur shop or whatever is deffinnnnitteeelllyyyy a dropshipper.
Kinda want you to wear the wig with the goth outfit.
I loved this video!!!! So much fun!! You are so hilarious and I missed you!
i’m from oregon- so when you pronounced it like that i was woe- 😳 i honestly have never heard it said like that
there is literally no way that you don't live in jenna marbles' house
Yea you’re fs living with jenna
I wish your videos were a little shorter safiya..I used to love watching them but they're half a movie long 🙄
Lmao can we make the video idea of you smashing all of your mugs and gluing them all back together? 🤣
im sorry did you say orgon???? cuz pretty sure its pronounced like organ. 'Oregon'
https://youtu.be/pET-Kx1KDyA
Why does every house in LA have that layout 😂😂😂
The baby in the video is my niece and the photographer is a friend!
I follow rogue and wolf and as soon as i clicked on this video i thought you would like them
i thought that was jenna marbles house 🥲
I LOVE that witch outfit!
safiya is so pretty it’s insane omg style icon
the pink looks so good bro
there are actually a lot of different interpretations of the term "e-girl" and i've seen a ton of softer e-girl looks like the one you wore.
She looks so good!!❤️😍 idk if it’s just me but she looks slimmer
Does anyone know where I can buy those masks ? btw Loved the video
Hello friend...... you always look good in your comfy colours (black) but you look so great in pink!!!!!! Love,love,love the pink hair
Or e gone trail lol 😂
the powerpuff crop top from poseur is a rip off of OMIGHTY! support the original brand!! <3 (this isn't hate I'm just mentioning it)
am i stupid or is safiya's house the exact same as jenna's?
😭🤣😭😍😭. "A pair of lightwash dad jeans with an angel on the butt. Oh yeah, they also say angelic on the other cheek.  This is perfect!". These are not words I ever expected to hear someone string together, but you make it work, Safiya 😂
okay, but she looks absolutely stunning, she's literally glowing🥺🥺
i loved all the outfits on her
I wake up at midnight and go to YouTube surfing and I find this video. Not only am I super excited that it's a new Safiya video but the fact that there's a shopping cart section on Instagram took my breath away!
you raised me up when my family didn’t and Ilysm
You look so good in pink hair!!
The skoverals straps need to go through the hole so they don't dangle. Just like a belt, just a tip!
SHES BACK
For what i received i passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the scriptures   1 Corinthians 15 3
That hair colour tho
Does Safiya only upload once a month? Or is she uploading on somewhere else and in not aware of this?  Much love.
Are you a once 😳?
So you're sure you aren't in Jenna Marbles's house?
The witch one Safiya looks great in
Safiya in the pink wig is some queen shit
My shop tab has a lot of home decor, makeup products, and nails
Honestly, the last outfit on you is my absolute favorite and the pink wig looks amazing on you
Hasn’t the shop tab been there for a while??? 😂
Safiya a ONCE? saying this because i see bdz by twice in her discovery page
i can roller skate
So disappointed in her videos that take for ever to come out anyhow!! Love the comments on her house, seriously what do these kids do anyhow to afford it.  Really sad about this youtuber, she use to be one of my favs.
Peasant blouse and goth overall skirt would be a bomb look
Is that house not literally identical to Jenna and Julien's?
I- I think I may have that skirt from wish...but I got it from amazon... *freaks out*
Me in Virginia: 🥺🥺my state is being mentioned!!!!
I didn’t get a notification for this video so I’m glad I looked!
as a Washingtonian it bothered me the way they said oregon like “oré gone”
Your face mask looks adorableee! Where did u get it? 😊 the witch outfit is soooo good!
Ooooh! Instead of smashing your own mugs, Safiya should go to thrift stores and buy a bunch and try to Frankenstein them but also try a lot of those different viral "fixing" ceramics life hacks.
138 text messages?? Safiya is really out here flexing on us
The first outfit is all Wight when you where all black r u ok saf ?😐
"Or-eh-GONE" 😂🤦🏻‍♀️
Yes! Another haul video! It seems like it's been forever. 💗
My shop tab is pretty small lmao - idk if it's my region or sth with my scrolling habits but yeah not much & not really catered
You are such a beautiful and gorgeous angel😍😘
Me: wait wait wait hold up. Is Safiya a Once ? Her recommended page on IG is full of Twice. ♥️
I thought everyone knew about the shop thing to be honest I can’t remember a time before it
Does anyone else think she uses in the beginning voiceover sounds like one of those surprise eggs kids accounts
Safiya, where did you get the mask (the galaxy one)? It looks like it fits really well.
Does anyone know where she got the galaxy mask? Sorry if it was in the video, I don't remember seeing it!
The second outfit y'all ...
I can't even imagine how your closet looks, you must have so many clothes!
I’m I the only one that call her style mother goth 😂
I'm sorry but "you can control the MEMES of production" was genius. As always, Safiya and Tyler make me laugh so much
Guys, its ORI GUN  :)    and continue on.....
.... that's not how you pronounce Oregon. But you look good.
I love the pink hair!!
I ALWAYS cook, I ALWAYS clean, I’m a colonial Williamsburg queen 👑.
Okay I want to see the colonial top, the black skirt, the moon boots, the wig and the pink jacket together please! thanks.
I like that the Sanderson sister were mentioned
The style that you thought was e-girl I’m pretty positive it’s soft girl
Shopping clothes on the internet  Me: 70% don't fit, 25% makes me look like a potato, 5% is actually good Safiya: everything fit and is beautiful <3
I like the last outfit the best actually
You look so good! I missed your videos!
you can actually use acetone to get rid of the “witch” on that shirt!
You guys are ADORBS. I love the way you laugh with each other and are so supportive of each other! I just smiled through the entire video! 😁
I kinda wished she would have done a mashup outfit at the end.  Like the colonial williamsburgh top, witchy skirt, pink jacket or something.
I just really enjoyed this video thank you Safiya and Tyler! Also I think the wig looked good 😌
Does anyone else think that pink jacket would look adorable with the “skirt-erall” or am I just tacky?
is it just me who thought saf was in jenna marble's house
I NEED THE LINK TO THOSE SHOES, PLEASE. THEY ARE MY ASTHETIC OMG.
Did she say Almond Brothers!? 😂😂
I love the dark eyebrows with the pink hair! The pink color complements your skin tone so well!
I spit my hot chocolate out when she said "comfortable vampire"
Bible prophecies are happening like never before, we're in the end times. Are you saved by believing in the Blood of Jesus Christ? John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life. Christ said, "Come to Me as you are." It's not about not sinning (we should as we're thankful and build heavenly treasures), it's about having faith from the heart that Jesus lived the perfect life we couldn't and you're given eternal life. On the cross Jesus said, "It is FINISHED!" The Blood of Christ IS enough! God wants to give you salvation from damnation, all you have to do is have faith in what Christ has done for us.  End Time's Checklist https://youtu.be/A159GcAffpI  Satan's Technology https://youtu.be/4IyPCGKFa0k  (He also has Spanish versions.)
Ok but can we talk about how good Safiya’s makeup looked in the last fit!
With the skirt overall thing aren’t you supposed to put the excess straps through the rings?
I loved the witch outfit except the shirt. It resembles the cover of a certain book with the same logo on their cover that is very transphobic and ignorant.
i need those jeans :'(((((
all my "shop" is just stores already follow. Maybe i havent scrolled down enough.
Dress like a BRATZ doll for a week!!!!!!! Omg.
Well I didn't know it but I guess I need to get Power Puff Girl pants. I'm almost 25...
SAFIYA. Looking like a WHOLE. ASS. MEAL. throughout this entire video, queen. Hothothothothot.
GOGOGABRIELLA WAS ON THE EXPLORE PAGE
Maybe if you went down a few holes on the straps the holes wouldn't be right on the boobs 🤣 overall ... my fave look of the 3 😁
j
Hey S a f i y a why didn't you just go to the Amish Country
I'm probably one of the kpop editors on her explore page 😭
the powerpuff girls top was bootleg/copied from omighty that's why the quality was bad, the listing photos were also taken from the mighty website so definitely suss buying direct from omighty if you like their prints <3
I loved your black outfit look! You looked so cute!
So much colonial 😂
The "Not E-girl" look is Safiya's evil twin...
34:26 pink definitely looks good on you
Is no one going to talk about her Home Screen
i love the pink wig on you! looks so cute
The witch one is my favorite!
I laughed at everything this was so fun!
I love the wig!!!
completely the wrong thing to take away from the video, but does anyone know where to get that pastel galaxy face mask? 😂😂 I've been searching around but haven't found it *anywhere* 😂
Hello Safiya! I think you're such a respectful YouTuber! You always spend so much time on your videos. I have rewatched them countless times. You are such a nice person and I love your references and silly comments. I adore your videos. I love all of them especially your fashion, food, and Franken ones! You are so funny and I recently just found out about you. I have been obsessed with you ever since. I don't like to idolize people but I respect you so much! You and Tyler are so cute together and I hope you're doing good in Covid. I enjoy watching your videos which include bat wings, Tyler, and fun. I love your collabs and my sisters love you too. You have a great fashion sense and I never get tired of your Office references and all of your fun videos. I'm very grateful for you on YouTube and once again I love your videos! You might not see this but I hope you enjoy reading my comment! By the way can you do more of your Safiya's New Intro Song?
i wantes to see the last one without the wig too
I reeeally liked the ''E-girl'' look!
Love the pink wig!  Great job Tyler!
THE PINK WIG ITS SO GOOD
yay
Saf in pink hits different
If those boots werent so expensive I'd buy them in a heartbeat
Love the witchy outfit, but that pastel outfit was like a throwback to an 80’s monstrosity. And since I was an 80’s kid, it’s giving me serious cringe.
Giving me Lava girl vibes with the wig!!
Why do her videos feel like documentaries Wierd but I love it 😆
BY THE WAY SAFIYA YOUR SKIN LOOKS AMAZING!!!
I am absolutely living for that last outfit on you! Ill take the jacket and the wig aaaaaand everything else when you're done with them! lol but dang safiya you looked like a bad b in your WiTcH outfit!!!
Is it me or yall see twice cheyoung and nayeon on her search tab :)
HELLO FRIENDS!! hehe, who all is watching in the middle of the night?? here is a quite lengthy deep dive into the shop tab that i had a really fun time filming - i feel like i'm lowkey exposing myself & my instagram habits in this video, but that's ok 😂let me know what's on your shop tab in the comments below! xoxo, saf
i liked the third outfit! thought it worked :)
Yooooo I’m not a wig expert or anything, BUT..... I’d DEFINITELY say that Tyler did a great job for his first time!! PROPS TYLER!
I really need "Let Me Churn The Butter, Please." on a tshirt all of a sudden.
hey saf!! i think it would be a super cool video idea to see you try and “upcycle” your clothes! like on the skirt-overalls outfit you could cut the straps off and put new ones on. i just think it would be cool to see how the clothes you get for videos can maybe be turned into something else you would wear more regularly!
love how your explore page is basically kpop
this is now my favorite channel
nothing relaxes me more than safiya's the internet made me buy it vids
Oh I love Minga London! I got the jeans w the hearts on them and the matching skirt to the pink jacket. Just wish they weren't so expensive, I need more
Me like who is Sammy
You suit the witch outfit so much omg
Well ... Im gonna buy that whole second outfit.
Rouge and Wolf! I've been following them for so long, definitely would recommend them for alternative/gothic clothes
Yessssssss someone putting RESPECT on Josefina's name! I LOVED Josefina as a kid!
l
Abby Cox used to work at Colonial Williamsburg and said she'd love to show you around there in her recent Livestream! She's excellent! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiXol9ugjOxHHrpkdD0fZZg
I'm so happy to see a new video 😭🖤🖤🖤 also I love the witch outfit!! Super cute
okay but its tripping me out why does your house look identical to Jenna Marbles?????? It looks identical
Is no one going to talk about Tyler being her home screen and how funny the picture is? I mean it’s adorable but also hilarious😂😂
Tys "grenades" impression 😂😂😂😂
Love love love seeing your new vids! Just wanted to add. Every time I put your videos on my TV, your soothing voice calms my newborn and helps her sleep.. I like that she loves watching these as much as I do lol
twice on your explore page afjakljfakhf
The last outfit is way more soft girl XD
the Suspender skirt is suppose to be worn down more, like the straps should be loosened a little.  ... i really liked it so i looked it up to see what sizes it comes in and maybe see if i can find one that not a velvet/Suede and in all the pictures the "rings" are right under the bewbies, the straps are looser and the waise is just a little lower. <3 I am now gonna buy one after i get paid next week XD
The jeans would actually make really cute cut offs
for reference its "Or-gun" not "oreh-gone" :) local here.
I bet if you replaced the jeans with a black skirt the outfit would actually work, because I think the power puff shirt goes with the jacket
i have the goth milk bag, i love it!
i'm 3 minutes in and i already spotted TWICE on the explore page 3 times soooo i guess Safiya or Tyler is a ONCE?
Saf you look SO good in the witch look!!!
Can't help you with Colonial Williamsburg, but you can always tag along with me to a War of 1812 reenactment. My family and I have been reenactors at Mississinewa 1812 in Marion, Indiana for years now, and I think you'd have fun. :)
*"Mark Zuckerberg is trying to kill me"*  -Safiya 2020
In your instagram page only kpop recommendations i see
how is no one mentioning TWICE Chaeyoung suddenly appeared on the explore page at 0:36 😍😍😍😍😍
21:20 Ahhh I live in Oregon and it’s pronounced Or-gin like kin with a g.
“It’s impossible to pull of a colonial Williamsburg, modern morticia AND a cute pastel look” Safiya: hold my beer
Tyler did good, needs to be plucked but good.
The third look is confused "vaperwave instamodel" meets "90s kid nostalgia fashion". With a hard "BAM" of "juxtapose-sweetheart". That kinda [sl*t written on a pink wooden board decoed with epoxy frosting] energy.
堍
@dietgoth_ is my instagram handle
why is no one talking about how on her explore page there’s so many kpop girl groups 😌😌 we stan TASTE 💅🏻
I just love Tyler's comentary so much! That is all, please go about your day :)
Omg can you make your angelic jeans to booty shorts those would look so cute and hem line folded 🤗🤗😆🥰 I kinda want them just to see how they would look like shorts
I really LOVED the witch outfit!! It suited Safiya SO good!
Safia even looks amazing in a fricken mask, like wtf girl.
Idk why, but I just love these videos. I guess bc I'm always worried about buying stuff on social media. Hope you guys are doing well!
Safiya, are you following Butch Wax Vintage?!  She’s the BEST!!  Hands down.
WOW, dang your house looks insane similar to Jenna Marbles' house LOLOLOLOLOL
I love that Saf and Tyler took time to just be married, possibly move, get their mental health in check. It just makes the occasional video that much more special
Gathering of Goods is anti-feminism. If you go to the website and Meet Sarah, they sell books that will not contain :"Magic, sorcery or witchcraft, Feminism- in any way shape or form". Not gonna support that. It totes it sells clothes for modesty.

Yay! It’s always a good day when you guys post! I’m obsessed with the pink wig on you!
When you were looking at all the pink outfits style I thought it was more inspired by kpop of the things you like
Great idea to get a matching face mask for each outfit. The galaxy themed one is especially cute.
Loved all 3 looks
Instagram: Are you a witch or a civil war actor of Civil War? Safiya: Yes
If she doesn’t like the suspender flaps she can probably just tuck the extra through the rings and inside the skirt. (Btw that was my fav outfit and it looked great on her)
Tyler's "Memes of production" joke is peak Tyler punnation.  10/10. Chef's kiss. Heckin' good pun.
I noticed a few K-pop related things on her explore page👀 Edit: She said it afterwards😅
Did she say spoopy
Where's ore gone??
Also, Safiya, have you been working out!? You look so good! Maybe it’s just because I haven’t seen you for a while but you look so awesome in that “witch” outfit! Super flattering
I think all of them look good but the last one would be better without the wig
Can you review dolls kill
OMG I'M THE GIRL WITH THE "WITCH" TOP! Can't believe it 😂 My favorite outfit was the witchy one, but I might be biased 💁‍♀️
That lace front henny.
any body notice the twice part
The witch outfit is amazing!
Her love for Colonial Williamsburg is the best. It's pretty much the only reason I want to go there now. 😂
The mispronunciation of Oregon tho 😔
Was I the onlyyy one who skipped through the entire video 👁👄👁
Poze-uuhr :) Signed, a French-speaker 🥐
😂😂 I love how you have 118 missed calls and 138 unopened texts! LOLLL
“My fresh cream brings all the boys to the yard!” 😂🤣 the world needs Safiya rn
gotta say i'm a big fan of different masks to match each outfit. go hard or go home!!
SAFIYA IN BLACK ISTHE REAL DREAM
When Saf shops from punkrave for fun and you need to save money like 2 months to buy something like that😅🥺
Oh it's punk rave it'll be great but really expensive
Sofia is a ONCE♡
11:37. Safiya’s screen hahaha cute
“As our due North” 😂
I live in Williamsburg and work close to CW and the amount of references she makes to CW is truly horrifying
“soft girl”
She’s got those Ass angel jeans.
Safiya with Twice 🥰
for some reason i only have the list of the brands that I follow
Have you ever shopped on Large
I hope you eventually do a "shopping handmade artists on Instagram" someday! My cousin Sarah runs her leather tooling business WesternSkiesHandmade and makes/sells some amazing pieces ❤❤
Damn I missed that intro
I love the gothic outfit so much 🥰
you looked gorgeous in this video! simply glowing
SAFIYA TWICE FAN?🥰
I'm sorry but when you said "you all" my southern mind realized that not every one says yall all the time
Safiya u should definitely give candles hacks!!!!🕯️🤓
You hanging out with Jenna Marbles???
when I saw that badwing dress I REALLY wanted you to buy it! lord that one is amazing in so many ways! also side note, i'm so happy with the uploads being back, I need my Saaf in these hermit times!
Rabbit Hole, meet Safiya lol
Safiya, I am really inspired by everything you do! Thank you for being you.
I’d like to see “Pinterest buys my outfit”
You are awesome!!
You should make a Frankin chapstick or lip bomb!! ❤️❤️
Cotton candy hair lady in LA no one bats an eye - Colonial lady - everyone loses their damn mind. :)
Safiya, let’s just say you’re not the only one who dreams of churning butter while in a Colonial Williamsburg outfit, singing about how your butter brings all the boys to the yard.
I SWEAR I HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS FOREVER............ SHE LOKS JUST LIKE MORTICIA ADAMS
THOTICIA 😂😂😂😂😂😂💀💀💀💀💀
The wig is good, I feel like it just needs to be tweezed a bit.
I loved the milkmaid outfit
Safiya: IV'E CONNECTED THE DOTS Tyler: You haven't connected shit               if you don't get it its when she was saying the pastel look is and e-girl look
Love ya!!
0:36 lol, all the kpop girls in her explore page.
No ads?
This ‘fit Saf is wearing in the intro 🤭😍😍😍
the second person telling was ur name i think probably a fan
I fell in love with you in every single outfit!!! Also you need to try more wigs the pink one was so cool😍
I really love the vid but the witch stereotypes are killing me, we’re real guys and we’re not doing silly made up magic and eating kids
it’s more like a soft girl or anime girl not egirl
OMGAH TWICEEEEEE
I saw so many things I wanted. 😂
i have been watching safiya since i was 11 or 12, so for about two or three years, and im very pleased to announce that i am finally understanding the majority of her pop culture references
What she was calling E-Girl is Soft girl smh
I have so much vintage suggested and I never wear vintage or follow any vintage accounts! To be fair, I only follow dog accounts so it's hard to know what I would wear!
I am just here, droolling over the fact that I am in a Safiy video for Morticia vibes :O <3 :D
Omg how can you not love them 🤣🤣❤️
Let me just say one thing- I prefer black-haired, non-pastel Saf.
Who sings along to her intro lol. (I know I do..🤷‍♀️)
Where is the embroidered mask from? It's so cute
I like how her Instagram feed I just kpop mostly twice LAMKSJDJD
Actually I think that pink wig suited you SO DAMN WELL. It's strange because you are so not the pink type. And still
imagine what honey is selling for having so much Ad money available. Yeap, your data
Your wearing the bonnet backwards the lace gap should be in onth back.
THE CHAEYOUNG FANCAM AND NAYEON IN YOUR EXPLORE PAGE AAAA
Love the Pink wig on you!! Tyler did so well putting it on, cause I SUCK at putting them on. Would love to see the Pink wig and pink jacket matched with black jeans and a black tank.
About destroying mugs.. Thare is a Japanese style where wthey are fixing broken plates and ceramic with gold :D Need to see this on here ! :D Love your channel <3
Safiya throwing some prettypastelplease vibes!

Insomnia cured!
I also noticed all of what you said about instagram, the ads, algorithm, etc. when I scroll.
Everything you bought is actually what is on the pictures... Didn't get scammed at all! This makes me feel so happy.
There is an "Oregon Trail" card game... It's actually pretty fun and you can play with just 2 people.
The pink wig and pink jacket and moon shoes look good on you.  Also the masks look good too. 👍🏼
i love youuuuu
Virginia is for lovers is the only slogan we have here Safe!.  Lmao Please let us know if it's in the works.  Me and my family are planning a trip. And it would be cool to meet you. We live about an hour and a half away in Virginia Beach.  Colonial Williamsburg would be cool. There's a shop there called the green cauldren
I like your "e-girl" look altogether a lot. The stars under the eyes are super cute, even if it doesn't match the nostalgia vibes. The pink hair and dark eyebrows are very striking, and I think they look good with your skin-tone.
the last outfit gives me doodle bop vibes - anyone else?
wheres the baby or when?? hahah jk jk srry i was just so caught up with laruanzside being preg watch her vid!!
okay but when is the “i dressed like american girl dolls” video coming?!?!
18 on trending in the USA!
hey safiya. if you're complaining about stupid shoe length. do a butterfly knot. idk why you'd think a simple knot multiple times will fix your damn shoe laces smh.
Lovvviiinngg the Witch outfit
Trending!!! 😍😘😘
Safiyas personality is like the productive version of my adhd... 😆
That wig looks amazing on you!! Really suits your skin tone
I totally understand the whole baby ad thing after you get married. I got married last year and when I got engaged, it was nothing but wedding ads and rings. After I got married, I immediately started getting baby ads. So strange
That pink wig with Safiya's skin tone looked absolutely beautiful. Or rather Safiya herself looked beautiful. Also perhaps it's just me, but I kinda like the dark eyebrows with pink hair look. The first outfit is also something I was pretty fond of.
Loved the video!!! Thank you for all the hard work that went into it! 🥰🤩😍😘
Is it just me or does she have a nice glow to her skin
You have beautiful skin. What kind of Moisturizer do you use
I can’t get over how good Saf looked in the second outfit!!
Honey is a bunch of bullshit. it keeps claiming that there are coupon codes to be used but it keeps telling me "Coupons failed. you already have the best price available" when everyone else is buying with a coupon from honey. it's a bunch of lies
What’s funny is I would 100% watch a Franken-mug video
did anyone saw chaeyoung from twice? 0:38
Wearing a long, flowing skirt (or any type of old fashioned womens' clothing) always makes you happier. Every girl knows that.
Get at Abby Cox to realize your Colonial Williamsburg dreams!
did i just see twice?????
the third trend is Y2K aesthetic btw!!
Saf you never disappoint us with your content! :)
Wow have you been gyming girl phewww 🥰
Loved the video !
when you take off the bonnet and it show your hair and i just don’t know how to act???? like you’re so gorgeous and i can’t-
She looks like a mom trying to dress hip like her daughter.......
I want to see “I dressed like an American girl doll for a week”
Yes      Virginia
That masks look so ridiculous. The outfits looked better without.
hmm i see chaeyoung and nayeon omg. stan twice safiya!
I had no idea there was an instagram shop tab.
OregOn trail...  Oregonian's : oregn/oregen/oregun
So I looked at what Instagram recommended to me and its basically "makeup, makeup, black veil brides merch, makeup, makeup, black veil brides merch" that's literally it🤣
I would have loved to see Safiya in the "not e girl" outfit withour the wig. I really liked the jaket jeans combination on her!
Outfit three was amazing! The jacket is so cute!
Really thought it said nig*a all over the bag 18:19
Saf is absolutely gorgeous 😍 and somehow I have an urge to get a butter-churning outfit of my own..
Please please please come to Williamsburg!!!!! It would be soooooooo cool. Unfortunately though, they did re-paved the cobble stone road to a regular asphalt which was stupid. But it gets sooo pretty in winter time
The application of the wig looks really good, I'd suggest getting a better glue to attach the front hairline.. but the wig doesn't fit you.. the colours isn't suiting you.. I'd go more pastel if you ever buy a pink wig again xD
I like it
14:18 is NOBODY going to mention how she just crossed the bridge and BECOME Lauren  Like if you get the reference
23:40, Is it just me or does she looks like Susan from Chronicles of Narnia?
I LIVE IN COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG
I think thee historical dress you got would be perfect for you in black.  Hell I’d diy dye the outfit and get creative if I was you.
Oh my god Safiya is very very beautiful
Twice <3
♡ Could you make a "wearing modern "witch-inspired" outfits for a week"-video? I'd LOVE that! \(๑≧▽≦๑)/~♪ Also maybe a video showing how you style all the pieces in this video with stuff in your closet already for more everyday looks? Thank you for making very entertaining videos and best wishes to you! ♡
Where is crusty
Woah we really got her vid to #4 on trending 👑✨
Instead of Colonial Williamsburg, try Historic St. Mary’s City in Maryland.
I'm not a hundred percent sure, but I think the posure crop top art is stolen
The screenshot message prompts an error, change to normal
I kinda want Saf to do a “dressing like Alternative subcultures for a week” punk, grunge, emo, goth, etc etc.
can someone tell me from where's Safiya's top at 19:45 ? That's a really pretty top and would like to purchase it if possible, or something similar
1:34 no es eso, lo que nos preguntamos todos?
Why are you wearing a mask outside when noone is around? 🤔
Hello Safiya! Thanks always for the care and effort you put in your videos. I love the interesting "risks" you take with testing things. Hope you're staying safe! Give some love to Crusty from a fellow cat lover!     P.S. I noticed this last episode too but somehow the audio desyncs with your mouth about 1/4s off twice in the video. It's not a big deal but it throws me for a loop as someone trying to learn how to lip read.
DO THE DWIGHT SHRUTE
The married to baby transition is crazy cause when i was getting married all i got was wedding suggestions and now all i get is baby suggestions 😂 Instagram being an Indian aunty😂
Have kids now
22:44 Safiya smelling the rose with Mask ON.
6:23 its beacuse its two diffrent things btw love your videos they are funny and cosy and just realy good i had seen almost all of your videos and im following you on instagram and all that stuff you and tyler is so cute together ps. I loved your wedding video😁😊
I think on the second outfit with the suspender skirt/dress you should tuck the nipple tassels in the circle buckle beneath. Hopefully that makes it look less awkward lol.
can i have the pink jacket im obsessed with it- JSNDJD
Realizing the powerpuff girls shirt is modeled after an undershirt for little girls from the early 2000 my sister always wore those!
That colonial woman outfit turned you into a new woman
What do you do with these clothes? Send to goodwill, sell it again...?
Tryna catch me churnin butter
“After this I saw another angel coming down from heaven. He had great authority, and the earth was illuminated by his splendor. With a mighty voice he shouted: “ ‘Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great!’ She has become a dwelling for demons and a haunt for every impure spirit, a haunt for every unclean bird, a haunt for every unclean and detestable animal. For all the nations have drunk the maddening wine of her adulteries. The kings of the earth committed adultery with her, and the merchants of the earth grew rich from her excessive luxuries.” Then I heard another voice from heaven say: “ ‘Come out of her, my people,’ so that you will not share in her sins, so that you will not receive any of her plagues; for her sins are piled up to heaven, and God has remembered her crimes.” #LordJesusiscoming
the way she looked in the wig and makeup in the third outfit gave me electra heart era marina & the diamonds vibes
Slow..
Yay! So happy to see your video! 😀😀😀😀 Laughed so hard at the churning of the butter. Thanks for the smart video and laughs.
we miss uuu upload more often 😭😭😭
Just want to say that I'm from the UK and I think 'Minga' is probably pronounced with a soft 'g' not a hard 'g' so like... Ming(as in sing)-a(as in ah)  It's actually like an insult in the UK to call someone a Minga because it means, according to Urban Dictionary, "someone who is unfortunate lookin" so that's a fun name for a fashion brand, lol.
The last outfit gives me Kirsten Dunst "On Becoming a God in Central Florida" vibes, I like it. Maybe a blonde wig would make it so much more 90's.
Your phone case looks like it has alien- jack skellington love children on it
My first thought was definitely nipple tassels even before you said that which made me LOL.  If it wasn't doing that it would be so cute. lol
Put the straps inside the rings like a belt
me a wiccan: *just chulling and searching and following the gothy-witchy outfit accounts* :P
Yes historical clothing! Tho you need a good crinoline under that skirt lol
tbh, she ate that pink look. I dig it
Nobody:   “We think this girl is either a witch or a Civil War reenactor!” 😂😂
Why i see Morticia vibe in her LOL
23:50 Excuse me, did you mean: *Is there a bee in my bonnet???*
safiyas aesthetic: 💣🥀🖤🦇⛓ her personality: 💕✨🐥🐙🌹
NO DAD PANTS next time plz
Haven't watched you in a while.. But.. Your hair!! Omg!! It grew so much and you look so good!! ❤️
The witch outfit was my fave😍. The wig looked good, good job Tyler!
waiting for that mug video 👀
Without the bonnet you look like you could kick some rebel booty in the civil war. Or just kick booty anyway. Like it was bada$$.
Just what the doctor ordered
"If youre not paying for the product you are the product."
I love these longer format videos lately
I have to say one thing so if I'm commenting anyway another two things will follow.  1. I would love to see you wear the pink wig with the colonial outfit without the bonnet, it came to me while you took the bonnet of and I just can't stop imaging it. 2. I actually love the contrast of your brows with the wig! 3. YES please destroy all your mugs and make a frankenstein mug, I'm begging I'm sorry these sound like demands, they're not. I just had to write down the thoughts. Okay you may continue, have a nice day!
Loved the Monet Clueless reference 😂😂😂
safiyas aesthetic: 💣🥀🖤🦇⛓ her personality: 💕✨🐥🐙🌹
CAN YOU PLEASE JUST GO TO COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG FOR YOUR NEXT VIDEO
safiya, tyler, i adore you, but... Ore-gone....
You can thread the extra strap on the skirt through the metal hoops! Minimal flappage. You are welcome.
you should get the bags too
I just scrolled through the comments for a while to see if anyone else mentioned the fact that they both pronounced Oregon wrong.... kinda wanna see how they pronounce Willamette now lol
Did anyone else think that was jenna marbles house
i'm confused? why does this look like Safiya's old set up?? doesn't she live in a new house??? I'm confusion
The style you misinterpreted as e-girl is literally called Y2K aesthetics which is a shortened version of "Year 2000"
Girlllll your makeup to match the fits were on point 👌🏼 lookin’ good too!
The punk letter print is literally just the Witch by Lisa Lister cover font but with capitals, I'm wheezing.
You suit that witch outfit SO MUCH!!!!!
it is egirl (soft egirl) there are so many versions of egirl
If you have IBS, you should probably check out Dr. Berg.
I waited to long for 1 video safyia- 💀
I really love how you looked in outfit 3, you looked stunning, it sort of reminded me of a tik toker but way better, damn you rocked everything
Did anyone else think the model from foxbloodshop looks like Safiya? Just me? Cool 😅
I think she could have tucked the suspender slack into the metal rings so they wouldnt flap around
safiya slayed the witch look 🔥🔥
thw amount of twice videos on safiya's explore page is so heartwarming
The both of you pronounce Oregon pains me.   It's ory-gun not ore-gone.
Who else miss Safiya and her wonderful personality and voice 💕 2020 didn’t that bad for now
https://youtu.be/tqBTGJ3FXRE
I think Tyler deserved more credit for that pun "memes of production" - it did make me chuckle ^^
I know you say that its not egirl but honestly I think its a sub genre of egirl! Like a soft egirl or a barbie egirl, you know?
Tyler did a great job 😂😂😂
we want a new house tourrrrr
You could cut out the Power Puff Girls image of the top and sew it on to another top. It's what I usually do when the material doesn't work out for me. Also: Tyler's Memes of production joke was A+ ^.^
That second look is giving me life!! 😍😍
okay but no one is gonna mention Twice all over saf's explore page lol
The "Egirl" outfit kinda reminds me of a VSCO-Girl 🤔
The colonial look without the bonnet had major cottage core vibes for me! 😂
If you added black pants to the last outfit i feel like it would go a lot better together.
I think the pink wig looks so cool on you <3
that trendy witch outfit is EVERYTHING
"its goth"  Me: *rants to a spider on my wall about how goth is a music based subculture*
The wallpaper tho 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
♥️♥️♥️
"It appears my fresh cream brings all the boys to the yard"
Nice floral top!
Why do you talk so much
SAFIYA ARE YOU A ONCE??
Wooooow I absolutely love the second outfit
ANYONE SAW CHAEYOUNG????
I went to high school with Andrew lol
omg the witch outfit, tho im not into witchy thangs, U LOOKED SO GOOD!!! also the flaps go through the rings, I’m pretty sure
I want to girl friend
Everybody always talk about Safiya's voice, but Tyler has a pretty good voice too!
Safiya looks STUNNING in every part of this video
Being from Virginia I definitely agree with the statements made 😂
Yayyyy you switched for your old opening song again!
I think you should do a video were you only buy second hand clothes etc for 6 months, it would be interesting for someone who buys so many clothes and could be an excuse to wear some clothes you don't wear very often
kintsugi mugs!!!!
I’d love to see you in the 2nd outfit with the pink wig
2.15am work at 5am but i wake up n c this and obviously I am now sitting in living room excitedly about to watch
Love the video   On the mugs - perhaps do a thrip shop and buy some mugs to glue back together? Will be a fun video.
I dressed like your “butter churned” look for a show in college where I played a maid, and I can 100% confirm wearing that costume was wonderful and I felt powerful and also quite thick seeing as I had roughly a billion layers on.   Also, I was a costume design student in college, and I believe you’re supposed to wear the brown skirt underneath the patterned skirt, to give more volume and feed the need for all the layers back in the day, and of course a large petticoat lol someone correct me if I’m wrong?
Safiya reminds me of Morticia Addam
What your name and where are from you
the goth outfit reminded me of Wednesday Adams at the age of 16-18
I could listen to safiya talk for hours
23:35 is just piratecore lol
When she says the vid is sponsored by honey I thought that mrbeast controlled her
long hair look so so good on u
I have such a crush on both of them
https://youtu.be/GLzRotujxIw
SAFIYA IS GLOWING
Somehow I feel like social media, being able to scan your pic and figuring out your fashion sense is something a machine learning algorithm out there is already being taught to do.
SEIZE THE MEMES OF PRODUCTION 😂🤣🍻
Ok, but hear me out. White poofy sleeve shirt + velvet skirt and moon boots + pink jacket (and wig optional!)....that's your takeaway outfit from this.
Oh Tyler, I've got IBS too, I feel you, my man.
ok I love safiya but getting cat called is NEVER a compliment and it is NEVER ok to do.
I kinda love the witch look but I don't use IG. Maybe I'll get an account just to to get them batwing tops.
You are actually supposed to put the straps of the skirterall (skirt overall) through the rings like a belt I think....
i forgot how much i love her videos I've been skipping her uploads (sorry Safiya, it's not personal! I've been doing it to a lot of people) and just remembered how funny and fun her videos are 💕
Saf, you look amazing (always did though) are you going to make a video on your workouts or healthy habits? I’d love it and I’m always hoping it’s a Michelle Khare collab.
Witch look is so good ! Love it on you 😍
why is no one talking about how she described eboy hair as meet me at mcdonalds
Can I just stop everything and point out how they say Oregon around 20 minutes in....like I’m sorry Safiya (and Tyler) but you are the only person I’ve heard ever pronounce it like that..... I’m from Oregon and I’ve never heard anyone in my state say it like that.
try black ribbon in the black shoes! i have ribbon in my doc martens, and it’s a super cute look, i think they might even sell ribbon laces
I like safiya bc she doesn't get sponsored by dumb things... like I actually use and like honey
Notice how all the goth models are like anorexic thin?
"I do have ibs."  Same, Tyler. Same.
26:23 your actually supposed to wrap them around your ankle, or at least that’s what me and a few others do, it helps keep the laces out the the way I guess.  Also there are sort of multiple genre of the e girls fashion, yours was a mixture of like pastel, insta nostalgia chick, I guess it depends on who you ask but I think there are multiple areas of being an e-girl.
Saf says something abt how pants are fitting her, I’m nodding bc we have similar body shapes! so thank you for your honesty 😂 btw Ty killed the wig app! #indianandhippy 😭👏🏽
Thumbnail Safiya looks like she should be the leader of Dirty Candy
Tyler, your "memes of production" pun had me CACKLING!
she likes kpop😳🤯
safiya looks so pretty in this video
The "WEH-ITCH" *DISTANT CACKLING*--Had me dying 🤣🤣🤣
You looked so good in the pink wig!
Goals is to have a partner as supportive as Tyler is
Well-done💯https://youtu.be/bEuD-WsQN_c
this was a great ad for the instagram shop tab omg. i went and checked and it’s such a weird but perfect balance
safiya addams
I go tot school in Colonial Williamsburg!! It's not all that I swear 🥴😂
I think the suspender skirt was maybe styled too high and that’s what made it a bit nipply. Or maybe too high for Saf’s body proportions.
How does she do it? If I went in public wearing any of these looks I would be so self conscious. Not that the looks are ugly but just how over the top they are (I would totally wear the witch look if I wasn’t so self conscious)
the first outfit is really cuteeee!!!! i was kinda fangirling cause Saf looks so good in them
Whose going to tell her the loops on the goth shirt was to tuck the suspenders into so they aren’t flapping around
I love the pink wig on you!!!!! It definitely suits you and your coloring. I promise.  From: an actual hairdresser :)
I always except of pink hair loves it
I love how she has some twice and itch on her explore page 🥳💞
The third outfit was like if an E-girl and a soft girl had a baby
Y'know....colonel williamsburg makes good flannel pants
saf looks more and more like morticia addams every video
Does Saf have a web store? I'm just thinking for christmas presents
"If it looks bad, blame Tyler. If it looks good, give Tyler credit."  Not bad, Tyler.
Listening to yall pronounce Oregon was painful.
For the first one it reminded me of a pirate with the hair down The second one was so cute but if you could cut off the straps of the skirteralls and put a floofy skirt under it would make it look so nice The last one kind of reminds me more of a soft girl look  All in all these outfits all look amazing
The way she said Oregon hurt my soul a little lmao
Saf's normal look is that of witch/vampire/bat-person blending in with modern society.
Once you put your hair down with the 1700s outfit you reminded me of kat from Casper the friendly ghost
i like the wig, but i personally think a middle part just didnt suit you.
Am I crazy or is that PRACTICALLY Emma Woods from Identity V on the right? 0:45
The second outfit is so 2015 tumblr it hurts 💔💔💔
Somehow the black mask makes the witch outfit even better. And the "e girl" 90s outfit I think would probably work without the wig and with the same wash of jean but with either nothing on the back pockets or something different on the pockets
Why do people always have to pronounce Oregon like this 😂
When Tyler said pink hair I feel like he was channeling WAP.
I have them same jeans love minga London ahhh
That witchy outfit was really my fav,and maybe my style cause l like clothing that are cute but like ghostly
Why do I have a fear that she actually is making a video of her smashing all her mugs and gluing them together
Have to say I loooove the goth outfit!!
SOMEONE FROM COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG LET SAF CHURN THE BUTTERRRR PLEASE! lol.
To the person that’s reading this:   You’re a very beautiful and adorable human! Stay healthy during this uncertain time ☔️  Our dream is to hit 1k, We’ve been struggling to get there 💛
im 90% sure the overall skirt was backwards on safiya and thats why it seemed very strange
What is haul??
Listen Saf, I hear you, but the moment you showed us that "bone me" bralette that you described as something from a brand you don't follow, I immediately had to go find it. The brand is apparently called "Not Your Average Babe," and while I hate the name, they've got some pretty alright gothwear that I'm here for. Thanks for inadvertently introducing me to them! ...Also I haven't finished the rest of the video yet, so I expect to be introduced to some other new brands shortly...
Saf: "American girl doll love child"  Todoroki: "DID SOMEONE SAY SECRET LOVE CHILD!?"
I got to churn butter once at Colonial Williamsburg. I grew up close by and we went like every other year on a field trip for school. 😂
Instagram said stan twice
Totally spies was full of fetishes it's on Amazon and I wanted to watch it again cause as a kid I loved it. And it's so weird.
hiii! Who else is trying to grow their YT channel during quarantine. Let’s help one another. Much Love
looks egirl to me
Auto Comment with Whitelist option for Instagram and other features. This app only costs $3.
Why do I get Yammy vibes from the last outfit?!
Omg the goth outfit is literally to good😌 in my opinion the cutest outfit you have ever worn on the channel!
27:11 Saf youe supposed to put the strps in through the other side too so the are not hangijg out. You know. How you normally wear a belt?
I want those shoes xd
yessss my fav content
I feel as if the pink wig looked super good on you! And then adding the face mask really made your eyes and eyebrows super pop!!! Looove it! ☺️
You wanna churn butter? Guuurl churn butter haha. Do it up
Ok, Scrap this video. SHMASH all the mugs in our house and put them back together
Okay but who gave Safiya the right to be so adorable
Saf you are glowiiiin
i NEED a civil war historical haul with proper hoop skirts man
the style you thought was a e-girl was kinda indie style XD
You guys are so cute. Always laughing at each other☺️☺️☺️☺️
Am I the only one who likes her new videos BEFORE I watch it 😂
5:18 excuse me. CRISTINE NEEDS THIS
I love the black boots that came with the "goth" outfit! They look so cute on you
PiiiiiiiiiiiiNK IS SOOOO YOUR COLOR!!!!! ✨😍💗💓💞💝💘💕💖
Wrap the laces of the star shoes around the ankle of the boot a couple times until you have desired lace bow length 👍🏼
Saf do you hav tik tok?
Oregon is pronounced like “organ” not “or E gone” 🥰
I'm pretty sure the not e-girl look is a soft girl look? Which do share similar styles at times imo  ALSO: Destroying a wide variety of mugs and glueing them back together could be really cool and artsy as well as on brand for the channel pls do it. It would also be a form of stress therapy, breaking all those mugs
I feel less alone knowing Tyler also has IBS
I finally feel i am missing out not having an Instagram
Safiyas white charging cable makes me feel that silver lining in every dark could might exist too!
S-Safiya..?  Why do you have so many unread messages..?
So glad my state was acknowledged for something lolol VIRGINIA
Okay now Tyler must wear all of this LOL I NEED to see him wearing those Moon and Star boots!!
25:46  serious chinese fashion tiktok vibes
Why does everyone always mispronounce Oregon? 🤣
YOUR SKIN IS ✨glowing✨
You are literally my favorite youtuber not just because the kpop because you are unproblematic you are funny and amazing
Sammie sweetheart? No.
goth colonial e girl. Obviously
thread the straps through the loop so tht they r tucked away
When are we getting this house tour. Im so curious👀
I love the witch outfit best. Now I gotta check my Instagram and see if I have a shop tab.. LOL
I don't really comment on youtube videos but I really enjoy your videos and I just wanna say it 💜 thanks for coming back
Safiya, i need u to explain the twice content on ur explore page
I think the first outfit is more Mennonite, cuz its still demure, but not full Amish-1800s
Last look was more of a soft girl look then egirl. You still did that💅
You had a bee in your bonnet! Can't believe you missed that one 😂😉🤩
Please colab with Abby Cox!!!!
On the velvet skirt... I was thinking, would tucking the flaps in the rings work?
IS IT Safiya's NEW intro song anymore though?
i kinda love saf in a pink wig
that second colonial “catcall” just sounded like someone yelling safiya
Do the pinterest shop tab
You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart. I will be found by you,” declares the Lord... Download The Holy Bible ❤
Live in Williamsburg and it’s funny hearing the colonial Williamsburg vs normal Williamsburg because even people that live here call the downtown area CW 😂😂😂😂
I actually REALLY liked your "egirl", more like soft girl, look.  I don't know why, I  guess I didn't expect it after being used to your dark style and just thought it looked really cute on you.
Those jeans were not made for the booty...cut slits in the front?? Might fix it?
Is no one going to talk about how amazing her skin looks! She is glowing !
When you said: tonight we fly sisters!! I was like oh my God that's from Hocus pocus
Last outfit is pop arty
THAT SECOND OUTFIT IS SOOOO PERFECT SAF!
Safiya is glowing!!!!
okay but i LOVE those jeans 😭
SAF!!!!! The last one was an absolute look! Yoh look stunning and so suit the pink hair! 😱👏🏼
The “not E-girl outfit “ is like a pastel E-girl outfit.
"I also follow some people from the hills"  me: "why?"
I Think you looked really pretty in the Pink wig and jacket. The all black outfit was obviously the favorite, but still. You are so damn cute.
The wig needed fluffing to get rid of the flat look but given you're not used to wigs it was fine and so were the dark brows. Those jeans were all up in the cookie jar. No bueno.
very underrated joke @19:01  well done Tyler, i chuckled
Safiya, you look *bomb* with pink hair
When you realize safiya’s new intro song isn’t as new anymore😂
i can’t hear mark zuckerberg without think of that interview when aoc absolutely destroyed him
Ok, so you're not _super_  far off with e-girl tbh. For that outfit, I would have suggested different bottoms for the e-girl aesthetic; but the top and wig aren't too bad. Not all e-girl fashion is goth/grunge
I’m waiting for you to hit 10 Million !!!
She knows she like, ....light (??) goth right? She’s knows she is goth right? Lol 😂
the amount of kpop related things on safs explore page makes me really happy
what are the odds 2/3 of those American girl dolls are my and my sister's name .... I went "oh that's my name! wait that was my sisters to"
why do i lowkey love the pink wig... she looks so cute!
Oh my gosh Safiya looked like a badass in the second witch outfit with her face mask!!
I think the third outfit would be better without the wig imo.
JAKSJDJD I LOVE HOW YOUR EXPLORE PAGE IS ALL KPOP GIRL GROUPS 😭😭😭🥺🥺
I literally just played back you buying the "witchy" outfit and went through Instagram to find the specific posts so I could buy them. Because, yes, I loved it THAT MUCH!!
Omg those shoes are great
You should make a video of Tyler pick your outfit from Instagram shop adds
You looks a little  like the girl is Casper when she is in the wedding dress while in the first look when you pulled your hair out and I’m living.
Stop promoting fast fashion.
The witch outfit looked the best - I'm in LOVE with those boots! I think you could pull off the pink wig. It was a jarring contrast to your normal black hair for a moment but it looks stunning on you!
is no one going to talk about how she managed to have a multiple twice fancams in her instagram explore page
Maybe I'm just more used to you wearing black, but pink (at least that shade) doesn't seem to be your color
Have you ever wanted an Instagram experience that was only ads?
You should go to Colonial Williamsburg with Abby Cox!!!!!!!!!
Eminem diss https://youtu.be/YAZp6CAKGDk
With your hair down in that historical dress, you looked like a pirate ❤
Without a bonnet, I get horse girl vibes
i love the pink wig!! you look like a comic book hero
Did anyone think Carrie from dirty candy  as soon as they saw the thumbnail?
Why does the house look like Jenna and Julien’s house?
People! Like this comment if you agree that she should look at Snapchat’s store recommendations!!!! I wanna see that so bad!
Your “witch” shoes match your black wedding dress. Just something I noticed
so fuuun those moon shoes are EVERYTHING
... So who's gonna tell Saf that wench means prostitute?
Wait you like Koop?
That Williamsburg look is totally you!  I'm pro-bonnet, I've never seen anyone wear a bonnet as well.
Does safiya want to donate these jeans to a random me 🤲 because I'm in love
your new intro song is so much like the Phineas and Ferb intro song
SAF IS A ONCE CONFIRMED
Saf there is an historical costuber named Abby Cox who used to work at Williamsburg and would love to work with you just saying
I love the print of the power puff girls and i think pink wig looks good. Props to tyler!!!! Love your videos!!!!
POV: you're waiting for safiya to find the words "Soft Girl"
you should make a video of you just scrolling though your explore page
Tuck your shoelaces under the laced section near the toebox and tongue or wrap 1 or 2x around your ankle and tie
If I did this is would just end up at like a bunch of different vacation places lolllll
Oh how I wish you uploaded more!
Every time Saf says Minga London I think about Ben and Jen going RIMMEL LONDON
Ok wow I love that bonnet though
I GO TO SCHOOL IN WILLIAMSBURG MY CAMPUS IS LITERALLY PART OF COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG PLEASE COME
oh my god this is how you got the franken-mug!!! i’ve been seeing it on your stories forever
So recently, and by recently I mean for a long while now; I've seen a lot of influencers and YouTubers do this thing when they go on Etsy or Fiverr ( I think) and pay psychic(s) that claim to draw your "Soulmates" and or "Twinflame". I'm curious to know what you would get. Either as yourself, though you risk that person scoping out your social media and finding out that you're happy with someone (And they conveniently base their readings on that) or under a pen name, just to see what happens. Would you get a description or drawing looking like Tyler, or would you get a bunch of mumbo jumbos that dozen people have received?  Is it possible to get the same reading under different names if the drawings were sent to different locations?   This has been getting a lot of heat for a while and of course, has brought out tons of skeptics and others claiming that their predictions were true/they drew their current partners.
Safiya looks like a modern Strawberry Shortcake. 🍓 31:31 She still looks great.
I miss this into...I remember when she paid a random dude on the internet to make it xD
I like the wig. I'd love to see your comfy vampire look with the bright pink hair. :)
Am I the only one who saw she has kpop on her explore page
Saf my dear to avoid the flapping on the “skirtaroll” tuck it into the o rings it’s also called a pinafore skirt btw
Okay, I have feelings about that pink outfit. So many feelings. Good feelings, mind you, but it is absolutely not your typical style. You wear it well but I could tell you were kind of uncomfortable in it. Might have been the ill-fitting pants but... I am tempted to buy it for myself though. I am the pretty pink princess of my friend group (who are all similar to you in the comfy, goth section of style or just straight up comfy, modern punk). Either way, first two outfits were on point for you and the second was just you but extreme. Like, radical Safiya. I very much approve of that one on you.
I love the pink wig 😍
The witch outfit was on-point.  Loved it.
i might buy the wotchy shirt myself tbh its cute! the shoes are hella cute but id have to save lol
The Complete Wario Apparition https://youtu.be/w6_uX74wjVo
I must be the only person that hates the word clothes and how Safiya says it 😩
She would be a good new caster she juss sounds like one😭😭
THAT VIDEO OF CHAE ON YOUR EXPLORE HOME PAGE HELLO ONCE
I absolutely ADORE the witch outfit on Safiya and wish I could pull something like that off
If your laces are too long you can double bow them, I do that to my figure skates for comp, and my combat boots- it’ll literally just look like 2 bows on your shoe. Just act like the bow loops are the normal string and loop to make a bow again, it’ll use up the excess lace if u really don’t wanna cut it🤷‍♀️
https://youtu.be/dxhjYQVuAFI
11:01 And you didn’t get the spider web yoga pants...I-
Those moon boots are so CUTE 😍
I know it was a tease but I want the franken-mug episode!!!
i see twice❤❤😭
That split second Jolyne Kujo makeup post made me smile 🥰
The three moods of Safiya, all witchy, all time!
Bruh the way she says Oregon tho...
Is anyone gonna tell her Shop has been there for awhile
Raaaahn, staahhhppp
The fact that there was naeyon from twice on Safiya’s insta explore feed
Im still not used to your "new" house😭
A lot of these insta shops like 'pvseur' actually buy their clothes off of Aliexpress, use pictures from other stores like Omighty and extremely overprice them so that's really disappointing to see. There's so many great artist out there that make amazing graphic tees and other fashion, I'd love to see you try them out.
Can you please do a video in which you are transformed into a fashionova instagram baddie!! I would love to see this! I love you 💕 glad you are back!!
Frankin lotion!!!!????!?!???
Come to colonial Williamsburg and you can be a witch AND a civil war reenactor
every time she said Minga London i thought of ben and jen saying "RiMiL lOnDoN"
Okay but I really like the last outfit. I genuinely think the jeans suit you as well
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT FLORAL FACE MASK?!
Love that witchy outfit is SO cute... minus the placement of this rings 😂 Those shoes though 😍🖤 (and the Hocus Pocus quotes 🥰)
1 day 15 trending
Was buttercup smoking a blunt?
See if you can get the jeans tailored. Cause they look great
There's literally no one near you, you do not have to have a mask on. Come on.
LOVE the middle part
*Everyone  in Oregon  rolls their  eyes.* It's  Or-uh-gun.
I actually like all 3 outfits!😂👏🏻
The way the rings hit on the skirteral looks a bit like its trying really hard to say "and here are my nipples"
Tbh I think you look amazing I. The pink wig lol. But maybe that’s just me 😅
ok is it just me that nodist she has over 100 calls and mesigis
your final look reminds me of Marina and the diamonds because of the makeup and maybe she would've tried that hairstyle
The colonial look with the hair down gave me serious salem witch vibes
I think the powerpuff top is a rip off of the brand “omighty” which could be why the quality wasn’t great because it wasn’t their original design and was just printed on💕
The tank top is sublimated! The only way to get that image to be a part of the fabric like that is to be printed on polyester, which is why it feels like swimsuit material.
Someone start a petition to get Saf to colonial williamsburg
the witch outfit is how they should've dressed in the new "the craft" movie    minus the "witch" imprint
Ok but Safiyas content Quality has gotten so good!!!
safiya you look so good!!!
Regarding a visit to Colonial Williamsburg, do you know Abby Cox?  She's a costume historian who has a YouTube channel and she worked at Colonial Williamsburg; you should contact her about getting a colonial costume and visiting CW!  I'm sure she'd be willing to help.
Can you double bow the shoelaces?
You got a personalized invite to Colonial Williamsburg:  https://youtu.be/qBCwxd48lHc  You're mentioned about 16 min in.
The name on the baby plate was very Christian girl Autumn, it was like “Brynleigh Fynn” or something?!
The last look gave me premadonna vibes, I think the look on safya just reminds me of Marina
You ROCKED the 2nd outfit
The fact that Tyler remembers ‘that skirt she got from wish three years ago’ ❣️
absolutely LOVE the witchy outfit and the wig/makeup combo!!!!!!!!!! i wish i could pull it off!!!
Everything about her and her videos is so heartwarming and fun!! Hope everyone is have a great day and Stay Safe!
How does Saf look fantastic in literally every style 😩 not fair how gorgeous she is
Me watching this with 37 things in my cart from Minga London😯
Safiya. Instagram most definitely can scan your images if they want to. If you are aware there is a shopping app called AliExpress. If you find an image of a clothing item on Pinterest and screenshot it, you can "search by image" for the item on AliExpress. It will scan the image and find the item or the closest thing! I would not be surprised if Instagram/Facebook have this technology.
I almost spat out my broccoli when she said “I feel like a saucy wench.” 😂😂😂
I have to wonder how many of the witchy goth items she bought not for the video
Your fresh clean beautiful face inspired me to get up though I was exhausted and do a little self care. My face is also fresh as fuck now. Thanks =)
Tyler's laugh at every remark Safiya makes just makes me feel so single ;-;  theyre so cute :'))))
She looks so good with pink hair 👍😃
are we not gonna talk abt the background picture of tyler lmao
Mix the 2 last outfits pleeeease 🥺
Hey y’all go pick up some Rocket stock tomorrow right before earnings!!!!!!
Felt a little attacked with the aesthetika post but I’m more like the friend who is emo and secretly plays the ukulele so the clothes would be black. But everything else was on point 😆
Are we not going to talk about how Safiya is GLOWING??? A QUEEN
The eyes🤩🤪😃
I love the pink jacket.
Ahh mask breath is def a thing! Love this whole video.
Was he doing an Adele joke when she openned the box and said "Hello" and then something else and he said: "It's me" 😄
I adore the Rogue Wolf Brand! They make some great rubber phone cases too 🖤
Omg cute outfits I think Sophie Louise  would love those boots
I think the word to describe the not an e-girl look is soft girl
I’m glad you took time off for yourself but I’m also glad to see your face on the internet 🖤
So. I was watching this when my twins went to bed. they now both want your pastel galaxy mask
I grew up in Williamsburg and a friend still works there as a reenactor. Dont know if he can get you an in though 😆 Loved these styles, so different yet you looked so good in them!
“Hello fellow kids, I am one of you.”  reminded me of when Laurenzside says “How do you do fellow kids” when doing a tiktok related video
I see a lot of people doing photoshopping to make them “hotter videos” across several different people based on their opinions of what “hot” is
I feel like the 3rd outfit (without the wig) is more of a “Famous Trendy TikToker” vibe
It made me said you said Oregon wrong
Calling a brand "minga" is so weird 😂 I'm guessing they are actually British, but "minga" means "horrible" or "ugly" depending on how you use it, it generally used by girls when they fight lmao
wait I like the other intro song better! it always gets stuck in my head lmao
She single?
Saf!!! Girl I get so happy to see videos from you. Just puts a big smile on my face the second you start with 'helllllooooooo friends' ❤
WHERE IS TYLER MASK FROM O MG
the face you made around 27:28 when you exclaimed "witch?!" made you look like Alexis from Schitt's Creek
I laughed out loud when u said thoticia 😂
Safiya is a once and I’m here for it
I feel like the cords on the boots were ment to be wrapped arround your ankle before tying!
Literally grew up down the street from Colonial Williamsburg if you ever need a tour guide haha
is it just me or did Saf loose a TON of weight?
the explore full of twice tho
haha the twice bdz performance
the moon shoes would look so cute with ribbon laces
20:45. "Bake them cookies muriel!" - meet the robinsons
i love insta morticia and i want to be her friend
PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO READ THIS. IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU COULD EVER DO AND IT ONLY TAKES A FEW MINUTES ARE YOU 100% SURE THAT IF YOU DIED TODAY THAT YOU WOULD GO TO HEAVEN? (CLICK 'READ MORE')  There are some things that you should know:  1. Realize that you are a sinner and in need of a Savior:  Ro 3:23 "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"  Ro 3:10 "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"  It all began when the first humans, Adam and Eve were created and God put them in the garden of Eden. God created them perfect to live in fellowship with Him. There was no death or sorrow. God told them not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They disobeyed God and as a result, sin entered into the world. The pain, which this world sees, is the result of sin.  2. Because of our sins, we die both spiritually and physically, but God sent His Son to die so that you can have a chance not to have to go to hell by accepting what He did on the cross:  Ro 6:23 "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."  Ro 5:8 "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."  Every person who has ever lived is a sinner and is not righteous because we do bad things. A sin is a crime against God, just as if you steal something at the store, it is punishable by going to jail. It's the same thing with sin. Lying, stealing, sex before marriage, pride, hatred, ect. are all sins. Hell is a prison for those who commit crimes against God. That’s because you must be perfect in order to get to heaven. No matter how well you live your life from then on, you have already sinned, which will be punished if you are not pardoned. If you commit a crime, and then live as a good citizen you still will go to jail for the crime you committed. Right? Just as the President can pardon a crime so you won't go to jail, Jesus can pardon your sins so that you do not go to hell, and can go to heaven when you die. You won’t have to pay for your own sins because Jesus already did that for you. But if you reject the pardon that He offers, you will have to pay for your own sins by going to hell.  3. If you will confess Jesus Christ as Your Lord, place your Faith in Him and Believe in your heart that He died, shed His blood and rose again as a sacrifice for your sins, you will be saved (from hell).  Heb 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.   Heb 9:22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.  You cannot get to heaven by being a good person, going to church, baptism or any other way other than by turning to Jesus, believing in your heart that He died on the cross and rose from the dead for your sins and placing your Faith in Him. While these are good things to do, some people believe that they will get to heaven, but your Faith must be in Christ and His sacrifice alone and nothing else, giving your life to Him.   Eph 2:8,9 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.  Ro 10:9,10;13 "that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved..For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."  4.  You must submit your life to Jesus Christ and His will in Faith, believing in your heart that He died and rose again shedding His blood to pay for your sins as a sacrifice to God.  If you want to accept Jesus free gift of salvation, or if you have any doubts about whether or not you are going to heaven, HUMBLY PRAY THIS PRAYER TO GOD FROM YOUR HEART IN FAITH:  ”Dear Lord Jesus I know that I  am a sinner and need you to save me.  I believe that You are the Lord and believe in my heart that You died on the Cross and Rose from the dead, shedding your blood as a Sacrifice for my sins.  I turn to You as the only way of salvation, I submit my life to you, placing my Faith and Trust in You as Lord of my life, Please save me and I thank You for it, in Jesus holy name, Amen.”  If you have truly placed your faith in Jesus Christ as your Lord, submitting your life to Him, you can know that you are a child of God and on your way to heaven.  Now that you are on your way to heaven, you should attend a bible believing church and follow in baptism.
Who does like go shopping online😆?
The vocab! 😂😂😂😂
Cottage core :) that's all I have to say
i think without the bonnet you look like a pirate
I actually liked how the angelic jeans looked on you! Too bad they’re not comfy.
That's my Intro!
Always here to support Saf!!
*RAAAHN*
I would say the third outfit is definitely more of a “soft girl” vibe.
that poseur acc seems soo sketchy n when u talked abt it feeling like a swimsuit its kinda obvious they just bought it cheap on aliexpress n then resold it. gross
I’m not even soft goth and I want that outfit. Those shoes are the bomb diggity.
You should totally talk to Abby Cox! She's a historical fashion youtuber that said she would love to make you a dress and go to Colonial Williamsburg with you!
I love that Saf's screen image is Tyler making a weird kissy face.
You could try looking at your “Ad Interests” information on IG to find out what things are being targeted towards you!!!!
Youre supposed to tuck the laces in 😅
istg safiya looks more disguised wearing all pink than normal clothes. i would not have realized that was her at all w that outfit
tuck the bottom of the skirt straps through the metal hoop :)
omg the pink look is so........ tiktok influencer vibe and safiya pulled it off????? the wig surprised me tbh. u wear it well queen
Thank you for the video! You look amazing in all three outfits (: you are beautiful!
us girls that have inner thigh fat understand the struggle you went through with those jeans but they were cute ngl
Can I just say that I love her with pink hair
You got really nice goth brands by the way, punkrave have fantastic quality!
Safiya, you're an incon!
TWICE!
Ahhhhh god I miss her voice 😯
I would really like a Franken-mug to happen!
What you thought was egirl is closer to new wave indie kid. You indie kids are kinda annoying as a community I’m sorry.
Okay, totally random video suggestion "Franken-tea" buy all of the tea and mix it together!!
without the bonnet, i felt like safiya looked like a rebellious daughter that’s tired of society’s rules
sub to my yt and watch my most recent video
I’ll be honest I’d love to see Saf do a week as an e-girl and how she’d style that look.
I LOVE the goth look! I even like the nipple tastle illusion. you look amazing in it!
You look amazing in all of these
I'm sorry but the way you guys pronounced Oregon... I'm not even from Oregon but  I was born and grew up in Northern California, I was 2 hours south of the Oregon border so I would visit it a lot and even I know how to pronounce it.
Carol baskin
Hi Safiya!! I've missed you!
THE MEMES OF PRODUCTION 😮🤣
"Killed her husband, wacked him" hahahaha I need this full version of the song asap
27:00 tuck the tassle bits in the hoops
These all look amazing. You are living my dream in all of these and the fact those Rogue and Wolf boots have been taunting me on insta for a year kills me, now I just want them more. Love your videos 😊
Is it just me or did Saf's voice change a little? Like during the voice over there are certain parts where her voice has this ASMR deepness
That’s not how you pronounce Oregon haha 😣. It’s more like “in” not “on”
The star makeup and the pink wig is a look 😍
hi guys idk how to begin but I love you all! seriously. Leave religion behind right now, John 3:16 “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” You know what the means that means for God so loved YOU, that he send Jesus to die for YOU, why did he do that??? because he loves you, he wants to cleanse you from your sin, he wants to turn your life around, and he doesn’t want you to perish🙂, he wants to show you his unfailing love everyday. What do we have to do to be cleansed and all? Nothing, but go to Jesus as you are, and accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour. I’m not forcing religion on you, I’m doing this because I also don’t want you to perish but I want you to experience God’s love. WERE ALL SINNERS, that’s why Christ came to Die for us. Jesus paid the price on The cross, so that me and you don’t go to hell and spend eternity with him. Isn’t that AMAZING! Guys wake up Look around! He loves you with everything he is. He gave his Life for YOU. Now why not wanna live for him. Come to him as you are, you don’t need to be perfect to come to him. It shouldn’t matter what color he is neither, the Point of Jesus is that he DIED FOR YOU. I need Jesus every day, he’s done so much, I use to see my worth in guys if a guy didn’t like me I would think I was the ugliest girl in the world, I was depressed, I didn’t feel loved, I felt like the dumbest person, I never felt loved, BUT that all changed until I met Christ, he showed me what real love is. Jesus saves! ✝️ If your hurt, insecure, tired, don’t feel loved, don’t feel satisfied. Go to Jesus he’s the only one who will satisfy, give you rest, and loves you no matter what. All you gotta do is repent and believe, the bible says we are all born in sin shaped with iniquity. The only way we can take off that weight of sin is to turn to Jesus, he’s the only one that’s gonna satisfy and the one that’s going to show you real love.    “If you are tired from carrying heavy burdens, come to me and I will give you rest.” Matthew 11:28  Being “good” does not make us right in God’s eyes.  “No one is good but God alone.” Mark 10:18 Therefore doing good deeds does not make us right with God.  “But you cannot make God accept you because of something you do. God accepts sinners only because they have faith in him.” Romans 4:5  “All of us have sinned and fallen short of God's glory.” Romans 3:23  “For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord.” Romans 6:23  REPENT AND TURN FROM YOUR WAYS.  I’m not saying you to Get religious I’m saying have a genuine relationship with The Lord Jesus Christ:)💙
With the pink look, lowkey got strawberry shortcake vibes
im loving the wig, i love the pink on you
OK I WANT THE FRANKENMUG, I WANT IT, MAYBE NOT EVERY MUG IN YOUR HOUSE BC SOME MUGS ARE SPECIAL PROBABLY, EVERYONE HAS SPECIAL MUGS, BUT LIKE EVERY MUG IN BED BATH AND BEYOND OR SOMETHING. 😂 Ok sorry but that would be so fun to watch.
Please will you upload more! I can’t get enough of your videos and 1 video a month isn’t enough 😩😩♥️♥️
I live in VA and Williamsburg is like 30 minutes from me. I frequent there often and I LOVE it there.
it physically hurt me when her and tyler called Oregon, "orrrGONE"
I can’t believe you called sailor moon a cartoon throw back 😧 it’s an anime 😂😂😂
You sound like a news reporter
Saf is just so beautiful😭💜
35:39 💀💀💀
I am obsessed w the goth look on u!!
I feel like in school Safiya would be the kid who spouts Hamilton lyrics at random times.
I live 45 minutes from Colonail Williamsburg, come over here! I’ll take ya!
Hey Saf! You should do a video on the first 5 things Pinterest ads recommend to you.
You should check out heritage park in Calgary
We aren't gonna talk about how she didn't know the e girl it was actually soft girl
Can i please just steal your style? Like extra sleeves, bats, witches, ya know. The usual.
Safiya be giving me Morticia Adams vibes in this video and I LOVE it
Seize the memes of production
broo i forgot about totally spies that show was messed up af
Btw if you have samsung you cant get honey. If you can, TELL ME HOW
PLEASE DO A STYLE SWAP WITH RCL BEUTY 101
This is how many people love Hocus Pocus too- I I v
Safiya, where did you get your embroidered mask?
1) Bubbles should have the blunt, not Buttercup 2) the necklace brought outfit 3 together 3) Outfit 2 was by far my fave 🖤
37:54  Franken-STEIN 🧟‍♂️🍺
Missed uuuu
casually scrollin thru instagram when I see a post from Rogue + Wolf for the same boots Safiya bought lol
You definitely would fit right in here at colonial Williamsburg !!! I live twenty mins from the burg and grew up going every year !!!! So much fun !!!
she used a different intro song from that one video
....I'm out of touch. What is an E-girl?
First outfit is almost Marilla from Anne with an e
Love you videos I like the way when you look into the history of this stuff not just showing fashion styles without doing your research behind them. I think I like your Witcher outfit better. I don't like pink very much either Ps Good job Tyler for putting the wig on
I can’t believe Safiya remembered all of the American girl doll names. I was obsessed with them when I was younger and I only remembered Felicity 😂
Beauty and the beastkini
Tyler deserves an award. The wig looked a lot better than most people I see coming into my grocery store 👏.
i see kpop on your explore 👁👁
The only way I know how to describe honey, "Honey is a free browser extension that lets you save money with just a click of a button-"
the cropped pink jacket is giving me nostalgia because I used to have a pink sweater with black hearts that had a really similar vibe. Oh, to be in the 2000s again.. How I both miss it, and simultaneously never want to see it again.
Chaeyoung
You’re on fire in this one! You look amazing, you’re funny, every makeup looks so good on you and most clothes fit you so well! And I’m living for the mask wearing!
Safiya using her curiosity as an excuse to justify to Tyler why she needs new clothes😂  Ps - no hard feelings, it’s a joke. I think they’re both fabulous.
The way y’all are saying Oregon is stressing me out
IF COUSIN IT WAS A SOFT INSTAGRAM  GIRL  Killed me 😂
Safiya is the only channel that I can see a 38 minute video and be excited, not upset that it's a long video! top content right here!!!
I usually tuck the shoelaces into the shoe
couldn't you just tuck the straps from the suspender dress into the loops? lol
So glad to see you back doing ur thang  Ms. Thang ! You look great !
Oregon (ore gun)
I wanna see the blouse with the velvet skirt!
I think you’re supposed to tuck the straps in through the circles on the skirt if that makes sense.
118 missed calls??? xD loved this video!
omg I actually shop at minga London all the time oh my god I feel famous
diet goth...comfortable vampire omg 😂😂😂😂
You literally look beautiful in anything hun😬💖
Ok so I saw a pin on romwe and it said I’ll stop Wearing black when they make a darker color
Video idea. Mix a bunch of beverages in the Franken mug.
What if you tuck the ends of the straps into the rings on the straps of the skirt? It might make it look a bit less strange!
who are you?
In the second out fit she kanda looks like the wife from "The Adams Family"
The 2nd outfit was PERFECT. In love with it. And safiya is one of my favorite youtubers by far 🖤
I love the goth clothes she wore!
I loved this lol. And I love the black floral top you're wearing so much!!! And just your general fashion. It would be cool to see like a closet tour/what's in my wardrobe video because you're clothes are to die for 😍
Safiya check out social dilemma on Netflix I think it will answer some questions for you re ads!
I LIVE IN COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG AND WOULD LOVE TO SHOW YOU AROUND SAF ❤️❤️
Hearing you pronounce Oregon as Oreg-ON instead of Oreg-EN truly hurt my heart to the core 😢
PLEASE do a historical video!!! I’m a historical re-enactor doing 1830’s and would love to see your take on the 18th or 19th century!! I feel like you would also love 14-15th century fashion as well, might be easier to put together and less expensive.
Safiya: "Colonial Williams Berg out fit!"  All of costube: *quietly dies*
In that colonial outfit I think everyone just thought that there was just a Morman walking around.
Where did she buy the mask??
I don’t think you were getting catcalled I think they were fans that recognized you
you're so beautifulllllllll
You really wore your heart on your sleeve in that witch shirt
Y’all saw her explore page? She’s a Kpop stan 🥰❤️
I loved the wig on you
PLEASE RETURN TO THE LORD! HIS COMING IS SOON; LEAVE YOUR SIN LIFE BEHIND AND RETURN TO JESUS. HE IS THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE. DON'T BE JUST A READER OF THE WORD, BE A DOER OF THE WORD. JESUS ​​IS THE ALPHA AND THE OMEGA. HE LOVES YOU AND ONLY WANTS THE BEST FOR YOU. OPEN YOUR EYES, READ THE BIBLE! TIME IS RUNNING OUT.
Love you ♥️
W
She’s just a witch with a bat familiar
How is this 13th on trending I- hdjhebdhrgj
When you took off your bonnet I literally gasped you look soooo gorgeous
I think you were thinking of vsco girls with all the pastels.
Honestly I loved the pink outfit! With the jacket off the shoulder it looked so good:) Also would be interested in the pink wig with the witch outfit
I keep hoping y'all will get less creepy.....but no. Y'all just jack up the creep factor with every video. I've been unsubscribed, now I'm all the way out
I like the witch outfit a lot! It really suits you
3:57 OMG, Bernardette Banner x American Duchess collaboration shoes in the top left corner!
You are my Favorite YouTube channel! I have watched you guy’s forEVER!You guys are hilarious
Ufff honestly Safiya is so talented and beautiful and they make such a great, fun pair!
On the "give tyler credit" note, as a cosplayer I am very much impressed. Lace fronts can be tricky but you guys did a great job styling it
Am I the only that noticed Rosé at 0:58?
I feel like e girl is an umbrella term
Damn I thought I was bad at picking one style
Saaaaf in classic style yess 🤩
THE MEMES OF PRODUCTION
I work at Conner Praire which is like Colonial     Williamsburg in Indiana! I’ve always wanted a try guys style video at some place like that!
...PULLING IT OFF: the pink hair
something about her posing and then breaking into a smile at  23:40 got me
ah those boots she save for herself , I was looking for similar ones for over a year ( I have them now), Currently on a hunt for brown cowboy boots from leather with minimal stitching and no pattern , ankle boots to be exact <3
Couldn't you tuck the end of the straps on the skirt through the hoops, that way they don't look like goth nipple tassles
goth outfit closer to egirl than the pink one. I would call the pink one soft girl
I LOVED THE HOCUS POCUS REFERENCE!💖😂💖
I went to try and buy the witchy boots and they're sold out. Damn it!
SHE MATCHED THE MASKS TO THE THEMES I LOVE THAT
She looks so cute in pink 🥰
People say safia bosses tyler when he is always just chuckling and smiling at her
I just don't get the mom jeans and dad jeans trend. So unflattering
omg you look amazing in the last outfit
I love that you took a done-befote concept (shopping on instagram) and made it totally unique!
I see you American Duchess in the ads.
Wow I really forgot about you  haven’t seen you all 2020
Does everyone say Oregon like that?
her different hair parting changed her look so much! call it facial fungshuay or however it's spelled
You look like Jennifer Connelly and how she should have looked.
You should have showed us the brown skirt!!
Ore e gone LOL
Wig looks amazing
I'm getting "Gabbie Hanna - Broken Girls" music video vibes from the last outfit.
I just realized Saf looks like Samantha Robinson in “The Love Witch” movie
Living for the witch top!
ikr.. 😅😜 your bundle of joy 🤰👣👶 is happening sooner than expected?!?
Your wishes for Colonial Williamsburg have come true!  Check out this video!  Around 16 minutes she says that she would love to make your dreams come true and even dress you for the trip! https://youtu.be/qBCwxd48lHc
POV: you looked up the moon boots and they’re sold out
Safiya & Tyler: Ore-GONE People in the PNW: *triggered*  Me in a Hermione Granger voice: "It's ORe-Gin not Ore-GON"   Haha 😂 love you Saf! Your aesthetic speaks to my diet goth heart.🖤
As someone that's looking into indie goth brands, I can tell you 2 things:  1. Rogue Wolf is super high quality! Their stuff is super awesome and I'm excited to purchase stuff from them once I can afford it.  2. Brand ambassador websites like Shop Poseur are generally bad bc they buy from AliExpress and Wish and jack up the prices before selling them back to you, and any original designs they have can either take a week for shipping or MONTHS so they're definitely not worth it.
How is no one talking about the INCREDIBLE photo of Tyler that Safiya has as her phone background??
Am I the i only one who liked safiya in the pink hair and that outfit even though the fit wasn't exactly right it was really pretty and really obsessed with the "witch look"
I mean, I would be down to watch a Franken mug video.
Finally someone does a video on this!
The wig looks good
I live in Williamsburg and can totally hook you up at Colonial Williamsburg once COVID settles back down. Also at Jamestown Settlement. Let me know when you are ready.
why are you bring up the memories of Oregan trail   its a really hard game I really wish I made it to the end *le sigh*
the pink wig looks so bomb on you!!!
I think for the goth skirt you need to put the flaps in the hoops (I think)
why does the wig look so good on her?!?!
I'd be interested to see a Tyler buying stuff on Wish kind of video. A bit of role reversal 🤷🏻‍♂️
for the wig, plucking stands near the front and at the part would help to make it a little more realistic! it looks rly good for the price tho
I WORK AT COLONIAL WILLIASMBURG. so like, let me help make a CW video happen.
Sooo... the mug video is gonna happen? Maybe? Yes? Great 😄
I don’t know why but I would LOVE to see Safiya actually learn about real witchcraft! I think she would really enjoy it!
Wow, you really took a long time of explaining the products... more than 10 minutes…
When my wife and I got married, your gonna love this, on Oct 31, people were asking us right after the ceremony, "when are you going to have a baby?"  Never understood that, can't we just be a couple for a minute?  GAH...
ok ur skin is GLOWING and ur makeup while unboxing omg
the shop tab has been around for a while actually! hasn’t gotten any less addicting tho
I really don't like the widow's peak in that wig.
THE WITCH OUTFIT
The witch vibe combo. I want 😍
I enjoyed the intro song, so bouncy. Fun video, thanks!
Abby Cox would be a great person to do a Williamsburg collab with.
I LOVE THE PINK WIG ON YOU!!!!!!
Anyone think she should mix every soap together??? I love ur vids. you sound like a professional. :D
The only thing missing from the Colonial outfit was a nice pair of stays.
The wig is a vibe
Is it just me or I noticed in recent videos that she lost weight and her skin is looking very healthy and glowy? I mean this as a compliment I hope I don't sound rude
obviously, the most important thing about the outfits is whether or not you like them, but i will say that i thought the last look was pretty cohesive and pretty trendy. particularly, although you said you didn't like the way they fit, that cut and fit of jean is veeery hot right now, and i see a lot of people wearing similar ones (i'm 18, so maybe it's a gen z vs millenial thing). anyyway, they were all super cute, loved the video!
is it just me but when she sit at the middle counter she reminds me of jenna marbles
ok but who wants to see this frankin-mug situation go down!?
The witch outfit is so cutee
The ones she thought were e girls are soft girl clothes
Woot! I see Katie and fam in Hawaiian shirts! 🌺
The last outfit would have worked better minus the wig. Maybe its just because pink hair looks odd on Saf but either way lol
Leave the straps of the skirt down when you wear the skirt & just let them hang at your sides😉
The third outfit totally works!
So happy to see you happy and enjoying yourselve during this video 💪
✨💖✨Churning...so that’s what they’re calling it now.  O.o  Missed you guys.  Love from Idaho, USA✨💖✨
I NEED THOSE RPGUE AND WOLF BOOTS!😳
With the baby stuff, I think it's generally women around the age of 30 too. I don't want kids so...I really feel you on that one.
Instagram hates me because it replaced my Likes tab with the song tab on my only account where I actually care about likes and follows! 😭 I will never use it either.
“Had fun showing off the girls..... I mean the powderpuff girls not my boobs” - safiya 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I adore safiya’s videos, I love the voice overs and the way they’re filmed and Tyler’s commentary and the editing and just everything really. Such well made, fun and informative videos ❤️☺️
I say without the pink wig and jacket it would look good
I had a lot of fun watching the video, thank you for that guys. Also your skin looks amazing Safiya :')
The third look is basically scuffed Belle Delphine
WHERE DID YOU GET THOSE MASK FROM??
Anybody else here to see if anyone from Colonial Williamsburg saw and replied.. no? Just me? Lol  ✨okay✨
Wait her name is hosafina I had the doll when I was little I always thought her name was Josefina
saf in the pink wig kinda looks like marina omg
I LOVE the wig and pink jacket😍
My 10-month old is mesmerized by your voice. I took my phone out of the room and she got VERY upset until I brought it back so she could hear you talking 😂
Safia looks crazy Cute in that wig! I love the contrast with the brows And her sweet heart face shape makes this wig go on a whole new level. Basically just I love. But yea pants were a bit ill fitting. I feel you I too have done this
If I didn't know what the kitchen looked like I would swear you, Tyler, Jenna, and Julien all lived in the same house
great video saf!🥰🥰🥰
saf why do you follow dollskill 😬
31:21
She just looks Amish in the first outfit
Please please pleaseeeee link the jacket in the description I NEED it
God of the Bible is the Creator of the World and everything in it and is Lord of Heaven and Earth.  God made us so that we might seek him and perhaps reach out to him and find him, though he is not far away from any of us.  God overlooks past ignorance but now commands all people everywhere to Repent!  I used to be a Drug addict Poker player alcohol partying porn watching potty mouth meth head I was headed for Hell but I cried out to the Lord and He healed me ❤️  You too can be Saved just believe and put your Faith in God and his Word and Seek him and you will find Salvation.  Heaven and Hell are real please don't forget God. Don't take this lightly your Eternal Soul is on the line.
I worked in PR years ago and took a writer to Colonial Williamsburg.  As a black person, being there is super weird.  However, I had my first hot stone massage there, which was excellent.
Okay but that pink wig is FIRE on you. I love it!
Ugh she’s so pretty💓✨
The second outfit 😍😍😍
Saf can you please link the shoes they are gorgeous
That cover photo... she really said Carrie from Julie and the phantoms
I see you got into k-pop after that 1 video :))
Kamala Harris slept her way to the Top! Now she’s is using Joe to become President because he won’t last long. She is not a great example for  young girls around the world. It would kind of suck if the first female president was due to process and not an election. Shame shame shame. Didn't know women wanted to win like that. Also Biden won't be able to pass anything for the next two years. He will be a lame duck.
I love the third outfit! Im sorry if that offends anyone but I think its adorable!
You have a news reporter kind of voice
I love the pink wig on you! Pink wig, thick a**, give them whiplash!
All I know is that I saw the Twice members on her explore page
Without the bonnet the first look feels like you belong on a ranch riding horses
Sock breath had me dead 🤣
The twice on her explore page. Legendary
i think u were supposed to tuck the extra part of the skirt suspenders into the orings?
From 13:34 to 18:07 is actually a indie softy kinda style which I LOVEE AND OBSESS OVER
omg 😱 goth outfit is super cute!
Safiya should do an actual e-girl outfit. I think it wouldn't be far off from your usual wear
It's like ella enchanted without the bonnet!!
I need that pastel galaxy mask omg
oh my god anyone else think she looks absolutely amazing in the second look
I liked the first two looks. The last look was bright, but that mask really did help. I loved the pink wig on you!
OH MY GOD HI I LIVE 5 MINUTES FROM COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG AND MY BOYFRIEND IS IN FIFE AND DRUM AND YOU SHOULD COME VISIT MEEE
I love your videos SO MUCH 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻💕💕💕 Loved this one too!!! Appreciate all of the time and effort and creativity you put into your videos. Thank you!!!
ok girl i see all of the kpop on ur explore page
How cool would it be to redesign/crop/cut/colour all the clothing you weren't a fan of, even clothing from previous videos! 🙋‍♂️
YET.... she said we’re not there YET!!!!!!
I just love how her Instagram feed is Kpop
Is no one goin’ to talk about how filming ended in June but now it’s November?
Is it just me or does Safiya sound like she speaking super slowly in these past few videos? It sounds like they’ve turned the play speed down or something...
Love your videos
Really love those moons shoes too
Hahaha
anyone peep the bernadette shoes??? bernadette banner fans stan
Hey Um I have a video idea: Do a Frankinperfume video where you go to a perfume shop and get the miniature/ tester bottles of perfume both for men and women and mix them together  Love you guys from Ellie in England 💕☺️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
THE TZUYU AND ROSE FANCAMS LMAOO
how many people do you think have asked her “are u a gof”
where did you get the mask with the embroidered flowers? its so cute!
Bus round round
I don't think there is a video of yours I don't like...you rock! Love seeing your processes!!
Honestly IG should pay you for this, i immediately went to go scroll on the shop tab
The seize the memes of production joke was very good and I just want Tyler to feel seen
The second outfit is so made for Safiya 😍
Weeknd fans! Why do you think Abel should win MTV EMA Best Artist this year? https://youtu.be/5oYCw04QjVw
Girl that tank looked so good on you
The pink hair looks so good on you omg
I oddly likes the pink wig outfit??? When you bought the stuff I didn't think i would but I 4eally did
I wish she would have worn the apron, even if it did cover the skirt. It would have tied the out together more imo. Over all, this was a fun video.
U remind me of Stephany from Lazy Town with the pink wig! 🤣😂🤣😂
Saucy Wench merch pls
Only for Safiya would I watch an almost 40 minutes video. This is the only channel I will do this for because I know with every upload it will be worth it.
Saf: killed her husband walked em   Tyler: * laughs nervously *
not safiya being exposed as a mina stan skdhf
i loved the "e-girl" make-up on you!!!
This was great! Your style is iconic.  You know who else has iconic style is Abby Cox, who worked at Colonial Williamsburg and who wants to take you there! And maybe make a dress for you. This a collab that everyone wants!!!
I'd love to see you collab with some fashion history youtube channels, like priorattire or Karolina Zebrowska
You can replace the shoe laces with silky ribbons! Just an edit: if you do the mug thing you can do a Kintsugi video
Someone please say Safiya can go to Colonial Williamsburg for a video!!😊
@safyianygaard Abby Cox here on youtube is a dress historian who wants to colab
You try clothes from ROMWE
I LOVE THE PINK WIG!!! IT LOOKS SO GOOD ON YOU!!!
Out of curiosity, would you actually do franken painting of a mug or something based on all the colors you can find at a home store? Or like do mixing to find the franken paint color average?
the kpop on her explore page is me af 😭
I love the eyebrow contrast with the pink wig!!!! Honestly giving me rowan blanchard vibes?
I think the white blouse would look great under the velvet skirt er all. Fun video.
Saf! That lil wildflower mask is so cute where did ya get it?
So I see you're a twice fan😳💜
Ahh what about....my fresh cream brings all the boys to the barn!? 🤣
With the suspender dress: I think you’re supposed to loop them behind the « nipple rings » just like you would loop a belt behind the buckle
Tyler's "nevermind" channeled me and my husband so much 😅😅😅🤣🤣
Me watching the video *gasp* WAIT TWICE? *gAsp* Is that American Duchess? THE BERNADETTES?! *GAsp* FRESH FRIPPERY OMG Aaaaaaa
DO NOT DOWNLOAD HONEY.  I downloaded it because I trusted Safiya (big fan) but now my laptop is working super slow and not like it used to.  I tried removing it and it's still acting up :( RIP to my hp
The historical look without the bonnet is giving me barmaid/gunslinger/piratess of the high seas vibes
That y2k shop is definitely dropshipping lol
Is anyone gonna talk about how mia maples did this exact video earlier this year?
I honestly love instagram's shopping page. As I do follow a lot of brands, but they aren't always very accessible for me, Instagram always suggests similar stuff from smal shops near me, which makes it much more affordable
How she reacted x10 is how I react when I get my cosplay wigs.
I didn't even know there was a shop tab on IG. Just checked it out and not surprising, it's completely full of nail polish LOL. Thank you for the video! 💗
Ok the 2nd and 3rd outfits are SO FREAKING AMAZING!! I loved the 2nd one on you so much🖤🖤🖤
You need to pluck the wig. Then it’ll look better and I like your dark eyebrows with it❤️
The pink wig makes you look jaundice. You would need to do a make-up to make it work.
try tucking the straps of the skirt into the rings on it so they’re not flappy
Lmao! "They see me churnin'" that made my day🤣 thanks Saf!
Any other Oregonians cringe when they said Ore-gone trail? 😂
Now I am sure she loves Twice
I was literally dying when Safiya thought indie was e girl lol
okay but the second fit was HOT
She literally filmed this down the street from me and I never saw her one :'(
0:40 Chaeyoung and Nayeon 0:56 Rosé and Mina and Twice(fell special era) 1:23 Twice 3:21 Twice (dtna era) 3:30 Mina And many more related to kpop I love your explore page❤️❤️
its funny how the colonial outfit is surprisingly flattering. Ideas going through my head now.
You are awesome 👏
Hi
Que the Hocus Pocus references
Does she really like her own posts? Am I the only one who caught that?
Can someone plz give me the link to the skirt and heart sleeve shirt 😭
Wait a minute are you living in Jenna marbles’ house now that she doesn’t film
with the pink hair and little hearts on your eyes you looked like marina and the diamonds
LOVE THIS VIDEO
h
If it’s called Minga that would probably be pronounced “Minger” (Ming- Err) which in itself is not a good thing to call someone in the UK 🇬🇧 (I’m English!)
I like the Franken mug idea!!
LOL THE WAY YOU GUYS SAY OREGON MAKES ME CRY
The last outfit is... NOT!... for you... And you look like a man in drag walking across the road... 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣
Did anyone else go check out there ig shop I had pink girly, anime 😂 Anime yes but Kawaii no
The 'Witch' top has taken the design from a book called 'Witch' by Lisa Lister!
Killed her husband, hexed him
Did anyone else just went  through an entire identity crisis and just started dressing completely different? No just me ok🤣
omgggg Chaeyoung and neyoen are in the top of her explore page!!!!!!! any once's watching???
I don't know about yall, but I'm here for Safiya doing more wigs in the future! Anyone agree? 😩😊💕
Thank God she started talking at a normal pace again
Would love to see you re-style each piece of that colonial outfit!
i like the franken mug idea 😌😂
I definitely only know what Colonial Williamsburg is because Safiya talks about it so often
This is not my original thought, but I really like the idea and it should be made known: So, there is an online candle store called "Homesick Candles", basically they make a candle with designated scents to each state in the U.S. So the gist of the idea is I/we want Safiya to mix all the candles together and find out what the U.S. smells like- i copied then pasted this so don't come for me
I think the staps tuck into the hoops on that pinafore
I don't work at Colonial Williamsburg, but I do go to school right next to it! Come on down, we'll find some butter for you to churn, lol
When you and jenna marbles have the exact same house
Get so excited when I see a new video from Saf! I loved the mask from the pink enamel, so want that one for myself.  Pink wig on Saf... Na not a fan, she rocks her own long black locks!
I like the wig it looks good
I NEED THOSE MOONDUST BOOTS BUT THEY’RE SOLD OUT 😩😩😩
mixing every Starbucks drink together and then drinking it in the Franken mug
I mean he didn’t sneak it in there. It was kinda there for a good while
Why is no one her explore having like 8 posts about TWICE??💀💀
Ahh I'm so sad qnq oregon isn't said as Or-E-gon its just Or-gun like organs qwq"
brb... off to but those moon shoes!!!
next clickbait video: "Mark Zuckerberg is trying to kill me!!11!!" 😂
40 mins worth it
I don’t know about clothes per se, but algorithms can look for and recognise brands in instagram photos.
Instagram:Historic Safiya: Franken American girl
amazing video, love love love
Is no one gonna talk about her phone backround of Tyler? LOL @3:15
Wait, I'm dying to see the witchy look with fishnets instead of tights
As someone from va who has lived in williamsburg, you will fit right in on main street in the historical district where all the historical reenactments go on.
i just realized that she makes 12 videos a year.
I love the pink wig and mask very much
lets just appreciate the fact that nayeon and chaeyoung appear on her explore page at 0:38 😌
Thanks so much for your videos, Saf! They are glimmers of joy throughout my day!
I'm so heart warmed that she loves and misses Jenna Marbles so much, she made her background look like Jenna's house ☺️😁😜
Why does it look like she's at Jenna Marble's house?
I checked my shop recommended, and lots of enamel pins and art prints, which like not wrong
Did they move to the valley -- Sherman oaks?
I love the pink wig and those boots.
Are you filming at Jenna & Julien’s? Holy uncanny valley Batman!
I love your "not an e-girl" makeup look!  you always look great in your videos tho!!
Omg such a good video!! Love your channel
The pastel is soft girl
❤️ American Duchess
Oh my god!! I really love Minga London's fashion and I am so excited that you bought something from them!! ❤️
dont mind me i'll just be hunting down saf's insta morticia look 😗
Your new house looks a LOT like Jenna and Juliens. It would be so cute if you guys were NEIGHBORS, omg
Please say Oregon right!
Saf I live in Williamsburg and I know several people that work in Colonial Williamsburg I can get you to churn butter and other fun things 😊😁😂
Ooo replace the places with a ribbon. Maybe Silver?
OMG SAFIYA IS A ONCE!!!!!
Safiya, just gotta say big fan. Absolutely love your videos. I love how professional you guys are and how well put together. Your effortless humor makes your channel all the more enjoyable.
"Don't we all live our lives with Sammi Sweetheart as our True North?"
This was fun
dang your house looks crazy similar to Jenna Marbles' house lol
The “not egirl” makeup looks so good!! Definitely would look even better with pastel eyebrows but im not complaining coz Safiya looks beautiful all the time 🥺
Awesome video Saf! I’ll be looking for sure now at my shop tab!
it's not e-girl, its soft girl
Saf is the goth cousin of the Sanderson sisters! Witchy vibes are so much fun! <3
It’s the fourth power puff girl
Is it bad I would love to see Saf to attempt cosplay ?
Okay I need those shoes! ...and also need to get myself someone as supportive as Tyler!
Why do you remind me of Morticia Addams with your long hair😳
My bestfriend and I watched this together and in every outfit we kept screaming SHE LOOKS SO GOOD.
It's not egirl? lmao
I live for the second outfit 😍
tyler has ibs
I live 2 hours from williamsburg, it gets tiring after trips every single year 😂😂
I just want Saf to know that i would watch her just buy clothes she was gonna buy anyway and then talk about them.
I interned at Old Sturbridge Village in Massachusetts for three years and that ruffled cap started giving me war flashbacks.
I forgot all about totally spies!!
,
🧚🏻✨💗💋STAN TWICE AND STREAM “I can’t stop me” 💋✨💗🧚🏻
Safiya's explore page confirming she's a ONCE lol
I love your haul videos ❤️❤️
The way you all pronounce Oregon always startles me... Not negatively. It just... does.
ur new bg is jenna marbles house double
if you want to donate those jeans i will definitely take them hahah
The second outfit really reminds me of Corinne!
I feel like all of History Bounding Youtube is vibrating with excitement for you to start hanging out with them.
I live in Virginia about an hour away form colonial Williamsburg. You can come visit me and I will take you there
Did ya'll notice that Sayifa is getting more prettier?
I have a skirt with suspenders and it has a zipper that goes on the front.
Your literally glowing 😍
I need to find the goth skirt
I really loved the not e girl look haha
Why do I WANT every bit of that last outfit? It's glorious
That pink wig is the mutts nutts and needs to be sent to Lanzarote along with the pink jacket PRONTO ..TUSIND TAK!! LOL ... always love your content and originality #safiyanygaard  <3
I'd watch a millennial macbeth
Saf you need to get @AbbyCox to take you around Colonial Williamsburg! She worked there for 5 years and has also offered to make you a dress!!! It would be an amazing co-lab :) all of the fingers crossed that this actually happens.
Hi
the aesthetic is called soft girl very similar to E girls and tik tok fashion
28:56 wait I wanna see what they are doing in the window
for real Abby Cox used to work at colonial Williamsburg and would love to take you on a tour....
Do a fashion focused video and have your man narrate lol
So when are you going to be re-creating all of the American girl dolls outfits just wondering
I feel like the "not an e-girl" look would be amazing without the wig
why do i find safiyas voice and *crisp* enunciation so soothing😂
she is ROCKING that witch goth look!
maybe you could salvage the jeans if you made them into tiny cut off shorts? That’s my go- to for any jeans I don’t like.
chaeyoung and nayeon at 0:39 LMAO
Salve                That means hello in Latin
nah. i love the non e girl look
Minga is really cool! They seem ethical and family owned
I loveee the second outfit aa
The before outfit was great!!
I never had a problem waiting for you to upload a new video because you always DELIVER! I call it professionalism.
Tuck the loose bits of the suspenders into the loops and then the skirt
I'm obsessed with the jeans and jacket from the pink look 😍
Sarifya really out here looking like an Addams snack
She’s glowing oml! Safiya you look incredible girl!❤️
Should've never told me about this. There goes my money
I was like "why am I getting THIS in my suggestions? Then I seen who it was like "oh, SHE funny funny, that's why" 🤣🤣 I didnt recognize you at first like "wtf is this?" Second thought was "why the video so long?!" Then I again remember you're funny funny so it works.
The last look made you look so much younger!! like you were 18-20!!
Maybe you should express yourself more respectful
i lost it when tyler said “the memes of production”
As a cosplayer who wears wigs a lot, this is a great quality wig and y'all did actually do a great job putting it on!
You should do a collab with @Abby Cox
You are the one who is reading my comment now .. I wish you a happy life free from worries and pains .. I hope you will get what you want 🥺♥️
NEWS MAX and TRUMPS YouTube channel both located on YouTube 🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂🗽🗽🚂✝️✝️💯❤️💯✝️🚂🗽💫💥💥💥💫🙏🏿🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏿🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏿🙏🏽🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
that wig .... girl LMAOO
I definitely need that entire second outfit. Especially the skirt!
Does anyone think their new house looks like Jenna marbles house, just in a different font?
I DO NOT NEED THOSE BOOTS....I TOTALLY need those boots..
Franken MUG
"Just, you know, making room for my crotch"
I’m from Virginia and I feel appreciated
Omg my friend is literally obsessed with minga London it’s so funny that’s one you picked
Ohhh man punkrave have some 👌 stuff
Im sorry but r u at Jenna and Julian's house???
She looks incredibly beautiful, stunning and perfect with long hair ❤️
your hair has gotten so long, have you been growing it out for a video?
is it just me that absolutely LOVES the long hair on safiya? she looks so much younger again.
You look like lava girl!
This has nothing to do with the video...But I want to WARN you all in 💝. Please everyone choose Jesus as your Lord and Savior. All these natural disasters are lining up with Bible prophecy in Rev. We are getting closer to Jesus's return and judgement coming on the entire world. Please all repent with your mouth to God and admit we need a Savior Jesus Christ who died for all our sins. Believe and have faith in Jesus Christ and how he died on the cross for our sins and rose again. Invite the Holy Spirit into your life and turn from your sins. For those who don't repent and choose Jesus's gift of dying on the cross so we can have eternal life.. Things won't go well for them. I don't want to see anyone perish. I love you all, why I'm warning everyone daily and praying for the entire 🌎 daily. God bless you all!! I'm a sinner and I'm so grateful Jesus saved me from perishing. I keep seeking him daily and his commandments and they aren't burdensome, instead I have peace even when the world seems to be falling apart. God is on the throne, amen!! 🙏🌻💝😊
tuck the strap into the rings
The aprons usually did cover most of the skirt for a reason lmao
Lol this is so funny I used to work at English Heritage! And now I work at my local heritage site as a civil war reancactior! I liggetmately churn butter for a living lol!
Also i really want to buy everything on the ig shop tab. Why must they take advantage of my lacking self control
I really love the wig on her, except the hairline
Number 11 on trending Saf! Good job!
When you go to W&M and get triggered every time Colonial Williamsburg is mentioned because it is the only thing to do around here
Its actually pretty easy for them to recognize styles and people on pictures. you can even search pictures on google and find if the picture have similar other ones there :) #
Could be reasons why their is KPop in her insta recommendation thing  1. It’s from her looking up KPop for her KPop video 2. She likes KPop 3. KPop is just that big that it goes into random peoples recommendations
Edit: The MoonDust Boots are now available for PREORDER lovelies!! 💥🚀💃 Thank you so much for your love and interest! 🙈❤️ We'll do our best to make a new batch as fast as possible in the midst of this global chaos! 😅🙏 ----- Thank you to anyone that has mentioned they love our MoonDust boots! 🙈❤️  They were sold out during the pandemic and our production has been affected during this time but with enough demand we'll try to bring them back lovelies so we'll be keeping an eye on this comment for likes to gauze interest!! Thank you so much!! 🥰❤️  Ps. And yeah! If we release another batch we'll make sure we give them shoelaces a good haircut! ✂️💇😅
Her Winifred impression was really good, I was surprised when I heard it
11:41 that arpeggio sounded JUST LIKE Roberto Carlos' "Cama y Mesa", and my latino senses switched ON
I like the wig, I don’t like the wig against a different shade of pink. You should make an outfit with the wig with black or dark purple
safiya in a mask is lily collins
the second outfit was insane but when you put the mask on, it was like the cherry on top. not only was it fashionable, it's protecting people too. you gotta love her fashion sense
That Witchy look is so pretty!!!
I'm 100% here for quarantine Saf, this video she was feeling herself so much and was so genuinely happy and funny and just living her life I'm OBSESSED WITH THIS VIBE I LOVE YOU SAFTY!!!!!
Am I the only one who thinks this setup reminds them of Jenna marbles 😭
safiyas aesthetic: 💣🥀🖤🦇⛓ her personality: 💕✨🐥🐙🌹
I would have loved to see you mix the the outfits together to present me like you might wear. I think the suspender skirt and pink jacket would be cool or go with the white colonial blouse with the strange fitting jeans.
My explore page just has anime stuff 💀
Love you, Safiya! Thank you for the video!
I absolutely love your videos. You clearly put so much effort into your content, and you have such a great flow and pace.
Flashback to when Avani Gregg played 'Guess The Post' versus Ashley Newman & Amelie Zilber! https://youtu.be/rY4-VyWt7lg
Safiya Nygard, the best Sanderson sister.
But now can we get Bernadette Banner to help Safiya with like a 1910 look?
The mug idea is hilarious
House tour?
You should replace the moon boot laces with ribbons!
Saf I loooove the pick hair on you!!
I know it's hard, but no CC makes this video inaccessable.
0:38 WHO ELSE HERE SAW NAYEON?!
Video starts 🙂 Video ends ☹️
Outfit two and together with that black face mask. Oh my. Veeery nice.
I can’t tell if they’re pronouncing Oregon incorrectly on purpose or not
the pink and purple it's called soft gir
this is sort of off-topic, but you should watch The Social Dilemma on Netflix as part of your marketing research for why certain things are recommended to you
The way u can work anything at all.... Leaves me extremely jealous every video. Lol.
did anyone else think she was at Jenna's house in the first unboxing shot? the table and the couch totally threw me off!!
TYLER......HEY!  U  BETTER LET MY SISTER WITCH LIVE HER THEATRE DREAMS SIR!!! LOL
Okay but nobody was really around much when you were out. So why did you wear the mask?
LMAO the fupa region
I thought that house was Jenna&Juliens for a hot second
I work in the Visitors Center the Frontier Culture Museum in Staunton, Va. If you ever want to visit us let me know and I will get you comp tickets for whenever you want!
i love saf's videos so much, omg <3
Anyone else getting jenna julian vibes in the living room shot? It looks identical to their kitchen.  Are they living there now? What's going on. Is this a simulation?
Ngl I always keep breath mints on me for whenever I'm wearing my mask it definitely helps with the smell
*gives tyler credit*
I want that wig!!!
I actually went looking for the witch shirt but it looks like you can't buy it anymore.
Tyler, the wig looks great!
tyler’s casual adel comment
I actually LOVE the pink hair
"Grab your vacuum cleaners"  I died 😂
The 2nd one is egirl
i love how safiya just casually has twice in her explore page
OMGosh, I absolutely LOVE that jacket and wig on you!! 🤩💖
Half way through and what I've really learned is that I need to snoop on what Instagrams you follow.... because I need them
The pink hair looks good on you
carolyn jones vibes with this hair and makeup from 2nd outfit.
10:50 Spoopy lol
2:58   Don’t forget Anese  Where Saf gets her butt scrub
When Safiya was sassy walking in the witch outfit, my mother, who was watching over my shoulder, started singing "Stayin' Alive" lol
Seeing Twice pop up 3 times on Safiya’s explore page 😏 I know a Twice stan when I see one 😂 Hello fellow Once!
I started out watching on my phone then was like, what am I doing? You guys are full screen laptop material tv.. :D
saf on the skirt you’re supposed to tuck the suspenders into the loops kinda like a belt
The witch outfit on you is to diiiiie for 🖤🖤
I'd love to see Safiya dive a little more into sustainability and whatnot in these videos. Some of these clothes I love but I don't really want to put money towards unless I know they're cruelty free and all that.
@abbycox wanna work with you on your colonial Williamsburg fantasy!!! She a total Authority and legend on the subject!!!! Reach out! Make it happen ❤️
Where's the black top with the white roses from?
One of these days I am going to make a compilation of Safiya saying "alright".
why is no one talking about how glowy and pretty she looks without makeup on
im always so excited when you upload, i couldnt wait to get home and watch it
I loved every single outfit 😍😍❤️
TIP: For those long shoelaces wrap them around the ankle on the boot a few times before tying them.  I love to do that on my combat boots and high tops.
Nice
I thought egirls were girls that wore only black clothes
If you combine the wich and the historical actor you get the Salem witch trials.
The pink wig makes your eyes pop! So pretty 😍
I use to work at Colonial Williamsburg and I know people who are in power there and may be able to make your dreams come true! Let me know what you are thinking and I can get you in contact with the person who can help you :)
The “not e-girl” look is called Y2K. Source: I sell things on Depop (mostly my old bratz backpacks and purses lol)
you are literally in jenna marbles house omg
Where is her flower/cherry mask from? :)
45 mins is too long, it's the length of a TV show but literally half of it was just Saf sat behind a desk shopping. Honestly it doesn't matter who you are, 20 mins of watching someone shopping is too much. If you have that much bts, a vlog channel would be ideal, and would need less editing so two birds, one stone x
intro just started:  instantly like
SAFIYA!! your skin looks soo flawless! can you drop your skincare routine!! and help yah girl out :(
Ty did a great job on the wig!
I looooooove the witch look, so flattering and stylish, you look perfect!
I LOVED the witch outfit so much it was the cutest and you looked super hot. The pink wing was a totally new vibe for you and I also thought you looked like a baddie with it so I would definitely love seeing you in it again. This new video was so fun to watch seriously love everything you do <3
Wait is this Jenna marbles house??? I’m confused
23:30 This look is most definitely NOT 1870's in the slightest.  The 1870's was the beginning of the bustle era so the silhouette is completely off to be 70's.  Because you used petticoats it is much more 1840's-looking (since 50's and 60's had far more ruffles and bigger skirts).
killed 'er 👏 husband 👏 wacked 'em👏
Didn't know they have a shop tab till this video. I wouldn't risk buying from them
I love this video but I can not get over the fact that her house (or at least her living room and kitchen) looks almost identical to Jenna Marbles’ house.... it’s like they were designed by the same people... or is that just the style in LA?
You can also come here to Tryon Palace in New Bern, North Carolina.. much like Williamsburg just condensed into a palace and its grounds. I work for a 93 year old lady who has been on the board for decades and can probably help you get in contact with someone to arrange a visit!
what you call the egirl stuff is probably extrapolated from your time being a kawaii girl in Japan?
I think this video exposed that Safiya’s a Twice fan 😳✋
I actually think your final outfit was very cohesive! Not the saf brand, but it's a vibe for sure :)
I'm never gonna get over this intro :') Great video, but I like all of your videos sooo
I honestly liked outfit 3 on you the most it looked just so unique on youuu
SAF..sweetie ..I'm a historical reenactor ...pretty sure you have the belt on upside down. It's ok though. You rocked it!
I like the last one most Bc. in Slovakia And In Czech Its kanda still a thing on wedings. AnD I livE IN CZeCh! Hello from Czech btw.
Safiya, could you please do a review for Noracora.com? I just stumbled upon it. It looks like a higher end Wish.com 🤷‍♀️. I would appreciate it! Love ya!
That wig reminds me of my hair, I'm living for it!
Your VA  jokes are pretty on point lol Check out Yorktown Victory Center also, pretty sure they churn butter there
This witch look is iconic
So proud you’re doing so well❤️
The "witch" look is everything
ok but safiya gets VIEWS wow 😳
Roller skates really blew up during the pandemic. Everyone bought out places like Moxi in March (including me!) I think that my explain the skates!!
ok but where are the subtitles?
Obsessed with those moon boots... trying to stop myself from purchasing those knowing I have nothing to wear with them and nowhere to go....
Let’s not ignore twice in the beginning bdz stage 🖤🖤🤍🤍
Good look
Glad this was filmed before the update
The pink outfit is very Natalina
Instagram is like: "This girl is either a history reenactment enthusiast or the person they'll be burning at the stake."
0:41 Two twice videos on your explore? Okay Safiya, I see you!  EDIT: Okay, so her explore is really just filled with kpop haha, its okay, mine is too.
Safia the laces on your moon boots can be wrapped around the ankle of the boot once or twice to shorten them! Some boots are actually meant to be worn that way as a style.
Safiya you look beautiful in this video .. long hair suits u
You looked so good on all the outfits 🤍 love you guys
Wednesday all grown up haha... also I love the pink hair and jacket in the last look!! Love ya
I’m pretty sure those flower “nipple pasties” were stick on earrings.
This is a very fun video, so glad you are posting again. I loved ALL the Lewks. 💕
Oh Safiya’s a Once? Love the witch outfit the most she pulls it off so well🖤✨
finally back to my fave videos
0:37 I see Chaeyoung, Jihyo, Mina and Nayeon. Like if your a ONCE.
Would  be cool to do a video with Not Your Momma's History. She is a  historical interpreter and has worked at many different historical sites over the years. She's very thoughtful in placing information about the early history  of the US into context, and it would be great to amplify  her messaging!
I’m pretty sure that some of what you had somehow falsely categorized as “e-girl” fashion, could actually be fairy kei.
https://youtu.be/cdJXg7ejO7A
you look good!
the pink jacket and hair, just makes me think of Frenchie from Grease
Safiya: Aren’t we all inspired by Sandy Sweetheart do we not all live our lives with Sandy Sweetheart as our do north   Tyler: never mind 😩😒
we’re just gonna pretend we didn’t see her background? ok
her hair is to die for. she finally grew it out and it’s soooo shiny. i’m in love.
Why does her house look like Jenna marbles house? Lol
The goth outfit was by far my favorite outfit she’s ever worn in this channel
I’m from Williamsburg and my grandma works there I would absolutely love to have you visit
i love the pink wig, it's so pretty, and i want to make a character with pink hair just so i can have that wig
Saf: It's not a pun.  *two seconds later*  Oh wait, it is a pun.  *laughs in gothmilk*
New house touurrr
Your house looks like Jenna Marbles😭😂
Awww thank you so much for being such a doll with our MoonDust Boots on! 🥰👏👏 They look so fab on you and so happy you loved them! 😍❤️ Your look was too die for!  And yeah.. if we release another batch of them, we're gonna give them shoelaces a proper haircut! ✂️💇😅
Omg the face mask remark is spot on
the house your in at  19:09  do be giving me Jenna Marbles house vibes
0:56 where are my rosie fanssss
I keep thinking she’s in Jenna marbles house cuz the background looks so similar lol
The 2nd outfit I love the most
Safiya is cute asf in all of them
Just love, love, LOVE the outfits ❣️🥰
The wig and jacket look sooooooo good on you!
That Intro song still makes me happy to this day
I love your videos and hope that you are doing well Safiya 🥺 Also.. in the last category the pink and hearts was mostly soft girl style and the flowers/carebears/powerpuff girls was indie style
"MY FRESH CREAM BRINGS ALL THE BOYS TO THE YARD" XDD
I need those moon boots
I thought she was in Jenna Marbles' house for a minute there
Absolutely loved that a few of these brands were small businesses!❤️❤️❤️
Okay is no one gonna talk about how her house (other than the decor) is exactly like jennas house? Like am I the only one who noticed ?
If you didnt realise she added a clip from this video in the intro at 0:00
I’m getting so much Jenna Marbles vibes when looking at the background of your living room.
Omg I almost got a heart attack when I saw twice on safiya’s explore page
I love these so much
that swimsuit-like material top feels like they dropshipped it from aliexpress :/
You look like really good with pink hair 🤜🏻😭
safiya maam i love you 🔥🔥😍😍
The third outfit is actually pretty good! Love the wig
If you will wear that skirt again, try to put the straps through the hoops and put it under the cloth after... I think it could work good
seeing Saf's explore page makes me **uncomfortable**
The witch outfit is SO FREAKING CUTE
13:16 i follow that girl in tiktok
Loving the pink hair!!!!!!
Me seeing the kpop things on her feed at the beginning 😳😳✨🥺🧡
Not e girl but it is called soft girl
oh my god i love those shoes so much I might have to buy them myself
Did she said " suspicious " . . .  People who play among us will know 😉 !
This Insta-witchy outfit was actually so perf for Saf
Ah yes, the perfect video to watch at 3am xD
You look SO good in pink omg
I live in Yorktown, Va and I have several friends who work in Colonial Williamsburg. I'd be happy to get you guys connected to facilitate a video. :)
not your explore page being 90% kpop girls
A trending queen 😍😍
All I have to say is that I missed her and Tyler and I'm glad they are back!!!❤❤❤🖤🖤🖤
Do I see Bernadette Banner's Edwardian shoes on her explore page at 3:55 ?? I love her so much omg
I look froward to every one of your videos!  You guys NEVER disappoint!  P.S. we all love Honey here... my 18 yr old son made me add it long ago...lol
How do you kind of pull off all these looks 🤔
She looks so good in everything she wears!! Why can't I be as pretty as her
bernadette oxfords in the instagram shop recommended  no one : me: gets too excited
I want that frankenMug please 😂😂😂
I get excited by a Safiya notifcation every time without fail ❤️
Its a Franken-STEIN. As in the cup.
honestly i need the 'break the MUG and glue it back together' video!!!!!!
Outfit 1) the blouse was my favourite, definitely wanna get it! Outfit 2) the skirterall!!! But maybe with different straps... Outfit 3) the wig and the jacket!! You're rockin' the pink hair ^_^
Oh my god 🙀♥️👍🏼
https://youtu.be/GLzRotujxIw😍😍
Saf looks so healthy and beautiful! Glad to see quarantine did someone good! (Can I trade her?)
The skirt overalls is honestly so cute
Loved the second outfit the best!!
I think the moon shoes laces were so long so you could tie them up your leg. So cute!
Please come to colonial Williamsburg !!!!!!!!!
Totally spies was lit!!🔥
Am i the only one who wonders what she does with the cloths after these hauls. Like does she still wear some of them or donates them 👀   Love your videos a lot saf! Can’t wait for the next episode 🤓💙✨
These kinda videos will forever be entertaining 😭💜
Did u buy Jenna Marbles house!?!??
If you want historical fashion, you should check out Bernadette Banner
Safiya let me just say your skin looks sooo good girl like glass
Ok but why did she absolutely slay the witch look 👌👌👌👌💖
Beautiful as always 💜🖤💜
I would say that is e-girl/baddie fashion, the stuff you googled was more alt girl fashion.
Get in burgundy
Minga dont do bigger sizes:( wanted their powerpuff girls jeans and they didn't even do a UK size 10?? Bro...
omg you should do a softgirl makeover!!
As a Virginian that has been to Colonial Williamsburg quite a bit, I hope you get to live your dream one day
I actually really like all of the looks! Another great video ❤
0:39 CHAE AND NAYEON LMAODKDF
It's a HAYPENNY A GLASS. I'm dead.
Fantastic
TWICE!!!!
how many people do you think have asked her “are u a gof”
Wow the "memes of production" killed me 😂😂
so @1:48 , you should really consider keeping that glasses look.
Saying "e-girl", probably confusing it with VSCO girl. Just a guess.
You look so cute in colonial clothes!
Wouldn't be my taste, but I think the "colonial" top from the first look, the velvet skirt-er-all :P from the second look, and the pink jacket from the last outfit would make a heckin cute outfit.
The twice fan cams made me so happy I DIDNT ONOW U WERE A ONCE:3
I’m sad she doesn’t post as much I’ve watched every single video she’s posted
living for saf's civil war era outfit commentary 😍   two minutes later: oh my god she's actually doing a historical outfit holy shit. Safiya, I need a CosTubr crossover.
https://youtu.be/dfVzenmq5K8
The last outfit would have looked better with black jeans
safiya i love u
The jeans are cute, but it looks like they didn’t get the rise quite right.  [rise= measurement from the front waist—between the legs—to back waist] If the rise isn’t right, the jeans will never be comfortable. ALL the looks were great!
the thing you thought was e-girl is a style called soft girl
0:38 I SEE CHAEYOUNG AND NAYEON
I LOVE Enchanted bikinis!!!
is anyone going to talk about the fancam on her explore feed
Why do i think safiya looked like doja cat😶🙄
Actually I had no idea that button existed. So I guess I’m exploring it now 😂
does that honey thing actually work though. just seems like a scam
Love this one !!!! ❤️❤️ and “the memes of production” lol
Omg the pastel outfit was actually pretty cute!
35:00  lady gaga baby ❤️
One day later and its #5 on trending ♥️
i need those shoes
the wig really looks so cute on her tho 😍
LOL
17:30 everyone check out my girl @/lilyteel ♥️ she does amazing work !! Super cool to see Instagram pushing her content ♥️
Killed her husband whacked him 💀🤣🤣
Did you know that 'Minga'/Minger is British slang for 'ugly person'?
Love this bih
Always enjoy your videos! Made my week, thank you!
WHY DID I NOT EVEN NOTICE THIS WAS 40 MINUTES?????? Thats just how you know Safiya’s videos are too good
Okay but I really want that necklace 😂. I was a Jersey shore Stan.
idk why but her talking about shopping on instagram as some new high tech feature is frustrating lol, like yes i’ve been shopping on instagram for months
I live in Williamsburg!😘
Please tell me where you got that black mask you wore with the witch outfit, thank you 😁
Omg jenna marbles who. Omg the house reminds me of her house it made me sad Haha still love the video
That there was a soft-girl, the e-girls polar opposite.
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO4QdxuciIvjmk8B905_GUA
https://youtu.be/2nsmtYsg1PU
so good to see you happy and in a new video btw love your hair jajaja its so long and love the chemistry with tyler 💕 💖 💗 ❤
I have to say: you slay in that pink wig. You look AMAZING.
wow you are alive
10/10 memes pun, Tyler. Thank you
Ooooh the witch outfit wow!!😍🖤
omg twice in her explore page AAAAHH
SAFIYAAAA
What a beautiful wallpaper she has...
the fact that this all started in march!! 😂🥰
I think the pink is more of a soft girl look
ЕСТЬ КТО ИЗ РУССКИХ?
Because your not waring a hopscurt
Is no one gonna talk about twice
I love that pink hair on you, I don’t know if it matches your vibe but if you ever chose pink hair it would look great
Hey bb this is a wonderful video, I really enjoyed it!! Please continue to take care of yourself and give yourself love, and we will always be here to enjoy your content. :)
Hi safiya !Can I get a reply from you....?
I went on my shop thing for the first time, and it had lots of bdsm items... The thing is.. is that I’m 14  Erm please explain
Getting me through 2020 with this video.
I just wanted to say how incredible you are looking in this video! You look so beautiful 😊

if you come to williamsburg will you say hi to the fans? 🥺
Your living room looks like Jenna's
✨It’s more of a soft girl than an e girl✨
SAF DO A WIG GIVEAWAY
Older gen chiming in here! Love your videos! Love your attention to research and how you explain your thought process  and reasoning. I also love how you follow your heart and post what interests you and are not married to one topic. Finally I love that your vids are clean with only a bit of adult language and humor(the churning jokes reminded me of getting teased in college when sanding my fraternity paddle so I could paint it. Similar motion! )❤❤❤
Aren't we all inspired by Sammy sweetheart?
safiya looks so beautiful with her hair in the middle parting and she looks some what like lily collins 😍
Please include a shirt saying "saucey wench" in your merch
CONTROLLING THE MEMES OF PRODUCTION!!! 😂
https://youtu.be/GY8XBBLB75I
The pink wig looks amazing on you!
12:09 he remembers the skirt from 3 years ago?! 🥺
Thr wig looks fantastic on you. 💕
I love how weird you are. I am right there with you sis.
i had agreed most young boys are trash, i had some steal my biden sign recently and it is now concluded they completely suck after this thinking cat calling is okay
I’m obsessed with Saf in pink!
Ah...I love that Safiya is a kpop stan
Safiya looks amazing. And she seems like the nicest and just unabashedly herself. My true north ngl
lmfao the instagram explore page is mostly filled with kpop related stuff-
Ive always wanted to try buying some stuff from instagram but ive always been scared to cause,,, scams
Okay, I now just need a full-on E-Girl look from you.
This kinda makes me happy, your house gives off Jenna marbles vibes! 😌
Love your videos and you Saf,ty and crusty and you should make a frankin frankin lipstick please 🦇🦇🐾🐾🖤🖤🐈🙏👍🦇🦇🐾🐾🖤🖤🐈🙏👍🖤🖤🐾🦇🦇🐈🙏👍🖤🖤🦇🦇🐾🐾🐈🙏👍
I think your suppose to tuck the overall tussle in the nip ring lol
I hate pink, pastels, in general, and dad jeans but you looked really cute in that last outfit. It actually shocked me how much I liked you in that outfit and the contrast between the pink wig and your dark eyes worked really well. It needed the contrast, in my opinion.   Suggestion for the skirt: Loosen the suspenders by a grommet or two and you lose that flappy look from the end of the suspenders. It would also allow the skirt to sit a little lower so the metal rings are not framing your boobs/nipples.
The third outfit was more of a Y2K aesthetic.
Saucy Betsy Ross... Only Saf! 😂 😂 😂 I think they should die the shirt black then she could wear it now, maybe. 😉
The t-shirt is fake, the brand is omighty.
Saf looks so so good with pink hair
Omg you’re saying Oregon SO, so wrong. If it sounds like a shape, you are 100% wrong.
hi Safiya just to let you know it would not be e-girl it would be more like soft girl
Second look definitely my favorite. I think laces were so long because girls often wrap laces around ankles.
Safiya should do a series of videos where she does a deep dive into diferente aesthetics (like kinderwhore, cottagecore, steam punk, dark/light academia, arthoe, etc) like she did with kpop and lolita fashion or with her decade fashion videos, exploring the cultural background that lead to their creation  (For example, kinderwhore being born in the 80s grunge scene by exaggerating a very feminine aesthetic and then subverting it to make it look messy or dirty, or arthoe being originated by black women to go against the stereotype of “loud black woman” and that black people aren’t educated as well as to create a space for poc artists)
Can I know where you get the pastel face mask? Also, is the moon shoes comfortable? I really like it and am thinking of buying it
What is Colonial Williamsburg?
It is pronounced Joe-Saphina. Just wanted to clear that up sorry if it came out rude
Darling you're slaying it!!! Love love love your energy. Totally be so fun to hang with. New to your channel and so bummed I just found you. You remind me of myself. Tehehehhe have a super awesome day 😀
Whoever is Reading this: Your skin isn't a paper don't cut it Your body isn't a book don't judge it Your heart isn't a door don't lock it You're beautiful Your life isn't a movie dont end it it Be you.. Stay safe (by the way I'm also a small youtuber looking for your support) I didn't create this quote I just wanna spread positivity
https://youtu.be/slcRLGneGpc.
Those shoes would be perfect if the laces were replaced by a wide satin ribbon <3
Can we talk about how it looks like she’s at Jenna and juliens lol
those black boots are awesome
"you heard of flossin, now u be churning" 😂
Jesus Christ loves you all. Come to him today! He's coming very soon!! Sooner than you think! Accept him as your Lord and Savior. Turn away from your sins. Believe on him and Trust him! The time is now!!! God Bless
The ✨glow✨ tho
The pastelly clothes could be used by egirls it's all about the styling! So you are not totally wrong
I would say that the third outfit would be better if the pants are like low like more on hips or more low than the waist level i guess
that witchy outfit was soo gorgeous on you, suited you perfectly!!
The Twice fancams in your feed, god bless
That floral skirt from the wench outfit, with like a cropped black sweatshirt situation, some docs and the right make up and she’d have a pretty good cottagecore/egirl mashup. Maybe a tiktok fashion experiment in the future?
I think the last outfit is called y2k
Tip:Wrap the laces up around your ankles until it’s short enough to make a bow.
Safiya saying she is one of the kids and I am like okay.... less than a minute later I'm just here wondering who the heck is Sammi Sweetheart and how old is that video.... SO Safiya, sorry but I don't know about your kid membership status right now.... lol
I really love that she doesn't care about an upload schedule. She only cares about making her content good. Thank you Saf for focusing on quality rather than quantity. Love you and your videos ❤️
WHO DOSNT WANT KPOP FANCAMS
literally everything looked amazing on you
You should try the Mori Girl look from Japan.
I love Honey it works very well
I screamed when twice popped on the screen
Safiya is basically like "E-GIRLS ARE RUINING MY LIFE!"
Okay, but can we talk about how there is Twice on her explore page
I think I'm trippin her background in the unboxing looks like henna marbles living room lmao
Pretty soon they will cancel you too
When she showed the Jenna Marbles clip.... :'(
The witchy one was like modern Wednesday Addams 🖤 and the mask makes it look even spookier!!
😂😂😂😂😂
I NEED to know where she got the mask for the "not e-girl, e-girl" outfit!
Highest level of stupidity
Oregonian here: The way Saf and Tyler pronounced Oregon made me ✨cringe✨ 🤣
Why does she look so good in the second outfit? 😍😍😍
Where did you get your top you’re wearing when your unboxing the clothes, it’s so pretty on you 💕Xx
IBS is a response to consuming dairy...so, this is ironic.
Strangely the third outfit looked the best from the back. The shot where you’re walking arcoss the street really looks like a solid oufit which was definitely different. Grest video as always!
Anyone else say the sponsorship name with her? No, just me?
so the clothing that you were thinking was e-girl is more Y2K
The witch outfit 😍 you make me want to buy it haha
That witch outfit tho?? Absolutely obsessed! I especially love the shoes!😍
why’d i think she was filming in jenna marbles house lmao
Would love to see Nikki tutorial and saf switch looks by going shopping together,  if they end up doing social distancing then do it by video call as though saf and nikki are the personal shoppers via video to choose each others looks. Then do make up where nikkie helps walk saf through a colorful full face of makeup look and saf walks niki through a gothic look. I'd definitely watch it. Is it weird I got this idea after watching this video?
a 70 dollar front lace wig is usually very good, you applied it perfectly considering it was the first time... personally i think that shade of pink is kinda cold for your skintone/foundation you applied
Saf you look amazing. That glowing skin tho!
You look stunning 👀 with the pink wig 🔥🔥
Wait. Do you Stan twice?
safiya can pull of all of these oufits and i'm jealous
Legends of rock System of a Down returns after 15 years of silence with great song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqmknZNg1yw&feature=share
So sad that I can't buy these boots...
Gir, please do Dark Academia 🖤🖤it would suit you so well!
WOW,I like your channel,thanks for sharing this,     I received the same     product from replicaclubs..ru theree months ago,    delivery by EMS,great quality !!!!!
I love your content!! Glad you are back!! Just a suggestion put the black skirt  and moon shoes with the pink jacket and PP girls that will be more you! Thanks for being you 🥰
All covered up and still catcalled
DID U GUYS BUY JENNA AND JULIENS HOUSE?!?!?!
the pink hair looks so good on her!!!!
I love how Tyler's laugh sounds like he's very proud of Safiya. I could hear his love 🤣🤣 Take care you both! Can't wait for the next videos💖
The goth look is SO stunning ❤️
I'm really upset that you missed the pun with the frankenstein mug.... The FrankenSTEIN
That butter churn ruined my nnn. Thanks alot

With the pink wig you reminded me of lava girl from shark boy and lava girl
Williamsburg is beautiful! I camped there before and got a ghost tour, super cool! You should definitely go! 🧡
Happy to see your videos again, Saf! Didnt unfollow! will be your fan whatever happens! Love your channel!
On the skirt try threading the ends into the rings and under the skirt 😊. Luv you n your vids x
Uugh, this makes me want to go out shopping ):
#5 on trending!!!!
Regarding the black skirt, maybe you can but the ends of the belt through the rings so that they won't hang there awkwardly.
Safiya is so pretttyyyyy <3
Oh my- was that an impressionist painter reference I heard-
I am not down for miss information but an appropriately tagged satire video built around "Mark Zuckerberg is trying to kill me" would be very funny.
I am very upset that Safiya didn’t end up buying a hoop skirt :(
Cottage core lol 😂
I feel like the witch look would look good with a hat
i live in williamsburg 🧍🏻‍♀️
Love the last look though
20:00 Is this an eurovision reference?
The first one, when she tool the bonnet off, for me went from Milk and Butter Wench to Tavern Wench, and could extremely easily become Pirate Wench.
I just hear minga London with a British accent like “revel London”
I love how Twice just popped up in the start😂
Minga or minger (pronounced to rhyme with singer) is a British (south east/chavvy) slang word for ugly woman 😂 or more generally, you could call something "well minging" meaning really disgusting
You do not know how happy I was when I heard the"tgis is safyias new intro song"
Your videos are so cool!!!!
Lowkey will get myself the outfit 3 😂😂
23:42 the vibe suddenly changed when she removed the bonnet, exudes a warrior princess type situation or rebel girl in the 1800s, I dunno if Im being accurate, all I can say is I LOVE THIS LOOK less bonnet haha
The pink wig looks SO good on you
About the first outfit, maybe do a virtual collab with Bernadette Banner.
im getting such 🖤✨morticia addams✨🖤 vibesssss
Nayeon in the explore page ....
Ofc honey isnt available in qatar🙄🙄
Safiya looks great with cheek filler! It suits her face so much. Looking gorgeous 🥰
Webster Wigs do make really good quality synthetic wigs, I own a few and it's hard to find good synthetic wigs that fit a big head (they had lace top wigs in the past which were perfect for big heads but sadly they do not sell them anymore but even the lace front wigs are good). I can only recommend them!
mug haul, mug haul, mug haul
not funny
she's trying too much
she's a boomer! and pissing me off, seriously she doesn't even have taste of fashion and very bad at choicing outfits together .Can't barely watch the whole video
Whoa. This just made me realise how WILDLY different our explore pages were. And also realise how I might be the only person left who apparently doesn't listen to kpop...I do rollerskate though! 😂
3:14 i paused shamelessly to see safiya's apps, but instead found a funny taylor in the background llol
just dye your hair black already and go full Morticia!
Can we talk about how beautiful she looks in this video?!?!
new video is going up in 10 minutes!! hope to see u there 👽
I liked the last outfit the best. The first outfit was kinda cool too.
The jeans are probably a little small because it's minga London and they use UK sizes? A size 12 in the US would be a size 14 in the UK
did anyone notice that her ig for you is kpop??? like yass we stan
Without the bonnet she looks like a hollywood protagonist. You know, from the kind of movies that want to look accurate but also don't want the female protagonists to look any less sexier so they let all of their hair to be as they would be today
If you don't want that witch top, I'll have it. I am a witch, so I have no problem with it written on my shirt.
Love the pink wig
I am officially waiting for the Franken-mug video!
you sutte pink hear
Maybe dye the “witch” lettering on the black top black so it doesn’t stand out? It’s a cool top
That wig looks amazing!!!!!
QUEEN I MISSED U 😭😭
Okay fellow once.
How can *YOU* be saved and have *ETERNAL LIFE?*  1) *YOU* have *SINNED* (Romans 3:23) 2) The wages of *YOUR* sin is separation from God and death, in the *ETERNAL FLAMES OF HELL* (Romans 6:23) 3) To avoid this fate and go to heaven, *YOU* must be *PERFECT* because God is *PERFECT* (Revelation 21:27) 4) *YOU* will never be perfect because *YOU* have sinned, so *YOU* need a *SAVIOUR* since *YOU* cannot earn heaven by *YOUR* works (Ephesians 2:8-9) 5) Jesus Christ *IS* God; who came in the flesh, lived a *PERFECT* life and died as a *SUBSTITUTE* for *YOU,* so *YOU* don't have to pay the penalty for *YOUR* sins (2 Corinthians 5:21). 6) All God demands is that *YOU BELIEVE* in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ; that *HIS BLOOD* washes away *ALL* of *YOUR* sins and makes *YOU PERFECT* (John 3:16, John 6:47, Romans 10:9-10, 1 Corinthians 15:1-4). 7) Now *YOU* cannot go to hell because *YOU* have *NO* sins to pay for. Jesus *PAID* for *ALL* of *YOUR* sins. *YOU* have received the *FREE GIFT* of *ETERNAL LIFE* (1 John 5:13).
The pink hair actually really suits you! Love the video, was such fun to watch!
Despite the material, the tank top really suits you by only itself
Why do I feel like my style is all of these mashed together with some touch of elegance to it
When did your hair get so long?
The American pronunciation of Minga is what had me.
Jesus is the visible image of the invisible God. He walked this Earth to show us how to walk. We must follow Him as He leads the way. He will guide us.
A "Medical Reform"  is necessary. There are too many crooked medical professionals, practitioners, and procedures, that are not being monitored enough to the point of overall malpractice everywhere (nationwide)!!! Doctors, surgeons, nurses, mental health professionals and facilities,  orderlies, emts, first medical responders and all of their issued vehicles, pharmacists and pharmacies etc., must be better monitored when doing their jobs, we need a type of mandated law that prohibits malpractice in any way (wrong diagnosis, attitude from personal emotions involved, sexual harassment, offenses, and assaults, personal issues medical professionals may suffer unknown to the director, illegal dealings in medical buildings, blackmailing, bribery, wrong labeling of patients, etc., and I'm afraid the list goes on and on...  unprescribed pills being issued out covertly, medical cover ups and association in covert operations via medical staff and professionals, etc.,)... Video surveillance w/color+an audio transmitters must be mandatory in every part of all medical+pharmacy related buildings except for restroom in actual stalls, with in every clinic, doctor's office, hospital, urgent care facility, an so on...  How many of you have been done wrong here...?!!!!  Not to mention, billing, and health insurance call centers, need physical files, computer analysis and data monitoring to ensure people are being appropriately charged and billed for every visit so there is no mistakes made on either the medical staff or client's/patient's behalf...  With the rate of how bad things have turned in this specific field of service... We would be better off having machines/A.I's monitor or do the actual check up so man does not have to be bothered in a field they did not plan on being effective at...   If this is a concern for any of you please let your feeling on this particular topic be expressed, shared, and known... For a possible change... The more who come forward, about their overall experience, the more will count!!! Opinions and suggestion (topic related) are welcomed here!
Saf, I love you so much! ❤️

I ADORE the third outfit not at all my usual style but idk why I simply love it except for the wig I would %100 wear everything
I listened to a podcast with sammi sweetheart and she has a masters and is a graphic designer now
Did anyone else get super excited when they seen members of black pink and twice on her explore feed?
Safia you could have tucked in the bottom of the suspenders inside of the loop holes! Wal-a, no more flappage 😆 on another note, I actually loved the pink look lol without the wig, I’d wear it!
JESUS IS COMING  & HE LOVES YOU  Believe the Gospel and Repent ⬇️⬇️⬇️  “Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:” ‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭15:1-4‬ ‭KJV‬‬  The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 2 Peter 3:9 | KJV  REPENT: feel or express sincere regret or remorse about one's sin   THIS WORLD IS FULL OF SIN JESUS IS THE ONLY WAY !!! JESUS is COMING BELIEVE AND AND ACCEPT HIM AS YOUR LORD AND SAVIOR TRUST IN HIM TODAY GOD LOVES YOU SO MUCH JUST COME BACK HOME AND LOVE HIM BACK  DENY YOURSELF DAILY AND TURN FROM SIN DAILY         #christian #jesus #faith #love #god #bible  #christ #church #christianity #fairtrade #gospel #hope #blessed #jesuschrist #truth #handmade #prayer #pray #scripture #life #holyspirit #worship #peace #godisgood #inspiration #religion #bibleverse #encouragement #motivation #good-news
Does anyone else think their living room area looks like Jenna Marbles place? Or am I crazy?
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
I reccon the "e-girl" outfit would look better without the necklace and wig
The throwback to Jenna's E-girl transformation made me smile. I JUST WANT HER TO BE HAPPY! YOU TOO
Please make a video on mixing every eyeshadow palette based on different finishes(matte,shimmer etc) & colour family(yellow,red,blue,etc) please
The black look was great
Okay so you are gorgeous and remind me of Morticia Adamms ☺️☺️
Definitely wearing the skirt overalls backwards 😆 zipper in front fo sho.
My Instagram updated to where I don’t even have to look for it. It’s literally replace the heart icon with a ship icon. It’s really annoying bc I can’t see who likes my post unless I click the home bottom. And I won’t ever shop on Instagram.
I loved loved the last outfit
Safiya should totally try doing an actual E-girl look!
Saf you need to do a SHEIN haul. 😁😁😁
Looking good !!Safyia 🥰💖👍👋
Waiting on the franken mug video 😅
I love the witch outfit. I so want it.
Lol what minga means in Australia tho...
I really love Minga London!  I ordered a full on Outfit with Van Gogh‘s Sunflowers printed on and it‘s such great quality 😍♥️
So for real, Abby Cox used to work in Colonial Williamsburg so I feel a collab. Also, historybounding sounds like the thing you want :D part of historical costume or clearly inspired by history outfits. :)
*I HAVE GOOD NEWS* ‼️‼️‼️ 2000 years ago Jesus died on the cross for you and for the sins of the whole world, He was buried but rose again three days later and He is coming back very soon! People stop there and think why would Jesus die on the cross for me? John 3:16. “For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish but have ETERNAL LIFE!” The word of God says in Romans 3:23 “For ALL have SINNED and have fallen short of the glory of God” We are all sinners and we cannot deny that. What is SIN? Sin is when you break Gods commandments. Ask yourself, have you ever lied? Stolen? Looked at anyone with lust? Had sex before marriage? Used Gods name in vain? We are all sinners and God being the RIGHTEOUS judge He is, cannot let sin go unpunished. The word of God says in Romans 6:23 “For the WAGES of SIN is DEATH” If we commit a sin or live a lifestyle of sin, the consequence is death. Not only physically but spiritually, which is Hell! It is a place of torment and punishment and even worst the LAKE OF FIRE which is for eternity! People don’t go to Hell because God doesn’t love them, People go to Hell because of SIN! Sin will seperate us from God because God is HOLY. The only way to escape The punishment of sin (DEATH) is through our Lord and Saviour JESUS CHRIST! the Word of God says in 2 Peter 3:9 “The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.” Repentance is not asking for forgiveness with the intention to sin again. But real repentance means to TURN AWAY from sin, having a change of mind, which leads to a change of action and lifestyle. Some might ask “WHAT ABOUT THE GOOD PEOPLE??” the problem is that no one is “Good”. We are all evil and unclean in the eyes of God because of our sinful nature. Romans‬ ‭3:10 “As it is written, There is NONE righteous, no, not one:” Jesus also says that no one is good but God (Mark 10:18). There is no other way you can be saved and cleansed from your sins, it’s not by doing good deeds, being a positive person, going to church once a week, getting baptised, being religious. It’s only through the Blood of the Lamb, JESUS CHRIST! Hebrews 9:22 “Indeed, under the law almost everything is purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.” BLOOD represents LIFE! Isaiah 64:6 says that “Our righteous to God are as FILTHY RAGS.” We cannot buy our way into heaven by our righteous deeds but only through the righteousness of Jesus Christ by faith. Everyone is justified before God by faith not by the law. Just like Abraham believed and it was accounted to him righteousness, this was before the covenant he made with God and any works he did. The word of God says in Ephesians 2:8-9 “For by GRACE are ye saved through FAITH; and that not of yourselves: it is the GIFT of God: NOT of works, lest any man should boast.” Jesus says “except a man be BORN AGAIN, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God” We are all born once in the flesh with our sinful nature, but Jesus says we need to be born again of the SPIRIT! When you accept JESUS as your Lord and Saviour, he comes to make his home inside of you and that’s the Holy Spirit and that what makes us children of God! If you want to follow Jesus you will have to DENY YOURSELF, TAKE UP YOUR CROSS AND FOLLOW HIM” You must completely DIE to yourself and your old ways through the body of Christ by faith and be raised to newness of life which means to be born again! Romans 6:7 says “He that is dead is FREED FROM SIN!!!” I don’t know who you are but I know that you’re not reading this by mistake! God woke you up today, God gave you breath in your lungs today! He has a purpose for your life and he created you in his image! Repent and believe in the gospel of Jesus Christ and you will be SAVED! Tomorrow is never promised but TODAY is the day of SALVATION! Maybe this is your last warning before you leave this earth, don’t harden your hearts. RELIGION CANNOT SAVE YOU, ONLY JESUS.  ‭‭1 John‬ ‭4:9‬ “In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.”  John 14:6  “Jesus saith unto him, I am the WAY, the TRUTH, and the LIFE: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.”  ETERNAL LIFE or ETERNAL PUNISHMENT,  What do you choose?.....
ommmggggg I have some items from Minga London!!! I love their style!
y i k e s
I’m not .?👩🏽‍🦱❤️❤️love vids
*nayeon, chaeyoung  & mina appearing in the explore tab*  my inner once: YAAAAASSSS!!!! *WAVING CANDY BONG Z*
as a historical costumer who is almost always looking for good fabric sources, all i have appearing is taffetas and silks. looks like i need to expand my insta horizons
nayeon & chaeyoung 💖💖💖💖💖
Hey that third facemask seems familiar XD I have exactly the same one. (the galaxy one)
Why don't you try making slime without slime activator
loved all this was great to watch =) and just an fyi... I miss Jenna =( I saw her flash by!
More outfit videos please Saf!
The jeans actually looked amazing
Jesus Christ came to save you!  He is coming for his people , ask Jesus to save your soul so you can have eternal life in paradise , America is under judgement.
Kinda glad my insta doesn't have this option 🤣
Please combine the witch outfit with the pink wig and post on insta. Asking for a friend
"Unwanted flappage" 🤣
It's ok Safiya, I've never understood what an e-girl is either
wait mix every tea you can find! then put it in the mug!!
That second look was really super cute! I wish I could wear heels like that, but I'm too damn tall
the third outfit is soft girl, but it can also be soft e-girl bc the style itself, but the colour scheme is soft girl
Safiya, can you share where did you buy the black floral top on 19:26 , it looks AMAZING!
I think the pink hair colour looked really good!
It's so funny Safiya and Tyler have the "same" house as Jenna and Julien 🤭
Gives all the credit in the world to tyler➡️⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Low key want that pink denim jacket with black hearts and matching skirt
I love your content and how vivid your videos look. Anyone else can’t sleep and is watching this video?
I’m obsessed with the witch outfit. Especially with the mask. Amazing you made me wanna buy everything!!!
Somebody leave a link for the retro belt!!! Pleaseeeee
Do you follow Bernadette Banner? Please do because she is amazing!
Not even 2 minutes in I got distracted by Safiya talking about a Selena Gomez horror movie. Searched it on YouTube ("Selena Gomez horror movie igtv"). Found it. Watched it (it's 2 minutes long). To answer your question if it's good, Safiya: It's definitely weird and I couldn't quite wrap my head around it. Like... what's going on there?
The second outfit is bomb af
YOU LOOK SOOO GOOD IN THE SECOND WITCH OUTFIT WOW
That pink look is sooo pretty on you!
Lose the wig and it would have been better
"There is unwanted flappage"  Copyright Tyler 2020 Hahahahahahahah
Punk Rave is actually a pretty decent brand. Good, soild clothes. Lol i find it funny that you consider that way more goth then how you dress. If it didnt have witch written on thr front is wear the HELL out of that top
I really really loved that black skirt on you! It was so flattering and your legs looked amazing! Also that white blouse was super cute. I could see a mix and match of the outfits like the blouse + black skirt + pink jacket. Feels like something you'd see in Tokyo on the streets.
I can’t get over the Minga brand as Minga is a word that brits like me used as a synonym for disgusting so the brand name got to me a bit, however I loved the witch top would totally get that.
Okay I absolutely loved the black velvet skirt, it looked amazing on you
Ooo brought back the theme song !!!!
Wait... this video was 40 minutes?!
OMG! You look so pretty in pink! The wing AND this jacket <3
I tried looking for the same gothic skirt and i think it's no longer available! 😭😭😭
I have missed this theme song!!! 👽🖤🦇
Safiya is so beautiful in all three outfit! Howwww
So much confusion in lock down looking for hope?? https://youtu.be/jSk2AgBmrZI
Your butter churning reminds me of that one polish Eurovision song.
safiya, I have to tell you that you're the only youtuber my boyfriend likes to watch with me. Like he'll even gladly watch you make soap-cupcakes for 30min straight. thank you for that. it's like a lil movie night when you upload <3
Don't get me wrong I love Safiya and her videos but I kinda wish she posted a little bit more often
I love the Dr Quinn Medicine Woman outfit! 💚💙💜
I am a day late!!
I thought you were at Jenna Marbles house lmao
Hi Saff! Maybe you could tuck the flappage in the ring on the second outfit? Hehe just a thought. Thanks for uploading Saf! Sorry for bad English ):
13:55 legit thought that was Zach Galifianakis 🤣
My favorite would be the Witch look, for sure! It fits you perfectly and (despite the placing of the skirt belts) is so in your element. 😍😍😍 i love the pair of moon shoes and the skirt!!! 🥰
The amount of kpop content in safiya’s explore page, yeah, I can relate 🤣🤣
TWICE!!! Let’s go!
old fans will remember where safiya got that intro song ;)
LIKE A BULLDOZER, LIKE A TANK, LIKE A SOLDIER, LET GO LET GO
The witch look was bomb asf
Am I the only one that wants to see the witch outfit with the pink wig???
velvet laces would look so good in those moon shoes
TWICEEEEEE
Mad https://youtu.be/BH8lAGJ6ObY 👌🏾💥💥
Stop helping the destruction of our mother Earth, by supporting the sales of useless crap that big business' tell you; "you need this to make yourself feel good enough"; in the eyes of people that are just as damaged... that also believe they need something exterior in order to love themselves...
Sponsor ends at 3:12
Your so awkward I love it
I want the pink jacket and it’s no longer on their site I’m dying
That ad for the skull bag made me dream about an actual skull, with the top "unzipped" and brains showing, just chillin in my bathtub. Thanks for that. Lol 😅
SAFIYA!! WE MISSED U SO MUCH!! - But if you need to time off, don't think twice and go do your thing! We'll always be here for u ❤️
never realised I have this "shop" tab until Safiyya brought it here
Safiya you are very pretty♥️♥️
I wasn't ready for the Jenna part :(
Only a day of being uploaded and she already #2 on trending!!
is it just me or saf with long hair just makes so much sense :0
i like pink to you😂🤪💞
l the egirl fashion that you were talking abt is called Y2K its 2000s fashion
5s
I love how happy and pure your videos are! <3
I love how the top of safiya’s explore page is just twice posts
Hmmm I'm surprised because I see those shop ads on insta all the time and I immediately think they are all fake like the ones you see on facebook but this makes me reconsider some of the cool stuff I've been wanting to try  lmfao.
0:38 omg yes stan son chaeyoung for clear skin 😌
Haha when she says “personal use” for the colonial outfit.... I’m thinking is that like a role playing thing?
SAF WITH THE TWICE EXPLORE PAGE
You can do a double bow with the shoes. Halve your loops so they become two loops (a total of 4 loops) then tie two if those loops together and the knot looks like a butterfly.
I’m in the middle of the video really hoping that wig is good quality because the price is 70 euros so imma be mad if the quality is bad
🖤🖤😂 love the “ millennial Macbeth”
I'm so disappointed in the suggestions my own shopping tab offered me. I've been scrolling through it for the past 15 minutes and all I got was a repetitive offering of the same few items from stores I already follow. Nothing new came up. No new suggestions based on shops I already like. Maybe it's because I'm in the Netherlands and the shop feature isn't working well for my area?
14:00   "E-GIRL" - thats not what they wear....
Tyler: "dude that's a sick video"  Me: HAHAHAHA
am i the only one that realized that safiya is a kpop stan???? i was like "isn't that twice on her explore page?" and i knew that ur explore page consists of posts that are similar to posts u've liked so i was like,, "let's see if she follows kpop idols" AND THERE SHE WAS, FOLLOWING DISPATCH, TWICE, AND THE RV MEMBERS. OML I'M SO UNINFORMED FKSJFJJSD
also randomly one day I wake up and find find sneakily snuck in only on 1 of my 3 logged in accounts the shop tab has replaced my activity tab ?? no thx
I like the pink wig. Maybe a darker color next time. I feel like it's more you. Just a thought.
Lele pons videos 🤢
Thank You for the awesome quality vids you always bring to us! Welcome back! ... again lol. Please tel us where did you get the masks!?!?! They are gorgeous,  specially the galaxy and the black one 😘
Ok, hear me out, the blouse from the first outfit, with the skirt from the second one
So we're going to not talk about all the girl groups from 0:35 to 0:39..?? 😔
My IG is full of nerdy accounts and nerdy Youtubers. My shopping recommendations is 100% makeup. I dont really wear makeup either. For me, it's a fail.
I love minga london
Lean into the witch look harder, it looked so good on you!
no cause ur instagram explore page is full of twice hmm as u should queen.
Your house looks a bit similar with jenna marbles!
looks like only me noticed how she is an once. ok
https://youtu.be/wfAc4vSHGCg
Without the bonnet you look like a lesbian pirate
I bought a wig or two from Webster's Wigs before realizing the same exact wigs are half the price from Kryssma on Amazon
girl that us NOT e girl!!!
Whoever liked the video....like here to..
That would be a good video.  Also  Was that her neighbor in the background or can people just see into her home like that?
you are dressed like a soft girl with e girl makeup
"You're legitimately terrible" 😂 Oh Tyler
The pants are STRONGLY inspired from the high end brand fiorucci, the angels are their 90s famous logo, which they brought back in the last collections i believe.  Look it up you'll see the comparison   Btw Justin Bieber once wore a beanie from them, if it rings a bell that's why ;)
Wait! Safiya didn’t know about enchanted bikinis? 😄 I‘ve been following them forever now haha
oh my god safiya's explore page exposed her...... she's a girl group stan o.o <3
After you took off the bonnet you looked liked Esmeralda
Your background kinda looks like there's two iggies, a tiny boi and a horse somewhere in the room.
Girl...that pink look was so hot. The jeans, tank, jacket, everything. They all fit you perfectly. If I saw you in any of these in person I would take a second look
That last outfit could be pastel goth if you added a bit more gothiness
Your videos give me life thank you for continuing to post throughout quarantine 😭
Yay first on trending!
It’s technically soft girl but soft girl comes under the umbrella term of e-girl
The shop tag just automatically suggests some things to everyone. Like the brat items and the skates are something everyone gets and I believe the makeup is to. Just to add some spice to it I guess.
Safiya and I have the same taste in gothic fashion insta accounts.
I can’t with the voice cracks😂😂😂
She got meeee 😁😁 i thought that too saf, 🤪
8:19    Wait  Hormone Ranger?Is that you?
Had a birthday, negative COVID rest, Biden winning presidency AND a new Safiya video in one weekend? Best weekend ever
Not all guys discuss dresses like Tyler does:) u guys are so cool together
The pink wig no but the fit is cute.
YOUR EXPLORE PAGE FULL OF TWICE kahakshdjd i was like “wait, am I looking at Safiya’s or my explore page?” LMAO
Pretty sure e girl just means emo for gen z? But just guessing :o
Saf your skin is looking amazing please drop the skincare routine queen!! <3
I like these videos, I doesn't shop or even watch these types of ads, but it is really satisfying to kind of do it through Safiya.
Why do u only make a video if its sponsored
The baby girl outfit was definitely gorgeous! It suits you weeeeelll. Its just the jeans that threw the whole outfit off and the tank top was intended to have that kind of cloth so that it hugs the body more to show off curves. I wanna see it again but with another bottoms. YOU SLAYYYYYY
omg yess buy Minga I love their clothese!
Yaaaaaay!!!!  A new video!!!!  ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
The first two looks you were just vibing and it was great. That last look was cute but so awkward as a whole.
My entire shop is filled with nikes and shoes only D: whyy
The pink hair actually looked so cute!!!
you should do a shopping mystery boxes at Depop or something like that!!
Safiya brings me so much joy
Honestly the ‘egirl’ outfit was so good! I really liked how everything look, and it think it looks great together! And I think there is a part of ‘egirl’ fashion that fits this aesthetic (mostly refering to ‘pink gamer girls’ :) )
I thought about the movie antibellum when she started talking about reinacter🤭 I know she’s not racist and I’m not implying anything I’m just stating what my thoughts were at the time please do not come for me I have too much anxiety for all that drama
If you feels very out of your box you should dye your hair blonde I can see it would lol good in you and btw your first in trending!!!! Yas girlll!!
their house looks like jenna & juliens awh i love it 💕
The most relatable part of this video is not understanding what e-girl is, honestly. I'm still not entirely sure lol (also, I love seeing the behind the scenes of editing! makes me appreciate the high quality of your videos even more)
Uh, but, is your livingroom / kitchen identical to Jenna and Julian's???
13:30 omg I swear I had this EXACT toy phone when I was a child in the early 2000s
I don’t think she realised the skirt was on backwards 😂😂  edit: the zip is meant to be on the front because it makes it a lot easier to get in and out of it
Is it just me or does everyone really like the last outfit on safiyah😍
THOSE SHOES OMFG 😍😍
Babe the way you say Oregon, why?
0:37
So... I don't know if I'm the only one, but I think you rocked the pink wig. In fact, I loved your "e-girl" look, except for the pants. You really rocked every single look though, you really are gorgeous.  Also, wth are there so many bots in the replies?
Plz post more :( I love ur videos
Omg she's back
I fucking love her personality
witch outfit with the mask 💯
Some of those pink looks are definitely also e girl looks. It's a wide variety.
Son Chaeyoung in your explore page 😘🤌 Immaculate
Girl I love you but you’re getting too old for this content 😂😂
0:56 ROSÉ ♥️♥️♥️
I have a bat phone case rouge wolf
I didn't even know there was a shop tab on insta. I rarely browse anything but my feed of the accounts I follow
as a virginian, I appreciate the shotouts and also love colonial Williamsburg, my 5th grade field trip
I just tried the Instagram shop tab and oh my word it’s terrible! It’s suggesting sports wear, football kits and boots. That is so not my vibe nor anything I would ever search for. 0/10 Instagram
Last one looks like E-MAMA
When are you going to have a baby
Uuuh i like me a good long safiya video
I’ve seen the powerpuff girls top for only $6 lmao
The last look is *very* Carrie/Dirty Candy
You look gorgeous
I think that tank top was fine by itself the jacket looks good but paired with the top it looks a bit messy my favorite look was definitely the second one that looks amazing
I wonder if they live in the same neighborhood as Jenna and Julien. Their houses look VERY similar
why am i getting jenna marbles vibes from this vid? is it because she is filming in her kitchen?
This video is so dull
I stan a kpop mina fan 😍
We don’t say Oregon that way 😂. I will now say  my state only that way!!
Before you even mentioned Felicity I thought oh my god Felicity my American girl doll! 😂
I appreciate how much effort goes into these videos!!! They're so good!!! WE ATE THIS UP AND LEFT NO CRUMBS <3
U watch Twice 🥺🥺🥺❤️❤️
i'm in love with that witch outfit somebody pls get that for me
Before Saginaw even mentioned the masks, I was thinking how all they totally elevated all the looks! Masks are honestly pretty cool looking and hopefully it can be a trend even after Covid.
Last outfit...dark bell bottom jeans would look awesome on the Top jacket combo
okay but anybody else think safiyas house kinda looks like jenna marbles? 😌😌🤌
The intro!!!!!
safiya’s a confirmed ONCE!!!!
MORE VIDEOS! THE INTERNET MISSES YOU (and Tyler and Crusty who I hope  alive and well).
https://youtu.be/Jx0nIzHinWw
Hey, maybe I'm missing something, but:  Aren't you supposed to tuck the ends through the rings so you don't get the "nipple tassle" look?  Like, you thread them through the rings, which keep them under control, so the ends vanish under the rest of the skirt-er-alls? Sorry.
Loved Safiya in pink!!
ahh i liked this vid cos safiya and tyler are great but i hope it doesn't encourage people to buy a bunch of clothing from fast fashion stores and contribute to the environmental and ethical issues the fashion industry causes :/ to anyone who wants more clothes—please choose brands that *actually* care about the environment (not greenwashing ones like H&M) or second-hand options where possible! *the fashion industry is the 2nd largest polluter after the oil industry* and tends to exploit their workers as well so we should aim to reduce its impact
You know what makes me laugh is that the third outfit is my fashion sense 😂
https://youtu.be/1VVg7z_eER0 -Tha't the one
Irks me when Oregon is mispronounced! Lol Or-uh-gin not or-e-gone
Safiya, I am absolutely certain we are neighbors, because I recognize so many places you film, and they are within walking distance of me. If we organically ran into each other, I can definitely imagine us being best friends.
e girl safiya doe
Your giving me Winona riders vibes from crucible  You look so much like her in that outfit
0:36 lol stan twice
“A witch, or a civil war re-enactor” I think you mean theatre kid
It was nice to see that Safiya is a huge twice fan too :D cuz my explore page is also filled with them x3 High five!
Ok, I wanna dress like a mix of the witch look and the like pastel/soft girl vibes like I wanna dress like a pastel witch I guess I just love how it looks!
I challenge you to mashup all the looks (2, 3, or more.. ) into one franken look!! or franken outfit!!!
You look good! I love the hair and can see you lost some weight! 😍
I wanted to see the last outfit without the wig. You looked too foreign and unrecognizable without it.
🥰
This first outfit gave me enola holmes vibes-
Why do you have Twice on your explore page? Oooooh
love it. love the witch and historical fashion, so me.
Safiya's video makes up for Halloween being canceled
Did anyone immediately think SNL’s “ass angel” jeans for the third look?
The jeans with the angels are so cute!
I’m here from the trending tab
i super want that pastel galaxy mask tho 😍
The last outfit reminds me of a adult version of that girl from lazy town 🤔
Okay so just fyi I think that outfit three is a soft girl look instead of e girl 😗🌸
TWIIIICE on explore tab! ❤
Love that you went for full historical outfit! I agree: definitely josefina.  🖤💚🖤💚
I like the dark brow + pink wig. Also, very much agree that with outfit 1 the bonnet takes it back an extra century, kinda amazing what a simple hat can do.
That powerpuff tank is literally a childs undershirt lol
milk maid: people, to the milk maid: SHOW SOME ANKLE!!!
i see pink haired(seraphine) girl i click, lol i thought she was gonna encounter a sera lol wig
YESSSS 🥺 i realized just now that you uploaded. you're the best mood booster right when I need it the most, thank you! now onto watching<3
I'm getting K-POP🇰🇷🎤💜 stuff of the Instagram shop tab for my birthday 🎂on Wednesday
Saf just larping that pioneer lifestyle.
I want those witchy shoes!!!
She’s so pretty and her skin is so glowyw wtf
“Destroy every mug in our house and glue it back together” LMAO
#1. I think you should add red to your look. You would look great in red and it is striking when paired with black.  #2. That pink jacket with black hearts will probably come in handy with outfits you already wear.  #3. I love your videos and hope for many more to come!
Congrats Saf on trending. Loving this vid
I Swear every Youtuber I have watched has an ad for Honey. Lol.
Are you housemates with Jenna & Julien? Your living room/kitchen is kind of identical...
You're probably supposed to double tie those boots! Wrap them around the back and then tie them uwu
omg that hair on you looks awesome
Her phone background tho
The way people say Oregon sometimes.... ugh the Northwest is shaking their head
Their house looks super similar to Jenna and Julien’s house
I loved when Mia Maples did this video, so I was so excited when I saw you did your take on it! 🤍
Love this. Too fun!
middle part👀
2ND TIME WATCHING THIS :>
I love that wig on Safiya!!
The way the whole explore page is filled with twice content we love a once
“I nominate you for dysentery” you guys are hilarious.
Hi! I’m deaf and I absolutely love your videos, I literally always watch them when they come out minutes later 😂, but there are no subtitles so I can’t enjoy it 😕 if someone could be kind enough to add them, that would be great! Hope you are all safe and well! 💘 EDIT: THANKS TO WHOEVER ADDED THEM! IM SO HAPPY I CAN WATCH IT 😆
Safiya is absolutely stunning. Goals.
What is with all the spammers in the comments?! Seriously get a life and leave Safiya, her amazing videos and her great community alone.
Not great
The witch themed outfit gives me more of The Craft vibess 🖤
Is anyone gonna mention the 138 messages and 118 phone call notifications? I would DIE just having 1 unread email gives me anxiety
Anybody know where she bought her facemasks because they are soo cute 😌
Jokes were on point! I couldn’t stop laughing. 🥰🥰 Love
Outfit 2 is my favorite, but I'm probably bias because that's how I dress
Alright but seriously can we talk about how Saf is always trending, So happy for her!
Everyone from  Oregon cringing when they pronounce Oregon  OR GON. 😂 also not hate just thought it was funny
I wanted to see the last outfit without the wig 😋😋😋
the explore tab having twice blackpink and itzy sdfgbhn
That witch outfit was so flattering on you!
I love how happy and confident Safiya seems these days 🖤 we all come for the wild stuff she buys and does but we stay for the queen herself (and the legend Tyler of course)
actually really LOVED the pink look
After watching Saf’s Instagram story about the editing process I’m even more impressed by the quality and effort put into her videos.
any other witches/wiccans thinking that boss witch patch doesn't sit right on a non witch? some people seem to forget we still exist and are still practicing smh
honestly tyler did pretty good w that wig!!! also the black suspender skirt is so cute on you!!!!!!
You should make this like a series
Ohh my god that gothy look was so beautiful 😍 The perfect amount of witch
https://youtu.be/_ObkM10Iovc
Plz do a meet and greet when covid is over🥺🥺💕
This video is so fun but you are killing me in the first outfit. You put the cap on backwards and 86’d the apron for covering up the skirt, which is the point of having an apron in the first place.  BTW, love you to bits and I don’t at all expect historically accurate dressing from you. I know you’re having fun. I only mention it because those are the things I would be laughing my butt off at and calling you a dork for if we were in the same room together. 🖤 🦇
When’s the new house tour!?
Hi safiya
The amount of twice and kpop content on saf’s Instagram makes me very happy
You pronounced Oregon wrong lol.
The old intro really confused me for a second there
You look very Morticia Addams in the into. I love it.
Can we talk about how good Safiya looks😘🖤
0:38 twice I just watch "cheer up" mv, why are you guys here???
Snatched safiya!
I am LIVINNNNGGGGGG for the PINK HAIR
We are ALL inspired by Sammi "Sweetheart" <3   Fuck Ron
i spot TWICE i continue to watch
Can you do a video where you try your subscriber's small businesses?
Oregonian here.. it's pronounced organ lol
I'm so happy she went with the Rouge + Wolf shoes! I've been following them since they started and I love the aesthetic, but I've never bought anything bc I hadn't seen any reviews.
That goth over-skirt + the pink heart jacket would be so cute together!!
Anybody else really want to watch a one-woman re-enactment of "The Scottish Play" by Safiya now?
That cheeky twice promotion in the starting segment.. 😂
that second cat call sounded like "safiya"
This is not my original thought, but I really like the idea and it should be made known: So, there is an online candle store called "Homesick Candles", basically they make a candle with designated scents to each state in the U.S. So the gist of the idea is I/we want Safiya to mix all the candles together and find out what the U.S. smells like
#1 on trending!!!!! Well done
I luv the pink  on you :)
i saw twiceee!! My once heart oml
I want that necklace so bad but I can't find it D:
5:58 Bikini and the Beast? Beauty and the Bikini? Idk
Had to go check my shop tap. It's ALL makeup! I mean yes I follow urban decade and such, but it's absolutely not a major part of my profile. Do I not follow anything else they can sell me?
My fav were the boots!!! 🌙 🌚
The last outfit was a mess, but the mask actually tied it together somewhat.
Wow! Just casually watching and my college floor RA just pops up! The IG Flashbacksummer lived on my floor.  That really caught me off guard! Good for her! Shout out to S3S!
You look GORGEOUS Safiya!
I had to watch this with mangekyo sharingan, Itachi Uchiha approves of this awesome vid, Keep it up.
I was so excited to see you’d posted a new video! But I was so disappointed that there are no captions, so I’ll miss out on this one. 💔
*Hey, to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” *www.soul.fish*
This is so cool and funny. The amount of work that went into this is incredible. Thank you Saf for always giving us good quality videos.
Why do I legit want that shirt from the first look though? 👀
i love how her videos are slowly getting longer and longer
This was such a great video!!! 😍
OKAY BUT WHY IS TWICE'S NAYEON AND CHAEYOUNG ON HER EXPLORE PAGE... ANY ONCE??
"If it looks bad... blame Tyler"  "If it looks good..." I was expected "give ME credit" 😂 honestly I love the wig!
Is it just me or does she look like Carrie from Julie and the phantoms
I feel like the wig would work for Safiya if it was ombré from black to pink...but anyway it will not work with the last outfit which was really cute
Wrap the shoelace around the ankle.
I NEED these boots! Can you post the link in the description?
Instagram really said Assigned Witch At Birth
Okay but how do I get Safiyas instagram shop list
Rtt
Oh boy, I'm getting old too because I was totally on the same page with the "this is egirl fashion" thing. What is that style actually called?? Why are they egirls and not just scene/emo?????
The second outfit was hella cute thoooo
imo the huge pink crocs would've done something for the not an e girl outfit
The wig seems nice! Good job tyler!
✨memory unlocked✨ We had Colonial Day in Northern Virginia public school where we dressed up in a similar fit as yours and spent the day doing colonial crafts (candle-making, etc)
I believe that the flaps for the skirt overalls, the ends are supposed to loop back into the circles huffing the extras into the skirt
the goth look was stunning on you
Safiya looks awesome in the pink wig, but I think it should have been the focal point piece for an outfit, rather than just an add on.
I really love Safiyas whole look this video! From the floral shirt to her long middle parted hair, I love how she's experimenting with her look. Im also thinking its slightly kpop/korean inspired(?) bc her eyebrows are slightly straighter and her makeup too. But im really liking it!
You sound like amy from Big Bang theory. 🤣🤣🤣
"Unwanted flappage" HAHAHAHAHA
No one is talking about her background on her phone?!?!
I think the pink wig looks good on you, Safiya! 😃
Not me going to my Instagram shop tab after watching this video-
I looked at Instagram shopping and it doesnt know what i like at all. Its kinda funny. But none of what ive seen is anything that i would buy.
The last look reminds me of marina diamandis
Can we talk how glowing Safiya is 😍🥰
SAFIYA YOU LOOKED REAL GOOD IN THE WITCH OUTFIT!!!!!!!
I love your fascination with Colonial Williamsburg, as I work in the shopping area right next door to it (Merchant Square). No one ever mentions our area, so it was a great surprise to hear you talk about it. I saw several people come into my store in period garb yesterday & I never know if they are actual historical interpreters or just really like to dress in that era's clothing. You would fit right in lol.
the fancam explore page hit me a little too close
It’s Ore-gin not Ore-gon 😭
Loving the long hair
Is saf lowkey obsessed with TWICE? 😂
The skirt is on backwards! I checked the website since it seemed like an odd design and the zipper is at the front 😅
Saf you looking more and more like Mortica Addams! Tell Tyler to grow a mustache XD
Without the bonnet, Safiya is rocking some serious Manson Family vibes in that colonial outfit.
where did you get your masks?
The colonial shirt and goth skirterall would look cute together. Fun video. As always. ✌🤙💋
Hey, this vid is number 5 on trending:D
I really don’t think there’s a single video of Safiya’s that I don’t like 😇
You look like you’re in Jenna’s kitchen and it makes me sad! I miss her!!! 😭
I honestly love the last look it’s really cute!
Ok but the full throttle goth/vamp look actually looks AMAZING on you. Would love to see you dabble in some even more extra vampy-vibe clothes like that😍💖
"I nominate you for dysentery" ayy Starkids
I feel like her idea of e-girl was a merging of Jenna's e-girl makeover and the Claire's video.
Definitely serving some Crucible vibes once you took the bonnet off! Love it!
Can we talk about how amazing her skin is looking over this quarantine, while I’m over over     with my maskne? 😂
vid starts at 3:15
Safiya, you are absolutely beautiful. <3
The ~memes~ of production! HA!
I’d love to see you take 3 pictures in each outfit then stand them next to eachother in one!   Also try the “e girl “ look without the jacket! Would look so much better
can someone PLEASE make a cousin it soft girl edit!??
Your references make me feel sane ❤️
I love that her background is Tyler 🥺
I MISSED THIS INTRO
Are those kpop vids I see in your explore page? 👀
oh shit this is #1 on trending for me, congrats saf !
YOU GOT NUMBER ONE ONE TRENDING CONGRATS
I think the old Safiya is back
The witch outfit was lowkey giving me Bellatrix vibes. Love it.
I would like to appreciate the clear and lovely audio of Safiya’s voiceover 😙👌   she has a good storytelling voice
Good nice sharing 👍 thanks I already subscribed your channel
This is a Josephina look had me 😂😂😂
OK but is no one going to talk about how amazing she looks in the pink wig?!?!? It looks amazing!
You remind me of Shredder from TMNT but in pink...lol
I LOVED your makeup in the last outfit id love a tutorial!
am i the only one that thinks that saf's living room looks exactly like jenna's??
safiya belongs in a long sleeved black turtleneck holy hell 😍🖤
That black outfit was awesome, especially with the mask! Haha. The pink wig with the black outfit would've been a whole new look!
the laces are so long on the moon boots because you’re supposed to wrap them around your ankle and then tie them!! don trim them!
Can we talk about how beautiful she looks in every shot
I LOVE THIS.
ok I did use Safiya's honey code and as someone who isn't sponsored by them, it's real good
literally how did you not break down and start crying at the catcalling 😭😭 you’re so confident and amazing and inspiring! even if people were complimenting me i’d cry! you own it so well. i love you!
Aloha Ears! I love their designs :D :D
ChereBUM
You should make a pillow out of the Power Puff Girl tank top!
You're supposed to tuck the laces bro
I’m more like diet goth, too, but I 🖤🖤🖤 outfit no. 2!!!!
Congrats on trending!
Oh god the way they say Oregon oh nooooo 😅😅
Why is nobody talking about her screen saver? 😂
new video is going up in 10 minutes!! hope to see u there 👽
You look INCREDIBLE  in the soft girl/insta baddie aesthetic wtf OMG!💕💕💕💕💕✨
I loved those velvet boots with the moon cutout. So cute!
https://youtu.be/FKwwGguwAqw
outfit one without the bonnet gives me marilla from anne with an e vibes
I get so many roller skate ads myself. I'm slowly but surely going to buy some one day
love the wig on you! and the pink cropped jacket could go with black jeans
As a Canadian I can confidently say Julia Ogden vibes
As a Virginian, I appreciated the Virginia joke :)
i wanna see safiya get into cosplaying 👀 she really liked the first outfit, i feel like cosplaying would give a similar high
is it just me or does her living room look like Jenna marbles
Kim
Jenna? Is that you? Why do they have exactly the same house
14:45-15:10 had me laughing so hard
I was gonna say "ye lets just ignore jennie in the corner and all the kpop fancams xD"
Weird Al... Greetings and salutations from Oklahoma darlin’s. I’ve been watching y’all for a minute. I don’t think I’ve ever posted, lots of likes 👍, but only now have I realized that you are truly my kind of dorks! Be well 🙃
ngl, until she mentioned the issue w the belt straps, i didnt notice at all soooo id argue they r very much street wearable as long as u dont mention the placement
You should take the colonial outfit and make outfits for every era out of the pieces of it!
0:35 Why are they all twice?
Pink hair looked good. Loved the video!!
You look incredible in every single style ever!!!💕💕💕💕
I've never got dejevu from a YouTube video, her house reminded me so much like jenna marbles house my brain legit confused the two, it probably doesn't but from that kitchen angle towards the living room, my brain was confused 😶 the video was really cool always wanted to know if IG shopping was real
If look 3 is not e girl, what type of category does it belong to?
OREG-IN. Not OREG-ON.  Safiya whhhhy!
Just hear me out: BLANKENSTEIN, a giant blanket made up of tee shirts or other fabric
i see u with the twice vids in the search page
If you see this please send me the link
The fact that Chamillionaire is still a thing in 2020 🤣🤣🤣
Drop the skincare routine, queen. YOUR SKIN IS LUMINOUS AF
I loved ur vid I just wish u left links to all of the items I really liked the witch T-shirt but I can’t seem to find it anywhere
With the shoes, tie the shoelaces around your ankle as well and then tie them in the front? I don't know if that's what they're going for but you can definitely do that and it can be kinda cute
Tyler pronounced Oregon wrong 🤭😅🥰
Your house looks sO much like Jenna and julien’s
Ok but why is nobody talking about how good Safiya looks in the second outfit 😳
am i tripping or does their house have a very similar layout as jenna & julien
But did she get those Maleficent ear or not?😍
the first and second outfit mixed together are just the salem witch trials lol
finally another video!!!
You could tuck the flappy strap ends into the little circles so they're under control.
I love the Colonial look with your hair down! Totally feel another vibe. The witch look just looks sooo perfect on you, those shoes are amazing! I'm into pastels so I like all the pastel recommendations but yeah its a lot all together. As per usual though I think you pull it off, the wig is just a little jarring but I love seeing you in pink lol.
You can’t convince me this isn’t Jenna’s house model
As a youtuber I appreciate how much effort goes into her videos
I love the pink
MY FAV YOUTUBER IS BACK 🥰
Omg this brings my little Virginia heart joy hearing Safiya mention Williamsburg  ♥️
I love totally spyce to 😊
The pink wig will look so cool with the goth witch outfit, and it actually suits you well
I accidentally had on the Chupa Chupa song by El Medico in the background, but I didn't notice until I had watched like half of this episode because it went so well with what was going on
I was waiting for this video so long I had a very bad day and I saved this video to see when I’m most sad ur videos make me cheer up thank you so much
Why is everything in euros
Upon investigation, I'm 99% sure the Colonial Williamsburg outfit was produced by a Mennonite family. They have an Etsy shop.
The only YouTuber I genuinely get excited for!!!
i would so buy that top this second if not for the WITCH part. ughhh
Going to Williamsburg, dressing up as Felicity, and bringing home the “stick and  hoop” toy was a highlight of my childhood. Also, hitting a circle with a stick was surprisingly enjoyable.
I love the new churning dance. Forget TikTok, I’m here fir this.
You should do flowery embroidery next!
I live in western Pennsylvania and there are so many Amish people around that nobody would give it a second thought if you walked around in that first outfit lol
It's ok saf, we know you're just going to go for you same style
The pink wig gives me Ava max vibes           Or Kylie Jenner
Its already a Franken-stein 😭
I think the jeans fit that way because of the style. I think dad jeans are supposed to be like that. I think it looks super cute though!
Please house tour
First outfit reminds me of the Quakers we have here
it is UNFORTUNATE how hot you look in that last outfit considering you didn't like it that much. maybe I'm just a ho for faux e-girl outfits. and I REALLY like the pink hair on you
Are we just gonna ignore how pink hair looks good on safiya and how her dark eyebrows contrast it. safiya do pink hair!
we need a house tour!!!!!
I loveeeeee the mingalondon jeans!!!
I’ve been looking for those boots for an hour and can’t find them under the brand Rogue and wolf. And someone please help me out
Is it just me or does it seem like since they got married they make a lot more sexual references?
Ah I used to work at CW (colonial williamsburg) for an internship back in college at william and mary.  You're two years off me helping you to your butter churning dreams unfortunately.
I would definitely watch a vid of just you and Tyler trying to fix smashed mugs
your hair is so long now!!
Love the witchy outfit, only wish the boots were plain black but still so cute!
The tthing that makes Saf unique is that she shows the whole process of  buying the stuff as well her thought process. Damn i love her so much!!!!
The witch look was definitely the best I love the silhouette that skirt gave you ❤ The last outfit would have probably worked out without the jacket and with your natural dark hair down
I'm lovinggggg long hair Saf
why isn't there a captions option for this video?
1st on trending! Love you saf 🥰
Jenna Marbles set up
What if you let Tyler’s shop tab pick outfits for you?
Wig would look good with a black outfit. Same with the pink jacket but not at the same time
are we gonna talk about how GOOD safiya looked when it cut to the unboxing! girl you’re glowing :)
Sabbath Night Fever... and, memes of production... too clever! This upload is rated F for Fun!
not @ u wearing a mask and smelling the flowers 😭😭😭
so i could be mistaken, but the overall skirt’s length could be adjusted, right?
You tuck the straps into the rings and tuck under the waistband..... XD
This sparks joy!
Hi Safiya! I work at CW! Unfortunately, with Covid we aren't doing much of the hands on experiences, but it's still open! I'm not sure if there's anyone on Duke of Gloucester that churns butter anymore, but I believe there is someone who does that in the Jamestown Settlement! :D Please come here, that would be so cool!
I’d kill to wear the last two outfits, they look SO GOOD
any idea where she got the floral top she wore during the unboxing?
Isn’t Minga the name of the demon form the exorcist 😂
Please please please tell me where you got the shirt that you are wearing while unboxing. It's beautiful and I've been comment hunting for 30 minutes trying to see if somebody knew
Okay hear me out... the pink wig with the goth fit 😍😍😍
The egirl elements you showed would be e girl if you wore it with other items actually !
The first outfit you wore with the face mask reminds me of The handmaids tale
You looked kinda look like Brieanna's mistress in outlander lmao
When u called their hair cut “mcdonalds” I choked
*To literally the 1% who is reading this ,but I have no father, no mother, no brother.💔 No one by my side helps me.👥 My financial state is very bad.😭 I have nothing and no money to take classes.🚫 Actually,what I feel is humiliated and ashamed and sad. 😐 I wish I could excel in my studies and become a doctor.🎓 Please, can you help me with my education, 🙏🏻 to become a valedictorian and fulfill my dream.🤝*
I would love to see Safiya go full renfaire look for us
Safiya, i love you and your videos so much! They bring me joy and I forget all of my stress for a moment  💛
In case anyone was wondering the whole “this looks like Jenna and Julien’s house” thing was bugging me so I decided to take a closer look. It’s definitely not the same house. Not only is the furniture different but so are some other key features like the fireplace being shaped differently. Both houses do have incredibly similarly designed living rooms however, especially when they film from the same angle. The houses are likely designed by the same real estate company
TYLER HAS IBS? IBS GANG RISE.
Love the witch look. ..😍👍❤
Your videos are the only ones I don't skip through, but feel like I'm flying through and I mean that in the best way possible
saf getting cat called in a bonnet is amazing
Jenna 😭
saf i love u and this
I need that witch outfit in my life.
safiya are you a once 👀👀 i saw that bdz fancam
i am so sad those moondust boots have been long out of stock...
The pink hair is very complimentary to your skin tone. Your hair and makeup make you look V pretty with the “e-girl” look.
The 1st outfit is def the look of the Amish.
Twice on your explore page, as they should be. Taste Safiya, very cool.
I have missed yall so much. Those outfits thougb were amazing!!!!
Loved the first two looks and I think the third one would've been good with a different bottom such as s high-waisted skirt as it would've made the legs look very long. Good job with the wig Tyler! Those can be really hard to put on, especially with long hair
That pink jacket is soo adorable
I live 30 mins from Williamsburg!!! Ugh that would be so cool if you came here!!!
Ohhh gosh I really  want to hear again that intro song, it’s so fun!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Hi Safiya ❤ I'm your new subscriber... Can I say something your awesome and your video 😍😍😍
Always fun and entertaining! Pure delights XO
Wow! I really didn’t know this existed. Good video
Her milk churn brings all the boys to the yard
Well I don't work at colonial Williamsburg but I do live here and have two extra free tickets....!
I hate her Caterpillar eyebrows
tell me why I would wear the blouse from the first outfit, with the skirt from the second, and the jacket from the third
this makes me want to buy stuff off my instagram shop tag lol
I love the pink hair on you, it just doesn't feel like you since you're gothy haha
The franken mug was awesome! ❤️ ~✿~❧~🌿~❧~✿~ ❤️
can we just talk about how good she looks with her long black hair?? I hope shes taking care of herself more now because i can see her face seems much happier and lifted if that makes sense?
safiya i see ur instagram explroe page with twice. secretly a once?? 030
omg those shoes!! i am in loveee. lowkey wanna get them in the future if they have my size. great video as always saf :')
Her house looks like Colleen ballingers house. I wonder if they live near by.
E girl but make it Lazy Town
Why was the third outift kind of everything tho
the shop page replaced where my notifications are     I hate it
So are we all gonna skim over all those fancams and edits in her explore page.? 😏
The background is serving Jenna Marble's energy and I am here for it
I did not expect to see TWICE on your explore page
I love how she had matching masks for each outfit so organised 😄
The fact I didn't realize this is a 38 minute video until it ended
Safiya seeing princess bathing suits: *Excited* Seeing Disney villain bathing suits: *😮😯😮*  Btw I love your videos Safiya, I came here a little after it was posted and was so excited lol
I have one crucial question, whats the eyeliner Safiya uses? because it's always, ALWAYS jet black and popin.
Trying to convince myself I don’t need those shoes ... it’s not going well
pleaseeeeee I need a frankenmug video!
Please make a video where you try to incorporate all the items you keep into your normal wardrobe!!
Queen Twice! 🍭
Btw you look so pretty girl .
At 33:10 I just heard Stupid Love playing in my head Mega Lady Gaga Chromatica Vibes ✨✨✨
also i learn more here than i learn in my fashion class..... 😇
aww the love.... n if saf has brath issues please use tongue cleaners people chug mouth wash like there's is no tomorrow but don't scrub their tongue which is generally the culprit
THE PINK OUTIFT IS SO CUTE OMG WHY DO YOU HAVE DOUBTS???
Wait....you filmed this in June? But it’s November now. Does video production really take that long?
The pink jacket could look really cute over the velvet suspender skirt.
How has no one mentioned the glorious middle part that frames Safs so well
If asos can match style to a picture, I wouldn't be surprised that Zuck fan.
Minga London stole a design from me when I was 16. When I emailed them they sent me $70, and being 16 I was like "WOW THAT IS SO MUCH MONEY", but no it wasn't. I can't pursue it legally because I agreed to such little money when I was young, and they still sell my design. I hate them :)
Safs and Tyler’s living room look eerily similar to Jenna and juliens
ok but i think that saf is kinda rocking the pink hair
"Overall" I like it 😅
I know you were joking, but I think the mug video idea would be hysterical! It would be like an ultimate puzzle...
I love all three outfits, especially the third one!  It makes me laugh how similar our tastes are... being early 90’s babies is apparently a style taste
Giving me Morticia vibes 😍😍😍
You look like Morticia! ❤😍
Oh safiya trending #5 I see
When you churned the butter😂😭I can’t stop laughing
I love how happy she is in this video! 🥰
Speed of speech on point this video
Me, a Colonial Williamsburg Shoppe manager here like 😱😱😱😍!!!
Lots of pressure: Will you get another tattoo for 9 million subscribers?
dude if your not staying with the pink skirt and jaquet give to me, it's so beautiful t.t.
omg ur on #1 on trending yfcgvjbnk
As a native Virginian (and I still live here), I loved the VA joke tbh.
I use that shop page to organize bc theres a lot of brands that i use in the page , the bad part is that  instagram Just CANT AVOID PROMOTING USA AND UK STUFF and im from Brazil and dont buy that much from outside South America more so... any ppl know how to chance it ??
i will always love this channel💀 everything about it is literally perfect
The wig would look great with the witch outfit
Biden won
Have anyone noticed Safiya's wallpaper?😂😂
She looks really good in the pink outfit!
OMG TOTALLY SPIES! ❤❤
Wow!! You look even prettier than usual!!!!
Oh how much I love Safiya. Kinda feel bad for Tyler cause he never gets new stuff
BWAGAGAG SHE HAS TWICE ON HER EXPLORE PAGEEE 🥺💀
🦇Donner party chic vibes.🦇 U be churnin' And thanks for the Virginia joke.👍🍎
https://youtu.be/z13n6jS-NCo
Saf!! you’ve always been so beautiful but lately, you’ve been GLOWING in your videos. you look so happy & healthy. we <3 you !
Please never put new shoes on a table or worktop it's bad luck 💛💛
wait but when you were unboxing your clothes it looked exactly like jenna marbles’s house lmao it’s like the exact same layout
I realy like the last two its so cute and i like that u keep on saying egirl
i can’t imagine then having sex like do they just make jokes and puns the whole time? lmaoo
As someone who is from Oregon it offended me how they said Oregon
HEY HEY HEY SAFIYA FOR THE “OVERSIIRT” TUCK THE FLAPS INTO THE LOOPS AFTER YOU PUT IT ON! IT LOOKS SO GOOD ON YOU BTW! It should help keep the flaps down and not make the loops sit there like straight up nipple outlines. PLS LIKE SO SHE CAN SEE THISSSS!
If Saf paired the prairie shirt with the velvet skirt and pink wig, I would survive the winter.
one the jumper dress, you just need to tuck the extra leather on the staps inside the rings
Safiya with pink hair is everything 😍 💗
Either my brain has been spending too much time watching bangtan videos, or Safiya’s pronunciation of sugar has no r so it sounds like Suga instead
You should do a "Dressing Cottagecore for a whole week" vid
OK NO ONE TOLD ME SAFIYA IS A KPOP FAN (based on her explore page) AND NOW I'M SHOOKT
I’m guessing safiya likes twice
I really wanna know where you got that rose blouse I absolutely love it❤❤❤🥰
Oooh this one was so much fun!
okay i just want to recognize all the twice content in her explore page
Ty:"Was that inspired by Sammi Sweetheart" Saf:'You mean she didn't come up with that?" Ty*getting nervous:"I  mean.... Saf:"Aren'twe all inspired by Sammi Sweetheart..!" Ty*defeatedly:"Never mind"  LUV U GUYS!!!
I’m looking for people who wants to earn an extra $100 a week. This is real money. No scam
Love the witchy outfit! Looked so good !!!
Does anyone else get this odd wave of excitement when watching Safiya's videos
Safiya, instagram can analyze pictures and get colors and words and possibly the type of clothing. This was originally designed to help people who are blind, but clearly FB monetized it.
The wig looked kinda awkward, may I suggest Brad Mondo's tutorial on how to make it more natural looking?? haha I loved the witchy outfit and THOSE SHOES!!!
Is anyone else just super tuned in to only the Aesthetic Witch look to get an actual review of PunkRaveStore? LOL
Omg thank you for knowing the difference between a fancam and an edit🙏
I never post pictures of me and don’t follow any fashion accounts and instagram was able to recommend things I really liked
the wig looks good! Good job Tyler
I ALWAYS LOVE IT WHEN YOU'RE BACK ...sorry I got excited.
I love how Tyler supports Safiya and how they can play tease each other <3
Omg omg omg my husband and two boys and I are going to Colonial Williamsburg this next year in July. If I see you there I will definitely fan girl sooo hard. We love watching your vids! ♡ from FL - the Hobbys
Wat a cool transgender
You looked amazing in every outfit! I could never pull off all these styles. Get you a girl that can do everything
Was that a jojo reference?
THE BLACK OUTFIT LOOKED SO GOOOOOOOD
I fell in love with the moondust shoes and now I can't find them anywhere 😩 💔
Don't think we didn't see the 'Recently Viewed' on the Jedi Robes
omg we have the same phone case
I love the witch outfit
Hello friends 😂💗😃
Wow you've reached truly amazing levels of Morticia vibes!
The pink hair is so cute!
Ho
saf, it is okay to watch kpop fancams ♥😭 your explore page is telling on you
Saf, in the 90' we wrapped our laces around the ankle of the boot a time or two when the laces were extra long (we liked them long)
as an oregonian, you saying oregone is hilarious lmao fix ur Pronunciation
Enjoyed Vid. Historical & Gothic outfits are my fav. Were did you get the black & white peasant blouse. I love it!
the fact that every mask of hers match the outfit is legendary 👽
I actually loved the last fit!
I almost didn't know how much I missed the old background
I’m surprised by how much of this I wanna buy.
I actually love the “not e girl” fit
Sophia, do the double bunny ear knot to shorten the shoelaces 😊
DON'T TELL ME I'M THE ONLY ONE EHO NOTICED TWICE'S NAYEON AND CHAEYOUNG IN THIS VID AGHSHDHDHDHD
saf looks so pretty in the try on oml
If this is a fact, that you as a human being who is the world and the world is you, are living a life in which there is no psychological conflict, then how will you live a life without conflict outwardly? When there is no conflict inside, there is no conflict outside because there is no division between the inner and outer.
Nflx I was kinda shook by the cover of this vid if you don’t know video games there is this game called league of legends and they just released a new champion that’s looks basically like the e girl look
honey has saved more money than trump has paid in taxes :)
ma’am that is not how you say oregon
ugh i want those moon shoes so bad
An idea if you need a butter churning outfit again: wear the brown skirt under the floral one and knot the floral one so it peaks out at the bottom.   They wore so may petticoats you could easily do both.  Thx for another great vid. :)
the second outfit looks sooooooo good on Safiya omg dshsgdjhjd im tearbending
Majority of the e-girl and nostalgia clothes are on Aliexpress. I bought the powerpuff girls tank top (15:42) for $12 on aliexpress and instead that shop was selling it for $24. Always check aliexpress before you buy from these brands.
Am I the only one that thinks she looks SO good in the last outfit?!?
I really like the pink wig on you! I think it could look weird of you wore it dressed down &/or without any makeup, but with the eyes defined (to match your brows) it looks good. Although I've had a similar shade of pink on my hair for a couple of years, so I'm kinda biased!  (edit: I also loved the boots, I think the blouse could be a pretty versatile piece, the pink jacket was a good cut, but maybe better over a dress than with jeans?  I always have trouble with anything involving suspenders - I've got a long body and big-ish boobs and it just never works very well. Which is a shame because it's a look I'm here for! Some good picks though, as always. I share a lot of your tastes, but don't have the money to spend, so it's always great seeing you test these things out and give us some idea of what is good value vs cheap tat/knock offs, etc. Thanks for taking one for the team again, Saf! 😘)
that pastel, hearts, cartoons look is soft girl not e-girl lol
The third outfit had some sailor moon Rei vibes
The memes of production! Omg, genius Tyler!
So twice is just chillin at your explore huh
Ooh wear the tank with the black skirt
Okay Safiya, but who wrote the note??!!??
How they pronounced Oregon thoooo it was soo funny
In the next video, Saf churns butter from scratch, adds different flavors, and forms it into fun shapes 😄
GIRL the wig us AMAZING
not sure if it was the makeup, but the last look gave me major marina diamandis vibes
0:36 its twice and itzy haha 😆 is safiya a jyp girl group stan?
giiiirrrllll I love that hair color and length on you!  The wig is really cute
2 hours later 5 trending
that Tyler wallpaper tho LMFAOO!
I love this kind of video! Thank you Safiya and Tyler for your great content!!
You look so good in the black witch outfit with the mask 😷
I was today years old (I am 41) when I heard the name sammi sweetheart, I had only heard of snooki and jcow or jwow, whatever
PLEASE go to Colonial Williamsburg!!?!!
Really love your content!
please do a colonial williamsburg vlog someday!!!!! i grew up going all the time bc my gramma worked there, its such a beautiful fun place and so dear to my heart ❤
My only complaint is that Saf didn’t do a whole week of outfits. I love these videos my god
Hey Safiya and Tyler! Love the vid. Your fashion sense is on point!
Aaah thank you so much for including my e-girl video!! You are legit one of my main inspirations I feel so honored!! 🥰❤️ Btw I think your “not an e-girl” outfit is actually a soft girl outfit and it’s totally cute! Pastels and Y2K nostalgia are essentials in the soft girl aesthetic. I also have a video explaining the soft girl aesthetic further if you’re interested 😉
i love the pink wig
When she’s got the mask on with the witch outfit I am very gay
I decided to check out my shop tab out of curiosity and I was very confused. A lot of my stuff was pink and dresses and Lolita which doesn’t make sense since I’m a dude interested in dark punk and goth fashion 😂
40 minutes didn’t feel that long when I could experience the secondhand joy of churning invisible butter in that historically-fabulous getup
She looks SO GOOD in all of them!!! I love the second one, you look incredible saf 😍
saf’s future child is gonna have so much fun dressing up in their moms clothes 🥺
ⓦⓞⓦ ⓢⓞ ⓜⓤⓒⓗ 𐃢☕︎𓂢𐂡𓂢
Chaeyounggggg!!💜💜💜minaaaa!!!! TWICE!!!
Seize Control of the memes of production
21:49 “Surprising turn of events” was a missed opportunity to say “surprising CHURN of events”
When I first saw that lace front I thought "ooooooooh please watch some tutorials!". However, as someone who normally wears wigs professionally you did a pretty damn good job. If I ever meet you in person I'll show you a mean pincurl technique.
I'm guessing a lot of the old time-y clothes are popping up because "historybounding" has gotten really popular with YouTubers like Bernadette Banner and Morgan Donner. I saw American Duchess in your explore tab, so that's probably what ticked it off in the algorithm.
My school trip were trying to go to Williamsburg
6:14 my mom has the same hocus pocus shirt and i did a double take when i saw safiya wearing it lol
If I saw someone wearing the first outfit, I'd just think they were Amish because I live in Ohio lol it wouldn't even get any attention here
safiya your hair is literally so gorgeous in this video!!! 💛
I wanted to see the last outfit without the wig 😕
When she was talking about e-girls and she showed Jenna and Julien 😭😭😭💔💔💔#fuck2020
I’m obsessed with outfit #2 🖤 it looks amazing!!
You have to wrap the laces around your ankles a few times before you tie them.
You look really good iin the witch outfit. It really suit you.
American girl doll love triangle 😂
Maybe the clothing you thought was e-girl would be more like y2k?
For some reason I was unsubscribed from you! Wth, anyways I resub'ed. And turned on Notifications :3
We need more videos from Safiya and Tyler 💖👌🏻
The third outfit would have been more "e-girl" if you had used a bit more black accents. The e-girl aesthetic takes a lot of inspiration from goth, alternative, and harajuku fashion. Most e-girl looks have a black or striped skirt, fishnet stockings, a pastel accent color in the shirt or hair, some kind of wallet or belt chain, and a pair of shoes that make you 4 inches taller. The 3rd look has more of a Harajuku Pastel vibe than an e-girl vibe. But, I loved the jacket!
18:15 Is Safiya in Jenna Marbles' home?! Lol it looks so similar
The bonnet would go the other way. Your hair would be in a bun at your neck and that area with no ruffles goes over the bun
I HAVE IBS TOO ITS A MOOD
Safiya in the wig reminds me of lava girl I love it💕
Can you do a video reacting to totally spies and other nostalgic cartoons
Oregon is pronounced like organ sincerely an Oregonian
love the goth one more :D
Omg ur impression of Winnie had me laughing hysterically! It hurt my chest was laughing so hard lol
Me watching this while wearing my sweater I got off of Instagram 👁👄👁
As someone from Virginia, I get excited any time anyone talks about Virginia 😂
Man I have so many clothes from Punk Rave I've got a whole box full of those bags XD
Safiya and Tyler would make a GREAT Morticia and Gomez Addams.
Orygun...dude...
Favourite on you was the witch-look, the whole thing flattered you so muck!
Please do a historical accurate Victorian video. Please
Like these if you miss safia's old intro and comment if you love the new one!😍🎶
Saf: this outfit doesn't go together  Me: 😍😍😍😍   Girl that last outfit was BOMB from all angles!
I think the clothing/aesthetic from the “not an e girl” outfit was from all your k pop likes and follows. The pastel and soft/cute stuff is probably what they were trying to sell you!
I’m around your age and I would also call that an e-girl outfit 😞 lmao idk anymore
I’m surprised you weren’t already aware of punk rave or rogue and wolf brands with how you dress already
11:36 you can see her screensaver its so funny
✨You should let us pick out your outfits for a week I have some great ideas for you :)✨ Just putting that out there think about it ;)
When yall started talking about insta-mortisha I instantly thought "I guess Wednesday day had a glow up"
https://youtu.be/tqBTGJ3FXRE her realty
I love the Witch Look omg 😍
18:16~ when it finally arived
I'm so vibing with the silhouette and look of the witch outfit 😍😍😍
fold the shoelaces in half and lace them with 2 through each eyelet.
The "e-girl" items you were looking at are more Soft girl. :) Just if you were wondering!
I would lowkey watch the mug video
queen of youtube
I work at a local second hand store and see Quaker women come in all the time looking at the vintage books dressed like the first outfit! They are so nice some of my favorite customers :)
The E-girl stuff is more of a soft girl look or y2k💕
i opened the shop tab and the first thing recommended was a vulva earring🥸
Why does her house remind me of jennas?!
“Vintagey sweaters” honey it’s cottagecore
Loving the long hair you look great!! Giving me goddess morticia addams vibes 👸🏻😉🥰
why does the colonial outfit suit you so well lol
so was anyone going to tell me sofia was an undercover kpop fan or was i just supposed to find that out from an instagram shopping video myself
“Never mind..” 😂
Saf, props to Tyler for the wig apply. The wig looked pretty good on you, like a whole new side we've never seen before. Loved how you and Tyler bounce off each other, and all out was just a plain good video with great humor. Love y'alls work soo much!
Yayyyy
I had a totally spies game for my green game boy idk if I ever finished it-
Put the “nipple tassels” through the rings and they won’t flap around hahah
I love all the outfits on you Safiya!
Honestly my main issue with instagram shopping is that it’s very northern hemisphere focused. I keep getting edits that are like “fall 2020” and “sweater weather is here” but I live in New Zealand so we’re going into summer  😂 I would love to buy a sweater but I would die.
There has always been a STRONG sense of simpatico watching Safiya, I think we grew up in the same area (half the family is in Chicago)...similar sort of environment etc and now the final flourish: COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG 🙏🏻❤️🙏🏻 that place was the family’s summer JAM! Lord we would go to any place within a five hundred mile radius. Greenfield village in the Detroit area, Sauders museum in Archibald Ohio and any Amish anything anywhere!! I’ve always loved Saf but a tricorn hat reference has done me in 🙏🏻❤️😂
Nice audio, very crisp 👌🔥
do you and jenna marbles have the same house...
You seriously looked so great in all of them!
The pink wig makes her look like a Descendants character.  Also  josefina was one of my favorites. Who was your favorite?
Prairie Girl/ Milkmaid/ Cottagecore vibes 🍒🐄
Safiya, we miss your videos! <3
I’d pluck the wigs hairline! Makes it more natural.
I really liked the last outfit—I think the fit of the jeans altered the look. If you’d put on a light skirt or something that fit more, it would have worked great! But, jeans are just so difficult to buy and you are really long legged, so that makes it even more challenging when these items likely come from China. Loved the way you made each look! Glad to see you back too!
Wow your hair looks really great! It looks shiny and healthy, we need your hair care routine plz!😄
ok am i the only one who thinks that her set up looks exactly like Jenna’s house i love it
That pink wig just made this Nikita Cosplay
Strawberry Shortcake/ PPG Blossom Vibes 💗✨
Middle part Safiya >>>>>>
I just wanna say ✨SAFIYA IS GLOWING✨
oh I really missed the intro song
I wud definitely watch tht mug idea....just saying
Anyone notice the hush app? 😂 I think they closed some time ago right?
I would love a video where the two of you learn about how wigs work. Like, making, shopping, applying, etc. It would be handy knowledge to have for future videos!
Got that WAP  Wet Ass Palette
I thought she was in Jenna's house
dudeee i wish you got the bucket hat for the last look 😭
I love your vids XD but I fill this was not a good video at all. Sorry! This is not what you do for YouTube, yes you can do what you want, but you do makeup now. Two years ago you did the Snapchat etc. yes i can’t tell you what to post but this is not you!!!!!!!! I followed you for you being funny not so Historical!!. This isn’t like a review but I feel you should know what you should be posting and what to do for your fence I have been here for like forever, and for how many years I’ve known you through YouTube this is not you this is not what YouTube you do make up now so I would stick with that where do you lose followers this is no hate because I will continue to watch you just this video is probably not a lot of peoples type. Sorry for the Misspelling words
So weird to hear Saf talking about Colonial Williamsburg when I'm down here for college rn 😂Don't come on weekends it's crazy crowded
I feel like the last outfit is more like the y2k or soft girl styles than e girl
Mmmm I liked the old intro...
The wig looks cute on you, Saf ❤
I just can't get over how much their house is JnJs house. Right? Is it just me?
"It's Sabbath Night Fever." Yes.
safiya must be a really genuine fun person cos i ALWAYS lmao everytime i watch her videos
I HAVE THE SAME PHONE CASE :D
The last look is SOOO GOOOOOODDDD!!!! It fits you so well!
Is nobody going to talk about the fact that she looks AMAZING in pink hair 😍😍🙌
I absolutely love this video! You are so funny and amazing! Also... I need those shoes!
4:30 is it just me or does it look like they photo shopped a different face onto the girl in the blue pants?
tyler’s “seize the memes of production” joke isn’t getting the attention it deserves
The 3rd outfit is y2k which is 2000s aesthetic
Safiya, I NEED you to mention how much you look like the Love Witch movie!
As an Oregonian I feel obligated to let you know its pronounced like  Organ not Or E gone
Mark is trying to kill us all....
Ok safiya is like irl version Celestia lundnberg
I vote black ribbon laces for the moon shoes.
27:28 has me laughing my ass off🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm pretty sure the shop tab has been there for at least a year, if not as long as explore
Maybe tweeze some of the hairs of the part and the wig would be nice
power puff tank top is drop shipped from chinese wholesale warehouses through aliexpress shein wish etc . very unethical business with click baiting and not being honest about the source and like 400% price markup. pls safiya use your platform to educate about this problem
I am in LOVE with the second outfit
Does anyone know where her top is from?? The black long sleeve with flowers
Did I really just watch this for 40 minutes.... yes. Yes I did.
For the skirt, could you tuck the end of the straps into the skirt so they dont flap around?
Safiya is the only youtuber I will watch a 40 minute video
I'm doing my masters in colonial Williamsburg, and might I say, I feel s e e n
12:51 That's just "Beautiful Creatures". Like if you even know what I'm talking about.
i would legit love to watch a video of you at colonial williamsburg (maybe when COVID is better lol)
cottagecore saf cottagecore saf
I love the witch style
He did good with the wig it looks good on you girl
Where did she get that top though!!!(the black floral one)it's so pretty!
god i love a lot of those clothes but worry i’d never pull them off. i want that pink jacket so bad
Outfit #2 I'm LIVING for it. I love it, I would wear it. Just 10/10 all around.
Literally the first frame I see Safiya, I get Morticia.
Jesus loves you! John 3:16
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
YAAAAAS KWEEN CHUUUUUUUURN
at this point i’m convinced safiya and jenna live in the same house
Lol Oh, my gosh... I SAW IT! The advertisement to preorder the shoes Bernadette Banner designed with American Duchess! Nice crossover. Lol
Okay but like I want that jacket
"As we are all want to do" matched up with her scrolling with her head covered was perfect lmao
the witch one looked so good, was deffo my favourite
The sharp widow's peak on the wig is what ruins it I think
Is it just me, or does Saphiya look like Morticia from the Adams Family
13:00
I just noticed the tank top literally has the Omighty logo on it they just took the exact same print omg
The straps are suppose to go through the ring hoops love
is anyone elses favourite part of these videos tyler constant support, comments and giggles
ok the pink hair is a LOOK!!! Definitely wear it again I'm obsessed
That comment about the vintage look being very 70's with the album picture showing up made me really want Saf to dress like Cher for a week.
I can confirm saf is a once 😂
You should post videos more often
As an Oregonian I’m personally offended at how you pronounced Oregon😭😂
I am obsessed with the second outfit it's perfect and it looks amazing on you (all the outfits looked good on you but I prefer the second one)
I LOVED THE WITCHY OUTFIT AHHHH
The last fit looks like a kid core/dream core
The pastel part screamed gay
When she is wearing the colonial outfit, she reminded me of Winona Ryder playing as Abigail in the Salem Witch Trial movie with Daniel Day Lewis.
i love all the twice stuff going on- safiya’s a once!
I loveeeee the second outfit!!!!!
Safiya looked sooo good in all of the outfits!!!!!!!!
I love rogue+wolf, I got a tumbler in the same moon pattern as the shoes and I use it all the timeee
I actually like the third outfit a lot
the Starkid Trail to Oregon reference i love u
Ok this is not related but did you see how many messages and calls she has
Outfit 3 is like a 90s/00s Lolita
Unrelated. But your house in the living room area looks like jenna and Julien's house
Saf- If anyone in the comments ever says anything bad about you please let me know and I’ll send them gorilla poop, for real.
You look amazing with the pink hair!!!
awe she looks so good w pink hair!! tbh i wasnt expecting it to look so good since she hardly ever wears colors like that but it surprised mee
Dude this is a long ash video
I black outfit was cute and I liked everything but the jeans on the pink outfit and I'm trying to forget the first outfit.
Omg your on treding
Safiya: today’s sponsor is HONEY Pooh: Screw hundred acre wood, where can I find this?
I would love to see some of your black bat like clothes with the wig. I think the wig looks really good
i went to buy those boots and they're not even on the site anymore! T.T
she looks like ella enchanted w the bonnet off
Hammer and scorecard
Hi Safiya! The "e-girl" top is actually made by the brand Omighty, you can actually see in the design that it says omighty on the little shopping bags. I'm assuming the instagram seller buys their fake merchandise off aliexpress for really cheap prices and then resells them on their instagram shop, which would explain why it took so long to get to you.
The effort it must take to make these videos is amazing. I'm so impressed Safiya and Tyler.
is anyone going to talk about the 111 missed calls and 130 something text?
Safiya: Tyler has dysentery.. Tyler: noooooo
The amount of twice in safiyas explore is why we stan.
that pink look TOTALLY WORKS!! the kinda mismatch-y but still cohesive look is a style I'm in love with 😍
The Colonial outfit needed the Weird Al Yankovic “Amish Paradise” song Hahahaha
So Instagram thinks 'First comes love, then comes marriage, then comes a baby in a baby carriage'.
I know your production takes forever to make and you guys put so much effort in these videos. I just wish I could have one every day🥺I love you guys 🤟🏽
would like to draw attention to how beautiful saf looks in the unboxing portion of the video
You know what, I always find your videos and your voice *mostly* soothingly good. Thanks Saf, for uploading another video! Love you to bits ❤️
I think the flaps on the skirt were meant to be tucked into those metal rings.... Kind of like a belt. Then they wouldn't be dangling and half the rings would be covered so you wouldn't have a nipple pasty look.
Is everyone gonna ignore that Mark Zuckerberg made FB not Insta? Not trying to shade or cause drama. Just genuinely confused.
The way you pronounce "Oregon" is the main reason Oregonians hate Californians 😅
MIDDLE PART LOOKS GREAT ON YOU
My family does rendezvous, dressing very similar to your first outfit. We wear two skirts, one pinned up a little.  Solid on the bottom, the pattern on top. Then a matching vest to the bottom skirt. So for yours, brown, then floral, and your belt. The rendezvous is fun, dressing, and living like we're from the late 1700s, early 1800s. Seems like something you would enjoy doing
Hi everyone! I hope y'all are having a blessed day! 😁 If you are reading this, it's not by accident! God wants you to see this! ^^ Hosanna to the Lord! He is SO AMAZING!!!! ❤️😄❤️ There is only ONE God, the TRUE God, he is the maker of heaven and earth. And he made us in his image and likeness, male and female, with dignity, value, worth, and purpose! ❤️ He made us to worship him. But we chose to sin against him, to rebel against him, and to disobey him. So, as a result, we are separated from God and live under the foolish myth that to some degree, we are each our own God, declaring right and wrong, living our own life, by our own rules, and standards. And guess what! That God ♥️LOVINGLY♥️ came into human history as the man ♥️Jesus Christ fully God and fully man!♥️ He was born of a virgin and he lived a life without sin, though he was tempted in every way as we are. And he WENT to the CROSS and there he SUBSTITUTED HIMSELF for sinners. When Jesus went to the cross, he took WILLINGLY upon him the SIN of those who would come to trust him! ♥️ That means me, as a sinner, Jesus WENT to the cross and took upon himself ALL my sin, past, present, and future! 😭❤️ And Jesus Christ God who was a man, DIED IN MY PLACE, FOR MY SINS, PAYING MY DEBT TO GOD, AND PURCHASING MY SALVATION!!!♥️♥️♥️ Jesus' dead body was then laid in the tomb, and for 3 days, he was buried. On the third day, a Sunday, (which is why we worship on that day) Jesus ROSE in VICTORY over satan, sin, death, demons, and hell. And he COMMISSIONED us with the HOLY SPIRIT, to be MISSIONARIES telling this ♥️AMAZINGLY GOOD NEWS♥️ that there's a ♥️God♥️ and PASSIONATELY, LOVINGLY, CONTINUALLY, RELENTLESSLY pursues us and he ASCENDED into heaven. And today, Jesus is ALIVE and WELL and he's seated on a throne, and he is ruling and reigning over ALL nations, ALL cultures, ALL philosophies, ALL races, ALL periods of time. And he is KING OF KINGS and he is LORD OF LORDS and he is RULING and REIGNING over ALL people, commanding EVERYONE EVERYWHERE to REPENT of EVERYTHING and he is COMING AGAIN to JUDGE THE LIVING AND THE DEAD, and those who trust in him, will enjoy ETERNITY and his KINGDOM of heaven FOREVER, and those who do not will SUFFER APART from him in the CONSCIOUS ENTERAL TORMENTS of HELL. That is what we believe, we believe is JESUS!!!♥️♥️♥️♥️🙌♥️♥️♥️♥️ God bless you! 😄

Ok, at 10:12 Safiya talks about how it would be high tech for Instagram to have scanned the clothing she's wearing and then have Instagram show her similar clothes...But I have posted things on instagram and didn't tag any geolocations or use hashtags...specifically when I'm in a bikini, and IMMEDIATELY i get spambots from clothing and bikini companies commenting on the photo to either collab or stop on their page. I had one post that had nearly 10-15 comments, and i'm just a regular person who doesn't normally get that much lol So this makes me believe that they ARE indeed scanning your posts and AI is figuring out what is in your photo!!!
I love how supportive Tyler always is. What a great partner.
I know you'll probably never see this but you should always wash wigs before wearing it because there's a lot of weird chemicals and dirt stuff in it
" Lele pons videos" I'm ded
I used to work in Colonial Williamsburg! I had to stop when I got a more theatre jobs but I was a sound engineer in the historical part for five years there and I know almost all the people in the CW video you used 😊 this just made me so happy!!! 🥰 and yes...VA is nothing but historical reenactors
Help, I wanna buy the necklace for my friend but I couldn't find it at the store she showed... does anyone have any clues where I might find it? Thanks!
She looked absolutely stunning in the second one 😍
I started calling the gothic one "Thotty goth". I literally would wear all of that but my 3rd outfit would be pastels with a slight 80s workout vibe. My darker clothes are slightly 50seque and kind of pinup gothic.
I love the amount of Twice on her explore page, the Once in her really jumped out lol
Why is this video so late also that witch laughing sounded like some spooky Halloween decorations like Halloween was coming at that you were making this video
do yall live near jenna and julien?? this video background looks like theirs
OMFG I didn't truly realise just how much I'd missed your videos...
This is my favourite kind of video!
20:55 missed opportunity to have said "churnin dairy"
Today is the gift that keeps on giving
IT ALL LOOKS SO GOOD! The witch outfit was my favorite
You guys pronounce "Oregon" like you don't live in a state that borders Oregon.
Did you end up getting the maleficent fancy ears? Those were cool 😁
I appreciate the morticia vibes 🥰
#1 LOVE the shoes   #2 You can tuck the suspender flaps under the rings. #3 I really like the shirt!!!
I really love that she doesn't care about an upload schedule. She only cares about making her content good. Thank you Saf for focusing on quality rather than quantity. Love you and your videos ❤️
Has Safiya never done a TikTok styles video?
Your kitchen/dining room/living room reminds me of Jenna's house and now I'm sad
Is it just me or does Safiya's living room look a lot like jenna & juliens?
As someone who's into the more goth egirl fashion... I'd say your idea of egirl is egirl? It's a subcategories of alt so I believe that it can vary! So you go (e) girl
I want those shoooeessss!!!! 😍😍
i need a “becoming a cosplayer” video STAT
I'm so sad, really loved those shoes from Rogue + Wolf but they seem to sold out.  Loved that whole witch outfit!
Can you loosen the skirteralls? I cant tell if it is like a fake belt or not but that would make it so the rings are below your bust line
A video filmed in January....wow. Did you forget about it?
does every house in LA look the same, or do you live with jenna marbles now?
I think for the gothic skirt your supposed to put the flaps in the loop and tuck them into the skirt. I may be wrong though.
1:27 Wtf? That’s literally so random😅
the long hair looks beautiful on you like morticia addams
I just noticed this but the layout of their house is so similar to Jenna and Julien's
kintsugi video coming up  37:57
The second one looked so good on you and the mask put it all together too
❤❤
The last outfit looks SO GOOD on you!! Love this video and you so much xoxo
The witch outfit was so pretty on her. Some space buns would have made the look
18:16 I thought we were chilling in Jenna Marbles living room for a second🤣
Honestly the last look would've been my favorite without the wig
I love the punk witch look, especially the shoes!
YOUR BACK OMG YAY IM SO HAPPYYYYY
The pink hair tho.. looks so good on u Saf!!! Digging it!!! ❤️❤️❤️
the soft girl outfit with the egirl hair for me
The pink jacket is beautiful!
31:02 I think the jacket and pants dont go together, and that's why. I think everything else would go together in some sort of way.
Did anyone else notice when we was in her living room it looks exactly like Jenna's lol
Me, who spends all day with mennonites: hm. That first outfit is....familiar.
i say this with the utmost respect....Saf, your posterior is finely shaped
The witch and pink galaxy girl outfits were my favorite. It was weird to see you in another color other than black.
congratz fo #3 on trending!
I work at Colonial Williamsburg! I would 1000% take you on a tour. I am going to show your video to my supervisors!
Middle part safiya is elite ✨
The wig is a lace front so it's more different than a normal wig he did a great job doing the wig
Are you going to change your last name?
ugh queen ☺️
the wig is  really cool though
I would definitely keep the skirt if the suspenders were a different material
And just like that, I confirm yet again that I like girls. I may or may not  have a crush on Saf.
OMG TOTALLY SPIES AND POLLY POCKET  Third one gave me Doja cat vibes & all the masks totally upped the outfit
I follow both not your average babe & sourpuss 😂
I actually really dig that not e-girl e-girl look on you, Safiya! I'd call it a "soft girl" look :)
I am so excited to see your content every time.
ok saf's new video counter set up looks SO much like jenna and julien's!
ik she always looks like a baddie but safiya looked like SUCH a baddie in that black witchy look
safiya spending money on instagram shop ads the way i always dreamed of but don't (yet!) possess the income to do. i still express my impulsive/compulsive shopping habit, just at.... a bit of a discount! lmao XD i try to get secondhand and indie brand things as much as possible tho but still like..... those outfits? goals. also, the wig looked PRETTYYY good but i feel like it needed something..... like a wash. and a dry. and a trim. XD other than that, it was PROPERLY on Safiya's head and the makeup plus wig gave me srs MARINA/Mars Argo style vibes. i personally think the 90's/y2k+pastel galaxy+neon angelic anime princess combo coord idea was ppppp neat imo. XD i agree that it is... a Monet, but I enjoyed it xD it's what i one day hope to accomplish in lolita fashion w/ combining styles once i'm a bit more experienced. ^^'
I’ve saved easily 50£ with Honey I can’t recommend enoughhhhhh
Omg Saf u look amazing in the witch outfit!
What you think is “E-girl” would be considered “soft girl”
omg does anyone know where she got her floral mask from the colonial williamsburg outfit!!!?? so cute
Mia maples did a video with the instagram shop six month ago. You should watch her video if you like Safiya.
damn didn’t even realize this was almost 40 minutes!
All three are pretty cool. I would totally buy the second outfit, all of it, and the powerpuff shirt and jacket.
I feel like with the first outfit, a flower crown would be so cute!
I like the pink wig! That's so fun, you should use it in another video!
I love safiya's hair length rn
YASMINNNN Yes ace activist!!
My name is Blair. I feel so honored she got a Blair wig
NUMBER 1 ONE TRENDING CONGRATS!
Your eyebrows look AMAZING IN THE PINK WIG?????
Is it just meeeee or does their house look very similar to Jenna and julens house ????? That living room tho
am i the only one who is obsessed with the pink wig on saf? tyler did such a good job
Missed you a lot Saf
Congrats ur #2nd on trending!
My best friend works for the Williamsburg Library system. He may have some connections at Colonial Williamsburg. I might be able to help.
Tries to be colonial, ends up Presbyterian.
Nooo I love how the second outfit looked, especially the overalls because I didn't think of the nipple framing until she mentioned it lol
0:36 we see you gg stan
you should to a house tour
0:41 like a bulldozer like a tank like a soldier
Safiya is a Once confirmed, all I saw were Twice pictures/fancams lol
The floral mask is so cute!!
This is Safiya’s new intro song....so much happy time feelings in my adult areas that I can’t even explicate in a real am I not homosexual but still love this person and her raven gothic batwing aesthetic ways?
We saw the twice fancam on your Explore page saf 😉❤️
“this girl os either a witch or a civil war reenactor” LMFAOOO
Is it just me or does safiya and tylers house look like jenna and juliens?
"Is this E-girl?" *The sound of Tyler audibly sighing*  😂
I really love the wig I think it looks amazing on u, u should do more wig videos cuz you could pull off so many
“Gothic Fanny pack.” Now that is style 😂
Are you opening your haul at Jenna and Julien's house? Where is Cermet?
OMG I VOLUNTEER AT COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG I CAN CONNECT YOU SAF (at colonial Williamsburg!!) i lived in one of the houses for a year and worked in one of the shops!! I volunteer with one of the curators and could possibly connect you with some of the workers and interpreters. I’m not sure they actually churn butter though but we could get you doing some interpreting!
where is the embroidered flower mask from? i want one😍
You’re actually not wrong to call those outfits an E-girl look, it actually falls under branch of E-girl fashion called Barbie E-girl, they primarily wear lots of pink, it’s not very common and is actually kind of hard to find examples of, but it’s is very much a thing, and are correct to call it that
I feel like if you swapped the jeans with the skirt, tights, and moon shoes, it would have gone more with the e-girl look!
The second outfit was 1000000% my favorite!
We love to see the Twice on ur explore page
Safiyas phone background 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Is it just me or does her house look almost exactly like Jenna and Juliens??? 😂
where do u get your flower embroidery mask???
I want that video of the mugs 😂
Blackpink and twice on her fyp! 👏
I think she really love twice 💕🥺
Her home looks just like Jenna Marble's place :0
I used honey before the ads cause I found it randomly as an extension in chrome and it's saved me like 80 bucks for far
Bumbed I didn't get the notification 😞
Diet Goth. Yes. I’m feeling it.
just letting you know!!! the power puff girls tank top comes originally from the shop Omighty!
Love your videos Saf!! Always make me smile and have a fun laugh❤️ the second outfit remind me of Marceline and third was Princess Bubblegum 🖤💖
20:59 Get churnt
Love the outfits!......wait.......did ya'll move?
Can you try tiny face makeup challenge
If you see a book with like the same name/design as the shirt of the witchy outfit, please don't read or buy it, it is extremely sexist and transphobic
I would love to see something like this but with ethical fashion brands or thrifted stuff! The clothing industry is one of the biggest contributors to pollution and slave labor, so I'm always interested to find brands that produce clothes that are both ethically sourced/made and still fashionable (not just basics).
okay but why does the goth look get way better with the mask??? has covid fundamentally changed my taste or did it actually look better???
You look like a tik tok star with that last outfit! Also the witchy outfit was so bad ass 😍❤
6 trending
Ughhh Safiya looks so good in this video! Huge Morticia Addams vibes from the opening look
The prairie belt was upside down, but Saf still rocked it.  😁
The "E-girl" make up is so cuteeeee
I clicked so fast 🖤
Me: *pausing the video every 3 seconds to bookmark all the sweet gothic clothing shops*
AS A WILLIAMSBURG RESIDENT AND A DAUGHTER OF A FORMER COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG EMPLOYEE I WILL HAPPILY PULL YOU SO STRINGS :)))
the pink wig looks SO good on you
THOSE JEANS ARE SO FLATTERING
27:17 I think that you should put the end of the straps inside of the rings so the straps don't mess what it could be a clean outfit.💙
Missed you Saf! ❤️❤️
CHAEYOUNG AND NAYEON!?!?
as someone who has lived there.you pronounce Oregon like "organ"
I’m never mad when I see a honey add lollllll tht little dancing coin is so cute 🥺
LMAO NOT THE VIDEO OF CHAEYOUNG IN THE FEED
Me seeing omg her house is so clean I could never lol
The Selena horror movie is not good
I don't want the iPhone, Safiya.
“Tyler has IBS” 😂
The second outfit is my fave. I also wear a lot of black, so it makes sense that i love that look the most.
BYE THE TWICE PERFORMANCE OMGREAOIHJEAHMAONE WE STAN
Damn the amount of kpop on her ig feed 👀
Tuck the straps onto the rings. They won't flap around and will cover up the holes
I really like the pink hair. Its cute🙊
I know it's not Saf at all but I'm into the last outfit... That hair looks so good!
Saf really rocking the jenna marbles setup when unboxing
Love the video!!! 😁❤️
The third outfit gave me BTS Boy With Luv vibes😄
On the third look Safiya looks like the love child of Doja Cat and Halsey and IM HERE FOR IT AND I LOVE IT 💕
With the goth look and mask on Safiya legit looks like a teenager lol.
I think the reason why the quality of the powerpuff top was kinda off, is because it might be a replica of a o-mighty top called the PPG Omighty Cami
Saf I love you:  :)
The Leather straps should be lower or you should tuck the straps inside of the ring
Ok, Safiya, you look amazing!
💜💜💜💜💜
MEMES of production sjfbakdbakfbjsj
Ooo a video making outfits from all different small businesses would be so fun!!!
YOU LOOK SO GOOD IN ALL OF THESE!!😍🔥
Love the looks! You look like lady gaga in the pastel
Colonia WIlliamsburg is hell pls don't waste your money. It's hot, humid, full of bees. So many bees.
hey remember when we didnt have reels
Colonial Williamsburg meet and greet!!! Omg
I want those moon shoes!!!
We Stan TWICE
SAFIYA IS A ONCE
I really love the second outfit! Also, watching this at 2:30am xD
Anyone else absolutely loving the second outfit! I think you look gorgeous 💕
how is she soooooo beautiful omg
If you want to take odd screen print “WItCH” I saw that you can remove it with alcohol like rubbing alcohol.!
I LOVE THE WITCH OUTFIT SO MUCH OMG IT LOOKS SO GOOD 🤩🤩🤩
tyler did amazing !!!!
I give Tyler all the credit! I actually really like the pink wig
Oh my. You said Oregon wrong.
Number 3 on trending       😳
I keep thinking they're in jenna and juliens house and it hurts my heart thinking about it 🥺🥺
This is my favorite intro!!!! Great video
"you're gonna have some pink-ass hair" "You're gonna have some pink ass hair"  This is why punctuation matters. 🤣
What a perfect thing to come back from my trip to. Excellent video as always!
You’re new living room and kitchen look identical to Jenna Marbles living room and kitchen
Trending High! Congrats! Love seeing you guys again.
I was laughing so hard about Safiyas jokes in the first outfit. she felt so comfy in this kind of weird look. Even if I´m more on the dark side of life and looks, I loved this pink hearted jacket...so so cute
Got damn I miss jersey shore
You should do a week were you dress like you’re living through the Spanish flu pandemic lol
I love the second and third outfits!!
The "colonnial" skirt is kinda cute. You could trift flip it!
Loved the outfits and definitely need  the moon shoes in my life...... but....... I kind of wanna see a franken-mug now 😂😂🌜⭐
Great now I have bought 100 things from the tab and I was evioding it before
So this is what I watch after a lesbian thing to make me happy again so I’m not sad that I’m a single and then get sad again tomorrow
not gunna lie i did not expect to see my picture from the la femme en noir page featured in this video HELLO ME
i’m uncomfortable abt how they said oregon
25:46 wow the mask just made that outfit POP!
COLORED HAIR LOOKS SO GOOD ON YOU!!!
Wrap the laces around your ankles a couple times. I do that with some of my high top laces.
Would love to see Saf do a video on different alternative/“goth” subcultures! I feel like she would really like doing the research and picking out the differences between each different subculture
If you take the big loops and fold them over then tie them again it will shorten them a bit better!
Girl! You looked awesome in the goth outfit!!
Pink outfit looks like the lazy town girl grown up
Bruh, Saf look so good in the last outfit, especially with the mask and the wig together, I think the jacket made it too pink, but when she was in shots with no jacket but had the mask on, it was perfect, maybe that's just me though
Mennonite/Amish
safiya did a middle part and grew her hair out and my life has never been the same.
id love to see you do a video about different styles/aesthetics and trying some of them!!
I have a feeling that the metal rings on the black "skirt-erall" are there to pass the leather straps through, securing them in place and avoiding any "nipple tasslation".
I wish my family worked on the reenactment side of Colonial Williamsburg, but we work on the retail/gift shop side of things 😂 I was just there this afternoon to hang out with family, I hope you come by soon for a visit and video, I would love to spot you!!  xoxo
I had to do a triple take cause I was sure for a second that you were in Jenna & Julien’s house & my heart stopped.
I feel like the third outfit is actually better without the jacket. You have really nice shoulders and also I think the wig and jacket are too much pink together idk.
Wait did u guys know Safiya went to Stanford 👀👀👀 I didnt expect that, that's great tho good for u girl
I always wait for your New video, I just like the way you talk :)
You look GREAT with pink hair!

Her egirl makeup is so nice wow
I think you look the best in the second outfit. It suits you and I kinda *really* want it for myself. Lol.
o those teen powerpuff girls were in an actual cannon episode
I want that frankenmug video.
a) Tuck the flapping tabs on the straps of the skirt from the second outfit into the rings. b) That skirt would look cute with the shirt from the first outfit.
I really hope that you practice witchcraft, If not then your pushing the narrative that witches are just fake and are just an aesthetic (which we’re not)
She looks sooooo good in the second outfit    An actual goddess
ahHAHA twice on your explore page i love to see it
That last look is very 1980s Definitely something you can see in a towney episode from early sailor moon
0
Someone please tell me they are in Jenna and Julien's house I feel crazy
It's kind of sad people were catcalling... what if that was what you were actually comfortable wearing? Have they never seen the Amish before?!
Your hair is getting sooo gorgeously long <3
"Mark Zuckerberg is trying to kill me." - Safiya 2020
Yooo she watches Kpop fan cams and twice 😭I love her
I thought it said this video was from 10 years ago
I think you're supposed to wear both skirts and everything else all at once?
Something else for you. If you die today will you go to heaven? Have you ever lied, stolen, used God's name as a curse word (O-M-G)? According to God's law, you're guilty, your headed for hell, ignorance will not be an excuse... But wait, God loves you, he made a way out for you, God's son Jesus died paying for your sin.  God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16   God is warning the world. End Time prophesies are jumping off the pages of the Bible, plagues, violence, scoffers, government control, earthquakes, fires, floods, people will be lovers of themselves, money, lovers of pleasure rather than God, evil will be called good and good called evil, sexual immorality rampant adultery, fornication, abuse... the ultimate in child abuse mommies killing their babies in child sacrifice (abortion), World leaders are prepping for a One-World order, government, religion (please don’t take a number on your forehead or right hand, read Revelation a number means no heaven, and there's only one alternative) The government is also prepping to have you believe that UFO's are real... Soon the antichrist will come and fix everything, everyone will love him, he will deceive many... then the tribulation will start, life on earth will be horrific. Today if you hear God whispering to your heart please respond before it's too late. Say a humble prayer, pour your heart out to God, he loves you, open your heart take a chance receive Jesus as your savior.
I really like the pink heart crop jacket.  I'd love to see it with Saf's actual hair and over one of HER typical outfits that she'd put together.  Also, I appreciate these videos so much!  I know there is so much work to them that we don't see.  Love you guys!
I stan Sammi sweetheart !!!! Tyler how dare you!
I spent the whole video thinking about the fact that you guys have the same house as Jenna and Julien.
omg YAAAASSS QUEEN INSTAWITCH WERK
It's kind of VSCO girl mixed with E-girl
https://youtu.be/s022tx9lMUU
I love the First and Middle look.... obviously but for the e girl pink wig. I think some like black hair clips would have been nice to sell the illusion little bit more and since the jacket had black stars on it....Black Star Clips??? Maybe...
without the bonnet you look like an epic 1800's warrior princess.
The first outfit is giving me Anne with an E vibes, I love it !!!
From Rogue and wolf I’m ordering two iPhone cases they’re pretty cool from Etsy
Nobody:     Not even Illinois:   Tyler and Safiya: Ore-GONE
Dam, now I got to get Instagram! ;P
She-- She-- She said-- THE "M" WORD    AHHHHHHHH!
Shhhh can't believe you said Lele Pons name outloud! Turn around, touch the ground. Break the curse!! BREAK THE CURSE, SAF!!
Lol her saying like the “indie” styles she says E girl lmao
That dark outfit really brought our your itty bitty waist So Cute
I NEEEEEEED those moon and star boots!!
Honey totally reads your data!!!
Honestly, you look amazing with long pink hair. I did not expect that.
16:47  That would make a gay slur and British slang. Oof but you don't know to heh.
i kind of love safiya with pink hair???
Why is this video not monetized? :(
Finally new video ❤️
The pink hair looks great on her!
IM HERE FOR SAFIYA'S OUT OF CONTROL SHOPPING VIDEOS, TODAY REALLY IS A GOOD DAY
Hey hey saf
You look like lady Gaga in the last pink fit
I usually love watching you pick out the things, but I personally think it took a bit too long this time with too much talk about which account you are following. It got a bit repetitive and I ended up skipping several minutes in the middle, to get to the actual unpacking. Please don't get me wrong. I don't say this to throw shade or put you down. I really love your channel and just wanted to give a bit of viewer feedback. I really enjoyed the rest of the video :)
i love the pink hair on her
Did you move??
Those jeans in outfit 3 highlight the worst of that style. They are mom jeans to the max and aren't flattering at all.
*smells flower with mask*
the fact that her insta feed is just filled with gg and twice videos makes me love her even more akjsjdjdjjssjjsj    STAN TWICE STREAM I CANT STOP ME
Pretty sure the shoes are out of stock, I’m so sad 😭
The way they said Oregon though 😅
THE SECOND OUTFIT LOOKS SO GOOD ON YOU!
Congrats on trending!
Safiya is literally my favorite human 💕
k popping off
"THEY dO THEY REALLY dO!!!!" Lmao
Safiya looks so pretty 🥺💕 And the shirt she was wearing during the un packaging clips is EVERYTHING
OMG I'm in love with the pink outfit 😍 I would rock that outfit with NO regrets!!! Btw Safiya you are BEAUTIFUL!!
The only thing i can say is .... yes, yes You are the Queen
TWICE❤️
Is no one gonna talk about how she has twice
Lmao we got some grenades over here hahahaha
That black/witch outfit was awesome!
okay but you totally rock the pink wig! 😍
I love the goth outift
Awesome
Everyone do be mentioning that their house looks like Jenna and Julian's house doe. WE GET IT.  thank you
oh I love the insta witch outfit on you! The first one gave me Little women vibes without the hair cap
I love the pink wig 🥰🥰 and the black outfit
The wig looks great with the Galaxy mask, suits u well ❤
You should do a “I only wore clothes from small businesses for a week” I feel like it would me really entertaining and it would help small businesses
oh so were onces now...
Ok but the pink hair is 🔥
yes you are a kid
Maybe you tie the laces around the top of your boots like skates? 🤔
I think pink hair would look good on you, if the color matched your skin tone just a little bit better. 💜
Why is no one talking about how she said K-pop fancams and how there every where
The house looks so much like Jenna and Juliens house, it's really throwing me off, I keep wondering why Safiya is in front of the wrong background 😂
🦇🦇🦇 I say pink wig, butter churned top, skiterall and moon boots.
we have pironeer village in canada, and when my class took us when i was a kid this ONE GIRL, spin thread that WASNT THERE. for the entire time. so my one desire is to spin invisible thread. i never got to. she was like "no look i'm almost finished" and its like BITCH NOTHINGS THERE
That goth one really giving off the craft vibes
Well interesting fact about how creepy Instagram and Facebook can be - I had made a facebook acount just to mostly see birthday congradulations from my grandma and aunts so I decided to not poste any pictures of myself. A few months later facebook showd me a picture of me in an event that I participated in and asked me if I want to save this picture of myself...and no I was not mentioned by the event organizers in the post. I wasn't following the profile that posted the picture either. How did they know? It still scares me till this day.
You know what, ngl pink wig Saf reminds me of a kpop girlie like Seraphine in KDA
Damn. When you mentioned that Wish video from 3 yrs ago I noticed just how long I've been watching you
I feel like the witch outfit with the pink wig would be **chef’s kiss**
i feel like im the 50lb heavier version of you lol our styles and aesthetic are so similar!!!! love u and your videos <3
Would love to see you do a collaboration with American Duchess :)
Saf your hair is GLORIOUS!!! SO BEAUTIFUL❣️❣️
Does anyone else think that safiya’s new house looks the exact same to Jenna and juliens?
The wig looks very good with your skin tone, but you need to style her! Take some scissors and cut her like your regular hair girl! You already know your style, you just gotta nudge some things around a little...
I live in colonial Williamsburg! And work in town and know practically all the actors — if your serious I can tell you who to connect with and I’ll be your tour guide !
Quick. Someone get Bernadette Banner so we can get a Safia and Bernadette team up
I think the last outfit would be cute with a different jacket 💜
The jeans look like when I wear men’s work pants for work. Those are mena jeans for sure.
Ok,safiya's wallpaper is art
The girl definitely yelled your name. I think she was just excited to see you out and Tyler filming. I'd get excited too!
Sooooo... is that horror movie with Selena Gomez good or not?
The queen has posted!!!
Your place looks so much like Jenna and Juliens! I don’t wanna like dox either of you but I really like the idea for you being like neighbours in matching houses haha
Why does their house remind me of Jenna and Juliens
Memes of production is epic.
EVERY time i try using honey it tells me i already have the best price, doesnt matter where.
So happy to find this channel! I definitely want to try honey sounds amazing!😻❤️
He laid the wig well
:0000      once?    ;))))))  i saw you safiya .
I think the “egirl” look would’ve been ALOT better without the wig and just your normal hair
Yesss! Love the witchy goth look😀👍🏻
"You can control the ~ memes ~ of production!" Girl you found a good man.
For some reason when I first look at Sayfiya Nygaard I think of Wednesday from the Adams family
Love the bdz by twice hahahaha
Still, Safiya looks good with everything.
Your videos are the best
Honestly, I didn’t notice that tab until today.
Saf in the first outfit without the bonnet reminds me of Joan Baez a little bit. Which is awesome
Witchy outfit is fire! Love it!
The powerpuff girl top is a knock off from Omighty! It even says it on the bags on the shirt
I hate the Instagram update. I never click on the Reels or Shop pages so I do not need instant access to them.
Did anyone else hear Ben & Jen-logical saying "Minga London" in their head the whole time? Just me?
Thank you for the video - missed you - need you. 🖤🖤🖤
Control the memes of production 😂😂😂😂 Tyler I have to stan
Are you at Jenna marbles’ house???
I think the last look was a vsco girl look? Idk I'm out of touch
Im sure people have mentioned this, but you could probably put the loose ends on the goth outfit through the hoops to hide them (though the circles are still gonna be on the ladies) XD I wanted to see the witch outfit with the pink wig!!! I think thatd be super cute!
Weird thing to be pumped about I know but WebstersWigs are awesome I love them!!!
Safiya: I'm an e-girl. Also Safiya: This is not e-girl. Everyone else: This is e-girl.  Girls rocks EVERYTHING
Saw on your insta "american duchess" bernadette shoes.  like your style, I get all sorts of compression wear?  not sure why
I think the pastels/nostalgic imagery category was more leaning towards y2k fashion than egirls
YES SHE HAS TWICE ON HER EXPLORE PAGEEEEE
The mask with the first outfit is beautiful! Did I miss where it's from or can someone tell me?
The pink hair is life
You bring me joy, Safiya.  Thank you for existing
8:13 legit thought that was Kurtis conner
I am SUPER into the trendy goth look, especially on you. Those shoes are just too good.
As someone who lives in Williamsburg,please, do visit! Colonial Williamsburg is so pretty !
you looked so pretty with the e girl makeup!!! and the wig honestly looked bomb
Does anyone else love the last look and think it goes really well together or just me?
I KNOW they did not pronounce "oregon" as "oregone..." why they gotta do us dirty like that
The Virginians are living for the shout out lol
who else noticed that she likes her own posts 🤣🤣🤣
“They dooo, they really dooooooo”😂 I love you so much Saf
Safiya are u secretly a Once? Your explore page is full Of twice posts omg im so happy😂😂💗
Can we appreciate this is 3rd on trending 🥺
I hope you got those custom Disney ears, girl. And if so, was it $30 or $57?
Don’t mind me. Just scrolling through the comments disliking all negative comments even though I don’t know what disliking them does. But You deserve all the positivity you can get. Let’s bombard Safiya’s comment section with sunshine. 🌞
I lived 1 hour from Williamsburg but I moved to Ohio....its awesome tho :)
Safiya got so skinnyyy and more happy i love thatttt for herrr
I loved when you put on the wig. It was so different for you ! But it looked good !! Good video, il like that it's a 40 minutes long video !!
“She’s either a witch or a civil war re-enactor.” “Both.”  This had me rolling LOL
I feel like I’m going crazy but I think your in Jenna marbles house the entire time
Ok so safiya’s insta is also filled with kpop XD
I love how long this video is!!! For your next video, you should make your own wigs!!! Mrsroshposh on YouTube has a bunch of wig cutting/dyeing/sewing tutorials that would be so cool to see you try her tutorials!! Plus you could try new hair colors and styles :)
This was me after I got my stimulus check
Wait zuckerburg is in charge of Instagram too????
3:55 yo bernadattes shoes love her
The wig looks good
'killed her husband. Whacked him!' 😂😂
I suggest using thick white shoelaces for the moon shoes. Those shoelaces just got to me, lol
the O-REY-GONE trail.   my inner Oregonian can't. 😂
That black look is VERY flattering and beautiful on you!!!
The pants reminds me of Mom Pants >_<.
Hate speech
i’m pretty sure the 90s fashion revival girl is called a “VSCO girl” but i am also old so who knows
Wait that wig looks good on you!! You should try on different wigs! It’d be cool to see how you look with blonde hair
Ok me being from Virginia loving every time she fan girl’s Colonial Williamsburg.
I absolutely love the show Jersey Shore. I am so happy you kept on mentioned it.🤣😁
Safiya having a TWICE video in her feed means she's an intellectual
Haha that's my 'wet eye' editorial look 😅😂💦
I think the last one would've looked a bit more cohesive with a cardigan or shawl instead of the jacket and the pants switched out with a loose skirt or looser pant. Also, I think the upper body cloud of pink would'ved looked less like the jacket and wig were melding together if the wig was in an up or half up half down do. Or just removing the jacket or just leaving it off one shoulder would've been a massive improvement so that it doesn't keep hiding the top and necklace and keeps the wig from blending into it so much
I like the wig its really cute
Drop the skincare routine, sis
Your living room looks like Jenna Marbles' living room
I’m sorry but I can’t get over y’all’s pronunciation of Oregon 😂😂
You took that bonnet off and I went "WITCH"  Also I love that wig so much omg (looks lovely on you) and I'm not even a pink kinda person (jacket too)
ok but why is no one talking about how good safiya looks with the pink wig. It literally looks so good on her!
Frankenmug!!!!
I liked the last outfit! It gives me soft/vsco/e-girl vibes all in one <3  Loved all 3 outfits tho, especially #2!
Saf why do you have a newscaster voice in this🤷🏼‍♀️
I love Tyler's commentary
11:39  Can we all just talk about how iconic that pic of Tyler that Safiya has as her phone wallpaper is?
I hope you do more three outfit per time era video again. 1940s, 1930s, 1920s and 1910s would be next eras.
Me, a dental hygienist: If your breath smells then we need to get you to the dentist!
You're probably supposed to put the flappy stuff in the rings
That pink wig is SO cute
Safiya: I like being witchy Instagram: There's nothing wrong with being witchy. what century would you prefer?
The k-pop in Safiya’s recommended feed makes me very happy
We live in a society
I love the second one
Safiya looked so weird with that pink wig. Pink is nice on her but that wig took it to another level. Otherwise she looked good in the outfits.
Tyler did a pretty good job on the wig!
I wouldn’t say it’s e-girl but I would say it’s more soft e-girl
I think you’re supposed to tuck the suspender flaps into the rings
I appreciate the Shakespeare.
https://youtu.be/Qii0HaHZL0A
I have to check out those boots.  And the witch shirt.  Did I mention how on point they’d be for my January 70th b’day?  Love ya Safiya! 🖤
Your look in the beginning is stunning, those SLEEVES ❤️👏
😭 missed hearing "hello friends" so much!! Your content is always the best Safiya!
Is it wrong I only liked the vibe clothing with the peaceful peach vibe and the gothic bad chick vibe but not the cottage vibe T-T my friend keeps saying I'm goth because of it.
Tyler, you call your wife "dude," and that is adorable.
Isn't Saf's house the exact same model as Jenna Marbles???
I have the goth milk bag from killstar!
me; tries to find the boots from the second outfit the website; they dont exist me; insert surprized pikachu face
It's pretty easy for algorithms to sort images into categories. So I think Instagram is matching your looks
I wish the shop tab was that hard to find for me. It's replaced the notifications button on my home page and it's SUPER annoying.
They call pregnancies that happen after you turn 35 geriatric pregnancies just saying 😂😂
I have a video idea: what if you try to see a stylish outfit together. Like make it from scratch?
Lol loving the rosè fancam😎
Why is she like, literally in Jenna and Julien’s house 😂 it looks exactly the same
Instagram is now also beta testing a version of the app where the shop tab is on the bottom instead of notifications
suggestion-  should be shopping on your tiktok FYP!! & mostly from small businesses :)) but you’d have to have tiktok for a bit so it can actually create an accurate fyp for u 💖💖
I think it’s the jeans that ruin the pink look. They didn’t look good on the model, so I don’t think a different size would’ve helped.
IGTV HAS ITS OWN APP???????
omg safiya explore page got blackpink on it 😂😂 me too sis me too😫
I’d love to see a video where you use all these items in your normal outfits! You have so many themed videos that would make for awesome different outfits!
Am I the only one that loved the fake “E-Girl” situation?
I love the brand punk rave!!!!!!
Can anyone explain the hush app to me? Does it tend to be more about friends or like relationships?
I actually think every outfit suited you really good :) even the "not an egirl-egirl look" and also the pink hair colour
Stop saying Oregon like that. Kthnx love you bye
The wig was so cool, I kinda want it.
The second outfit was a LOOK
26:19
I miss one brand Full Face makeup reviews from Saf, they are always hilarious. And luckily Shein has a makeup line Sheglam now.  It would be so cool to see a video on it. No pressure, just suggestion.
ok !?
I actually work at Colonial Williamsburg; I’d love to figure something out with you!!
all of those outfits are really nice and we’re cohesive in my opinion! i loved all of them and you looked so good in all of them!!!💞
I need to see the 2nd outfit with the pink wig!
Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life" (Jn 3:16)
I Love the 2nd Outfit 😍😍😍🖤
Does anyone know if Honey works in the UK
WITCH! 🤣
I think the skirt-spenders would look better with the straps off the shoulder/ hanging down by the waist if she were to wear them again.
When you said diet goth all I could think about Abby from NCIS
I felt like taking off the bonnet actually gave me witch vibes. Like colonial witch vibes, lol. The witches hiding amongst the villagers who take off their bonnet in the woods.
Lately safiya looks more... Grown up? I think it's the new background...
Why does her house look so much like Julien and Jenna’s house?
.
You really need to make shorter vids and be more consistent in posting... Find help with your process because it's really not working
she kinda looks like yoko when she was wearing the colonial outfit with her hair down lol
YOURE  A TWICE STAN!?!?!?!?
umm most beautiful woman ever like i am speechless
The memes of production joke was top tier
Can I just say the wigs hairstyle on you is amazing ! And black !!! It would be gorgeous 😍
The Watch outfit IS SO GOOD (except for the flappy thingys)
I WANT A SAFIYA AND BERNADETTE BANNER COLLAB !!!
I love your videos, I’m always eager to have one to see...it’s like waiting for Christmas every month 😊
The first outfit with the bonnet just looks like a Mennonite lady. I see this exact outfit all the time
You're supposed to tuck the extra bit of strap on  the harness into the o ring, that's why its there
I was really hoping to see a collab with Safiya/Tyler and Jenna/Julien. Like, really wanted to see how good they meshed. Both groups so fun! Hopefully one day, even if it is just them meeting in a vlog or something :)
Can someone please please please tell me where Safiya's Cardigan from the intro is from? PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEASE
as a virginian i can confirm people only come here if they're really into history
I appreciate the Hocus Pocus reference 😂
that second outfit looks sooooo good on her😳🖤🕷🦇🦇
As a williamsburgian, we’d love to have you lol
Guys I- I think Saf and Jenna are neighbors...  Either that or they’re actually filming in jenna’s house
Her house reminds me of jenna marbles house
18:30 damn safiya you look amazing! Skin glowing, hair shining, looking happy! You go sis
Don't nobody dare hate on Tyler for the "memes of production" pun - because it was frigging awesome! 😂😂😂
too good
16:50 - 17:03 That's cheeky
I read the blog you wrote and can't understand the critics. You and Tyler (and Crusty I love that cat) are awesome, you put heart and soul and a ton of hard work into all your creations mixed with mischief, fun and messy perfection. I'm not on social media like "the Gram" and don't have a smart phone nor am I fashionable  I like seeing this anyway and after losing weight I'm trying new things (even though I'm homebound) 1st outfit I'd liked to have seen a corset instead of belt or a corset style belt. 2nd outfit, those shoes! I think if your long torso the buckles on a "skirt all" ? Might hit awkward mid boob area. I wanted shortalls but the top and buttons hit me the same awkward way. And I'm only 5' height. 3rd outfit was not a good fit but honestly the jacket would work for you if you wore it with a black swing dress and black boots.
Any other American Girl Doll people just have there hearts stop a little when they see youtubers say the word "American girl doll" or an American girl doll picture/name. Just me?
SKINSKINSKINSKINSKIN WOW safiya your skin looks absolutely flawless you look beautiful without makeup (and with but wow)
I cannot be the only one who noticed how absolutely stunning Safiya looks throughout this whole video
No video makes me laugh like a Safiya video
OOOOOOOOOO girl!!!! you looked SO good in the witch outfit!!!!!
AHHH the way they pronounce "Oregon" 😭... It's more like or-gun not or-eh-gon
hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh emjoy
I am going to miss the masks when it is finally over. It gives me some anonymity when I feel like being 'extra'.
I think the last fit dosen't look that great because of Safiyas eyebrows are black and it would look better if they were blonde or pink u know (u could had made them pink with eyeshadow)
12:50 - 12:58 You're a colonial re-enactor for the Salem Witch Trials
"My frash cream brings Ll the boys to the yard" I died XD
HER HOUSE LOOKS LIKE JENNA MARBLES WHAT
You should tie your laces around the ankle of the shoe to shorten them
first try on she reminds me of bella i think shes called
i cant be the only one who saw twice on safiya’s explorer page at 0:41 🥳✨
Is...is that Jenna Marble’s house?
I hate your videos
I need to get me a pair of those shoes now  Edit: I just went to their site and they no longer have them :'(
Your skin looks amazing!
egirls are goth edgy tik tokers
I love how the options in her Google search bar are so Safiya. Lol
Okay am I going crazy or does Safiyas house look so much like Jenna's? I'm drunk and I'm confused
The distant cackling
Those star shoes from Rogue+Wolf are amazing! Unfortunately, also not available anymore.
Tyler, sighing: “neverminnnnd” 😂
She looks very good with pink hair! She should so dye her hair!
Wait omg omg in the beginning of her video there is Twice AHHHHH
When they said ore-gone😂😂 I love it when people outside of oregon try to say it😂
Not sure if you moved but looks like you’re in Jenna marbles house or her neighbor lol
Saf.. That witch outfit was damn hot! Looking good girl.
the pink gives me such doja cat vibes lol
She looked so good in the pink hair. Also a suggestion the pink hair with the second outfit would be everything
‘Thot-icia’ 🤣
The third look reminded me of Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century
Why do I really want to see a Safiya and Laurenzside do a colab
Safiya has so much twice in her explore page HAHA
Second outfit suits u sooo much
31.90: i agree with tyler i think it looks better close up but tbh everything looks good on saf
Bless follow me
Noooo! Don't name the scottisch play!!!
You should paint glow in the dark paint on the stars and moons on the shoes!
Please do dressing like it’s the 18th century with help from Bernadette Banner or Abby Cox
THE INTRO OMGG I REMEMBER THAT VIDEO
Yay! Thank you!! ❤️
Anyone else pause to see what apps she had on her phone?
Better check those 138 unread texts! 😂
That first outfit makes it look like you know something the rest of us don’t. Like, “I handled consumption, COVID ain’t shit”
Saf, Tyler, I love the fireplace in your living room! Do you guys ever use it?
Really loving your evolution into a Morticia look a like! <3
WOAH YOUR HAIR IS SO LOMG SND PRETTYYYY
💜💜💜💜💜
The suede skirt outfit looked so flattering on her😍
Wish we could have seen outfit 3 without the wig!
Are we going to address Saf's homescreen background...
Can we talk about how the babies name @5:30 is Brynnleigh Fern ?? Lmao
It’s not or-gone, it’s ore-uh-gen 😭
i LOVE those "e-girl" jeans on you!! they hug your booty so well and they look really good on your legs to me! 💌 and the make up look from that one is so different from what you usually wear, but i think it fits your facial features so good, you look like a fairy!! 🧚🏼‍♂️🧚🏼‍♂️🤍
I wish there was a heart I love this video
I didn’t realize I was early bc I was going through and watching your videos, now I’m commenting late.
The Carole baskin joke killed me 😂😂😂😂
Pink fit is a y2k ( early 2000’s ) vibe
I live 20 min from colonial Williamsburg
RONNNN 😂
I’m pretty sure going by the tiny rose and frills in the crop top that it came from a multi pack of undershirts that I used to wear as a kid only it had a great print put on it 😂
The Pink fit is literally just how I dress and I think it looks cohesive and fine! And cute
THE THIRD OUTFIT i’m actually in love
💕 *That pink wig & jacket!!!!*💕 😍😍
THAT ISN'T HOW YOU PRONOUNCE OREGON. It's pronounced ore-eh-gun  Source: I was born and raised there
i looove the intro, please never change it!
Love these videos. I haven't had IG in so long now you telling me you can shop there and there is an IGTV app. WHAT!? ps.still not getting IG tho
Ok but you looked absolutely stunning in the second outfit! 🖤
One kpop video with ruin your recommended heheh <3
I don't know how it would work in a video but I need to see Safiya wear different wigs! She looks so different in light colour hair!!
#1 on trending bruh
I missed that intro
I love these videos <3 and you <333333
If you want a colonial historical site to shoot at, let me know! I work at one in MD. :)
Cherubim = plural of Cherub.
That jacket with the black skirt thing from the other outfit 🤔
im really loving the wig ugh amazing you look so pretty thanks tyler
I am not trying to be mean but can you not put cussing memes on your video because my dad doesn’t like it but I love your Channel
The pink wig is looking cute on you!
Those jeans need never bought but also...set on fire.
LOVE The pink hair!!!
Saf being a Once?? 🤔
10 MILLION FAKE BIDEN VOTES
Hello! As a resident of Oregon, this is a gentle reminder that the state is pronounced "Ore-gun" not "Ory-gone" :D
0:40 safiya being a twice stan
Election Fraud 2020  https://youtu.be/jZzSttpgAlM
I watched totally spies! I am so glad I am not the only one
Control the ~memes~ of production!!! So perfect
the wig literally omg wig
Soft girl not e girl lol just an fyi
Anyone have a guess at where her blouse is from that she's wearing while she unboxes? The black one with roses?! I need it so bad 😭😍
25:00 Do you have the link for that skirt??? I love it!
did they really take omightys print and reuse it?? on their shopping bags.. it looks like it :/ boo
Those star boots are absolutely adorable, I'd wear them so much XD
The brown belt didn’t go with the first look tbh but the witch look was FUCKING ICONIC
i checked my instagram shop thing and it is filled with toddler and mom clothing ... i'm 19 and single <//3
Am I crazy for thinking their house looks like Jenna and juliens?
It’s Or-y-gun
You should watch the Trail to Oregon! It’s a musical by team starkid on YouTube! I love your content so much!!!
WHY DID I THINK YOU WERE IN JENNAS HOUSE??? 😭
I can see that Safiya likes Twice 👀
Not e girl it’s soft girl vibe
I remember seeing an add for shopping on Instagram a while ago with Celine Dion that I bet people have probably sent to Saf a million times by now
Why did the first look Make e think of it’s a small world after all
19:57 if that is her natural motion, Tyler is packing some real heat!
I swear u look more and more like wednesday Adams
good
I have lost my job due to COVID and I need money for bills I know many are less fortunate but anything helps my cashapp is $Crossano96 thank you and god bless🙏🏾
I'm actually obsessed with that second look it looks so good on you?!?!
Just a little fun fact: Cherubim = plural cherub “im” in ancient Hebrew pluralizes words *The highest ranking angels are the seraphim and the second highest are the cherubim
Why their house look like Jenna marbles house
tyler giving up after saf wouldnt stop talking about sammi sweetheart had me so dead
Also maybe boycott killstar seeing as their owner is a crazy racisttt
I love that she still uses her fivr intro
I loveee that embroidered flower mask, whered you get it? Anyone know?
When you live in OR & you had to do that stupid game for school! Hahaha
Safiya check your messages
SAF IM DYING!!! You look SOOO good in the gotho outfit!
That goth outfit is amazing.
god safiya uploading a new video is the cherry on top of this wild week i needed. thanks saf <3
I want "It's a hay-penny a glass, baby!" on a shirt. Or at least a sticker. That gave me such a laugh.
The moment you were wearing witch outfit with black mask it reminded me of Japan streetwear
Lol “diet goth, comfortable vampire ” I died hahaha I can relate 😹👍🏼
okay but hold on a sec, why does saf with long hair look like Morticia Addams? I’m honestly loving it
That witchy look complimented you oh so well make you look young and beautiful
My looks like yours wow
I was a seamstress at Colonial Williamsburg until about a year ago; I could've hooked you up! I could still probably get you in contact with some people there, provided they're actually open and doing stuff....   Either way, you're awesome :3
memes of production joke was soo good
Even tho I don't like pink as much I think the pink look i liked the most but the shirt with witch and the moon shoes were also cute 😸
You looked like you were having fun and that's what I'm here for.
I can't believe u didn't use the colonial outfit as an excuse to insert Weird Al's Amish Paradise..... What a missed oppurtunity....
i see the kpop safiya heheh
Tzuyu 😳🤟🏻❤️
hi
You need to post more please
Outfit 2, is everything!!
I assume they moved and it looks like Jenna and Julians houseat minute 28
the second outfit looked so goodddd
14:21 Okay, I actually REALLY want the pink dress at this timestamp. But apparently PepperMayo doesn't sell it anymore since this vid was recorded months ago. Anyone know where I can find something similar?
oh look at that mailer, poseur is 1000% a dropshipper
Tyler’s “memes of production” quip was severely underrated
I am from Virginia. Colonial Williamsburg is my jam.
I am so glad that you don't know what e-girls are. That means we are aging similarly and I don't feel like I'm falling behind on what's trendy. YAY I feel relevant!
Loooove the goth look! The skirt is so cute! And i think that if you tuck the loose straps inside the ring it won't be so nipple-forward. ;)
✨ byootiful ✨
You saying Ming Gah london.... me being Scottish wondering if it's supposed to be like Minger....
That top took so long to arrive because it was likely dropshipped. The exact same one is on places like aliexpress for around $4, so they likely shipped it directly from the website. It took so long because it’s coming from China.
Locket LOVE the pink... anyone else lmao
She looked so good in all of the outfits but that second one was so her and so cute !!
Does anyone know the specific song that was playing at 7:16? I have been trying to find it for ages!
I low key now want a vintagey skirt from gatheringofgoods. 😜
Well, if I was a sponsor, I would sponsor you. You sound so convincing, I feel like I'll buy anything you promote XD
I just want a Safiya and Karolina Zebrowska collab so bad
ok but are we getting that mug video after this?
I LOVE the pink look. The hair really suits you!
Her second outfit was everything even with the “tassels” 🤣
OMG it's Morticia Adams
Have you tried shopping at dresslily? Idk how relevant it is but I see a lot of ads and would kinda like to see a review of it 😅
Your hair is giving me strong Morticia Addams vibes and I am living for it.
Pleaseeeeee make more videos!! Love you 😘😘
Okay anybody else notice how similar Saf's house is to Jenna Marbles'?? I swear it's the exact same layout lol
Yay powderpuff girls!
roses are red violets are blue "8 out of 10 would by again"
Bro Safiya’s a once. I’m quaking
Tyler's humor is underrated and glorious
You should do this but with makeup or skincare items
@0:35 LSKKFKF the chaeyoung bdz fancam
the only thing showing up in my shop tab is brands i already follow :(
Two minute silence for all wonderful t-shirts/tops that were ruined by stupid slogans
Love it. Or-a-gen not Ore-a-gone.❤
Also, Instagram uses Facebook's pixels to track your online activity and shopping even off the platform, so there are soooooo many reasons things might be recommended to you. And the Honey plugin too, honestly.
The wedding to baby jump also happened to my Instagram after I got married.
How they say Oregon 😬😬
MINGA is a British word for someone ugly. It sounds so funny hearing others say it😆🤣
that wig is truly a vibe 💕
Check out my first ever song on my channel!
*LORD JESUS DIED & ROSE AGAIN TO FREE U FROM SIN ACCEPT HIS GIFT* ✝️✝️✝️
Ahh that's me in the green dress @ 7:27 !!
Omg save the pink wig so you and Tyler can be shark boy and lava girl next Halloween!!
I think the pink hair should be short to make it work
I love ur videos tht are about clothes like They are cool and a lot of these clothes i didnt think exited in this day of age lol
Love the pink wig on you!
The memes os production kkkkkkkkkk
She looks more and more like Morticia😍😍😹🖤🖤🖤
I’m very much getting “pierced nipple” vibes from the suspender skirt
Instagram really said “Salem witch trials”
The pink wig looks amazing
Who else saw their living room and could only see Jenna and Julians house
I need to know where that embroidered flower mask came from, it's so cute!
get saved in christ right now before it's to late. just pray that you believe he died for your sins and that he is your Lord and savior then tell him to enter your life. when you say this that dead spirit in you comes alive, your born again, soul is saved from hell, name written in the book of life. after that get to know god. repent and trust in God. serve god, you will be rewarded.
I want those celestial shoes but she didn't put the link in the description😫
The ~memes~ of production was a wonderful pun
I am so sad i can't find that heart jumper that was on the syndromestore picture
Can we just talk about her Lock Screen for a moment
A <3 for the Marxist joke at the end.
i'll be sitting here waiting for that gluing mugs back together video
#1 on trending
That wish video was from three years ago ??!!!        Damn
Omg, 118 missed calls. I guess this is what success looks like!
When her house looks like jennas-
I was today years old when I found out Saf and Tyler can’t pronounce “Oregon” and it’s cracking me up.
For Safiya I watch the ads
0:39 Safiya is a Once? 👀
You look so good in anything you wear, safiya! I was pleasantly surprised at how much I loved you in the pink wig!
That gothic outfit, plus the mask, is a great look for you. Imagine if you also put your hair in space buns with some long ribbons!!
The pink jacket is so cute!
you look so beautiful ✨
MoonDust Boots...sold out. THANKS A LOT FELLOW FIENDS!!! :(
I don't know why it bothered me that they made it "Shopmegoosta" and spelled gusta with double O's. Unacceptable.
I just want to tell everyone that Jesus loves you and he died for our sins so we can live. Jesus is the way to peace and happiness in life, He is the only one that can change your life for the better. So why don't put your life in his hands and allow him to take place in your life, He is waiting.
I loooved the egirl make
SAFIYA IS SOOOOOOOO GORGEOUS !!!
Loving that i can always relate in this videos !! ... ladies we’ve all had those omg camel 🐪 toe moments lol 😂 safiya looks gorgeous  tho in all these outfits .. 😘
I love that last outfit but without the jacket lol
The mask straight up makes the second outfit better, it’s so good
Your videos make my day better
the pink looks so good!!!
I enjoyed all of the looks.
Shoutout to Chaeyoung, Nayeon and mina making a cameo in this video 🥺
Americans qlso watched Totally Spies?! Glad to see a Canadian show have success! ^^
Anyone else notice her explore page is just filled with kpop
Never thought I'd be asking people on the internet for sewing patterns.. but oh well.. here we are in 2020 quarantine :D Where did you get your face Mask from or which pattern did you use? It seems to be fitting really well and looks awesome!! I have to wear one every day the whole day as I work as a cashier, so I'd love to have something trendier and better fitting. Thanks in advance and as always, I love your content! 💕
Their kitchen and living room area straight up looks like Jenna & Julien's! 😱🤗
You know what we did to start off loom bands; make an 8 with the loop and then bring over? You can do that with long laces loops, you get double short ones instead. That's what I do
Hands Down: The Witch Fit, with the ADORABLE Moon Boots!! So Saf 😍🤘🏽
25:12         You might say this is Safiyas resting witch face!
So no one's gonna talk abouy Saf's explore page?😭 She's litterally an once lmao chaeyoung fancam and nayeon photos NDOAAJAKZN
I love how the historical dress and vintage fashion communities are growing!  Makes my vintage heart so happy.
I didn’t realize how much our styles overlap I’m kinda living for this,
THE INTRO SONG IS BACK I AM SO HAPPY
I'm reading Macbeth in english right now and would much rather have safiya act it out for me
YES THE OLD INTRO!
My regular feed is ironically more tailored than my shop feed 🤣
I love the witch look! Those shoes are everything 💀👻
Just get some black fabric paint to cover up the witch part.
You seriously look like the mum from Adam's family in the beginning and I mean that as the highest of compliments
I think they should do a video depoping random clothing from videos/closet clean out
I literally liked in the first 10 seconds hoping ill see more videos from her. Going a month in between videos sucks
I love this!
@madisonandmallory feature for a second!!
The wig looks good and pink is great on you, but it is not the right haircut for your face shape...
CrUsTy♡︎♡︎
I want Safiya to colab with Bernadette or Karolina
11:15 XOWIE JONES
I miss the times when you did less falsetto and more of your super gorgeous natural low voice
I actually love the pink hair lmao
Tyler has IBS 🤣🤣🤣
Love the hocus pocus reference.
Instagram was like "this girl is a witch, but we don't know which century she's from.  Is she cursing Donald Trump or are they burning her at the stake in Salem? We'll never know."
Biden is president elect AND we get a new video?! Can this day get any better?!?!
I need a tutorial video on how tyler applied that wig
Do I just really miss JennaMarbles or does Saf and Tyler's house kinda remind anyone else of her and Julien's?
Is anyone else super happy to see Safiya’s Christmas light backdrop again?
The twice members all over your feed 😭
Safiya really be looking like the Mortician Addams of instagram science today
Ok can we talk about the fact that Saf coordinated her masks with each outfit, including having one appropriate for the colonial look?
nicki trending #1, safiya trending #2, my birthday, donald trump losing. best weekend ever
Why do I only get dresses and skirts in my shop?  Hol up!
is that your hair?
drop the skincare routine !! your skin looks so good!
Here’s what I really want to know.. hoW on eaRTH.. do u get your eyeliner to be this perfect??:((( spill the tea!
somehow all the outfits look great on her but you'd never catch me in any of those
The last one looks nicer than I thought it would. I’d wear it.
its literally been there FOREVER and the fact that youre so blind to it makes me cringe
2nd outfit is absolutely YOU, you looked the best in it, you should put on that pink wig with it and it will look dope as hell :D
with that reenactment vibes outfit where's the Weird Al Amish Paradise parody when you need it
I love the witch outfit on you, the pink wig and the Powerpuff girl tank top, also you look amazing overall! <3
Okay, Safia with pink hair literally made my mouth drop like d a m n girl!!
any other Oregonians laughing at the way they say Oregon lmaoooooo
How did I not know about this. My bank account is really gonna be in trouble now 😶
The background on your phone! 🤣🤣🤣
I cant believe you live in cali and can't pronounce Oregon
periodt ms gurl
Romans 5:3  More than that, we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance,
can I get your honest opinion on this track https://soundcloud.com/ftj-music/juiceified
Safs pioneer outfit gave me life 😭
I don’t comment on videos but the witch outfit looks so good on you!!!! You looked so hot!
I love your videos🍓🤍
Okay hear me out though: “I buy things from the ads on my own ‘The Internet Made Me Do It’ videos”
I feel like tyler was a little mean in this video, you looked absolutely gorgeous in every look 💓💓
I live in virginia and i actually know a family friend who started working at Williamsburg. (my family met them because we go to williamsburg every year with my nana)
instagram really said  *COLONIAL* or *WITCHY*
Why is there SO MUCH SPAM on this channel!!! From like 5 different accounts, they keep posting links!!!
Safiya I share your passionate love of Williamsburg :). All 3 outfits were so fun!
#2 trending in Sweden
I wish that I had instagram because I love vintage ANYTHING.
the 3rd outfit is lovecore/kidcore 😈
Great job with the wig Tyler!! Props given!
What a shit video but over 1 .3 million views people are really bored
Please come to Williamsburg I'd love to meet yall 😭😭😭
I wish the internet didn't make her self conscious about her voice, it was completely normal before.
living for that 1800 look
Soo I went to Safia’s channel and looked back at her first videosand oh mah gawd... her personality is literally the same from years ago
Love the pink hair! 💜
I love the moon heels and the love heart pink jacket so much 😭💕
I actually loved the last two. They were so cute. I agree about not having the word witch on the shirt. I feel like if it would have just had that heart as a cute detail that would be nice and I thought the last outfit was kind of cool honestly. It’s a little out there but in a cool way. Honestly with it being 2020 it was not the weirdest thing I’ve seen lol
https://youtu.be/yD7aFFh2TZU
Very happy to watch new video today.
You know you're far down the historical costuming rabbit hole when you get worried that Saf won't be wearing the appropriate undergarments for the first look (and the slight relief when she says she at least has a petticoat).
I haven’t been here for a while but damn you look amazing with that long hair! 😇
Oh my goodness I’ve missed your faces. This was so fantastic!!
Safiya's house looks just like Jenna/Julien's house. Is this a common California set up?
Finallyyyyyy
Regarding Honey, I used to think it wasn't that good, but I've been doing Christmas shopping online recently and it's actually saved me a lot! If it doesn't work for you there's no real downside, so I recommend~
I need the witch outfit omg😍🖤
Your videos always make me smile. 😃 You're the best. ❤🙏
The last one was the best on you in MY OPINION
I've been a huge Saf fan since buzzfeed but does anyone else feel like the video topics are kind of boring now???
I really think the pink coat, and wig look great. They might layer better with a black outfit. Like a pop of color. Also, you should try a live stream someday. It would be rad if you let the chat put together outfits from your closit. 😊😊😊
I think that what might be taking away the cohesiveness of the last outfit is the jacket, without it or another kind of jacket it would've looked more cohesive. But I absolutely love all of the outfits, specially the 2nd one, the shirt was so cool.
outfit 3 what ruined it was the wig
I know this is a super old video but I just watched the old buzzfeed vid where you went to face haus and I was so excited to find out that I lived near one! I just went there for the first time thank you for introducing me to it saf ok byeeee❤️❤️
Why do you talk so slow and monotone like if you’re trying to teach English lmao
Omg!! You should do a pioneer trek!!
Do the powerpuff girls actually did an episode where they and the rowdy duff boys are teens. Its a real episode that is an actual image from the mall scene.
I really liked the hair, it would be interesting to see Safiya try more wigs from Wish, Amazon, etc.
ماشاءاللّٰه
New editors me thinks. Obviously trying out a new approach. Not mad  at it. Just gotta adjust. Incorporating the fairy lights was a great way to tie in the old with the new. I had missed them!   Keep Glowing up. I think you are very talented❤️
someone make a churning gif
Glad to see you! Was a bit worried about you! Hope you and Tyler continue to stay healthy through all of this. Great video!
“The memes of production” LOL 😂😂 Tyler was killin it with the jokes 😂😂
Wow her and Jenna’s living room/kitchen interiors are hella similar
Safiya! Its incredibly rude that you look INCREDIBLE in literally every outfit!
your videos are just so satisfying to watch, you learn something, have a giggle and just generally feel like you're hanging with a friend 💕
Safiya you look so stunning and glowy I also love the long hair with the middle part I hope you keep it like that :) 18:55
Saf looks really good with a middle part
Google: K-pop is a Korean style music that takes influence from (Goes on to name EVERY single genre of music, AND Gospel)
Tyler’s tired “nevermind” from behind camera during her Sammi Sweetheart rant i- mekdhdnejhd
Hello. I know this is random, but are you happy with Joe Biden being the next President? Well, I'm from Germany and I would like to know the opinion of an american 😊😊😊 Also cool Video!!!!!😍😁😁😁😁
Where can I buy the "MoonDust Shoes?" I went to the Rouge and Wolf website but I can't find them anywhere. They have them advertised but it says something like "sorry we don't have that in our collection." Somebody please help!
Am I the only one who LIVES for how they're savage but honest with one another?! When Saf says she's bad at rollerskating, Tyler says "you're legit terrible", and I  LIVE FOR IT. Being a great couple is so much about this!!! You have to be able to admit when you're bad at something and it should be A-OK for your partner to acknowledge it too!
#2 huh wow
Omg never put new shoes on a table! 😦superstitious me is going mad!
The goth outfit was soo good! I want it <3
Oregon Trail, damn what childhood feels! Also cringed a bit on how you pronounced Oregon, I'll forgive you though ❤
I need those moon shoes I-
I'd love to see that pink wig with the goth outfit!
Okay, so the last outfit is REALLY cute. LIKE REALLY CUTE. But.... it isn't your style so if you feel uncomfortable you shouldn't wear it! But I think you look really cute so <3  However, you looked wayyy more comfortable in the second outfit aaaandddd it was also a really cute look so do whatever you want with that information
please link all the items!
For the skirt/overall, I would tuck the extra straps into the hoops so they wouldn’t just be hanging there. But that outfit is by far my favorite 😍
WHY DID YOU BOTH PRONOUNCE IT “ORE-GONE”??????
40 minutes quality content👍
Has anyone else noticed that everyone on YouTube rn is claiming their subscribers saved $2 million using Hi? This is the third time I'm hearing that exact number being quoted (and no-one who quoted a different number) which is really suspicious.
Wait, is Buttercup smoking a blunt on that shirt?
I love the pink wig on you!
Can we talk about how safiya is low key a goth girl.
TWICE on the insta explore page as usual😹😹
I know pink is not your thing but that Jacket was so super cute on you! I would be a nice pop of color in your all black wardrobe .
I was just inspired to buy 200 dollars worth of clothes lol
Your hair is so long! I feel like I just watched the video of you chopping it off 😅  love these videos!!!
Tyler killed me woth the seizing the memes of production
Aw the poor ig shopping tab is so clueless. I guess I don’t do enough on ig. It gives a few vague suggestions but nothing that I gravitate toward.
The pink wig honestly looks amazing on you
I see a lot of things I like with my Instagram ads but lots of the stuff ends up being from unethical brands. I would love to see a sustainable fashion haul 💕
i am positively surprised how well all these outfits fit your body type
Can I just say that I love that the intro song has stuck around for this long😂
I like your intro it's so calm and nice
My phone case is from Rogue and Wolf! I’ve had it for years, totally recommend.
I squealed w/ giddy excitement when I saw this video is almost 40 minutes long! I'm sitting here talking to the screen throughout the whole episode lol I love you, Saf
oooh ....  the Pink jacket with the goth velvet suspender skirt.  that would be a cute look.
Your third Outfit is like a Marina and the Diamonds look!! :D
I think a question we have is or at least I do, did Saf buy the magnificent headband? Lol
For the nipple tassel situation just feed the extra tab throw the bottom ring and problem solved
omg i need your phone case 😍
I’m in love with the shoes😍😍😍
did yall see how much linda cardellini and saf look alike in some shots
Not gonna lie, I deeply love that wig and jacket in the last look. They're so cute! But you looked great in everything
Imma need to buy that necklace to fill my jersey shore heart
Took me a sec to figure out "I'm not gonna wear it on the reg[ular]" as opposed to 'on the rag' lol. Regardless, you do you !
I miss you so dearly ❤️❤️😭😭
I like her in pink hair
You are truly adorable, Safiya! Glad to see all these awesome outfits. Loved the pastel even if it’s not really you! You looked cute!! 💗
The witchy look it's KILLING MEEEE IT'S SO COOOOOOOL
Why does safiya’s house legit look like Jenna marbles house a little bit
I saw twice ans I was like I love her
The second look though ❤️❤️🤩
Congrats on trending.. 🥳
I don't think e-girl is much of an actual fashion, it's more of a stereotype.
is no one else noticing how their kitchen/living looks so similar to Jenna and Julien's?
The wig is so cute
The pink hair is amazing on you. Looks believable.  And you guys put it in correct. Good job Tyler.
The brown part is a waistband so it is meant to be matchy matchy with the brown skirt. It is the vibe/ lewk.
anyone else see nayeonie at 0:42?
Pink eyebrows, please!!!
the all black witchy outfit was my favorite <3
The wig, the tank top,the skirt, the shoes. 10/10 outfit
THOSE SPACE SHOES😱🥵 I NEED THEM🖤✨
When they say Or-E-gone lmaooo
safiya really is the definition of "a girl who can do both"
Hi friend🙂
so we’re just gonna brush over the fact she said “we’re not there YET”
was i the only one who thought the last outfit was really cute together?
Okay so I have a question: I’ve been looking on my phone for the shopping section of Instagram, so is the tab only for laptops/computers?
I think, I could be wrong, the last aesthetic is the Y2K aesthetic
I would be so excited if Safiya genuinely got into historical reenactment. She would look so beautiful in Victorian garb!
Are you and Tyler secretly roommates with Jenna and Julien? Your house is the LITERAL SAME
I think you pulled off the soft girl vibes ok even though you thought it was egirl
And a q and a pleas
All of these styles are me. Plus alot more than just those. I don't have a certain style I just like what I like.
And a house tour
me:*Goes to website*  Website: *most things soooold ooooout* OMG Curse everyone.
I NEED THOSE SHOES!!! They don’t seem to be available anywhere 😭
much needed break from life today. thank you for all you do!
Second outfit looks AMAZING on Saf!!!🖤🖤🖤🖤
She needs to do a franken makeover to Tyler
Aw I like the pink wig!! You should experiment with wigs more often!!!
Id die for those shoes
OMG WTF 🆑🆑 https://youtu.be/UckCWRZpasQ
I really can't get over how much their house looks like Jenna's house, lmfao
Saf looks like a totally different person with pink hair! Gorgeous either way but I wouldn’t recognize her lol 🥰
Safia is so nice to buy all this stuff that really isn't cheap so she can entertain us
I love the witch outfit and as a passerbyer I wouldn't think you were a witch or anything because you're wearing a top saying witch. The Powerpuff girls tank would have been sooo good if it were cotton. Love this video 👌
You look amazing in this pink jacket!
Trending
Those first two I would wear in a heart beat her long looked really good with the looks
Love the wig, tshirt and necklace - hate the jeans. Other outfits were fun.
The pink hair was so good on you! It looks very cute (though not very "safiya-esque"). You are looking so good! This made me laugh out loud (also discover that tab I didn't notice on Instagram lol)
My shop is mostly skincare products, beauty products, shop-accounts I follow and some Korean accounts. (And for some reason a bunch of sneakers.)  XD
The "selena gomez horror movie" is 2 minutes. and has no dialogue. lmfaooo
I really like that witchie outfix. It look so cute on her.
Okay here’s the thing. “E girl” is not just one thing. there are different genres so to speak of e girl. Your pink outfit was more of a lovecore (bordering on cottagecore with the pants) e girl look. the traditional e girl look is more grungy but that is definitely a valid e girl look don’t worry! you weren’t wrong!!
I keep seeing minga London on ig as well 😅
NGL the pink not an E-girl look on Safiya was everything.
"The Cherubim on My Ass" sounds like a nice subtitle for your future memoir.
CAN ANYONE FIND THOSE BOOTS!! I looked on their website and can’t find them
love how her Instagram is full of kpop
The open part of the bonet is actually for the back, where your hair/bun would be. Just so ya know lol.
Tayler I think you did a great job with safiya's wig!!! Well done!!! We missed you both!!!
I MISSED THIS AGHH
React to "One Love" of Now United please
Well know we gotta get an actuall e Girl Video 😌🤲
Hello, to anyone who reads this, my name is Thomas. Unfortunately I'm one of the millions who was affected, by Covid not only financially but also health wise. One of my kidneys is going bad, sense of smell hasn't return, and I've been unemployed since March 16, here in nyc. I haven't been able to receive a stimulus check or unemployment because of someone else who's been fraudulently using my SS#. I've pretty much exhausted all my savings, mostly for rent and to send money, to my ailing mother in Haiti. I have no family here and I don't know what to do, I have to worry about rent. I'm hoping anyone can help financially thru my paypal at juombe@gmail.com or cash.app/$mobet4. Thank you and I hope and pray, things get better for anyone else who's going through some hardships, due to Covid.
I see Safiya is a once 😏🤚
HELLO FRIENDS!! hehe, .. this is great video i love it very much I like your channel
the third outfit definitely goes together. i would 100% wear it
I’m not a 100% sure but I think the third look was more VSCO Girl than E Girl
American girl love child🤣
What I want to know, did you buy the Maleficent ears?
I did a double take at 24:01 , Saf’s house looks like jenna’s house... please tell me I’m not the only one who thought that??  Maybe I’m just feeling a bit deprived
How come u only upload like once a month???
my personality is torn between the black witch outfit and the pink mom jean outfit
When I was 19 I went to Colonial Williamsburg for my birthday. I hadn't been since I was 12 and I have to say I loved it! It was so fun! I say when all this craziness is done you should totally go back as an adult.
There's such a thing as "soft e-girl" which the last look is kinda close to!
😄😄😄😄😄🤣🤣
you looked lovely in e-girl look, definetely not your style, but outfit was cute and lovely plus you do suit pink colour <3
"arent we all inspired by Sammi Sweetheart?" Me: Who now?  With the skirterall, you might be able to tuck the strap ends into the loops so they don't flop around
I know you've been back for a minute now, but I'm really glad you're back ❤
"I have some thoughts and feelings." - Everyone & Everything 2020
Congrats on becoming #2 trending
Once all this is over PLEASE GO TO COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG!!!! OMG SAF PLEASE!
she looks more like a witch with the first outfit and hair undone. Scandalous!
I really like the "witchy" outfit- would wear 👍🏻 maybe you could tuck the flappy bits into the rings to stop them from sticking out?
I DID A SIMILAR VIDEO ON MY CHANNEL!!! GOOD MIND THINK ALIKE 😂❤️
Omg my cousin was shown in the video!!!!
I seriously thought she was at Jenna's house when she first cut into the unboxing  😂😂😂
The respect for Tyler doing the wig!!! 👏🏼
On one of the baby disks it said Fern. That’s my name 😊
Good job with the wig Tyler *thumbs up*
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
the pink wig is really cute!!! i love it 💖💖 you look very cute in all of them saf!!
I LOVE that this is #2 on trending!!!
Cover the witch logo with black sharpie to make the shirt a little less witchy
28:25 is what happens when I start reciting Chaucer around my husband, so... that's real.
So pleased to see an old style Safiya video :) These are my favourite, we get to see more of both Safiya and Tylers personalities. Which are amazing.    Also, those second boots are fabulous!!
I actually think that pink hair suits her!!!! 😍😍
i actually think the last outfit would look good without the jacket
the “e-girl” outfit was more of an indie outfit
The shoes really didn't fit with the first outfit
I would honestly wrestle a bear for that second outfit
Did they buy jenna marbles house?? Is it just me, or does it look like their living room is identical to jenna and juliens? Not the furniture, but the fireplace, walls and doors/windows?? I might be going crazy lol
I really love it when the internet makes you buy stuff
I love colonial Williamsburg and have family who live nearby! I’d love to go with y’all 🤣
I would love to see the pink wig with the second outfit!!!
ISTG I THOUGHT SHE WAS IN JENNA MARBLES HOUSE WHEN SHE WAS UNPACKING THE STUFF
Trendy witch was my favorite by far lmao
Just so you know, I’m pretty sure the design of that tank you loved was stolen from a website called omighty, you could probably get a better quality one from them ☺️
Cap.
I think if you pluck the front of the wig and brush it out more, maybe spray dry shampoo the wig will be 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
GG
i’m pretty sure pvseur or posseure or whatever just drop ships from ali express so that would explain the quality lol
Wow I would love to wear those outfits 🥰
Giving us Marina and the Diamonds Lonely Hearts Club omg
As a Brit...I would like to say that we say Minga completely differently to you :P, with us its more Ming-er. And is slang for unattractive people, its also spelt minger rather than with the A but we have Kinga as a name with the same pronunciation.
Anyone ? What do you do if you order something on line, pay for it through pay pal, and it NEVER COMES? My teen ordered a rug for her room in April 2020, supposed to take approx. 10 wks, we gave them a bit longer bc of Pandemic ....  yet, Nada. All inquiries ignored from company...she is out $175.  I never buy online, and she has only twice, but it was clothes and no problems from that site. The PayPal was not her account but a friend's who she has not really seen much of in months. (Yes.... Not always wise...Kid ordered rug by this method without consulting with me, bc I would have suggested going to a STORE, and not involving another kid.  Her explanation- "Well it looked legit and stuff."😶 Can it just be reversed through PayPal and no harm done? I am barely able to operate a smartphone, let alone the interweb world of shopping. I like to fondle the items for sale in real time b4 I buy. Check for quality, flaws, colour. The name flung at me by my teens is "Mummydweeb".)  I love Sofia's video....my vicarious online shopper.😄💜

I really weirdly want to see a mish mash outfit at the end, like take an item from all three looks and make a workable new look.
You used your hard earned money to look like a character from my school's production of The Crucible
When Safiya only gets the outerwear of the “colonial” outfit without getting the proper undergarments.... :(
I think the not e girl stuff is a soft girl
I love your “e-girl” outfit!
Where is the first mask with the flowers from??? I love it so much
I really was positive this was Jenna marbles house. Like I really thought it was.
I loved the all black outfit except for the part that said witch. I don’t think you look good in pink at all but the jacket was cute 😊
Can you post more often like if You agree
Almost scary how well Saf managed to pull off pink hair. And frankly, that witch outfit I'd wear in a heartbeat
why this is #2 in trending?
The e-girl clip with Jenna and Julien rocking matching pink wigs 😂😂😂
I think the 3rd outfit would've looked a lot better without the wig
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Also that e girl look is very confused
I seriously thought they were in Jenna and Julien's house, but I guess American rich houses just all look the same?
It’s cottagecore. She just dressed cottagecore.
Today on “Dressing like a wlw”
What a joy to see something as normal as your internet made me buy video, after all the election chaos!  I wonder if the black skirt would go with the pink jacket? I kinda liked all of these (well, the jeans had some obvious issues). The bonnet could work as a night cap, with a fancy vintage style night gown.   I hadn't noticed the shop tab, either, so I went to check mine in the middle of the video. Apparently, IG has concluded that I'm in the market for a chest binder (I'm not), jewelry, and a pair of Jimmy Choos. I may have confused the algorithm by saying I'm a jewelry making human being in my account description. I've only ever bought some tights because of an IG ad, and I don't really follow any fashion accounts, but I wouldn't dislike something fun like celestial boots in my tab.
Can we please just talk about how amazing Safiya’s background is on her phone
I think what you were looking for is probably "soft girl" I get a lot of those recommendations too. I think instagram correlates that with kpop.
The pink wig looks so good. She should dye her hair that colour it would Look good with all the black she wears
Safiya you look good with pink hair
PLEASE ALL THE TWICE VIDEOS ON YOUR EXPLORE PAGE WE STAN A ONCE
OMG!!! GIRL YOU LOOK SO F- ING BEAUTIFUL IN THE THIRD OUTFIT! OMG!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Beautiful as always :)
Im sorry safiya I just wanted to know have you gotten any plastic surgery ur just to pretty 🤩
why does safiya’s new house look so much like jenna’s 😭
I totally wanna see the black witch outfit with the pink wig!
what about keeping the wig and pairing it with outfit 2?
you should have put the straps true the rings and into the dress
Okay but is the Selena horror film out?😂
I think you’re suppose to put the leftover strap part of the skirtoralls inside of the rings 😂 I mean who know what you’re SUPPOSE to do but you could lol
What was your wallpaper😂
Y’all literally have the combined IQ of 300 and didn’t get the pun goth milk = got milk? I- 😭
how is Safiya so beatiful!!!!??????
100% not colonial williamsburg, which is in the 1700, but more of a a mid victorian look, around 1860s
Juan.
Oregon is pronounced oh-ree-gen... I should know, I’m a fifth generation Oregonian
That "witch" outfit is something I would 100% wear if I weren't shaped like a sack of potatoes. The pink outfit unfortunately looked like it was made from pieces  that shared factory space with all the other fast fashion brands. Useing that grabage swimsuit material on anything other than a swimsuit is a crime period.
FRANKENSTEIN COCKTAILS in the Frankenmug! All the cocktail syrups or all the flavored vodkas 😎🍸🍹🧉
The whole time I was thinking “take the wig off” lmao I think it would’ve changed the vibe of the fit
Saf, that’s not e-girl thats a y2k aesthetic aka 2000s aesthetic
love the witch outfit on you.
YEEEES THESE ARE MY FAVORITE
Totally need those boots! What did you search to find them?
Love you safiya 💕
Safiya yelling the witches’ speech from MacBeth as Tyler ignores her and walks is weirdly so relatable.
Do you live in Virginia?
Does she have the same house as Jenna and Julian?
ITS T SHIRT TIME!
The top you have on while unboxing the insta-witchy outfit is ADORABLE.
The question is what are you going to do with the clothes that are not going to be worn?
our favourite wholesome creator is backkk
Okay i LOVED the second outfit on you. Also your Winifred impression is ON POINT,  Miss! This was a super fun video, so thanks for that <3
Ooo. #1 trending

wait you have no idea how long I've been trying to find those shoes with the compartment that you can fill with stuff.  The only one I could find was from Dollskill, which I don't support.  Bless this video.
okay but why does it look like you live in Jenna Marbles's house? :D :D
The epitome of: good things take time
y is this treanding after the election victory?
I LOVED the second outfit, it suits you so well🥰
THE SECOND OUTFIT!!! So perfect!! I need it now omg
I actually liked the first outfit the most
Hellooooo box 🤣 (it's me)
When are we doing the new house tour anyways from the  little angles I have seen your house looks beautiful
lol safiya’s explore page is all kpop girls 👀
Love your hair...always did
It's called Soft girl! You ment soft girl the whole time 😂 ist "the same" but the opposite 😂😂😂😂 if that makes sense
Okay this is Mark's way of selling hookers on Instagram okay I got you
leaves and comes back with Same content  😳  i am not interested anymore sorry
https://youtu.be/CUn1WRG31C8
If you wore that first fit where I live people would think it’s normal because there are so many Amish people lol
I want to see the lower half of the second outfit with the top half of the third. I feel the  skirt and shoes would help the pink match Safiya more.
The Amish would probably say “my culture is not your costume”, but I don’t think they’re on YouTube, so we good...
More soft girl then egirl, not far off!
29:00
The fact that Safiya easily quotes Macbeth blows my mind😂😭
TRY FOLLOWING A HOWTOCAKEIT TUTORIAL!!!!💓
28:01
Spoiled top is a Bratz top.
Great video 👍 really cute
That's a nice wig!
The fact that she matched her masks to her outfits is amazing, lol. Also, this is my first Youtube comment, you should be honored.
Is Safiya’s family room giving anyone else Jenna Marbles vibes?
11:18 lil peeps bellboy

OMG i LOVE that pink denim jacket !! i'd love to have it myself
Her background😂 I love it
THE WALLPAPER 💀
As I'm watching this it's #1 in trending...good move leaving Buzzfeed 😎
Ooooh, wow, this gave me s good laugh, thank you so much, this is exactly what the doctor prescribed! 🌚🌚🌚 Also, you are looking goooood 😍
u look amazing in the pink hair, but it didn't match this pink jacket (which is also extremely cute, i want it)
Wait what is that Selena Gomez IGTV movie called??
Pink wig + goth outfit would be a winner.
I’m sorry I won’t be finishing this video, but I have to go check out the Instagram shop tab for edgy clothes to add to my wardrobe
Saf you’re glowing!! Loving the long hair on you ✨
How the hell does Safiya rock those ill fitting jeans?? They look great on her
Such a fun video!!! Me and my husband look forward to your videos! 😁
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9sZ46t7qOs
Damn safiya you are looking so FOINE. Hair is lush, girl get it girlllllll eyyyy
She looks like she’s in such good shape now !
You look bomb in that gothic outfit!😍
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🎈Non-Duality
#2 on trending CONTENT 👌
I only wish she made content for frequently. I mean, totally deserving of a long break. But I love saf’s videos 💜💖 Plus she got the man, the house, the money aaayy girl!!!
why is your phone wallpaper so beautiful 😂
Safiya is looking more and more like Morticia and I’m here for it
omg i have wanted those edwardian boots from memery for ages!! they are too expensive  for me at the moment thoough :/
Yessss I loveeee these videos
That historical outfit was definitely a mish-mosh of eras and cultures. LOL But it was cute.
That second outfit was amazing, I went and bought it right after I watched this video and absolutely love it!
Ok but we should have a 2 he un cut special of one woman millennial Macbeth
My instagram is just full of ASTRO x AROHA kpop stuff
Comment for algorithm :)
I love your video safiya🥰all your video i watch✨🙆‍♀start your korean skincare until now.. be positive and always happy🙆‍♀
Omg PLEASE visit  Colonial Williamsburg! I live super close by for school and that'd be so awesome :') I will say right now though is maybe not a great time because a lot of tourists in CW aren't wearing masks .-.
my moms friend is having a baby girl and i recommended the name Safiya!
Ok but like petition for safiya to dye her hair pink lmao? It brings out her features SO WELL.
on my main account its in the same place but on my finsta its got it's own tab where the activity tab used to be?? idk whether im a beta tester or sumn but i hate it
how does safiya look stupid good in everything she wears?
The way they said Oregon hurt my soul.
Those are very unfortunate looking jeans. The rest of the items were really nice and flattering
She’s back 🥰🥰 so happy you’re back making videos Safiya! Hope you’re ok 💞
You should totes move to Virginia Safiya.  Also I have very happy memories of my grandma taking me to colonial Williamsburg.
Ore-gone? Why do people not from Oregon wanna say it like that
😄🎒💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝
That pink wig with the witch outfit would look so cute ❤️
Poor tyler i also have ibs i feel you man
Safiya naming all my favorite American Girl dolls! Team Kirsten, Felicity and Josephina!
Now you have to do an actual e girl look
Hahaha I love the way y’all say Oregon. Typically it is pronounced or(think Oreo - the eo) guh-in. But fast to orgin. Still I think it’s so funny that it is totally up to the interpretation.
YOU SHOULD DO A COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG VIDEO WITH NOT YOUR MAMAS HISTORY! I think you and Cheney would have tons of fun!
I actually liked the last outfit for some reason? She just pulls off all these unique looks!
minga london is a very strange name for a brand considering the word 'minger' in the UK means someone who is really gross and nasty
We trending
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT MASK I WANT IT
SAFIYA YOUR HOUSE IS GIVING ME V MUCH JENNA MARBLES VIBES also great video the outfits are great!
Me, another out of the loop millenial, seeing the thumbnail: "oh look, I think she's doing an e-girl look"
The second one was so cute and felt so natural to her. Third one was awful lol
Trending #1
This is the earliest I’ve ever seen one of her videos!! LOL
Pink hair looks amazing on you
Safiya, you are so neat
I love the goth outfit. The pink outfit looks like what a movie made in the 80s but set in the 2000s thought the future would look like. It’s not bad it’s just not of this time.  Ngl churning the butter gave me life. Ben Franklin would have loved it.
ok but the memes of production joke was hilarious
The wig looks sooo good!
The shirt and necklace is y2k but the pants is a soft girl aesthetic the jacket I think could be both depending on how you style it
I wish you made more videos more
honest to god the hair style/length and color suits u so well, i feel like it really complements your eyes and facial expressions
Hi saf that is called a soft girl. hops this helped?
14:00 I think its Y2K fashion but I'm not sure lol
Is it odd that I kinda like the pink hair? Anyone else?
Why do I want all of these outfits? Just for like going to class or like the grocery store
The second outfit suits you so much! You look f&€king bomb! ☺️
I LOVE the pink wig on you. Also, I want to pair that pink jacket with the skirtall
"and a selena gomez horror movie" PLSS
Что за движ? Откуда столько просмотров ?
The room where she did the unboxing looks like Jenna marbles place... threw me for a loop
Dying at “SHES A WITCH OHHH SHES A WITCH” I must have watched this part 5 times
I just bought something on Insta. Safiya you should be paid by Insta for this.
You have no idea how hard I’m trying to not spend 125 dollars on those moon shoes😭
When are we getting a house tour
the not an egirl look was more y2k fashion imo
Awe thanks for the Virginia jokes.
What were they yelling?? I couldn’t tell 🤔😂
It's okay Ty, I have IBS as well xD
Hi Safiya, where did you get that flower mask for the 1690s outfit?
🌿🌿🌿🌿Thanks! 🎵🎼🎹🎹💚💯❗🤗 .💋💋💋💋💋💞💞💞💞   My favorite channel💕😢,really!Thanks for the video.💋💋💋💋💋💞💞💞💞   🚀🚀🚀 Very nice video 👍👍🚀🚀🚀Very charming
I lovveee the pink ✨
Can't think past the Safiya Nygaard parody at this point
ok but now destroy every mug and glue it back together
Omg # 1 on trending I'm so so proud <3
14:18 "Hello fellow kids, I am one of you". -Safiya Nygaard 2020
that second outfit was so good >:( i want all of it
okay how did she put on that wig?! I can never get wigs to stay on or even look good!
She actually looks so cute in a bonnet! She can definitely pull it off with that first shirt she had on and her hair down! It’s a look only she could do 😂
The wig and the makeup was such a Marina Diamandis vibe and I LOVE IT.
PLEASE tell me other people are FEELING that pink hair on her!!
THE SECOND OUTFIT 😍 it suits you sooo much! I LOVE it!
Am I the only one that NEEEEEDS to know where's the triangle pillow from??
You two are hilarious.   That pink jacket looked super cute on you and I actually really liked you in that wig!  Lol
now we need a full face of makeup from Instagram Shop
I live like an hour from Williamsburg. Why I haven’t been more than once in my life is beyond me. Also I love the second black outfit I want it!!
I was like 9 at night but I’m soo exited. I’m British how about you ?
Boss bitch is now a thing
My gosh Safiya you're sexy. Especially in your 2nd dark outfit look
what if the "witch" shirt had a black cat or a bat on it instead?
Tuck the ends of the straps of the skirt into the metal circles..
I actually loved the 2nd outfit and I need those shoes
Is that twice i see :)
you could tuck the little leather flappies on the overall skirt into the metal hoop, which might solve both the problems you had!
okay but why was the ~witch~ outfit so cute?
Safiya Safiya SAFIYA!!!!!  Please experiment the look of Dark Academia!!! I think you will like it! Its like a mixture of Historical vintage liberian  Aestethic.
I love the kitchen in the background....😀
OMG, I LOVED THOTICIA! hahaha that one was closer to e girl than the pink one 🖤
For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;  Romans 3:23 KJV   But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.  Romans 5:8 KJV   For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.  Romans 6:23 KJV   that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.  Romans 10:9 NKJV  For God so loved the world, that He gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  John 3:16 KJV     God loves you, Jesus loves you! Repent and believe in Jesus Christ today with a sincere heart in faith, and by the grace of God you will inherit the gift of eternal life! If you believe in Jesus you will NEVER die! (John 11:25) God bless you!
😍😍😍
Outfit A without the hat is major Christina Ricci in Sleepy Hollow vibes.
it’s the fancam of Chaeyoung dancing for me.
Can someone please give me the link for the moon boots
All of those Kpop posts on her feed though! 🤩🥰💜
SAF, YOU'RE TRENDINGGG♡♡♡♡♡
You should tuck the buckle ends through the hoops into the top of the skirt to stop them flapping! Also, I need those moon shoes and pink heart jacket!!!
she legit looks like noami scott, they both are so prettYy!
SAF, YOU'RE TRENDINGGG♡♡♡♡♡
Those eyebrows though nooo
The last outfit was giving more soft girl/y2k than e-girl, but the whole vibe on your insta was very y2k
She changed her intro song!!!
I love the brats look!! Do a video of multiple bratz outfits plzz
Glowup alert
Thank you for wearing a mask!
get rid of the wig and jacket and it would be cute
loved the video :)
Yes hello I need those shoes
La meilleure <3
i think you’re suppose to tuck in the excess strap into the circle so it not flopping around hahaha
15:04 tyler sounding genuinely pissed here LOL
#1 on trending when election results are out, wow!
i LOVE the goth/black look omg <3
Could I see a video of a fraken-mug? T
This was really fun, love the witch look
For the last outfit, I love the pink jacket and wig! And the matching mask really complements them both! I'd love to see either of these items with some more 'gothy' items from her wardrobe :)
I really love those moon shoes holy crap
the Witch outfit really gives me life
I'm obsessed with the second outfit, it looks so good on her!!!
I love colonial Williamsburg! Busch gardens williamsburg is also completely amazing. Come to Christmas town at Busch gardens. It's breath taking!
The last one is so good what do you mean Saf!!!!!!
I immediately went looking for the rogue wolf shoes and it looks like they are sold out 😭
Tyler so excitedly “look at those boots”  Her “uncomfortable”  Him “......yeahhh”  I think he wanted her to wear those boots 😂
Amazing video idea!!! Reall like it kisses from Greece!!!
14:17 "Hello fellow kids, I am one of you". -Safiya Nygaard 2020
I think egirl/vsco/prettypastelpls/bratz styles have a lot of overlay with 90s styles, the denim, some of the colors and the colored hair and accessories, it's just more the tone of what they are going for that differentiates them.
Hi saf ❤️
Safiya is a ONCE 😭 we have a twice Stan over here
Coffin dance to black peoples
Mia Maples did this a while ago :P
i missed the intro song
"Hello fellow kids, I am one of you" -Safiya Nygaard
The black outfit was so cuteee
I would wear all three of these outfits but I definitely think the last one didn't really fit your style
Thankful for the effort you put into all of your videos! Like the patience required to wait for all of the packages to arrive is more than I could ever do to not rip it open immediately but you film each and every one👌🏻.  Also this is my happy place, hope you and Tyler have a great one!!
This is Safiya's new intro sooooong!!
Ok but I think that hair color works for you
she should have a skull mask with black dress
oh honey, mark zuckerberg is trying to kill us all
Same
I love you Safiya!
The last look reminds me so much of marina and the diamonds
So many things I've never ever had in my life. :D
Safiya in her colonial outfit is like she’s getting ready for Thanksgiving 🦃 and not just skipping to Christmas 🎄 in November
Is it just me or when she said bonnet blouse belt was waiting for her to say Battlestar Galactica
i fucking miss y’all
I thought the soft girl "e-girl" outfit was really really cute! And that wig was great 💖
I think the rings are there so you can tuck the strap in and behind!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgLQR4Z4sDo
she looked great in all of them, my favourite was the witch outfit, but I really liked the pink wig, too
I can't get over the intro it's too good 😆
As a Virginian from Williamsburg I’ve never been so proud
Tyler didn’t do that bad with the wig! I’ve seen way worse lol
1mn views in 14 hours, great job👍🏼
I think the pink wig looks so cute on u I would just say get your eyebrows thinner it will compliment your face soo much but either way I love ur videos !!!
Love the idea of the Franken-mug video but how about going one step up from your Franken-candle and doing every candle in Yankee Candle? Or trying to do resin art because that stuff is EVERYWHERE on my insta
We missed you!
Okay but that “e girl” makeup is fire saf 🥺🤩🤩🤩
As a Virginia resident whoes dad is a historical reenactor, I really like this video. I also love williamsburg
18:16 GIRL IS SERVING SKINNNNOMG
Honestly I think Safiya would enjoy most things from Rogue & Wolf. It's got the matte black and kinda "awkward" unique pieces.
I loooved that witchy outfit!! But also loved all the others! You are so pretty ❤️
She should do a video trying different aesthetics it could be a series
You guys are hilarious together.
23:20 That bonnet vs no bonnet transformation is some 2000s live-action disney movie sh*t. 👌😌
Am I the only one or does Safiya's "e-girl" look give me more of a Halsey in BTS' Boy With Love music video vibe especially with that pink hair?? 😂
I’m pretty sure it’s still egirl, it’s soft egirl style instead of the classic egirl. but nowadays, it’s all blended
Oh my gosh, Safiya just reference Josefina, my favorite American Girl when I was little. And she even pronounced right!
I support Saf in wigs!!!!!!
Oh my gosh I’m SIMPING over pink Sofiya
the pink hair and the eye make up is very marina and the diamonds
The third look made me think of Marina and the Diamonds
Anyone else actually loving saf in the pink hair???
I think the pink outfit looks great and definitely cohesive enough!
Safiya and I have the same explore page :P
Congrats on trending Saf!
pink hair looks so good on you 😫😫
You looked so hot in your witchy woman outfit! Maybe you could swap the harnesses to the back of the skirt to avoid that tassel situation? Loved this video ❤️ my shop tab is unfortunately super random and not relevant to me, idk why
Yeeeah no, those jeans are not cut well regardless of being the wrong size. You already guessed that the wig color is wrong for your skin tone, and I'm gonna say the style of it is wrong for your face shape too BUT I'm glad you tried it out anyways! Definitely could have worked better with pink eyebrows but them's the breaks. I'd like to see the pink jacket redone as more of a trenchcoat look on you, but maybe it's the jeans that threw the jacket off too.
That pink wig is not good
It sad to see some people being bit racist here ,
Omg a few years ago there was an act on Eurovision that had dancers as butter churners and...yeah it was hilarious 😂 do look it up
The shop tab has been there for ages ?
miss rosie and twice on the explore page <3
pink not an e girl safiya looks like when hardcore goth youtubers do those "goth to insta baddie transformation" videos
first outfit without the head thing looked like a secret village witch the second one was IN YOUR FACE WITCH the first was like chill bro my family are witches 😂
The pink hair with the makeup combo 😍😍 safiya is stunning
I don’t work at Colonial Williamsburg but I go to William and Mary and I’m sure we could hook u up with something lol!
safiya looks SO GOOD in that witchy goth fit omg
You look so pretty, inviting, and nice with a middle part. like if Miss Honey from Matilda was a vampire.
Wow 1 million views and it was only 14 hours ago
I love u in the pink wig.  Jean's sucked,  everything else ok.  I really liked the witch top and celestial shoes
That "egirl" stuff was more egirl meets soft girl 💙
She looks like Wednesday from The Addams family in the witchy outfit 10 out of 10
THOTICIA 😆
Living for the Colonial Williamsburg reference lol
Hi sofiya! Can I pls get a shout out? and i have a video idea! please go to shop miss A! all of there items are one $1!
YAY SHE POSTEDDD
Love CW!
This video is a good prize for me after learning that Biden’s president. Made me really happy to see Saf doing hauls
For the first outfit they tried on, as someone who lives in Oregon, that hurt me to hear them pronounce it like that 😂😂
Whenever someone mentions K-Pop. i just think of my ult ( *ASTRO x AROHA* ) ( *PENTAGON x UNIVERSE* ) ( *SVT - CARATS* )    That's it...that's my comment... also I was waiting forever for Safiya <- I freaking missed her after all the soap videos she got me addicted to :))
the third look is more of a soft girl look.
I like the first outfit lots.  I think you are right about the skirt on the second outfit.
We need a house tour😍
0:41 BUT ALL THE KPOP ON HER IG PAGE WOW I STAN
OMG WHO ELSE AGREES SAFIYA IS SO BEAUTIFUL!!
You should do a second part to this video and try shop me goostaaa
Saf you’re such a babe and seriously rock every one of these outfits
Humm I have check out next time on Instagram.
The bonnet is supposed to be for sleeping.  Dormeuse means "a sleeping female" in French.
I love these videos. Saf always buys things I either want or am curious about.
25:49 ''SISTERS~ TONIGHT WE FLY!'' 25:53
Maybe the Straps are supposed to go inside the rings and inside the dress
I like all the different looks
ugh idk i just love u so much
So we are not gonna talk about that screensaver at 11:36? :D
I have a virtual baby. Since I had to research some Prgnancy related products for a school project i have gotten a lot of Pregnancy and Baby Ads. Now Its ads for Toddler toys and so on. they grow up so fast... even when they are not even real.
https://youtu.be/NW3GIpz-3bI
The “Hello Box, it’s me” got me lol
So are we just not going to talk about Saf's phone background? Tyler has never looked better.
Who else is binge watching safya! I’m doing this whilst thinking what recipes to make haha! 🤣🤩💕
but why are you pronouncing oregon that way? 😂😭
Omgg i cant with the twice cameos 💖💖💖
Okay is anyone else noticing that their house looks EXACTLY like jenna and juliens?? Like the living room area looks so similar
Im so fat meme ,lololollol
Now I am waiting for Safiya to do a next video of “I went to Colonial Williamsburg in full 1770s makeover.” Once the pandemic is over.
Safiya is looking extra Morticia Addams today and I’m here for it.
"Tyler's getting dysentery" "Dude!" "Tyler I nominate you for dysentery" *Exasperated* "fine"
Can u do a vid where ur cat chooses things to buy on wish or ebay
I love the pink wig and jacket. They’re both so cute!
I missed this intro so much!! 😭
Dude wear the denim jacket with the skirt thing! ♥️♥️
Am I the only one that notices the joint buttercup is smoking
Saf I’ve missed seeing your videos you are awesome
safia is a once i repeat safia is a once
I cant say I'm only disappointed that you didnt go for the full Josephine look, with the shawl.  But I'm still glad you did a historical outfit.   Also I'm surprised the Goth Milk didnt try for the Goat Milk pun and put a Baphomet on it. If anyone knows of a purse or brand that's done that pun hit me up.
I saw those cool cut out goth boots and went to go try and buy them and they NO LONGER EXIST AAAA
I don't mean to simp BUT why is no one talking about the fact that she actually pulled off every outfit so perfectly, I loved them all wish I had the goth one tho and that pink wig😍
💖
"Do they do other princesses? They do, they really do!" "Do they do villains? THEY DO, THEY REALLY DO!" I loved her increase in excitement there 😂
Shop & review outfits from SHEIN and FashionNova! I've always been curious about the quality of their products.
“Aren’t we all inspired by sammi swearheart?” Haha I’ve never felt so seen before 😂😂
As a spokesperson of Virginia as a native Virginian(and with the name and initials Virginia) I approve.
you’re looking so good lately 😭😍💞✨🖤
I don’t know about anyone else but I definitely think Saf was pulling off the pink outfit. She looks good with pink hair
As an Oregonian I’m posting my obligatory “that’s not how Oregon is pronounced” comment.
Love whenever you post a video!
Safiya makes every mug cake in the franken mug
LMFAO they used the new intro hahahahahahaha thumbs up if your remember that video
Why does their house look exactly like Jenna and julien’s???
Ordering those jeans
The pink outfit makes you look like a cartoon character in the best way possible!
The last outfit was a very weird mix of y2k and soft girl indie 😂 she tried though
Sofia now talk like Wish item titles
I want that mug video
oh to be rich😔
13:53 y'all telling me that's not Doja Cat?- 😳
So she basic af
I hope there's a load of brits in the comments going 'wait- minga london? Is that ironic?' (I'd assume 'minga' to be prounced like 'ringer' with the 'ming' as in 'ming vase') and a minger/minga here is someone who's gross (looking, smelling, acting, it applies to everything: 'Ew, she's a total minger. Absolutely minging'
i would LOVE if you did a collab with abby cox!!! The historical reenacting would be GOD TIER
Please do a whole video on wigs!!!
Great video! So much fun!
25:46 THE STRUUUUUUUT
I honestly LOVED the outfits (but more the dark witch look, personally) The outfits looked really good together and I loved the galaxy mask❤
"let me churn the butter plz" MAKE THIS HAPPEN 🤩❤️✨
I see Saf, I hit LIKE!
Safiya looked stunning with the witchy outfit! I felt like it enhanced her natural beauty and personality, and also made her look younger and modern!
Can you do more mystery boxes ???
Safiya: Why is instagram showing me this? 🤔  Also Safiya 2 years ago: "I Dressed Like Bratz Dolls From The 2000s"  @ 4:46
Check out "Anne with an E", on Netflix?
The "not an e girl" outfit looks like what they'd call a "90s baby outfit" or "00s baby outfit" on insta
You should search for AlienOutfitters on Instagram, they have amazing outfits and maybe it's your style ✨
As an Oregonian, I have to say your pronunciation of Oregon (it's or-uh-gun not or-ee-gawn) was the only imperfect part of the video. Everything else was gold.
I actually love the pink and black outfits on you
😂😂😂I have NEVER seen my name SO MUCH in a video (My name is Angelic)
i honestly would love the pink wig on you if you were wearing any color BUT pink!!
Can't believe Safiya and Tyler are roommates with Jenna and Julien.
"Are you into bunching?" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
23:27 something about it gives me Red Dead Redemption vibes
I adore the black outfit, especially the shoes! And I am in love with that pink jacket! Tbh you rock everything you wear, would look good in a bin bag no doubt! X
Upvote this I want to see safyas mug collection now
Wait when did you steal Jennas house
Is anyone gonna talk about Tyler’s picture for Safiya’s Home Screen?
I just love safiya and Tyler's relationship and how fun they are together
Another amazing video you should do more goth and do the green hair look in the pic in the beginning
20:05 you don’t “churn” up & down, Safiya! .... 😂
#2 on trending 14 hours after upload Holy hecc
Pretty interesting
The Oregon pronunciation deceased me
"The memes of production." Can we just talk about how brilliant that line was.
the wig is SO CUTE. you should experiment with wigs more!
This reminds me of an OG Safiya video and it's GLORIOUS. MUCH LOVE!!!
I find it hilarious that its called minga, most brits spent all the 2000s using minga as solely an insult
The way they said Oregon killed me. As an Oregonian it seems anyone who doesn’t live doesn’t know how to say it
I had one of the baby blue angel shirts, when I was in middle school lol
#1 on trending well done!
The stuff that you were calling e girl is what I'm pretty sure is like soft girl
19:25 "I feel like a saucy wench" -Safiya 2020
omg "ore-gawn"
This reminded me a lot of the tiktok small businesses ☄
you mentioning Josefina makes me think you should an American Girl outfits video!! Like the Bratz one
memes of production was the most quotable phrase this episode props to tyler
Am i the only one that thought she was in jenna's house for a sec? 28:40
Speaks like Ivanka. Same finishing school?
I could see Marzia wearing the last outfit
not u having twice on your explore page 😭😭😭
#2 on trending ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ so happy and proud
To be fair, the goth witch vibe is already a default, I also get those suggestions and I do not follow any goth account, is not edgy anymore, jaja is basic.
Sabbath Night Fever. 😂😂😂
Can we all just appreciate the fact the Saf coordinated her mask to her outfit. V cute 💖
Well done tyler
She said the meet me at Mcdonalds haircut and I knew exactly what she meant.
The kpop in your explore page tho 😂😂
I think the pink look would've worked a lot better if you had styled the wig - like space buns or ponytails on two sides. I mean that's what I usually see with this kinda look.
https://youtu.be/-iQEKtOd6cM
https://youtu.be/-iQEKtOd6cM
These videos are my favourite!!
I may just have no fashion sense but I feel like the last outfit would've been pretty great if they switched out the tank for plain white one and not included the wig
15 seconds in and I just gotta say those wings and flawless.
You forgot to put your apron on the first outfit. Love the second outfit, but maybe the laces wrap up your leg? 🤔 and the 3rd outfit works, looks good. Just love the jacket and wig 😍
Honestly don’t understand how her videos get dislikes
So happy you’re releasing content again 🖤🖤🖤 you’re my favorite youtuber
Lol I like that chaeyoung from twice was there 😂
I’m like 85% sure that this was made partially for Safia
You need the skirt that matches the Jean jacket
2:07 🥴
Ah one of my favorite Disney ear shops Aloha Ears was suggested to her! They were the 3D printed maleficent ears!
hey safiya i like ur hair OwO
Okay but why does she look bomb in a wig tho😍😍😍❤️🖤
JENNAAAAAAAA that's it that's the comment
You are so hard working good job keep it up xxx also I have been subed for 5 years xxxx
The pink wig and jacket looked so good on her!!
The last outfit was the best imo 🤗
Are you and Jenna Marbles switching homes? Same house? Confusing.
DO AN EGIRL MAKEOVER!!!
That "e-girl" look is a lot like a soft girl look to me, which makes the confusion understandable because they're pretty close. Where the E-Girl aesthetic hits plaid skirts and layered tops, the Soft Girl aesthetic definitely goes more towards the color palette you had, and you can find a skirt with the exact same pattern as the jacket you got when you google it.
also I stan rogue + wolf, their drinkware is joy, I have a huge mug with the same print as the shoes inside and a huge tumbler with, again, the same print
if you do end up going to do reenactment stuff making candles is actually so much more satisfying than churning butter, churning butter gets PAINFUL at the end and with candles you can,, just,, dip your finger in the wax and it's rad
I feel bad because Instagram completely changed the layout of their shop right before they released this video
Twice made it into the video ❤️
The  ABCs of Salvation, or how to be right with God, and know you're going to Heaven:  A-dmit that you're a sinner, and need a Savior.  As it is written: There is none righteous, no, not one. Romans 3:10  For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. Romans 3:23  B-elieve that Jesus Christ died paying the penalty for your sins, and rose from the grave.  He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross. 1 Peter 2:24  For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures... 1 Corinthians 15:3-4  C-all on the Lord Jesus Christ to save you, and trust only in Him for your salvation.  If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. Romans 10:9  For whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved. Romans 10:13  The moment you "believe," or, put your trust in what Jesus has done for you, God saves you and your eternal destiny in Heaven is assured. You go from spiritual death to eternal life the moment you believe.  Jesus said it this way: Most assuredly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life. John 5:24😀
Alternative title: watch Safiya's hair grows in a video
Petition for Safiya to collab with CosTubers!  Maybe dive into some history bounding?  I think it would be right up your alley 🙂
I’m here cause this is trending.. -Always was
im slightly obsessed with those celestial boots
i absolutely love the wig on you!! actually the whole last outfit tbh
YESSSSS I MISSED THESE VIDEOS
I'm OBSESSED with the second look
*already liking the video*  MY ASSUMPTION WAS CORRECT, SHE  WENT SHOPPING IN INSTA (～￣▽￣)～
Why has no one commented about Safiya's homescreen wallpaper being that picture of Tyler? 😂😂
Me, a Virginia who has been to Colonial Williamsburg hundreds of times: 👁👄👁
Girlll the pink would be a softie look. Not egirl
Why don't you have the links two things I need that damn witch shirt and witch shoes
it looks like she’s in jenna marbles house 😢
im so used to you being a bat that i was  freaking out when you had the pink wig on
With the makeup and the wig in the last look you're giving me Marina Diamandis vibes and I'm living for it.
I miss your videos sooo much! When can we get a house tour?
I need that which shirt need those with shoes don't like the skirt but I need that shirt and shoes
Safiya: "They see me churnin, they hatin..."  Me: 😂🤣😂🤣
you look so awesome with pink hair xoxo
Technically there’s a sub category of egirl that is girly and pink
I went to my insta shop after watching this...mine was less exciting
I think the last outfit is a very Mom-E Girl look based on the style of the jeans. And I'm 100% here for it.
nonomomomomomo
Omg the witch outfit looks so good on u :0
Safiya looks so pretty in the goth outfit!
I think the power puff girls top was dropped shipped. Idk the sellers seemed shady to me
Witch or civil war re-anactor? "Both"  *Insert meme from Road to El Dorado*
Ok but safiya, you looking GOOOOOD in all of the outfits!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Safiya literally pulls off any outfit
FYI: Cherubim is a plural noun. The singular is cherub.
You're video is 2nd trending!!
that colonial look with your hair down reminds me of hailee steinfeld's emily dickinson
What I wanna know is does Honey have a discount code for brambleberry.com ?
OHMYGOSH THAT PINK WIG SKSSKSSKSKSSKS IT'S SO GOOD
Oh my goodness!! I love those boots! They are lush!
The stars and moon on the boots kinda make a smiley face
Honestly I never ever get tired of these types of videos
For you the skirt tho you can always change the straps
not saf having twice on her explore page pahahahaahaha
The witch one just fits you perfectly loved the shape on the waist and hip ! Also loved the stars make up
Does anyone know where her black top with flowers is from (she's wearing it when unboxing) ? 🥺
I'm sorry to be this person, truly sorry.  BUT you keep interchanging "Colonial Williamsburg" with 1870's or mid-1800's. And no! Maybe more like 1760's or 1770's. Also, because you mention the lack of a "hoop skirt" that's another anachronism. Hoop skirts were exclusive to the mid 19th century, roughly 1840-1860's ish. So technically your fine in not having one, just thought I'd clarify that. Again, I apologize for having to be "that" person.
I feel like the jacket would look good with the velvet skirt, just in general color coordination.
o no, that is not how you say Oregon
yes!! we love ONCE Saf!! stream I can't stop me!!!!
OMG SHES #2!!!!
The second outfit is amaaaazing omg
You've made it to the jenna marbles sub reddit for your room looking like jenna marbles' 😂💕
Without the bonnet you look like ones of those Western outlaw women. Going round on a horse shooting people and having a dandy old time
Loving the witch outfit 🥰
I think the skirt would look and feel less awkward if you tucked the ends of the straps through the rings and into the waistband.
Its sad cuz the power puff girls top is a stolen design from oh mighty .:( that’s why the quality is off I wish they could get more recognition as they always get ripped off 🥺😭
I live in Williamsburg and my husband used to work in Colonial Williamsburg tourism industry. It's not as excited as you may have remembered it... trust me. However, if you actually want to go there HMU.
She looks so good w the gothic look 🖤
The universe keeps telling me to where more pastel goth
Me and all the other fashion historians going off on Safiya about the difference between a bonnet and cap
lmao the song was amazing xD I luv u Saf so much <3
EGIRL DOESN'T EXIST STOP CALLING ME AN EGIRL I'VE BEEN DRESSING LIKE THAT SINCE MIDDLE SCHOOL N I'M 26, NOT AN EGIRL ..... it's like taking your style making it popular and calling it something else so then when people start to see you they call you that and you're like no!!  let's say your normal style start getting called KGurl,  you go out wear your normal everyday clothes and everyone looks at you and say are you trying to be a kgurl?... no bitch I'm myself...
How is no one taking about how it looks just like Jenna marbles’s house!!!
The wig looks amazing! Love the style and the color!!
Some genius posted this and I want it to gain more attention soo..  I need a “I dressed as an American Girl doll for a week” in my life  Credit for this idea- Allie Gies
Tyler did a good job on the wig!
Saf really pulling off Lavagirl vibes😂
Great video! Tyler did great with the wig! I wish you would have purchased the shoes with the lucite container soles. You could fill them with seasonal items! Lol! Glad you are posting again! Missed you...even though I'm probably old enough to be your Mom, still enjoy!
I would love to see a Tyler version!
Living for this middle part 🤩
Was there a Starkid Reference? Trail to Oregon?
I’m not vibing with the way they’re saying Oregon  Edit: for shoelaces that are too long wrap them loosely around your ankle and then tie it in a normal bow.
I'm sorry for saying that but...am i only one who was soooooo weird out by seeing safia with difrent hair colour than dark xD i mean maybe it was just the pink hair, you looked like totally difrent person.
Damn Safiya you look good in everything
I am OBSESSED with that second outfit
I reeeally like the wig 👍🏼
Honestly Saf really pulls off the pink outfit
Another great vidddd I think my favorite was the goth one but the first one was dope too the last one I think would have looked better with different pants like maybe a pastel blue or matching white?
It's just me or anyone else notice, Safiya more beautiful ans glowing everytime? 😍
Bro the only thing I could focus on when she was talking about the shop page was chaeyoung im-😭
The witch outfit was so on point, just marvelous !
When she showed Jenna & Julien.. that hit hard 😢
I loooooveeee the witch outfit!!! I'd wear it everyday lol
I think that her 3rd look was e girl mixed with soft girl
That second outfit. Wow. Just wow.
My entire insta app changed and now it has its own page and goth does to but notifications doesn’t, but this didn’t happen to any of my friends accounts, does anyone know why?
Did anyone else think of tana mongue when she was wearing the "egirl" outfit
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcEm10mA4hkb2KEb8nz8Utg
I started watching her videos again after not watching for a while and i forgot how much i enjoy watching her videos
I live in Williamsburg, lemme see if I can hook you up 👀
I don't have anything on may shop because I don't have instagram -age-16
Hey sayfia if you know Laurenzside or not you should just go over to her channel give her a congrats cause she's having a baby. Btw love ur channel
That wig did look good on you and I think pink hair suits you :)  I'm eager to check out the shop page now, but I'm really trying to buy as Australian as possible at the moment and Facebook/Instagram are very US-centric.
The blouse has such a baby doll vibes!!!!!! That with a pastel skirt!!!!🤌
I love that pink jacket
It's a shame those jeans didn't fit you overall because they made your booty look fantastic
#1 on trending! Nice Job Safiya!
2nd outfit was my fav 🖤
Love the pink wig😅. My tab is lame. Lots of jordans? and now that I watched this video catwomen costumes🤣🤣🤣
that witchy vibe gurrrl
This immediately went into a weird colonial direction but somehow I'm not surprised or upset 😂
Saf: Hello fellow kids LaurenZside has entered the chat
Why does the inside of your house look extremely similar to Jenna and Julien's house 😂😂
Can you donate the “e-gorl” jeans to me please 🙏
Imagine being this rich
I missed you! ❤️
I actually own a pair of the Aloha Ears Designs ears (Mulan version) and they are amazing! So detailed!
I am an Oregonian and cringed so hard at how you pronounced Oregon. It's not ore-gone. We haven't gone anywhere! As a lifelong American Girl fan, I appreciated the Josefina references. I love historical, vintage, and retro fashion so I looked more into Gathering of Goods.  Looks like it's part historical and part early 2000's Duggar fashion. There is a religious-inspired modesty tone to this seller.
You missed an opportunity to recreate a look from the craft! All you needed was a white crop top to go with the black skirt!
You could've tried putting the "flaps" of the suspenders through the loops to hide them in the skirt.
the last one gave me tumblr flashbacks lol
If someone asked me which are my favourite video topics that Safiya (and/with Tyler) are I was going to say this is one of my top ones...but then I started thinking about the other general topic/group of video content that she/they have done and honestly, I don't think I could come up with one I don't enjoy...even the asmr one - I HATE asmr...even ones that if another YouTuber made, I most likely wouldn't like it or even watch it - Jenna Marbles being the exception as I watched her nap and explained about all her plants (I have NO interest in plants at all...but c'mon, it's Jenna Marbles!  Man I miss her :( ) Sorry, but yeah, Safiya (and/with Tyler) videos are 100!
Your hair looks so good!
The off shoulder look with the “egirl” look actually works!
I actually am obsessed with the pink hair..
Did safiya and tyler move houses?  The place they're unboxing looks much larger than their condo
Such a shame that the jeans didn't fit, I thought they looked so good on Saf! :(
You.talk.like.this.
Safiya you look amazing in that wig! Mine look horrible.
I think the wig looks really nice! you cut the lace super well
Congrats on being #2 on trending
When she talked a bout josephina I got thrown into a pit of nastalgia
I feel like it’s e girl enough!!
The "witch" outfit looked the best and it really did suit you.
Where did you get that blouse from the 3rd outfit??? 😭
I live in Portland Oregon and I’d like to say they said it roung
I love how there’s a bit of kpop in this video :)
The fact that Saf's explore page is just filled with Twice and Blackpink!!!! Kpop stans be wildin'!!!
Yay #1 on trending!
Without the bonnet, the first outfit reminds me of the older sister's look in Newsies
with the new house i keep thinking yall broke into jenna and juliens house to film
Idk what it is but you seem very Mortisha Addams today like more than usual
0:36 Is she secretly a kpop stan?! We stan queens like twice, itzy and blackpink.
the second outfit *chef’s kiss*
I love how every time she uploads it goes right to the trending page!
Please tell me she paid for "Express Shipping" and received everything a few months later. Can't be a Saf Shopping video without that
That pink jacket looks really nice on you
I looooove the witch outfit !!! You looked so good in it !!!!
0:38 CHAEYOUNGIE CHAEYOUNGIE CHAEYOUNGIE CHAEYOUNGIE CHAEYOUNGIE ALERT ft nayeon in the corner
I loveeeee her with the pink wig 😍
I actually laughed out loud at “we think this girls either a witch, ...or a civil war re-enactor.” 💀
I really love the witch outfit on you. So cute!
So beautiful, ouch
Okay here me out. Safiya wearing a full week of clothes inspired by outfits that Kpop idols have worn. Instead of a Kpop makeover.
but WHEREEE did you get those floral white masks I must know🥺😍
The mispronunciation of Oregon triggers me
I really think that when Safiya is doing all these outfits, that Tyler should dress up with her. Especially in the Colonial Williamsburg outfit. That would have been amazing
I didn’t even know the tag was there - so I will definitely check it out now!
I need an “among us” video 😫❤️
I want  the shoes  with  the sweets. I am new to Instagram  so I had no idea.
I love the pink hair! It works well with your features! If you were wearing less pink it would be more palatable haha
did the say ore-gon not Oregon on purpose? Please tell me it was on purpose😂 I love these two
loved the one Jedi robe that kept popping up
I love your videos so so so so much
Did I see twice 👀
I feel like the pastel look works really well without the wig. It just seems like too vibrant of a color that it's not really adding anything. Everything else is like just delicate enough
God I love your humour and that´s not cool man
i love the twice on her explore page sjsjs
safiya with middle part looks so good reminds me of mortricia from adams family
that living room looks so much like jenna im :(
Webster wigs looks drop shipped. Same thing with unzii and other stores. Those wigs are available on taobao or Aliexpress.
That mask you wore with the colonial outfit is gorgeous 💕
YALL STAN TWICE, CHAEYOUNG BEST GIRL
yo is she in jenna marbles’ house?!?
not @ saf with twice on her feed. as she should.
Quick Question ! Who is The Most Noble Existence You Know ? Is it Instagram ? For Me it’s God & Mohammad ! IM RIGHT 😁
Every time  Saf references a movie, I feel like I haven't watched anything compared to her! Wow!
The pink wig works for you girl! Just maybe not with the outfit 😂😂😂 the last outfit could work as separates but was a LOT to take in together lol
Love the moon shoes. Can you link them?
I think the end of the straps on the witchy skirt were supposed to be tucked through the metal rings into the skirt. That would help with the nipple tassel vibe 😂
Can we talk about her being the third d’amelio sister with that makeup and wig. The resemblance is uncanny.
ONCE HEREEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Saf pluck that wig!!!! lol
Also the middle part long hair looks so good on Safiya!  Giving me Morticia Addams vibe 🕷🖤
Wrap the laces around your ankles Saf!
This video made me smile!! And you look so good!!!
I feel like the pink wig and jacket would look great on her with all black for the rest.
I would love to see the pink wig with the second look! That would be so good!!!
First of all, I didn't know Instagram shopping was a thing because I apparently live in an alternate universe. (I'm a middle school teacher and constantly reminded of the fact that I know very little) 🤷‍♀️ Second, you're hilarious!  Thanks for sharing another video.  Have a lovely weekend. 👍😬
It would be cool if she did a video exploring the different alternative subcultures (tradgoth, scene, punk) or maybe just gothic subcultures! I noticed she really likes the color black and idk it could be cool !
Tyler was wearing the mask from the first outfit
Congragulations on #1 on trending!
I absolutely loved the pink wig on you. It looks so cute!
Greetings from Germany! I really love your videos, they're always so much fun to watch. Also that black velvety skirt was sooo pretty!
Safiya is a once
The second outfit looks absolutely amazing omg
Omg I’m the Shego look in this video!!!!
That pink looks so good on her
Safiya has officially taught me more about history than all my school history lessons combined. I love that for me.
Jesus is coming!!! Turn ur ways and follow him and not these fake idols
https://youtu.be/NWVtcdy2vu4     😗😗😗😗😗
Saf; sees pink and hearts:  *is this egirl???* 🤔📖🦋
the intro reminded me doofensmiths evil incoperated  song from phineas and ferb
Where did you get the alien phone case?
In 8th grade we had a project in Social Studies, so we got to stay in colonial Williamsburg! It was so coooool
Ron stawpppp!
safiya: minga london simplynailogical ben: RIMMEL LONDON
This video was so engaging. I like that you tried things that were outside your usual style as well as featuring a few interesting things closer to what you might wear. I was feeling pretty grumpy, and now I feel a lot better about life, so thanks for that!
dwayne and jasmine
Yay!!! I was literally just wondering when the next video was coming!
I know she's talking about the American Girl doll, but it did startle me a little to hear Safiya say my name.
I want that whole witch outfit
It's my birthday tomorrow (8 November ) can safiya say happy birthday
I mean Sophia shop tabs basically Sylvia summed up She likes throw back stuff she likes Gothic and Bat stuff but there are some randomness
Safiya doesn’t post often but when she does we are blessed with at least a full half hour of great content ! 😊
I see those AD Bernadette oxfords in there! Huzzah for costube! 3:58
I kinda wanna see the velvet skirt with the pink crop jacket... might be a moment.
Performing a one-woman Macbeth is an absolute mood.
The pink wig with that makeup on you looks sooo good, I love it!
Me getting vietnam flashbacks when you mention the oregon trail. Not only from playing and losing the game but from starkid and the fact that 2020 was the year I was supposed to follow the oregon trail  with other children from my church (which of course was shut down, im so happy)
I feel like the pink jacket and wig look would have gone better with black boots
I would love to see the last one with no wig, but overall you did look great in all 3!
Try grunge
I really wish safiya would have tied a Half bun on the pink wig 🤷‍♀️🙄
Nobody: aye
Who else wanted that second outfit but when going on the website realized she spent over $215? Nevermindddddddd
Whoaaa I'm singing double trouble for choir
I’ve been bombarded by Minda London as well
You should see this tab on Tyler’s phone
Lowkey cosplaying as doja cat
It would’ve been awesome if she styled the wig!! So much potential 👍🏼
twice in her explore page, QUEEN!
Move to Virginia! I'm in Winchester! ;)
I love the second outfit!!!!
"e-girl? is that what e-girl is? no it's different right? is this e-girl?"  😂same girl. I can't keep up with all these
The step "Churning" is originally Malika Sherawat's step in Jalebi Bai
Saucy wench is my personal favorite
How can you miss this beautiful melody https://youtu.be/tqBTGJ3FXRE
Is no One going to talk about Safiya’s Explorer page being peeked with Kpop fancams? I stan
...and now I’m following enchanted bikinis .....
the last outfit is cute maybe not the jacket if it was just the tank and jeans and like a cute lil pink purse
am I the only one who notice Chaeyoung and Nayeon at 0:41?
I’m definitely going to check out my shop tab after this, sounds intriguing!
tyler is onto something w that whole "control the memes of production" thing... definitely a lot more fun seeing small businesses do it tho as opposed to big corporations.
When will we get a house tour cause it looks so cool
Safiya your the best youtuber out there informational amusing comedy and a dash of Shakespeare 😂 I literally check your channel every minute to see if there is a new video, hope your doing better😍😂
honestly saf I love this pink hair on you!
My instagram shop tab has only 13 posts on it
#1 on trending  YASS
omg yesss
I used to work at colonial Williamsburg but now I just live in Williamsburg. My elementary school was basically in colonial Williamsburg.
Sponsor? I don't remember Saf ever doing a sponsor.
HOPE ❤️ Salvation is found in no one else, no other name under heaven given among men where by we must be saved. Saved from the punishment of sin. I’m trying to offer people Hope in absolute perfection !!! No more dying, lies, decay, depression, anxiety, crying, sickness, rotten food, broken things , etc... offering the Hope of Eternity in heaven with Jesus Christ. We must be willing to turn from sin to receive Jesus forgiveness. And to know and live out his teachings. He who does the will of God abides for eternity 1 John 2:17  nkjv
The pink wig with the 'witch' outfit would be a whole vibe
I know you read a lot of comments like this but I would really like you to take 1 minute to watch my beats, it would really make my day, take care of yourself;)
Out of curiosity I checked to see what Instagram was listing for me. And I am pleased to say that every shop was an ethical/sustainable shop 💃
I actually lined the pink jacket on you.
Tbh I would have tucked the last of the belt into the circle bits on your skirt-alls
Could have thrown in a little collab with Mykie from Glam and Gore for the wig part.
Safiya's explore page has kpop in it omg I'm so proud 🤧🥰🤧🥰
I mean, I don't work at Colonial Williamsburg but I live 20 minutes away so.....  Seriously though, definitely come do a video here!
I hope she wore that first outfit for Halloween
The TWICE fancams 🤣🤣
3:16 Is no one gonna talk about that wallpaper!? It’s so beautiful
I actually thought u looked bomb in that 3rd outfit ngl
reply if you live in virginia
Does anyone else notice how similar her back ground is to Jenna marbles when she’s opening the stuff?
Omg you are gorgeous!
The pink wig really looked good on you.
Safiya's voice would be great for a smartphone assistant
Doesn't it look like Jenna Marble's living room??
She shoulda showed us the brown skirt and apron outfit as well!!!!!!
Ok can we just appreciate Safiya’s wallpaper-  (Sry if I copied anyone’s comment)
The last look is V E R Y steph0sims and it’s freaking adorable
Are you gonna do a house tour? ♥️
Hi random person scrolling in the comments i hope you're doing well and always remember you're beautiful and someday you'll be who you've always wanted to be bye
Throughout the whole video the only thing I was thinking was Nafiya has TWICE recommendations in the explore page 🥰💜😌💜🥰 ******Laugh's evily in ONCE*****
me being an envious short person... you look good in literally anything you put on
Can u vlog a bit more because I wait so long for ur videos
the way non oregonians say oregon lmfao
I love those moon boots, and the pastel mask!
Anyone getting Jenna marbles vibes from their house
I'm so jealous of her confidence 😭
Biden won the election
Oh no, you said Oregon wrong😂🤭
This was a fun video :) You look good in all three outfits but I am weirdly mesmerized by your pink hair/jacket combo. You are pulling them off, for sure! Also, Rogue + Wolf is awesome, I get all of my witchy phone cases from them... this is making me want to go buy those boots
Yeees #1 on trending!!!
I missed this intro sooooo much
I live in Virginia! You should definitely come visit!! 💙💙
I love the second outfit :O Sooo pretty on you! Love you, have a great day!
#1 on trending let's GOOOO
Tyler need credit!!! The wig looks great!!!
make a indian outfit video
Really wish I could pull off that witch outfit 😩
So we’re not gonna talk about her wallpaper 🤣🤣🤣
tell me who else can get ab 1m views in 13 hours after being gone for a month... this is why she’s goated.
Saf, I love you and Tyler but... Oregon is pronounced the same as Organ 💕 also hello from Oregon
5:01 I see that trans flag pin 😌 trans rights babyyyyy
This is #2 trending, make it #1. This is the kind of distraction we need in this era of chaos
i want those shoes
I love the “Rahnnnn” and then Tyler going “we got some grenades over here”
Is this Jenna Marbles house?
it’s always a good day when saf uploads 💛
I’m fully convinced Safiya and Tyler, and Jenna and Julien all live in the same-ish neighborhood
That colonial outfit is my favorite look ✨🌈✨
I had a friend in High School who had red hair and really thick black eyebrows, so seeing Safiya with pink hair and black eyebrows makes my brain go "She is... Persian"
Saf looks good in the goth outfit
I love that Saf can disappear for a month, then come back and be 1 on trending,  That’s an icon right there 👏👏
Ive been waiting for ever I wish you made more videos
You are good!! I thought it was e girl too!!!
you look so pretty <3
Who’s here after Biden won ?!
Girl just tuck the ends of the suspenders through the circle and in to the shirt so you dont have the flaps
Honestly, I think that shade of pink hair looks great on Saf. She's all glowy!
lmao safiya's explore page full of girl groups
Hearing “power puff girls” after Sarah Z’s TJLC video is sending me
This video was waaaaayyyyyy to freaking long
safiya putting together a 00 baddie shirt with some art hoe pants soft girl jacket and calling it an egirl look was inspiring i wanna be this out of touch with kids on tiktok right now please
Why does it look like you live in Jenna Marbles' house 😂
I think the pink looks good on you
Okay but my instagram shop tab is instead of your notifications tab. So you have your timeline, reels, post picture, shop and your account. Like who wants that
I love how you went for the upmarket pricey goth brands in the second outfit lol
twice being on the top of your explore page tho..... STAN TWICE
The colonial outfit would fit right in in Pennsylvania. There’s a lot of mennonites and Amish here.
Reminds me of Jenna marbles house
I actually really like the goth outfit on safiya it’s so cute
Safiya thank you for another incredible video! You looked amazing in all of those looks! I actually really liked the bonnet on you! Not many people could pull it off but you certainly did! My favourite look was the second one, but that’s probably because it fits so well with your natural and spooky aesthetic that I enjoy so much (and live vicariously through you as I can not pull it off haha). Thank you again and I look forward to your next video! 🖤  Now brb gonna go check out the shop tab on my Instagram >.>
The 2nd look needed a witch hat!!
As someone who is from Oregon, why do you pronounce Oregon like that?
The witchy outfit is my fav💀💀💀
Awesome video
Did anyone else notice that on gathering of goods page they had a PICTURE of a Josefina doll O.o
Ur bac
Safiya, I always look forward to your videos!
The intro song haha i love it
I really like the pastel look on her. I think the jeans are fitting the way they’re “supposed to” and its a vibe.
the real question is did you buy the masks from the instagram shop section
i think that the shoelaces are supposed to give some loops around your ankles, but I'm not sure
0:36 NAYEON AND TWICE LAOHEAOWPOHW
The butterchurn wench outfit sans bonnet was giving me big Delores from Westworld vibes
3:15 Let's just aprecciate her phone background for a second.
Actually you look like miss Adams in that video, in a good way!
I may be 51 but i still watch totally spies, i must confess i have them on DVD, but i also watch them on YouTube.
I love Tylers 'Nevermind' it had such a tone of I cant win with her with this shit 😂
This video was planned in MARCH?! I'm floored
Omg Saf, for the new year, can you take all prior internet outfits, and make Franken outfits?! You know.  Mix and match
*FIRE🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥* _https://youtu.be/vFcQ4lgC62o_
I am here
Where are her masks from?
I love you in pink hair 🥺
When she said "Sisters tonight we fly" she actually sound like them
Safiya should do a e-girl and e-boy makeover for her and tyler for a week
You looked so pretty in each look. 😍
was at 26:52 when i discovered biden won, the witch outfit manifested it
Ok but people shouldn’t be yelling at people on the street for how they are dressed... Just kinda messed up cause people do still dress that way - and that people think they should yell at or cat call them is a little backwards
Saf you posted while I was sleeping. Anyways, I think you look freaking adorable in the last outfit. what you created is actually in the soft girl aesthetic and i think you look really adorable, though it might have something to do with all the stars and hearts. honestly i love the items together, and the makeup, its just the pink hair directly atop the pink jacket doesn't provide enough contrast. If you had your hair down instead of the wig i think you might have enjoyed the color scheme a bit more.
the pink outfit is a power move for me
damn it Safiya! you got me stuck on a new shopping addiction xD
Honestly the e-girl look is an e-girl look, just a softer more Korean e-girl look. It had more of a pastel goth thing going on.
Good to see you again!
Peachywix is a scam! All shien clothes.
I think the wig looks really good on! Such great video :)
I actually loved the last outfit on you a lot, baggier jeans would have been way better, maybe cargo style 🤔 The pink hair is a bomb ass look imo. The natural eyebrows is a nice contrast.
When you're not wearing the bonnet just the outfit you look like your Amish
It never ceases to amaze me how much I fucking adore you in all your goofy smug glory saafiya :) I hope you were able to read this and share a secret little smile with me you absolute ray of sunshine 🖤
Does anyone know the brand of mask she’s using?
They Do! They Really Do! Lol loved this part 😂
I know you were joking about smashing all your mugs, but a kintsugi video might be fun?
My Instagram shop is so disappointing ….It makes me look like a 40 year old youtuber mom during autumn season.... I was hoping more for idk anything that isn't that...
You look in all 3 awesome but especially in look 2
You look happy and healthy. I like that
I love all her videos! They always make me happy. I also feel like, if she hasn't already, she may enjoy The Oregon Trail! By the StarKids!
I think the wig looks great! So props to Tyler! 😁
why you never post anymore
looooove each outfit, but the insta-morticia is my fave. and yes living for those shoes!
Smashed that like button for controlling the MEMES of production
My cottage core vibes are going OFF on the first outfit! Love it!
Safiya's phone wallpaper is just amazing omg
She comes and not even half a day later makes it to the trending tab. Only Saf. ❤
I actually adore the pink wig on Saf. 😍
don't forget to sMaShH that like button
safiya: NOPE NTO READY IM RUNNIGN AWAY *she runs away from her phone*
Her house looks really similar to Jenna and Julians
That cropped tank looks like children’s underwear turned into a shirt.
I think the last outfit would look really good without the wig
Not e-girl but DEFINITELY PeachPrc
insta: ohhh she posted weding pics lets suggest she get baby stuff
Why does she talk like that
I love your flower shirt
The way you say Oregon hurts my soul
I love the pink wig and jacket!
i live in southwest virginia and i have friends that reenact civil war battles i can confirm those colonial looking dresses do look like civil war women
You need to talk to Abby Cox, historical dress/costume youtuber, to go to Colonial Williamsburg.
....Did Safiya and Tyler move in with Jenna and Julien??? Their houses look nearly identical 😂😂
*when she finally posted- EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE*     but you are late      *Whaaaa*
Already loved the video, but Tyler's "memes of production" joke really pushed it to be one of my favorites, well done sir
GURL CONGRATS UR NUMBER 1 TRENDING!!
If the suspenders aren’t necessary for holding up the skirt it could be cute with them just hanging down on the sides bucked or unbuckled
You should use the pink jacket to do a pastel goth look! <3
Wait...the shop tab has been there for at least a year..
If Safiya can get catcalled in a milkmaid outfit with her boyfriend there, we need to stop saying that women are asking for it and it was because of what they wore. Just sayin'.
I love these videos saf!!! But pls be careful of where you buy so you don’t support brands that rip off of creators! <3
I am not joking when I say that my whole explore page is about books
The pink outfit gives off very pinky pie from mlp if she was human and an Insta baddie
Congrats on trending Safiya :D
Tbh Safiya's new house looks like it has the same-ish features as Jenna Marbles house
Good job on getting number 1 on trending!!
I need those Rogie Wolf shoes, I need it
i miss u
https://youtu.be/ch_dj4fKiXE
I know the “egirl” look wasnt her fav but it was DEFINITELY mine!! I want that whole ensemble (sans the necklace/top)
I think she should have put the brown skirt underneath The floral skirt, it would have poked out the bottom and would have matched her belt. Also would have given the skirt extra layers. Looked good though!
The hairline of the wig looks weird! I don't know if it's the color or the way the hair lies but it looks very strange...
The way the algorithm works is that as you purchase stuff it learns your preferences, adds that data to the data from third party cookies and the AI adjusts your preferences till it has honed into who you are as a person. So while it seems to be a bit off now, in a year or so, it should be able to know you better and suggest products closer to what you like.
Good job Tyler the wig actually looks pretty good, there are like no lumps and looks overall pretty good
I love that witch outfit sm wow
I thought you looked great in the second outfit!
Needed this! We miss you
Me seeing some baby stuff on her shop tab after watching LaurenZside's most recent video: SAF!!!!???
Saf gurl! Your trending! Your #2, congrats! 🥳 I love all the outfits but I mostly loved outfit #1 & #2. Outfit #3 was okay. 🦇
Mc fucking yes siiiirrrrrr
Can we congratulate Safiya for being #1 on trending?!❤️❤️
GIRL YOU LOOKED SO GOOD IN THE GOTH LOOK 😍😍
She looks good in EVERYTHING 😭🥰
Does anyone know where Safiya got any of the masks in this video? I love them ALL so much
*FIRE🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥* _https://youtu.be/vFcQ4lgC62o_
safiya, it's a franken...stein...
I believe that the last look she went for is called pastel goth
"it's sabbath Night fever" 😂
Interestingly, my shop tab is organised by brands. There's no individual post on it
House tour?
I need those Shoes
the twice video in the beginning WHERE MY ONCES @ LMAOOO
You bet that I’m waiting for the franken mug video 😂
My shop tab is all Halloween costumes and Build-A-Bear :/ I swear I'm an adult, Instagram algorithm
I was crying then I sew that Safiya video, thank you
I want to see them play Oregon trail.... very badly.
Chicos saludos chicos llequeeee
Saf in the jeans from the back: turn aroooooooound  Saf in the jeans from the front: turn yo ass back aroooooooound
I may be totally off but the pink wig and the dark eyebrows makes her look like Lily Collins to me. Especially with the mask covering everything but the eyes.
Somebody educate Safya on the different aesthetic pls
"You're Married ---> Show baby stuff" is real and I hate it. I DON'T HAVE A CHILD, INTERNET. I WILL NOT BE HAVING ONE. PLEASE GO BACK TO SHOWING ME (NON-MATERNITY) CLOTHES.
I love the 30:40 outfit on her
I really want to see the Colonal Williamsburg blouse with the overall skirt!
You could thread the strap flaps though the rings to avoid the tassel look
I love that occasionally the other intro song pops up
"Controlling the MEMEs of production" is an underrated pun.
I need the dark outfit, it is perfect #NewAgeWitches
safiyaaaaaaa i love youuuuu thanks for uploading
#2 on trending gg!!!
girl!! I loved the pink outfit so much haaahahah, i really think colours go really well, but it is deffinetly not your kind of style at all. Even though, you rocked it!! I love this kind of videos!! I can´t wait for your next one
I love the second outfit so much Saf! You look 🔥
Who wants to see her follow Dwight’s makeup tutorial ~<3~
My friends shop was in this video lmao dhehdj
Why the hell is this number 1 trending with such a ridicule amount of views?! Who even watches that shit? What’s wrong with youtube nowadays...
OH MY GOSH THE ROSE BLOUSE IN THE BEGINNING IS SO CUTE. Where did you get it safiya
You in these goth things are just jaw-drop-gorgeous 😍
Does anyone else just really want a Colleen and Safyia collaab?
today is going to be such a good day, biden is now going to be elected and safiya posted a video.
I AM DYING FOR THAT WITCHY OUTFIT!
lol spoiled...angel...daddyslittlegurl!
Last outfit could’ve worked Lose the jacket, trade the wig for pigtails and the jeans should’ve been low rise or something
Diet Goth!!!
Also honestly omg I love that second outfit so much! 🦇 🖤
I need that pastel galaxy mask, anyone know where it’s from?!
I can't help it. I know I am going to rewatch this video several times, because Safiya's three looks are just genius and the videos are so fun with all the quirky references. Safiya is soooo pretty. In all of the three looks. <3
Anyone else getting Lady Gaga vibes with the pink wig?!
8:52 *Abby Cox has entered the chat*
I really like the wig
I am loving your longer hair😍
i don't really follow "humans" per se on the platform so this branch is really interesting to see what it is advertising to me. To be honest, there's not really much that i want to buy and i prefer it that way :) PLUS i don't post any picture of myself or geotag my photos so there's that.
....what ugly clothes.
Having looked up the source of her "Colonial Williamsburg" look, they are going to be *horrified* to be featured in this video. If you want to shop for historical clothing, you do want to take a moment to check for anti-feminist Christian Dominionists! There's often a "who are we" page in the store that can be very enlightening.
I think the pink wig looks good on you, it just clashes with the not-quite-the-same-pink jacket.
please dont swaer so much
I downloaded honey and it straight up shut down my new Mac book. Wtf. Like I’m extremely pissed. Had this happed to anyone else.
Hello! I wanted to let everyone know that the wig she bought was from Webster wigs which is a good quality wig company if anyone wanted to buy them!
1 on trending. yay.
Wait but I love how safiya’s explore page is kpop related! A cultured queen 🥰
The whole layout of my insta has changed, making the shop tap a full button replacing where my likes/interaction are
*LOL this intro is the highlight of this year!!!!*
this is the video i was watching when i found out joe biden was elected the 46th president of the united states
i must say, e-girls hardly exist past may 2019
Just go to colonial Williamsburg
Looks good Tyler!
Watch Baby Step Records Video Freedom Of Speech
Lol why does it look like Safiya is filming in Jenna's house?
A.) MORE of Safiya playing with Wigs. If you need some good brand names. 1-800 Wig Takeout, Arda Wigs, & Wigs By Vanity are amazing.   B.) I need those Celestial Boots. I’m a size 10.5 in US Men’s. Do we know how big I’d have to go to squeeze my Dragon Talons into those?   C.) Great job as always guys. I’m definitely gonna be checking out the Instagram Shop Tab to see what they recommend for me.   See ya next time 🖤🎃
idk why i felt compelled to say but my great grandma babysat the allman brothers
This house reminds me of Jenna Marbles and Julien Solomita's house
#2 TRENDING QUEEN
WAIT SAFIYA , you new house looks SO much like Jennas!!!
I really feel the 'never wear pink'. My favorite color is plum. I just got a light pink tank top and a plum flannel popover with pink stripes and I felt so girly.  I don't look bad in pink, I don't avoid it, I don't have any. I do prefer light pink though and I hate a wardrobe that stains easy because I am the spill master.
The wig looked fantastic!!! Grats to Tyler!!
I didn't realize how much missed the "Internet Made me Buy it" intro song until now
your #1 on trending safiya!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wait Wait Wait... do you live in Jenna Marble’s house???
“Goth Milk” well theres no pun there! 😂
Biden won the election and this is number one on trending?  America needs to get it's act together.  Hopefully now it will.
Idk if it's the quarantine or what.. but I REEEAALLY liked the ""e-girl"" outfit.
The pink wig looks really good on you Safiya <3
Saf.......its been there for a year😂
#1 trending in Canada! 😊😍👏
Saf.......its been there for a year😂
sis, just tuck the “nipple tassels” into the circle part and into the skirt 😂😂😂
It's so entertaining, thank you Saf. Also dig that first outfit!
Herbal medicine has proven to me that natural herbs and roots are blessing from God because my progressive COPD was cure with a herbal medicine from Dr Madida I come across on YouTube.
The try on haul queen has regained the throne 👸
The black looks so pretty on you
I went to the Orengene trail before
I think the pastel look is cute, it's the hair that pushes it over the line to too much.
Can you guys help me reach 1k subscribers by the end of the year, I know we can do it!
She's a kpop stan :0 she has a rosé fancam :0 . I didn't know I could be more in love with this channel
It’s soft girl
I love that you bought matching masks and actually wear them all the time outside. I’m sick of influencers acting like nothing’s happening and going out without masks for the sake of the looks.   Also I love the video, I need those moon shoes.
you waited until june to unbox but posted in november???
10:10 there are companies that literally make tech to scan clothing from social media pics and match with real world items, Curalate is a big one.  The more you know ....
i miss your short hair 😫.
Hi everyone  since your favorite  Joe Biden won, can everyone  follow me (Chef Nicole) as a celebration 🍾?
very excited as a London girl to see Minga pop up! (not that you would know put its pronounced ming-aah, it used to be a chavvy insult we would all call each other lol)
Hi everyone  since your favorite  Joe Biden won, can everyone  follow me (Chef Nicole) as a celebration 🍾?
I love how Saf incorporated the masks, would love a mask fashion video!
She's so "not like other girls" it's obnoxious
This literally looks like Jenna & Juliens house 😯
Ohh the second outfit suits her sooooooooooo good
That settles it. Safiya is a closet Bernadette Banner fan.
Keep the pink jacket and pink wig, they both look great. Those jeans let you down, but the pink didn’t.
I think you should do the white prairie shirt, pink jacket and dress overalls as a look.
So glad to see you back and you seem happy 😊 I’m hoping all is well with you and Tyler and that the funk you were going through is better & you are still overcoming it :)
In my app the shop tab is completely separate and is where the explore page was
I feel like she was so goofy and confident in this video and I LOVE IT!! She just seems so happy! I hope she is! <3
i’m excited about the potential franken-mug video haha😂
mug haul mug haul mug haul
Hocus pocus? SisTeR ToNIghT we fly
OMG WITHE THE BONNET OF, THE FIRST OUTFIT MAKES HER LOOK LIKE SNOW-WHITE 😍
I looked at my shop section on Instagram and I felt offended, ig thinks I'm a craft mystical gay, and I'm just a bubbly gay
Try tucking the extra bits on the straps behind the rings, would look better
this long hair is everything on you. so gorgeous!! I am so nervous you are gonna go chop it all off but hopefully you keep it because it’s BEAUTIFUL. can you tell I am in love with your hair? 💕
Saf put the extra flap in the rings! That will hrlp the skirt!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNpeqYAKozg
You look like a grown up version of the Lazy Twon girl 😂
I live in Williamsburg. I’ll get you the hook up in CW!
upset that you didn't said cherubum 😩💔
OMG COULD THIS MEAN SAFIYA IS A FELLOW ONCE?
Yea on the skirt overall thing the zipper is probably supposed to go In The front cause I’ve seen that before
Okay those power puff girls pants.... I need them...
Lady Gaga - Live Stream - She Cried In Her Live Session - 07.10.2020 Click on the link below to watch  👇👇👇👇 https://youtu.be/IKFVQ7mvzWQ
OMG number 1 on trending YAYAYAYAYAYYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAY!!!!!!
I don't do shit on insta but follow various YouTubers, cosplayers, authors, East Asian music artists, and art-artists. Can't wait to see what it recommends me.
It’s not e girl it’s soft girl
+Hoping we could get a full video of    Safiya transforming into a full E-girl+
I just wanna know how her skin looks so bouncy during that unboxing. Drop that skincare routine
I love that Saf is also a kpop stan 😂
Our explore pages are  much different.   Mine is just mostly half naked dads.  I've never felt so seen.
How could those lace up boots even be remotely considered Edwardian? THEY DONT EVEN HAVE GIBSON HEELS
H I I love you so much
My husband’s aunt used to work at Colonial Williamsburg until fairly recently. 💁🏻‍♀️
I smell a new K-Pop fan 👀👀👀👀
oh we saw TWICE on ur explore page 😍
I kinda love the 3rd one…
I knew yesterday how she got her intro 😂😂❤️love u saf iam a girl btw
SAFIYA FINALLY U POST OH MY GOSHHHHHHHH
The third cutesy style would be described by most people I know as “soft girl” rather than “e-girl”
Aah yes finally some good Hecking YouTube
If you like the pastels, look into harajuku fashions! I prefer fairy kei fashion because its just a ton of sweet sugary colors and accessories!
Your witch outfit is SO FLIPPING CUTE
why is Safiya’s explore page full of Twice??
the fashion with soft colors and all that is soft girl aesthetic fashion, not e-girl xdxd
The second outfit looks so gorgeous on you!!!!
11:35 saf's wallpaper!!! Is it tyler?
I love everything about this video in general. Keep up the good work.  Safiya's voice is so nice. She has vocabulary and good diction, which I appreciate greatly.
Not a fan of the dad jeans but literally everything else I think you rocked
You killed every look though! You are so pretty I feel like you can pull off everything. I love these types of videos so much. Excuse me while I go shop for trendy witch attire.
Make a video where you shop from Small businesses
YESSSSS A NEW VIDEO YALLLLL WEEE NEEED MORRRE😫🤧
11:42
can Safiya do a house tour?
Please come to Williamsburg! Lol I live here and so amazing!
It just struck me that she looks so much like Cobie Smulders 😳😳😳
If you're a guy watching this you a S I M P
Lol she was calling the soft girl look e girls
You need to check out Abby Cox.  She's a former employee of Colonial Williamsburg who has a bitchin' youtube channel.
You look exactly like Corinne at 25:15
Please tell me that was a joke pronunciation of Oregon 😭😂
👨‍👨‍👦‍👦看不懂英文
Is it just me or does Safiya's house look a lot like Jenna Marbles' house? 🤣
AAAAH I see the Bernadette American Duchess shoes!
E girl/boys and goth are the same thing but with generation gap.
Mom: why didn’t you do your homework? Me: I was feeling a little too restrained cranially
I love the moon shoes , I wish I had them when I was in high school with my goth vibe
Holy crap safiya you made it on trending!?!? 🥰🥰🥰
Good to hear from you my friend. Thanks for sharing.
The wig looks good
Dude that hearted pink jacket— I LOVE IT SO FRIGGIN MUCHHHH
I love you being sponsored by honey because honey is amazing lol an actually useful app
Meh
Biden won!!💙💙💙
Why does it look like she’s in Jenna Marbles house? 😂 I’m sure they just have very similar houses.
Tyler did a good job!!! Such a good husband 💖
Do any men watch this stuff?
I was about to say you have good taste because of your ig but then you said lele 🤢
YAYYYY
About the ‘sneaky brand’ there are lots like that on ig and most of them resell intems from aliexpress and such for a much higher price,
I admire how you can just quote Macbeth off the top of your head.
Minga London is literally clothes from AliExpress.
Damn girl its November now lol
A mug video would be very good
I don't understand how Safiya can look so amazing in all those different styles.. She is so beautiful.
Me who lives in Virginia 👁👄👁
Why does she look so good at 33:09
honestly the last outfit would look better without the wig and jacket
"Do they? They do, they really do!" Adorbs
I really wanted to see the last look without the wig :)
I really thought outfit #2 looked really good on her and the 3rd outfit is something I would personally wear 😍😍
The e girl you think of Safiya is soft e girl.
I love the second outfit 😍
Love this video!!!!!! 😍
BIDEN WON!!!!!!
So I was watching this and heard about honey and completely lost my mind going thru honey and completely forgot I was watching this video that was last night and this morning I’m back lol
Sooo...like, 20-25 years ago (I'm currently 42), I thought I was quite edgy when I'd tell people, I'm/She's "the sweetest bitch you'll ever _eat_" and I've never watched Jersey Shore. Ergo, I suspect that JS girl popularized the phrase, but by no means invented it. Heh heh.
You should make a video buying outfits on Depop!
*when you see the moon in witch*
watching this right after watching LaurenZSides pregnancy announcement: 👁👄👁
so.. we not talking about the Frankin-mug or what
So glad someone else thought this was e girl too now i have no idea hahha
"I Feel Like A Saucy Wench" 😂 😂 YES!!! I love you Safiya you're amazing
Guys, Oregon is not pronounced Or-i-gone 🤦🏽‍♀️ it’s Or-a-gun.
Another video! Yes😍
I am so lucky within 24 hours all my favourite youtubers posted Safiya Nygaard, Laurenzside, Noraverse and Moriah Elizabeth!!!
The trendy look with the goth skirt thing would've been perfect!
Jenna marbles house?...
When she talked about Jersey Shore I felt that...
I would love to have that wig if you what to send me, just saying jdjdghdhdjd
You should make a video about how you'd style the pieces in your everyday life.
As a cosplayer, when you tapped on that wig I literally screamed YESSSSSSSSS
Killed her husband ZAPPED him 😂
That's not Cololonial Williams Burg or really 18th century America, but A+ for enthusiasm and effort!
the way you pronounce oregon makes me upset lmao as a resident you know how to pronounce it but i guess others dont know how to
me simping for sad in outfit 3: ❤️👄❤️🥀
Why is she in jenna marbles house?
You have number 2 on trending congrats!!
Is it me or your living room looks a A LOT like Jenna Marbles's? LOL
I thought you pulled off all the outfits! I thought the wig looked pretty good!
The pink wig looks amazing on you!
Churn that butter, Safiya!
Saf’s a ONCE it’s official
2nd on trending in my country!
Outfit 3 is totally a 90s magical girl anime protagonist. It's actually not bad. Also the wig looks super cool and the dark eyebrows kind of work with it. I'd definitely love to see the pink wig with your diet goth style.
TWICE on her explore page tho omgee
wait why didn’t you just tuck the excess “flappage” from the tassels on the skirt thing???
you looked SO bomb in that witch outfit omg
BIDEN WON
you aint slick sliding twice in there like that, sis lmao stan twice and gfriend yall
Me when she was shopping: soph I swear to got if you don't get those goth Fanny packs...
This was so fun!! The IG shop tab always looks so shady to me haha
At 23:55 I thought she was in jenna marbles house
3:20 !!! That’s not just kpop that is TWICE, do you hear that that’s all my fellow Once’s screaming
You ordered it on March 7th my birthday and your just getting it now? Wow
I can definitely relate to safiya’s explore page being full of Kpop videos, mine is too
looking gorgeous!
Bruh you walk around with that first outfit in PA and everyone would just be like “oh yea a Mennonite”
Your Instagram doesn't really have great taste
a) 👍👍Tyler on that wig application  b) Saf you could totally rock that wig again with one of your everyday outfits
Minga london is one of my favorite brands !
Video starts at 19:00
i think destroying all the mugs and put back together to create a new goth-ish collection of mugs is a great idea lol i would watch that lol
saf finding y2k  saf: is this egirl
0:37 safiya’s explore page being full of blackpink, twice, itzy and other groups. honestly stan
21:24 Crap just went from 0 to Donner Family real heckin quick
You look so cute with the pink hairr ah😂❤️❤️❤️
I'd really prefer if u did more research about these fashions as this is stuff I usually wear (the second one) and I also dress Egirl and u just butchering the fashion is just no run to watch
Confirmed Safiya is a Boss Witch and an Insta-Batty
I live in VA and have yet to go to Colonial Williamsburg 😭😭
Hey Safiya! I noticed you had the Hush app and I’m so sad to say that Hush and Bad Habit went out of business in 2019 I think. They say they’re coming back but they aren’t it’s not happening. If you could do a video on that would be so freaking awesome because they’ve left us with ZERO information!
lol 0:38
Lord u thinking the second outfit is ...alot and over the top is insane...that's so basic
I wish I could wear all the necklaces that I saw in this video but I'm allergic to the metal in the necklaces
I love the wig but outfit two was best!
I really enjoy your videos please be consistent 🥲🥺
The wig looks so good on saf  Like it contrasts so good with her skin tone  And you did a good job applying it  Lace front are hard .
The totally spies show was just pulled from the memories I didn’t realize I had
I just realized that safiya lowkey sounds like Perd from Parks and Rec
Pls die your hair😭👀🙊🌺 it is so cuteeee
the bonnet is so expensive wth
37:24 friggin love Safiya's reaction 😂
I’m surprised you are even aware of the 1970’s prairie dress fashion!  It was short lived fad style.
can i take this moment to say that their shopping tab is the most annoying thing ever. why would they replace the notification button with something no one uses 😭 i have never met anyone who actually bought something off of it unironically. i checked once and all i ever get is super overpriced clothes or overly sponsored stuff im tired of hearing about. anyways, this comment is sounds so negative but im going to end it with i love saf's videos.
Wig looks awesome! Well done, Tyler!
I think I NEED to know where you got that pastel galaxy mask! It's so cute!
SHES BACK
It’s like e girl and soft girl made a baby that’s the third thing she was talking about
"when life 🚶have 💯 reason to cry then life 🚶give you 1000 to smile "" 😀😀💓💓 """"
Can someone please tell me where I can find that black floral top Safiya was wearing. I want one
WE NEED A SKINCARE ROUTINE , SAFIYAAAAAA!!!
Love seeing so much Twice on her explore page! 🥰🥰
she looked so cute and beautiful in the pink  outfit, i'm  i n  l o v eeee omgomg although yes the black outfit is more "saf"
ATTENTION!!! I’m waiting for FRANKEN MUG video!,
I think the pink looks suppost to be indie vibes
Welp, I know what I’m watching for the next 40 minutes. 0:07 I just realised that was the intro song she got someone to make for her in that one video. 6:28 it’s the 70s video she did. 8:40 good god, I’ve been there too... 33:57 I promise, not everyone in New Jersey speaks like that but it’s fun to make fun of
Man Safiya is giving me big Franny from Meet the Robinson vibes rn
I feel like the pink look was very Y2K
In all the insaneness that is YouTube these days thank goodness for Safiya vids!!!!! 🥰 happiness 🥰
"Honestly my breath must be terrible" "I mean...it's not great"  ...I died
Tyler's "memes of production" joke deserves some recognition!
Can we talk about the amount of YouTubers in 2016 that would’ve called this video “Mark Zuckerburg is Trying to Kill Me *not clickbait*”
no one: literally no one not a single soul me: being obsessed with crusty <3
I feel like the last outfits looks better without the jacket
Also the pink really does work on you. It works really well with your skin tone. That wig is snatched! Great job, Tyler!
Congrats on #2 trending!
every youtuber has been sponsored by honey 😂😂😂
Me: *Frantically writing down all the stores and accounts mentioned so I can give my goth gf the best life*
Destroy all your mugs and put them back together kintsugi-style.
The way they pronounce Oregon is cracking me up ngl, love you guys😂💕
THE👏🏻 AMOUNT 👏🏻 OF 👏🏻 DEDICATION 👏🏻
So is it just me that saw twice on her explore page? We be stanning🤩
#2 on trending girl!!!
Someday my kids will ask me where I was when the 2020 presidential election was called, and I will show them this video.
I have a big backside. This is how all British trousers fit me.
WHO CARES??
Yessss Jenna Marbles! When I heard you say E Girl I immediately thought of her 😂❤️
Those moondust boots are fire
Honestly though, Saf would kill it if she really dyed her hair pink
You should have tucked the leftover leather on the skirt overall into the ring. If you had tucked it into the ring then it wouldn't be flapping as much.
Did not see a shop tab on my gram xD so i clicked on it and i think it has no idea what i like, so threw an obscene amount of underwear stuff at me...i dont even know why apart from it probably knows im female xD I want your gram shop Saf the gothic stuff was cool!
it kind of makes me sad that you feel you have to keep defending your mistake of calling it an E-girl style. I think in the future, one disclaimer is fine. No one should be flying off the handle over a mistake you made while filming and you should not have to feel like you have to make yourself sick to apologize 1000 times. If people are that upset about it they need to hakuna their ta-ta's. Love you guys <3
This looks like Jenna marbles house
I usually comment one of my favorite funny moments from videos I watch, but this whole video was just so funny
Safiya, It’s time to change your background/backdrop please.   Maybe make a video letting your fans decide on the next background look?
Insta been having the shop button how did u barely see it
Not being a creep but your house looks exactly like Jenna’s, you guys must be neighbours XD
A FUTURE MILLIONAIRE WILL LIKE THIS COMMENT !
all of the twice posts ahahah
I love how twice was all over her explore page
I'm not sure what I laughed at more, Tyler saying "you can control the memes of production" or the disappointed look on Safiya's face
LOL I just see chayoung dancing at the beginning of the video  Also love to see just random k-pop Idols
WOOOOHOOOO #1 ON TRENDING CONGRATS LOVE❤️
I love that fact that you took a few seconds to censor “bitch” on that candle 🕯😂😂😂 ZAFUL got me. Not on the shop tab but I now hate them 😎
34:24 JESUS ! YOU LOOKGREAT!
Such a cute e-girl look! 😘🙃
hi
"Sweetest bitch you'll ever meet" I know I said a few times to my husband in the early 90s, when Sammi was probably getting a new lunchbox for kindergarten. The phrase definitely came before her.
"Destroy every mug in our house and glue them back together!"  Please no. 😰
OMG please make a video trying kintsugi!!
Saf, I beg of you, look up " dance with Leroy" on youtube. The moves are right up your alley. It has milk the cow...and MILK THE BULL
I would do the pink wig with the witch outfit because I have zero fashion sense.
The hair
I came here faster than ever I missed safiya so baddddd
Ooooh you should do some similar shopping on Pinterest!
The fact that I immediately recognized those alohaearsdesign Mickey ears says a lot about me.
A suggestion for your eyebrows with the pink wig. For the outfit you had, yes the black eyebrows were a bit weird, but if you wore more of a traditional e girl look that has more black your eyebrows would have looked fine.
That last outfit was giving me some major Marina and the Diamonds vibes
Ok, but are the shoes comfortable? Because I want them.... like, a lot... :D
instagram was like: she's either a 2020's witch, or a 1690's witch
The Dwight makeup is by @kimberleymargarita on Insta :) idk if she was credited in the post, I didn't see it, so just wanted to let people know!
Is Safiya a ONCE?? Welcome to the fandom😊😊
I feel like you would love History Bounding if you looked into it, especially with how much you loved the first outfit.
You glowiiiiin Safiya can we have your skin care routine pweeeease
Safiya, where did you get all your masks? They cute.
Oh man those jeans.... 😬
Love the kpop, specifically twice, in your search tab
I love pink hair on you!!!
Why i did not expect to see a dance the night away tzuyu fancam in a saf video, what a pleadant suprise lmao
as an oregonian im so sad she says is ORI-GONE🥴😂
Okay but Saf looks so good with this hair length??
I promised myself I wouldn't buy any clothes (or unneccessary items) until I have completed my official move next year... but that PowerPuff Girl top is making me rethink my decision... You looked so darn cute in ittt.
Ya'know what, I'll give Tylar some credit:) he did preety good fitting (not to mention beautiful) pink wig on Sofia's head;)     that is not something I thought I'd ever say
Each new Safiya video is such a gift! You can see how much work and care she puts into each one. Also brb gonna go shop on Instagram 😂
I love the way the outfits fit on you ! You look like you were having fun !
Number 1 on tending 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
The pink looks good.
This is so dumb but WHERE DID YOU GET THOSE SOCKS IN THE WITCH OUTFIT?!?!? 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺 I love them
sorry but non-witches using witchcraft as an aesthetic will never sit right with me
Oh that’s me at 10:17 on the right haha !
I'm getting Westworld vibes from the first look without the bonnet
Am i the only one who thought she was at jenna marbles house at 18:15
I was pretty excited to see CHER!
Is she living in Jenna's old house or something, I feel like the living room/dining room area looks familiar as hell lol
safiya is a once omg u go girl
YouTube keeps hiding your videos from me I had to look on the trending page to find this
Jesus Christ is coming back Repent and give your life to him before it's too late!⏳👀🙏
https://youtu.be/Kdh7VoB3C_g
"It seems that my fresh cream brings all the boys to the yard!" I'm actually dying🤣🤣🤣🤣☠
Ok but that witch outfit with that mask... 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Great video. If it makes you feel better, I've never even heard the word egirl so you could have had me fooled.
Omg omg get curtain bangs
If you take off the bonnet, you look like Laurey from Oklahoma!
the pink wig looks SOOOOO GOOD ON HER
She rocked that witch outfit!
I have shoes with a similar long-lace situatuon. Instead of doing multiple knots I do the first knot normally and before doing a second one (I always do two with every shoe because I am clumpsy and tend to step on them) I fold the lace in half and tie a normal bow like that. It looks cute and you avoid the dangerous long lace situation.  I hope this helps someone 😂. Hi
Lol. I used to work at Colonial Williamsburg.
Okay but does anyone else think the pink hair looks really good on her?
Okay but Saf looks so good with this hair length??
She looks so young and pretty in the second outfit🥰
You should dress up as every historical America girl doll :0
Safiya doesn’t dress vintage, she dresses antique.
I laughed out loud at the churning’ song haha
"my fresh cream brings all the boys to the yard" needs to be new merch
Useless story:  I’m kinda distracted by the brand name Minga - because that’s how we people in upper Bavaria call Munich in our dialect 😂
That gives me an idea.. You should do a video on  Victorian style.. would like to see how you look in Victorian gowns.. awesome I think!!! 😹
lolol the shop thing's been there for ages
Hmm, my "shop tab" shows up first, then IGTV's... I wonder why
I looked through my shop tab and it was interesting how different it was from my regular adds
Without the bonnet the first outfit gives me steampunk vibes
That pink look has big pinkie pie from mlp cosplay feels to it.
Where is Jenna? I know she’s in there!!! This is CLEARLY HER HOUSE
Maybe try tucking the ends of the leather straps into the rings? It might feel less like nipple tassels to you, haha 😄
There are always like fifteen different comedic lines in all her videos and I love it.
oh yikes saf killstar is a highly problematic company
I went to colonial Williamsburg every summer from the time I was like 5 to 18. I love it there soooo much and cannot wait to take my kids there.
Okay, looks like I'm going shopping on IG
I have a strong feeling that the shop selling the top in the last outfit, is one of those sites that resell stuffs on Aliexpress. You pay they, and they place a order on Aliexpress for you. That top is probably only $4 5 dollar there with free shipping.
the last one looks like a grown up modern version of lava girl
I really appreciate all the time and effort that goes into your videos!! But I do feel like your video topics are getting a bit stale. They feel a little impersonal and detached. I'd really be interested in seeing something a little more personal from you (as long as you're comfortable with that). Maybe show us a hobby that you've picked up in quarantine?
for be completely honest with you now, I love how the outfit of the pink hair looks on Saf. I am not kidding one single bit.
Cause it only took a month for another video
Safiya confirmed once <3
Change the wig to blonde then u will be a soft girl one the last one
Honey do be sponsoring everyone doe
HER HAIR .....
I watched this on my tv and specifically came here to say Safiya’s hair is stunnin. When she let it out of the bonnet. Whew, Dat length doh
I have a question for safia. Do you like k pop. Because I love it. And yes I am saying it because twice was on her Instagram. I like more k pop groups btw I just want to say. And I am not a toxic k pop fan. I just want peace.  Anyways I talk too much
If you thread the excess flap of the overskirt through the hoops, you might solve both problems.
Love the pink wig 💕
Now I can never not shop on Instagram. Thank you Safiya. If only I had the confidence and time to dress as gothy as I like. With me hopefully getting a job soon, I can only resort to wearing Tee shirts and the rest is a uniform. But at least I might appreciate having a sense of style more if Im forced to wear a uniform.
the platform crocs would have matched that third outfit
When she put her hair down out of the bonnet 😍 Safiya is so dang pretty!
Man, instagram algorithm must be so confused after her shopping :)))
I went to buy those moon boots and they're no longer avaliable :(. Damn you, Saf, for making me need them
I just noticed a pair of shoes from American Duchess.
the “not an e-girl” is called Y2K fashion!
did saf buy jenna marbles home...
Safia has such a gorgeous figure. Hubba hubba hubba 😍
I can't express how much I miss your usual uploads ♡
you wore the goth skirt right... next time I suggest tucking the strap ends into the loops.
I wish I could like this a million times... You always make me happy!
So when are yall gonna paint the house black..... cause i see it coming
When she said "Sisters tonight we fly" she actually sound like them
AHHH SHE POSTED AGAINNN
The witch outfit looks really good on you Saf, but more surprisingly that pink wig looks so great! I loved the contrast of your dark eyebrows with the pink hair. Really good look :)
saf you need to glue down the wig, it’s driving me nuts, you can see the lift.
I'd totally wear the goth outfit is it wasn't velvet. I despise velvet
Facebook have been secretly hiding everything I put on my wall for weeks and they never told me.  I could see my posts but nobody else could.  I thought everyone was just ignoring me for three weeks.  This is a very dangerous thing to do to a person's mental health.  But, when I'm knocked down I fight back harder.  So I started posting important information to my friend's walls instead.  Within 5 minutes Facebook put a stop to this too.  We are living in total censorship and total fascism.
The second outfit looks so good!!!
Tys quick jab jokes are iconic. Lol
I think the pink outfit would've looked good with her natural hair (or the pink wig shorter cut with a side part) and a bellbottom-esque jean, not those ugly mom jeans
I actually love the pink wig on you! x
Interesting
THE SONG IS BACK!!!
I think the pink wig looks GREAT on Saf
That home page 😂😂
bro when she said oregon trail i was so surprised that ppl say it like that💀
LOOOOOOVE these video!
I like how she matched the masks with the different outfits .   #covid19
This video was a lot of fun! I loved the first 2 outfits and you definitely looked more comfortable in those two compared to the last.
Maybe they're showing you baby posts because Tyler has already perfected dad jokes lol.
At last saf n ty ❤️
Whats catcall?
The black mask looks INSANELY good with the black outfit 😍😍😍
I’ve stared getting clothing ads on YouTube now?? I think it might be interesting to do this series with youtube recommended clothes 😂
I live for your humor
Aloha Disney ears are fantastic! Do it!
I love the pink look honestly 👍
THAT WAS A TWICE VIDEO ON SAFIYA'S DISCOVER PAGE OMG
The all black clothing is so cute, I love it 😍
I love these videos 💕
omg the black outfit with the mask is sickening
Your neighbors must have been really confused
I LOVE the witch outfit!
I wanted to see what my shop tag looked like after this video and it was pretty disappointing. I follow a lot of punk/goth, streetwear, and anime themed fashion brands so I thought I would get a lot of those recommendations. Nope. A lot of it was very generic forever 21 and pacsun-esque with ONE brand I was already following at the top. I get better sponsored ads and recommendations than I do from the shop tag.
Who love the new  intro
"her belt chain is kinda in her butt crack though."  "It's got a bat on it though."   Same energy as the what color was the bike tiktoks!
Dad jeans are NOT flattering
Okay, but she looks so freaking cute in the colonial fit! 🥺
I'm telling you. Tyler laughing at Safiya doing basically anything. Just puts a smile on my godforsaken day.
I get so excited when I see you post you were my favorite on buzz feed and I was so excited and happy that you were able to branch out and it has been fun to watch you grow over the years. You and Tyler are amazing and I cant wait to see more. Love you guys no matter how often you post I will always be excited to see it. Your amazeballz
That “memes of production” joke got me good 😂😂😂
I really want to see Safiya get styled by a professional stylist or a goth stylist one day. I thought that would be really cool! Hehe
For a couple days the shop tab was at the bottom between the heart and profile button and I was so confused
I would wear everything from the 2nd outfit.
As of my comment, the video has hit No 1 on trending!
Is it just me or what, but Safiya is glowing 😍
I love the Insta Witch outfit 🖤
I wanna see the wig with the witchy outfit tbh
That goth outfit was EVERYTHING 🖤
23:34 Looking like a black hair Melinda Warren their Safiya. I wonder how may people will actually get this reference
beyyn: minga londann
I died seeing twice all over her explore page 🤣
I think the white long sleeved shirt would look good with the angel jeans.
Best line - “Aren’t we all inspired by Sammi Sweetheart?”🤣
I saw the Madison and Mallory Instagram page 😊 love them
This is trending number 1 in England💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽
I'm not a master about wigs but from a non-wig master it looks good!
I suppose it really is a dysentery world
your house looks so similar to Jenna Marbles’ lololol
kkkkkkkkk muito bom soundcloud/diehlg
I want those boots!!!!!!
I love the dark brow and eye combo with the pink, Saf. Gorgeous!
LOVE Colonial Williamsburg! Highly recommend the walking ghost tour. Xo
This was a really nice fun video. Really reminded me of some of her older videos but i loved it😍 btw the top she is wearing in the unboxing part is so cute. Does anyone know where its from? 😊
I legit want the second outfit dude. It's my style for sure.
Did anyone else get Jenna & Julien house background vibes??
I love, love, love the pink outfit! It’s so cute, I would definitely wear it myself.
I think you can still definitely call the last look an e-girl look. Some of them are dark and some of them are light and pastel!
The egirl look is Chromatica vibez!
Safiya's skin just told me to wash my face 😔
I have a dream of becoming a sheep at colonial Williamsburg and grazing on the GOOD grass. Collab?
I see you like Twice Safiya😍
There's also an update that turns your likes page into the shop tab. I only got it on one account and I hate it
Tell honey to make it usable on cell phones, then I'll use your link.
WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT HOW GOOD THE PINK WIG LOOKS ON HER?! 😍💗
The fact that you can quote so much Macbeth warms my English teacher heart!
I really want that 'goth' outfit
For anyone wondering her third outfit I believe is Y2K style, but correct me if I’m wrong :)
Ahhhhhhh!!! Safiya! I just Love your videos!!!! They are so amazing, entertaining and such good quality!! Keep up the good work Saf and Ty❤️❤️❤️💖🥰
Feeling good about being here before 1 million 🤩
safiya is slowly becoming Morticia
So funny and gorgeous as always Saf🥰
Not going to Lie. After she took off the bonnet I immediately thought of Salem Witch Trials.
I actually really liked the pink wig and galaxy mask look on you Saf!! Yes, not your normal...but really nice on you.  I also need to figure out where I can get that mask, because my current galaxy one is a bit janky.
safiya looks so cute in that wig <3
Did?? They move into the same neighborhood as Jenna Marbles??? That living room layout looks the exact same
The range in these outfits is amazing!
How long ago was the first portion of the video shot? Those boots aren't available anymore 😭
I'd say the third outfit was more of a y2k style but I can see the confusion 😭
What color would you say there house is I love it.
You two are the absolute best- i am crying with laughter- THANK YOU! 😂😭😂😭🖤👍🧡👍🖤
In Saf's defense, I too find E-Girl fashion unclear, I still have no idea what it is, and I'm only 19.
https://youtu.be/hoP64M7WUsc Have a look at this
The second outfit is very e-girl, like if you wore chains and rings and did like pigtails, it's very much e-girl For the third outfit, there is a type of e-girl thats called "soft/pastel e-girl" so you still technically wore an e-girl look
3:54 I SEE THAT BERNADETTE SHOE GURL
Try the colonial bouse with the skirt-overalls!!
You could tuck the loose straps into the hoops
You FORGOT about the Totally Spies?! What?! UNSUBSCRIBE!!!  *This is sacrasm*
Also the Egirl fit is mostly a soft girl fit
Dang this video did not disappoint! I was very pleased with it!!! Loved it!!! Also, Safiya looks AMAZING in that pink wig!!!
we missed you!<3
SHE BROUGHT BACK THE OLD INTRO!!!!  Edit: She’s also #2 on the trending page
The witch outfit suits you soooo well!
I'm so obsessed on you safiyaaaa!!!! love u!!! i miss watching your contents! waiting for the next!
The “not an e-girl” look is giving me Steph0sims vibes. I love it!
23:22 big Stevie Nicks vibes here
You said Oregon wrong 🙄😐 it’s not Ore-GONE. It’s Ore-GUN.
Wait wait isnt that jenna marbles old house???
Is it just me or does that kind of look like Jenna and Juliens house?
Good job Tyler
Omg I missed this intro song soooo much
OMG please come to Colonial Williamsburg!!! I live here and I'd love to take you around!!!!!
Number one on trending! <3
Gooooo
Me: *gasps when I see this in my feed* Safiya Nygaard! Hubby: *from the other room* What was that? Me: SAFIYA NYGAARD HAS A NEW VIDEO. MUST WATCH NOW!  I liked this video during the intro song and have zero regrets 9 minutes later... 🎉😜
If you wore the colonial look in Pennsylvania, we would all just assume you were Amish lol
Lmao the last outfit was a soft girl look 😂
The ring on the goth outfit where to tuck the straps into so there would be no nipple tassel action
E girl and E boy is basically watered down emo fashion
Who wants her to make a house tour
i want a part two !!
"Its a hay penny a glass baby" I think I just died 😂
i miss the fashion videos!!
Okay now I want full video of Safiya transforming into an E-girl 😅💕💖
love this video! also i think moving is a good idea still
Ok but who loves her new hair like she is giving very big Morticia Adams vibes (idk if I spelled the name correctly)
Her house when she’s unboxing the clothes looks so much like Jenna marbles lol
OMG SHES GOT A JENNA MARBLES ANGLE
that second outfit paired with a mask and Saf's gorgeous hair... makes me feel things
She could always tuck the extra strap into the ring and tuck it into the skirt.
eeee this looks so perfectly weirdddd!!!!!!!!!😁😁😁😁
I get so happy every time I see a notif for a video from Safiya !
I think the wig is cool! And well applied. Makes me wanna get some
21:25 The way they say OrEgon trail
I’ve never heard anyone say Oregon the way they did 😅
Without the bonnet, I got sassy pirate vibes!!
"you can control the ~memes~ of production" A+ JOKE TYLER ASFDGFKJLK
Her house looks just like Jenna Marbles
Just realized that their house and Jenna's house are basically the same! Also I thought the jeans looked great on her
Ok but safiya in that pink wig and makeup is giving me major Marina vibes (yk from marina and the diamonds)
The tight underwear area on jeans is unfortunately trendy and it's REALLY annoying. I had a pair of green courdory pants with that cut a bit back and I never wore them because they caused me physical pain
The first outfit without the bonnet looks like a character in a movie who’s breaking out from her small town life and seizing life in the big city 😊😂
She, safiya is why I started watching YouTube
Without the bonnet, the first look is 100% cottagecore
why does the mug video actually sound interesing...
Hey Safiya it is not a e-girl it is a soft girl, just wanted to tell y’all
bad news the gather the goods shop are trump supporters.
You are thinking more soft girl then e girl
”I do have IBS” lol I felt that
The "e-girl" outfit looks like a modern Princess Bubblegum cosplay 👏💗
I used to love an hour away from colonial williamsburg and I loved it
Glad you had fun
The make up and the pink hair with the mask is giving me Gaga vibes and i am here for it
This may be my favorite video outside of your wedding. Your personality really shines.
Because of the eerily similar/completely identical look of your houses, I am convinced you live next door to Jenna Marbles...
Your can tuck the tassels into the belt circle loops!
I think Instagram doesn't know me because everything they suggest me on the Shop-site ist totally crap and not even near my style/interests 😅  On the one hand that's pretty good but on the other hand it sucks to get no interesting advertising...
Dye the roots of the wig black and slap it on the 2nd outfit and you got yourself a real look
your kitchen reminds me so hard of Jenna's!!! Thank you guys for this video, I've been missing yall!
I really dislike these videos of yours. These kind of brands are really harmful, usually stealing artwork, using terribly cheap and unethical labour, and its really bad for the environment. Wish you wouldn't financially support them
I just realized that your intro song is from your “I bought the first five things YouTube recommended to me” video!
Omigosh I especially loveddddd the 2nd and 3rd outfits on you! 😍💕
OK BUT WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT HOW SAF HAD TWICE SUGGESTED VIDEOS ON HER EXPLORE PAGE? ONCE DETECTED
I can absolutely vouch for Jersey Shore sound bites always being in my head.
Can we please talk about the fact that they pronounced "Oregon" wrong?
You are my idol 😭
Saf should do little house on the prairie crafts like butter churning and candle making in the historical costume
i actually loved the pastel egirl moment..
you in pink, im living for it omfg
TOTALLY SPIES <3
Ty is so supportive I love it
Post videos regularly please 😭😭😭😭
Sayfiya and Lily Singh would be the perfect collab!
i don’t work there but i live there 😎
🖤🌹🖤🌹🖤🌹🖤
Spot on Winnifred Sanderson impression! Love It!
I love you ❤️❤️❤️
I never understood the cottagecore obsession. I like my yoga pants more than dresses worn before there were toilets.. but thats just me
She’s so beautiful 🥺
Instead of apple bottom jeans its angel bottom jeans
Tyler, I will give you the props Saf didn’t for “the memes of production.” I outright cackled loudly enough to scare two cats. 😹
Video idea Cosplaying for a week
Why does her house look like J&Js ?
Honestly I was highkey living for the pink wig
This feels like the shops are made from keywords and not shops advertised by keywords.
HOLY CARP DID I JUST SEE SAFIYA LOOKING AT TWICE ON INSTA!!!!
yes 'just churning' we believe you ;]
Random thought: what if what you’re smelling in your masks is the smog that is LA’s air?
Your filming area looks so much like Jenna's, the layout is so similar to her home
Saf looks SO HOT in the witchy outfit omggggg
I need that pink jacket!!
god damn it she’s so beautiful
Just went to try to get those shoes and (at least in UK) they have no shoes at all 😭!
I love Safiya and I 100% respect and appreciate her decision to make videos at her own pace while she lives her life... But I'm so so gay for her and during the gaps between videos I am ACTUALLY STARVING to death
I didn't realize how much I missed her videos like this!
You're so beautiful
Am I the only one who thinks that the black mask actually was a really nice addition to the outfit? or am I just getting too used to it? :D
The wig looks good. It just needs to be ruffled a bit to separate the hair a bit more and add fullness.
also safiya is really LOVE your makeup for the not egirl one!!! so so cute
I LOVE your second outfit so much!
Consider shopping on pinterest
Honestly I really want that "witch" outfit.
For real, the third fit is fire, Saf. Maybe not for you, but you DO look cohesive.
last look reminds me of lavagirl!
Anybody else think her house looks like Jenna marbles house? My brain had to take a second
I missed that theme so much/
The brand American Duchess woulda been the place to shop for shoes for outfit #1 Edit: they make old timey shoes, and make them the way they were made in the olden days 😊
I'm always so happy when she posts
Do.. you and Jenna Marbles have the same house? Haha
The pink wig is REALLY cute on you, not gonna lie. The makeup is super cute too
"Hello fellow kids, I am one of you" - all 90s kids who are turning 30.   Also me irl when I talk to my nieces about their egirl mode.
My gremlin brain upon seeing the first American duchess shoe pick thought of Safiya in full 1700s garb that she made some of because I'm too used to costube
the witch look is so cuuuuute
I like how safiyas explore page is full of twice
wow, i thought the dark one was cute at first but the mask REALLy brought it up a notch for me!! it added to the darkness i love it ahahha
Omg safiya is SO beautiful wow!!!!
the way safiya is DEFINITELY a once lmaoo
Control the memes of production!
Can I just point out how much Kpop was on Saf's feed?
I mean, the wig is e-girl ish but the rest is more vsco girl.
I think she thinks shes Morticia
I saw TWICE videos on Safiya's feed and I see a ONCE now ❤️
Luuuuuv that shoe box
I feel like the 70s 80s is back, I can see everywhere, from the song (Dua Lipa, Weeknd, Twice, Mamamoo) and also fashion, last but not leastespecially the rollerskates. 🤣
that overall skirt was SO flattering
🎶My fresh cream brings all the boys to the yard🎵-Safiya 2020
she looks like Morticia Addams here
the "e-girl" outfit actually looked good on you in my opinion!:D that shade of pink suits you
The wig doesn't fit your skin tone red would look amazing or black and green streaks
But did you buy the Maleficent ears?
I THOUGHT SHE WAS AT JENNA MARBLE’S HOUSE😭
I actually really liked the last outfit
Safiya (& Tyler) coming in hot with another amazing video!! Love this!
Lol chaeyoung performing bdz
For the last outfit I think it’s just the baby angel jeans that don’t totally work but otherwise pretty cute!! I love the outfits
Oh Safiya, you brought me so much joy this morning while i watched this video! You are hilarious 🤣 😆
Crossing my fingers for a real “Frankenstein mug” video! 🤣
The outfits look so damn good on her! The black one was damn impressive! She disliked the straps and how they were placed on her but the way they curved around the chest made the chest look bigger and the cinched waist was really well placed! And honestly the whole vibe of that outfit was super cool! <3 But I'm completely in love with all the outfits! 😍😍
The masks really elevated every outfit
She was definitely feeling herself in these looks 😄
Safety looks so pretty with the long hair I mean she looks amazing even with shirt hair but I think she  a little better with long hair
as someone from Virginia, I appreciate the Virginia joke
NEW VIDEO
Oooo the witch outfit looks even better with the mask 😷
are we not gonna talk about safiya’s phone background? 😂
First one is very sound of music vibes
it's so good to see and hear you guys! you make my day so much better, great video and take care :)
Her living room reminds me of Jenna marbles 😭😭
literally 99% of these shops are on my instagram store tab lol
Try tucking the end of the skirterall straps through the rings and then into the top of the skirt. That may help!
We STAN the American Girl doll love
I was so looking forward to the candy shoes! :(
Please. No. Jersey shore. No. That is my home. Those people invaded and caused trouble. No. Please. Just no.
Safiya waiting for days
Bro she deadass looked amazing in the “witchy” sort of goth look.
I really LOOOOVED the last outfit doh 🥰
You should do a decade fashion video for the 1910s! That way you could work a mask into your looks!
Hey Saf thank you for the upload!
IF YOU GO TO COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG PLEASE REPLY TO THIS SO THAT I CAN SHOW YOU AROUND!!!
Is watch the Frankenmug video! Haha!
I can't get over how similar your house is to Jenna and Julien's
Can we petition saf to make a "I dressed like I'm in the 1700s" for a week video
Dang couldn’t find the jacket 😞
I really liked the outfits!! And you’re so pretty everything looks good on you! ✨✨✨✨
I love the pink wig on you!! :)
SHE'S BACK YAAAASSSS
Yoooooo she looks so adorable in the second outfit!!!
Darling , You amazing 🤩 ❣️❣️❣️ Witch 🧙‍♀️ outfit is my fav...  Can cross the suspenders in the back to make smaller, so you have less of a chest tassel look. 👍🏼 👍🏼
"I feel like a saucy wench" - Safiya 2020.
You got a like for Tyler's meme pun.
You look INCREDIBLE in the second outfit 😍 and those shoes ♥️ rouge and wolf are an amazing UK brand ♥️
Peep that twice
You tuck the straps into the rings....
Hello from colonial Williamsburg
I'm sorry, I'm freaking out a little bit but doesnt this look like Jenna Marble's house? I'm not crazy, right???
The inside of the house looks like jenna marble's and its throwing me off
Loved this! Well worth the wait. I've been eagerly watching your insta BTS
The pink Hair somehow reminds me way too much of lazy town 😂
I hate it so much, i don’t even want to use Instagram anymore. I don’t use Instagram for shopping so it is extremely irritating to have it forced down my throat with the shop button where the notification button used to be. They bank on the fact of you accidentally clicking it and going down the rabbit hole.
I was just saying hellllllooooo friends yesterday and thought aw I miss her .... then BOOM it was like ESPN !!
7:58 SCREAMING BECAUSE SAFIYA MADE A REFERENCE TO ONE OF MY OG FAVORITE AMERICAN GIRL DOLLS!!!  edit: AHH SHE DID IT AGAIN! Felicity and Kirsten were my other two favorites!!! <3 21:07
The Zucc not even hiding at this point the fact that we are the products and advertisers are the consumers 😅
THE PIIIIINK HAIR I LOVE IT ON YOU
I CAN'T WITH THE WHICH OUTFIT It is soo Amazing its a mood😳🤩
You should mix the outfits.
HOW CAN I NOT SEEING THE TWICE RELATED POSTS ON SAFIYA'S IG EXPLORE???   Happy to meet another once~ ❤
She should defenitly watch trail to oregon wearing the first outfit, its a starkid musica
i have never clicked on a video this fast in my life
💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄
The last outfit just gives me Rose Quarts vibes. I dunno if it's the wig or the height, or both.
I legit want those moon shoes!!!
The memes of production 😂
This video brought me so much joy!! Safiya donning the Franken-American girl outfit just gave me life!! Girl, you’re hilarious!! I never comment on YouTube videos, but I just want to be your best friend!!! Lol you’re my spirit animal! 🖤
the memes of production is a really good joke, tyler. good work
I need an “I dressed like American Girl Doll for a Week” video in my life
I’d call the style she thought was e girl, soft girl because it’s more pastel, and cute. Soft girl is my style.
You know its serious when she uses Safia's *new* intro
I had a hysterectomy march 2019 and I get flooded with baby stuff and period stuff on facebook it's hilarious
Where do you get your masks? They are so cute.
I grew up next to Colonial Williamsburg ( and yorktown and jamestown). I *believe* that many people (reenactors) who work there volunteer.
Can you pls do an escape the night video
I only got the notification now 😭😭
Please for the love of god CHECK YOUR MESSAGE AND CLEAR YOUR VOICEMAILS!!!!!!!!
Safiya can you do a modern witch video?
When she started the unboxing I was convinced she was at jenna and juliens house several minutes  I feel like they might be neighbors lmao
Does anyone else think their new house looks like Jenna marbles house of am I losing my mind??
"This is Safiya's new intro song!" - 2017
saf ... that second outfit was EVERYTHING !!! looks so so cute on you !!
Honestly, I think the last look really worked without the wig! It felt like a little much with the wig, but the outfit itself looked really good. Also, Tyler, I liked your memes of production joke.
whenever someone mentions Honey, I hear Markiplier's Where Does Honey Get Its Money rant in my head playing at double speed
I deadass had a dream last night that I had run into you at like a huge fabric store or something, and when I woke up I was like .....what does this mean, is she gonna upload? Lo and behold, I have super powers
WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT THE WAY SHE SAYS OREGON SISJAJSJSJSHD
why did you say oregon like that !!!
Was that a StarKid refrence I heard??? :D
0:56 OMG is that twice's mina?   omg here tooo  3:29
All the fancams of Twice ❤️
38:00- Mixing all of my mugs together to see what we get
Candles, shoes, and wigs—OH MY!
If Safiya can wear a mask You can too Thank you for being safe just in case!! Love your videos <3
THE WIG WAS KINDA CUTE SAF!! Try to rock it more often it’s fun!! You don’t need matching brows girl it looked fine
The jeans fit you perfectly, it’s just a different style of jeans than you’re used to! 😄
The outfits describe me so much I died inside: the modern Lolita-ish outfit, the modern witch(I’m an actual witch) and the history nerd
Mine and Safiya's explore pages look so similar. Mostly kpop, specifically Twice.
Her next vid should be FRANKEN SOAP I said it once and I will say it until it happens
I work at one of the shops at merchant square in Colonial Williamsburg! I have seen a lack of butter churning lately, but you can stomp on clay to make your own bricks ...and shoot a musket 🤷‍♀️ 😆
I want that pink jacket and it seems to be sold out now 😭
I feel like those silver rings looks like nipple rings
hey my name is macy!
Tbh you look cute in the pink jacket
not related, but I need that galaxy mask in my life!!!
never heard of colonial willamsburg, is that the place that beck went with her family in “you”??
The outfit works without the wig.
wow your skin looks so glowy and pretty while unboxing the haul !!!
I think the last outfit would've been perfect without the jacket lol
I watched Jersey shore at a young age too 😂
She said 10 mins NOT 10 HOURS
You should do a house tour
I wonder if IBS is in many people just your body losing the ability to digest lactose, as most non-Western people do by their teens. I started to become lactose intolerant in my mid 20's and it took me until my 40's to figure it out. Of course no doctor ever gave me the correct diagnosis.
I live near colonial williamsburg and i feel seen
That tank top looked great on her!! I hate that it wasn’t a great quality
You cant understand how much I absoloutly love these videos
I’m getting MAJOR morticia vibes(more than ever) & I’m loving it ❤️👻 Edit; I commented this within the first 35 seconds of the video & now I see why 😫
You have thoroughly upset me by putting new shoes on the table 🤢
I mean hey, I'll take the jeans
Safiya, You are beautiful. I love your videos, so upbeat and funny.
Can we appreciate the matching masks? Saf ain't just stayin healthy, she's slayin' as she does
Number one on trending well done!
THE CONTENT I NEEDED❤️❤️❤️
I feel like there house was built by the same company who built Jenna and Julie's house..the living room/ kitchen are very similar.
Hi
I live in p a lots and lots of people wouldn’t even bat an eye at the first outfit ha ha
Did she just call an anime shirt a “CARTOON shirt”??? 👉13:21  Well she had 50% right at least, i mean Power puff girls sure is a cartoon. BUT SAILOR MOON?
Dissapointed not to find how the Selena Gomez movie is in the comments.
Usually I watch the entire video first and then like it, but this time as soon as you mentioned Sammi I placed an instalike.
THE WAY YOU SAY OR-GONE. NOO. ITS OR-GIN. LIKE THE THINGS IN YOUR BODIE.
I live 45 minutes from Williamsburg and happy to host you and help out if you’re serious about coming to Williamsburg to film 😊
Tried to join Honey. You need a desktop. No mobile option. ☹ no honey 4 me.
I ... I just love the butter churning 😭😂
I hope you’ll do some historybounding looks in the future if you loved the first outfit. Morgan Donner made a video on the term sometime last year. You looked so cute in that first outfit without the bonnet!   Wearing full on historical dress in everyday life, a mix of a few historical eras all at once or just some parts of historical dress mixed with modern pieces.
Lets just appreciate how well she knows American girl dolls😂😂😂😂
Just wanted to say I am still glad you are posting videos again.
for anybody in the comments considering buying from Minga after this - DO NOT! I bought those exact jeans and the quality was horrible. It felt like iron on transfer. When I returned them I found out, despite the brand being Minga LONDON, they're based in Spain. It cost me £20 to return them which was not refunded.
I'm kinda the same, even tho I bush my teeth to gods it still smells bad. Wtf how? I never heard my breath is bad and I have bf
I need the Sammy sweetheart necklace
You gotta put the straps in the holes like a belt buckle hun
I was hoping you would get proper undergarments for the colonial look 😔
Kill the pink. But really glad to see you again
I don't realize how much I miss safiya until I watch a video
American duchess shoes? Did anyone else catch that?
I do quite like the pink wig
The Witch outfit really suits you. Your figure looks bangin' and you've got great legs to show off! Also, while I love you in your comfortable vampire black, I am surprised at how much I liked you in the pink wig and jacket. Maybe the jacket could go with the skirterall (?) skirt. And I flippin' love the shoes.
People would just think your an Amish person around here. Cute!
You look incredible in pink! I love the wig 😍
Safiya could literally be wearing a trash bag or a burlap sack and she could still look great in it.
CHAEYOUNG!!!!1
OHH MY GOD LOVEEE THE WITCH LOOK ON YOU SAF!! DONT worry about having an intense “goth” “witch” look instead of a “diet” look..fashion is for you and nobody else! If you like it wear it girl
Safiya dressing historical, and then dressing cottagecore. Just waiting to see
I'm just saying, Safiya, the fact that *all* of the kpop stuff on your explore page was of Twice is a biiit sus. It's okay if you're a Once, we welcome u with open arms
Every pair of mom jeans/loose jeans fits me exactly the same😭
I love how you didn't put ANY ads. You're a true friend
Can we talk about how cute Safya look with pink hair?
(Lives in the Midwest and sees Amish and colonial style dress all the time: 😘 Confused Cali peeps: “Are you a time traveler?! 🤔”  AHHH so happy you got a GREAT WIG for like a “first time” wig! I found out about Webster’s Wigs from Madeyewlook this year! I’ve been losing hair due to illness and needed something to help me feel “normal”. Their wigs have done so much for me and my confidence!!! I LOVE the pink on you but you should look at all the other ones they have too, I think you you will find ones you’ll want to wear! 🤷🏻‍♀️😘 Also, Anibiu has GREAT wigs too even if they aren’t as full. I actually wore the wig from Anibiu twice already for some videos on my channel! 😱Missed your content and can’t wait to see more!!! (Also Ty, you did a great job applying the wig, lace front wigs are hard to do if you have never done one before so gold star ⭐️ to you 🙏🏻)
My shopping tab turned out to be suuuuper disappointing
I feel like a saucy wench  Same.
Are they in Jenna Marbles’s house or am I crazy?
I have three insta accounts and the shop tab shows up differently on all of them
SUCH a good video omg so glad you posted it!!!! cant wait to see what yall have next 💞💞💞💞💞
SAFIYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA MISSED U  (Hey, hey, anyone actually a kpop fan? Go watch Monsta X - Love Killa ) Totally relevant. She mentioned kpop twice I'M JUSTIFIED
That pink wig and mask combo really brings out your eyes.
Why do people say Oregon like that 😩😩 Oregon, like the things in your body, or that big piano thing.
I have the spoiled top:)
I loved the witch outfit with the mask! I don’t know why, but the black face mask looked like such a fashion statement with that outfit, instead of just covid-necessary, lol.   I would be here for a “Safiya does modern updates of the most iconic American Girl doll looks” video. Felicity’s dresses! Samantha’s victorian coats! Molly! Addy! Josefina! Did she do this already? Or does it just seem like such a safiya-appropriate topic that I dreamed it up?  Also, updating looks from cartoons like totally spies or book series with specific outfit vibes, like BSC.   (Especially if those videos used more secondhand clothes, like from thredup and etsy/ebay, and less fast fashion. I love the witch outfit but also would love to see some inventive pairing of used clothing like safiya has done really nicely in the historical fashion videos)
Just me or does their new house kinda look like jenna marbles house!?
Ngl, the Pink outfit reminded me of IHasCupquake
19:15 a bonnet, Micarah Tewers approves
You keep saying colonial, but you're definitely wearing civil war. I wouldn't wear it to colonial Williamsburg because you're about 90 years off.
I think the design for the last tank top was taken from another shop. I've seen it first on omighty and not really on any other known brands. That might be why the quality wasn't great
The background at the table is giving me Jenna Marbles living room vibes
It's y2k or baby girl
is this Jenna's house? looks so similar
Lol you prob won't see this but if you don't want the one shirt to say witch, you could try to dye it with black dye? Maybe it would fill in the writing and then it's a little less on the nose
Saf you looked amazing in all of them specially in the firstborn one but without the head thing 🔥✨
the twice fancam in your explore page! we had to stan
I love how see looks like she’s from beauty and the beast like one of the villagers
The prairie top might be cute with the goth skirt!
You must listen a girl group named DREAMCATCHER! they are a really princess and gothic girls! many black cloth and Kpop or KRock songs!!! you will love it
Not gonna lie, I totally dig the Power Puff girls outfit. You look surprisingly amazing with pink hair. I’d support you if you wanted to make that a regular thing. Also, I’d like to point out that you have 138 unread messages.
My explore page on insta has a lot of the same witchy stuff and now I want a whole outfit like the second look!
Still waiting for “Dressing like it 1830 for a week”
I love the last outfit!
The black outfit gives me so much dreamcatcher in their song chase me vibes and I’m loving it.
Her house looks exactly like Jenna marble’s house
you rock all of these looks, so cute!!!!
Saf is sooooo beautiful 😍
That “not an E girl” look is more VSCO girl right?
Are you Indian
I wanna see the mask worn with the  “not an egirl” look with the witchy look. I just really like mixing black with pastels lol
https://youtu.be/xc5R_7bjRV8 relax boy
Bernadette banner is crying tears of joy right now
I love safs screen saver lol
Does anyone else she linked the clothes in the description? I kinda wanna try the jeans and pink jacket.
you should do buying wigs in wish and wearing them for a week
*Me from  virgina and lives near willumsburg* AHHHHH YES
Okay I can’t be the only one looking at all of the prices like 0.o
+Safiya Nygaard Whose idea was the calendar stop motion? CUTE AND SUBTLE BUT WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT!
Is it weird that I feel the need to say thank you everytime you bless us with a video❤
The hair looks great on her! Pink really does look good on her. I know she doesn't like to wear pink it looks great! I feel like if she was wearing like her normal all black but then wore the pink jacket or the pink wig as just a pop of color i think it could be really cute too.
Most likely the reason the tank top took so long is cos it was drop shipped from AliExpress 😬
Sabbath Night Fever got me 😂
someone please tell her its y2k not egirl
The cherub jeans are so nice
Hey Saf, is there a reason captions are unavailable for this video? ☹️😔
that 1800s look is amazing 🤩
Tyler: I do have IBS  Me: I relate
Hey! So I don't work at Colonial Williamsburg anymore, but if you want to go there, visit, and hang out with everyone who works there, we can *absolutely* make that happen! ...after the pandemic... (though there isn't any butter churning...) ❤
Safiya has realized her true form as a colonial woman
Safiya looks very cute in the pink wing and that goth outfit is my favourite.
I may have a very tacky fashion sense, but i would legit wear that last outfit x')
Love your "goofballism"....you remind me of my sister. It may run deep in our family though.
I think you look great in the pink wig. Throw it on with the witch outfit. It will confuse people.
You have ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT unread messages
I actually think the last outfit was kind of cohesive from the front. The pants are good from the front. The pink angelic on the butt matched the jacket. The middle power puff girl has a lot of red and pink. The pink hair. It kinda brings a lot of pink. They are kind of different styles but they all have some pink so it ties together. Like it’s not perfect but like it kinda works.
36:03 isn't 18 to 54 too big a range?
The tassel part of the suspenders could be threaded through the hoops and tucked into the skirt’s waistband
My grandparents have a timeshare near colonial Williamsburg and let me tell you, going black friday shopping there for almost twenty years sure was weird
The new intro song gave me Doofenshmirtz vibes😂....in a good way
why is this number one on trending like ion care about your clothes
For the moon shoes - I think it would look great if you replace laces with black halftransparent ribbon.
my favorite thing so far is her phone background of Tyler 😂
the "e-girl" outfits work so well together and u look good in pink
Tyler, good job on the wig, it looks great 👍👍👍
That pink jacket with the hearts is definitely cool. I think with an all black outfit, it could look awesome. With the jeans, it really leans into a cutesy territory that doesn’t speak to me (though I can see it being really amazing for someone who doesn’t typically wear all black). Regardless, love the video!! Really fun. 🖤
i love when her videos are 40 min long and i get to lay in my bed and have the time of my life watching
Incase anyone else was curious, this was all $662.71 in total if I crunched it correctly
It's a hay penny a glass LOL I'm dyyyyying 🤣🤣🤣
That pink wig is so beautiful 🥺🥺 I wish I wasn’t broke to buy it
when Safiya was unpacking all of the outfits I genuinely thought they were in Jenna’s house for a second that fireplace threw me off
Not sure if you noticed, but the straps on the overall-skirt have a loop, you might be able to fold the leftover over the ring and feed it back through the loop.
I love cottage core safiya and the millennial witch safiya looks the best!!
Lol how old is the video —- bc this isn’t new at all!  How long have you not been on Instagram!!
I didn’t expect to hear my name on this, much less the way it’s not pronounced which just caught me off guard and made me mad lol
safiya’s explore page really said “✨ stan twice ✨”
Next video full face of Instagram makeup 🤩
They tryin’ to catch me churnin’ butter!🤣
Why does it look like you’re in Jenna marbles home? Not trying to be creepy but it’s tripping me out!!!!
THE PINK HAIR LOOKS SO GOOD ON YOU
that crop top was from a drop shipping site 100%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
0:36 Is no one is gonna talk about this? So Tyler likes RedVelvet and Saf likes Twice👀 (Btw Chaeng looks super cute in that outfit)
btw outfit three is called “soft girl”
Who else just went to Williamsburg 2 weeks ago??? 🤣
Thank you for putting your time into this video! We see now how much time and effort goes into them, and we love watching them. We don’t mind waiting for them, and we’re happy when you two take breaks! You don’t owe us anything, and we’re just people watching these videos for free because they’re awesome. Just remember that we want you to keep loving your job, so we can enjoy the things you make!
I love Safiya's hauls)
i think without the face mask the wig definitely doesnt fit your face shape and skin tone tyler may be right that the eyebrows clash too but the mask definitely helps fix that
Restyle.pl shop ❤️ GO POLAND 🇵🇱
“They got that ‘meet me at McDonald’s ‘ hair cut” that fucking killed me
irrelevant but, now we know safiya gets a bunch of Twice content in her explore page
Pretty sure if she ever puts those pants in the drier that baby’ll come out looking in his 90s 🤣🤣
LET SAFIYA CHURN THE BUTTER!!!!!!! like if you agree
You can turn the Power Puff tank in to wall art by cutting out the front and framing it.
FINNALY A NOTHER VID!! I’ve been waiting liek 3 months and I’ve been watching ur videos from like 3 years ago lol 😂.
“The memes of production” is such a good punnnn 😂
Here is me not knowing what to comment but wanting to be supportive
I AM IN LOVE WITH THE SECOND OUTFIT
Anxiously awaiting Frankenmug! or would it be a stein?
You were supposed to tuck the straps through the hoops and hide them under your waist band 🤔
The Memes of productions, was the most underrated joke XD
I'm sure you could pull the flappy bits of the suspenders through the hoop to keep them down
19:59 OMG 😂😂😂
As someone who has worn lots of period dresses you do get cat called alot lol not entirely sure why but its 100% a thing😂
I hate how much I love the last look tho whyy
I'm also obsessed with colonial Williamsburg; it's just the best place! I'm still a little miffed that I got rejected from the College of William and Mary even when I applied early decision (ended up at Gettysburg College instead, so still thematically appropriate), but not, I just love Williamsburg. I've actually straight up bought one of the contemporary dresses from their tailor shop and bought re-creation 1780 stays and did the hair research and everything and did some photoshoots with it. Kindred love of colonial Williamsburg FTW!
Could you pls send me the link from where the wig is I need it for my cosplay
I love these kind of videos.
Safiya's hair has grown so much I love it.
14:17 SAFIYA, that is a soft girl look 👀 !
* Slight Cringe* Oregon is pronounced OReGin
I love the WITCH loo outfit the most but i do understand that whole, the rings are at your boobs. But otherwise I love the whole thing, it suits you and is just cute overall
Not e girl it’s a soft girl look lol
That first outfit is the cottagecore dream
"Virginia is for lovers and reenactors" lol Any other Virginians here?
the wig was what did it for me 👏🏼
I had a dream I was a cashier and checking out Safiya's groceries. For some reason, she was buying Green Apples and green apple Dawn dish soap along with other things that I don't remember. I told her I loved her Youtube channel and when I asked her what it's for, she said, "It's a surprise". Then after I wake up, I find a new video! What are the odds?
the powerpuff girl top is ripped off from omighty, literally used the exact same photo omighty use on their website :/   dont support ripoff brands ppl❤️
YOUR HAIR LOOKS SO GOOOOOD
Have they already made a house tour? I would love to see that
can we appreciate twice being on safiyas explore page
E GIRL MAKEUP ON SAFIYA 😮👍🏻❤️
Pink wig gives me such black pink vibes OMG
Saf is slowly turning into Morticia and I’m here for it
That pink look is from Chromatica
I missed you so much safiya have a good day
For a second I thought she was in Jenna Marbles kitchen. Who agrees?
is it just me or the last outfit was so good? like yea, ill fitting...but wow some shots were nice
Oooh i missed the intro song
The witchy outfit with the mask gives me the ultimate Winter Soldier vibes in the very best way 👌👌👌
is it me or does safiya look like the mom at ADAMS FAMILY
Pretty sure the pastel stuff is the y2k aesthetic.
THE INTRO SONG IS BACK! YESSSS!
You should do a house tour....plsss
I'm a simple gal. I hear "memes of production" and I click like
I can't be the only one who was like "She's got the same living room as Jenna Marbles!"
I love the witchy oneeee!
As someone who lives near colonial Williamsburg, you need to also visit Yorktown and Jamestown. Live your colonial dreams out here in Virginia! Also the yankee candle factory in Williamsburg is lit.
With the caveat that I'm pretty much the polar opposite of whatever demographic is being targeted by outfit #3 (cis guy, born in the 60s, blah) -- I'm with Tyler: not great from a distance, better when you look at the individual bits.  Wig: Awesome. I wish I'd thought to get a long pink wig for Halloween. Next year.  Tank: I get your criticism, but it does make the girls look good. And it makes the girls look good too.  Jacket: Weirdly nice, though there's a lot of "Hi, I'm 12 years old" going on there.  Jeans: Very schizophrenic. From the front: yeah. Everything you said. Camels, etc. Tragic mom jeans. But from the back: you've got a very nice butt. Always be walking away, I guess.
Did anyone else notice that safiyas house looked strangely similar to Jenna’s?
Please do the video of the broken mugs! I did it with plant pots once, it is incredibly fun
There are so many Addams Family references and I am unbelievably happy about it.
Safiya judging Tyler's pun >>>>
I don’t know proper trend names but I think her “e-girl” look is more of an anime girl look or like a bratz doll wearing outfits from Etsy. Pretty sure “e-girl” would be closer to the witch look which is my favorite.
Is this foreshadowing............
You guys should make a video where you try to make colonial clothes trendy for a week
As usual, everything looks great!!! Thank you for bringing joy to our lives during this stressful time ❤️🦇👽
Her: let's go for a throw way back outfit Me: yes yEs YES YEEESSS!!!!
With the bonnet off, I lowkey got pirate vibes In a good way!
OK, you spent so long commenting on American girl dolls that I think you should do a deep dive into the American girl photography fandom on Instagram. It would be really cool to see a video of you looking at and reviewing people who photograph American girl dolls. There was a giant community on Instagram where we pose dolls and make really realistic looking scenes with them. I would love to direct you to some cool accounts (including mine LOL)
The “Not an E-Girl” look was very much electra heart
Goth witch Saf is a wlw dream
💀 the pastel style is more of a soft girl style
Plz do trying wigs from wish next
Safiya is confused as to why Instagram suggests goth fashion to her, when if you follow her they immediately suggest that you follow other goth fashion accounts lol
When are you two gonna drop your kpop bias lists👀
Wow! LOVE all three outfits on Saf. I didn't actually notice the rings on your chest with the velvet overalls. And the pink!! It looks so good even though it's not your style! Loving the jacket and the wig.   Amazing video as always Saf. :))) <3
OMG THEY LIVE WITH JENNA AND JULIEN
The third category is more soft girl
... I could tell it was from months ago based on the age of the bachelor memes oops
your living room looks like jenna marble's living room
IBS solidarity
Find someone that loves you like Saf loves Colonial Williamsburg ❤️
Actually roller skating is back in style. Watch tiktok and there's a ton of people roller skating in California.
Omg please do the Frankenmug!!!!
I actually Adore the third outfit
" a Selena gomez horror movie is it good" lmao
omg yes do the franken-mug 😂
Did y’all buy Jenna and Julien’s house?
id say thats egirl fashion for sure!
Oh my god shes a ONCE yeeeeeeessssss
My mom works at colonial Williamsburg and she dose tickets if you serious let me know 😊
You can control the MEMES of production??? That was GOLD!!!
I genuinely love the pink hair.
I like the witch outfit the most. It's amazing!
I love that colonial blouse, which is super unexpected
Is it just me or does she have a Morticia vibe going on? 🤣
*My name being Safa and nickname also being Saf*     hey twin-
I just checked out my shop tab for the first tike and I gotta say im not surprised!! Mostly Broadway and theatre stuff, and some scrunchies and graphic tees😂😂
We've missed you! This is such a fun video lol
I love this concept for a video, there’s actually a lot of cute stuff on their shop tab.
You have very strong Josh Gates as a woman vibes
Living vicariously through other people really is the way to saving money
😂😂 the Frankenmug idea at the end is grand!!
More, soft or vsco girl
The lack of bonnet, make the colonial get up turn straight up scandalous! Could also be witchy!
I kinda hope you do the Frankin-mug idea. That would be so cool. Or better yet, do a set of dishes. The mug, a plate, and a bowl.
American duchess!!!
Omg I want an Ursula evil swimsuit! 👙😂
Instagram is like: "This girl is either a history reenactment enthusiast or the person they'll be burning at the stake."
Saf: *gets catcalled while wearing the Franken-American Girl Doll*  Me in high school: *got catcalled while wearing a felt 50’s skirt and a Christmas sweater*
WHEN SHE TOOK THE BONNET OFF WHILE STILL WEARING THE CUTE PRARIE OUTFIT MY HEART STOPPED LIKE BRO SHES EO BEAUTIFUL AND THAT REALLY MADE HER BEAUTY SHINE
me the whole beginning: ...TWICE....TWICE.....TWICE....TWICE AGAIN
Wow the editing in this vid!!! And camera shots!!!
My pet hamster cheese passed away last Friday
Please order shein makeup
I've missed my spooky bat girl! Thanks for the new video! ❤❤❤
25:38 where is that trench coat from?😍
Anyone else think “colonial Tyler Williams burg” when she was talking about Williamsburg? No? Just me? Thought so.
love those shoes. and love kill star too.
you look so insanely good in the witchy costume
I love it so much when you upload!!! Your videos are always so well done--I'm so happy you take your time with videos, it always pays off. And seeing progress on your IG story is so fun!! Take care ♡♡
Mia Maples did it first!
I wonder if the straps of the overall suspender skirt could be tucked in?
Im obsessed with that pink jacket! But in the moment I saw the things you picked to pair it with I was like.... oh no.
“I want to go to colonial Williamsburg”  I feel very outed right now.
i missed these !!
I live in Virginia go va!!
When saf said "in thunder, lighting, or in rain" she sounded soooo much like professor Mcgonagall, like the resemblance is unimaginable lmao XD
When you think you know what kind of video she’s posting from her story but she comes out with a colonel dress
My sister works there... And I think k could try and find something out... Let me know if you actually want to come up here 😂
Okay but... the way you guys say Oregon 🙃
I learned so much about you in this video ha ha. 2 of the 3 out fits I would totally buy or make and I’m actually working if the historical reenactment one already cause I do follow also a lot of those same pages which was funny and surprising. Goth witch one is also yes and I do actually want those shoes cause omg they look comfy and cool. Also feel like they would work great with your Lolita outfit ❤️🌻. Love to you both stay safe (stay saf🤣 sorry I’ll leave now)
Your house looks like Jenna and juliens house
are you doing a holiday online gift buying video on the way?
I’m an Oregonian. Ya’ll don’t know how to say Oregon 🤣🤣😵 Still love you.
YOU👏DONT👏HAVE👏TO👏 HAVE👏 KIDS👏 EVEN👏IF👏 YOURE👏 MARRIED👏👏👏 YOU DONT EVEN NEED TO HAVE ✨🎶BOWCHICKAWOWOW🎶✨
I live in Williamsburg y’all can come here plz
I'm surprised the shirt and skirt were from Punkrave, considering they usually have really over the top fancy clothing. Like so fancy they're almost unwearable for day to day life.
Im here to beg 😔🤕
The goth like look is so flattering on you. I think the shirt-erall is made for you. Amazing.
Tyler, good job on the wig, it looks good. I always enjoy these "let's see what so and so recommend me now." videos. They always have something interesting in them.
Honestly, I'm feeling the soft girl look on you. It's a nice change of pace. The pink wig was EVERYTHING 😁
The pinky stuff was actually girly girl or VSCO girl
10:47 Is that a MCR's Three cheers for sweet revenge pin right there or am I just delusional?
Why does that look like Jenna marbles house lmao
good to see u girl! unique AND authentic personality xo
I’m so glad you’re back
23:23 This whole outfit and transformation reminds me of Hester from the Scarlet Letter. When you had the bonet on, you looked like you were having fun, but a part of you was missing. Once you took off the bonet, you looked so free, happy, and rebellious, just like Hester did once she let her hair loose.   THAT'S ALL! GREAT VIDEO SAFIYA!!
Thank you both for making these videos. I know a lot of work goes into them and you probably don't always feel like putting on your "happy face" or whatever (although the milk maid outfit brought very obvious and genuine happiness, lol). We love your videos!
The wig looks really good. I think it would look great on you if you were wearing black!
I love the pink wig on you! Great job Tyler!But the Cherub jeans are not great.  You look great in these looks.
I love all of the outfits
The ppg shirt & the black jumpskirt & boots. The ends of the suspenders could go insise the rings.
In the intro, she looked like she could be in The Addams Family
I can not express how much I think Safiya looks gorgeous in every single thing she puts on.
I notice the TWICE in her explore and I am happily surprised
im very worried about how the third outfit will look 😂😂
This looked so fun!! Loved the historical clothing, but you looked awesome in all the outfits
Her house kinda looks like jennas house ngl. Like the living room and everything 😂
does anyone know where she got her masks? they are so cute :)
wait so like do you practice witchcraft?
A video where she goes through every item she's ever bought for videos like these and makes "real" outfits for her fav items. <3
I’m living for the Scottish play quote moment in clothing that literally says “witch.” Shakespeare would be a fan I’m sure.
the witch outfit really looks so good on her...
I do like I how the wig frames your face
i love “the internet made me buy it” episodes because i get to do the 👈🏽👈🏽   👉🏽👉🏽 with saf
You look like morticia Adams in 2020
Diet goth 😂
I cant get over your love for my hometown Colonial Williamsburg...lived there all my life and i hate it lol
Am I the only one that can watch a thirty minute video of safiya’s and be ok but any one else I get bored
i really love the pink jacket on saf might buy it for myself
Am I the only one who thought she was in Jenna Marbles house?
I literally have no respect for you as a you tuber you literally go months without posting you’re obviously just doing it for the money and don’t care about your followers. Unsubscribed.
Love 💘 the pink power girl and wig look!
I came home from an exam to find a 38 minutes long video from Saf and a new upload from Buzzfeed Unsolved and just like that, life seems alright
I loved the witchy outfit!
The witchy outfit is definitely my favorite!! 🖤🖤🖤
You shouldve done the pastel outfit without the the wig so we couldve seen how it looked with your hair smhh
Doesn’t she know that when she isn’t around anyone, especially outside, that she can take her mask off?
Safiya in a pink wig was something I never knew I needed, Tyler KILLED IT 👏🏼
I missed these types of videos!!
Have missed your posts. Love this.
Witch! *Distant cackling*
I think the third outfit works without the brat top and wig.
I want more videos
Just what i need to distract myself from the election
Colonial Safiya yaaaassss I bloody love how it looked! More costumes plz, I'd love to see civil war reenactment with safiya 😍   In the part of the UK I live, Minga or minger means someone who is disgusting or gross 😂 The clothes really don't follow suit, they were adorable
I actually really like that pink jacket.
12:59 OMG IVE BEEN WANTING THAT TOP FOR MONTHS BUT IM POOR LOL
I like Colonial Williamsburg to
The colonial Williamsburg outfit will burn the witch outfit
I mean it's not, not E-girl? Its e-girl adjacent.
That is defo like a child’s sleep undershirt or something
Why are they in there old house
E girl transformations are the new goth transformatuons 😂 with everyone thinking they know what aesthetic they're replicating but not doing any actual research
I really missed you Saf. <3
Wear the pink wig again ... looks good
She looked really sweet in the Colonial look! I liked it the best. 👍☺
The first look is definitely more of a Marilla Cuthbert vibe than the Schuyler sisters
Instead of e-girl I would call the last style you saw soft girl ❤️
I live in Williamsburg.  I know people.
Tyler laughing because he loves her
I'm not trying to tie everything to witches but as a fellow thespian, Saf with her hair down in the colonial outfit looks like Abigail from the movie The Crucible based off of the play by Arther Miller
I know nothing of either style but wasn't the supposed "e-girl" one more of a "visco girl" look?   Also, did they move? Cause I'm like 99% certain that they lived in an apartment before and did not have a backyard. house tour soon?
Definitely credits to Tyler for the wig! Also, love love love the long video, perfect for taking a bath haha
Most people’s idea of vintage: The 50’s  Safiya’s idea of vintage: The 1800’s
omg twice on your explore page
But... what is the amazing blush you’re wearing?
Safiya, you should try the victorian outfit, smth from 19 century
Just 3 looks?... Saf, you're slackin', homie.
Do you have the same house as Jenna Marbles?
you should do thrifting off on depop !! that would be really cool to create outfits from there
"The MEMES of production" made me laugh out loud XD
With your boots youre supposed to wrap the laces around your ankle
OMG imagine a comment and like from saf                  The trick of getting like from saf
Omg the witch outfit suits her so well 🥺💕💕💕💕💕
Sorry to be this person, but I feel I'm allowed to do this just once... it's mah birthday! :)
Franken American Girl Doll is aesthetic vibes. And the fact that you just know them makes my day
I want a skirt like that!!  <3  I love love love the outfit on you !
I love the pink wig and the pink jacket but yeah I agree I’m not a fan of the tank and jeans. Also loved the witch outfit if it didn’t say witch and totally agree that the suspenders looked like they were accenting the nips.
Oh my god, you look !! INCREDIBLE !! in that witch outfit 🖤🖤
Safiya looks like she belongs in the Addams family today, I think it’s the long black straight hair with that middle part😳
Ya I checked my shop section... only makeup 😆
I am completely distracted by how much their house looks like Jenna Marbles and Julien’s house. I feel like there’s definitely a conspiracy theory to make up here lol
37:18 best joke ever
So happy to see your video on my feed, and to hear that intro again ! :D
Yooooo, I think the "mug" was actually a Franken-Stein. Like a stein drinking glass
😁
We love seeing kpop fancams
Safiya why is so much of your discover page twice, Itzy, and bp related 👀
I need that necklace 🤣
I miss the old background 😞
Hi kinda early
The “e-girl” outfit actually gives me soft girl vibes!!! Makeup and all, so you did kind of do something!
When she said WITCH I literally died!!!!!😂
The thing with the Jeans is that you have a booty. I know the feeling that's why things ride up on me
Is it just me or does Saf's boyfriend, Natalie's Outlet's husband, and Alex Wasabi all look the same?
The pink outfit for some reason gave me dirty candy vibes from Julie and the Phantoms
Love the pink hair with the brow
Safiya: direct zoom to chain in butt crack. Tyler: noticing a skull in the SIDE xD
janna marbles :(
Love the first outfit! Ore-gun though not Ore-gone.
I love her new intro...
Couldn’t be happier to see this, especially that it’s a whole 38 minutes long!! Oh, and Honey is great even here in the UK, I’ve saved loads from it :)
Saf's "egirl" look is more of a soft girl look tbh
I keep getting vaguely confused cause no one ever references my state this much
I really like that pink crop jacket. Wish I had a better figure for all this. Clothes are soo much fun but I look frumpy and overweight in everything
Anybody else trying to see the ig names of stuff I like
Has anyone noticed Safiya has a very similar voice/cadence to Caitlin from ask a mortician?
I'm sure this comment has been left already but just in case: on the witchy velvet skirt you can loop the extra suspender tassley bits through the hoops and tuck them into the skirt so they aren't flapping around if that makes it more wearable.
Please dye your hair completely black!!
Saf your hair is EVERYTHING!! THE LENGHT THE MIDDLE PART!!! IM DECLARING MY INDEPENDENCE AND CASTING A SPELL!!
i think you look awesome with the pink hair!! but as someone with purple and pink split hair with red front pieces currently, i’m a little biased 😜 i’d love to see you try a darker shade of pink/other colors. i think you’re like me, really dark natural hair and light skin so darker shades of fashion colors tend to look better on us than pastels because pastels can wash us out and yes contrast with our natural brows and hair a lot lol would love a dyed hair saf moment... even if it’s a wig 😁
Watching this to distract myself from the stress of the election :D love you saf
I bought a new iPad last night so... we’re tied? 💕😂💕 Also for the roller skating... did you watch Dynamite too many times lately?
I love how twice is on her explore page
She’s looks soo badass when she was strutting in her dark witch outfit
Safia reminds me of my English teacher trying to be cool and I love it
Where’s the hoop?
Come to Williamsburg, I will sit through tunnel traffic just for a colonial Williamsburg video.
It’s me 😂
With the bonnet off, I was getting more of like a Western Baddie vibe!
Those face masks though are so cute! I need the galaxy and embroidered one
I think  the wig looks good on you
It looks like you’re at janna marbles place. 😅
omg the witch outfit tho🥺❤️
Oh my gosh.... I just realized that she is at 9 million now. Wow... I have been here since FOREVER
FINALLY A VIDEO THAT IS NOT ABOUT MAKING SOAP
Saf looks like Winona Ryder in The Crucible 😂💕
THOSE BLACK SHOES THO
Those boots... I would love to buy it but it’s no longer there 😫😫😫
The first outfit is like cottage core , the second outfit is like witchcore and the last outfit us like soft girl clothes
My grandfather works there!!
Need to take the time to say you’re the most wholesome person I’ve ever seen 😅😅 in the sense of YouTube, SM and where my interests lead. You and Kendall. But since you don’t focus on true crime, AND my 12/14 y/o sisters watch you, I just feel attached to you in a cute wholesome way 😭😅😅
10:50 NO throw spoopy awaayyyyyyyy
why is safiya in jenna's house?
Makeup, skin care, oversized sweaters, ripped jeans, dnd dice, and nail polish.
The white blouse and then skirt would look so good together ? I also have a rouge + wolf brand phone case I love it
:0 I live right by Colonial Williamsburg omg Saf pls come 😂 (edit: legit I have some connections with Colonial Williamsburg, so if you're interested...)
The second outfit was PHENOMENAL. I need it myself now
I hate to nit pick but that is the point of the apron to completely cover the skirt so it stays clean.
the skirteralls give me "harness from her kpop video" vibes
Wait...You like Twice? I saw nayeon and Chaeyoung there xD
THE "MEET ME AT MCDONALDS" HAIRCUT LMFHAIFBWIFB LMFAOOO
I think the third look is more pastel goth than egirl, the pants and shirt take me away from that thought, but the majority of what you were looking at seemed to be a more pastel goth
I see a lot of TWICE. 👀😂
Omls its not  e girl its tumbrl astehic  visco grunge  girl.  But İ am AA huge fan
"We think this girl is either a witch...or a civil war reenactor." And I'm like, "both." ....I don't know if I have ever related to anything more than this!!  Same, Saf. Same. 😂😂
My cousin works at colonial Williamsburg. I can contact her 😁 she's a candle maker
CUT YOUR HAIR!!!!!!!!! It’s doing absolutely nothing for you!!!!!
If you do ever get to go back to Colonial Williamsburg, make sure to take to the milliners, my fam literally spent like an hour there talking about stays and how those turned into the modern day bra. It was super interesting!
Those jeans!! 😅 I think they are super cute, but you got that amazing booty and the pants COULD NOT deal.  Don’t you love it when the best parts of your body make clothes not work?
Also! The flaps on the skirt get tucked into the rings!! You don’t leave em flappin 😭
this is my engagement comment for the video. hello.
Does any know where Saf's black floral shirt from the opening packages scene is from? I NEED it
As an Oregonian I HAVE to say it...  "Or-a-gen"
YOU SHOULD TEST AND REVIEW SOME MLM PRODUCTS! I think that could be fun! Just do proper research first so you know it’s 110% safe❤️❤️
The pink jacket and wig look great on you
13:29 WHEN I WAS LITTLE I HAD TGAT SAME EXACT TOY PHONE!!!! I was trying to look for it and I couldn’t find it I looked for an entire hour! BUT NOW YOU FOUND IT AND IM SO THANKFUL THANK YOUUUU
As someone who really loves those gothic moon shoes... Were they comfortable?? Should I get them??
HAHAHA TYLERS “NEVER MIND”
I think the "e girl" was supposed to be vsco girl + soft style or maybe the bright color versions of e girl
Maybe do a lace tuck? *Shrugs* I love the witchy look!
All the outfits are fun but WHERE DID YOU GET THAT THIRD MASK?!?! ITS SO PRETTY
The way you pull off literally anything!
We’ve unlocked the Tyler IBS lore
The last look is like soft girl
Love your vids!
I adored the witchy outfit!
I think that pink jacket would look really cute with a black skirt!
The pink jacket, tank, wig look would look pretty cool with black bottoms... like black leggings or a black ‘Saf-style’ skirt 🖤🖤🖤 Omg idea...! The 1st white blouse, the 3rd pink jacket and the 2nd weird suspenders skirt? But maybe veto the straps?
Your hair is looking so beautiful long. It is beautiful however you have it. But I love long hair 😄
You look so good in the historical outfit!
Me when Safiya talks about e girls: looks up e girls then thinks of soft girls. I find the last category she looked at looks like a mix of e girl ans soft girl.
i love this kind of videos!
You should do a FODMAP diet video
Fun colonial fact: you can still make your own butter by putting Heavy Whipping Cream in a mason jar and shaking it until the butter forms! It only takes about 5 min.
I just checked my IG shop tab... and what I found are Chanel hand bags, gourmet cakes cookies & brownies, dog treats (although I don't have one), floral arrangements, jewelry, home decor and makeup. Pretty much they nailed it.
Okay but like... I found so many new brands to follow lol  Okay and I have no idea what an e-girl is but I have a pink wig for cosplay/I just wish I had pink hair. Now I feel so conflicted
Without the bonnet you remind me of westworld
I actually love all the full look of #3 I would totally wear that
*everyone goes to their shopping tab that they had never noticed before now*
I love in Williamsburg and it is awesome! You should totally visit! I would love to meet you and see you walking around!
the poseur top is a knockoff of an omighty design!!
I love how tyler is very present and safiya combined these outfits with a poetic show lmao...
I would wear the whole second outfit!
I'm sitting here watching this in my mom jeans (no angel on the but tho 😔), tank top, and cropped jacket 😂😂😂
I don even have a shop tab...
The last style I believe can be call indie
Drawing Safiya while watching Safiya
Did anyone else hear what sounded like the second colonial “catcall” was a fan saying “Safiya!” 🥺
I think Safiya might like Twice. Just a hunch though.
I like the masks here, maybe that could be a video idea?
I always love Safiyas try on videos. Way more entertaining than most
I can't be the only one who thinks this looks EXACTLY like Jenna's house LMAO oh my god... It's a clone.
nonononononononono late
I love the pink hair
I am so happy to see one of these types of videos again! I love when you try clothes and makeup.  You should check out wantable if you haven't already or thredup. I tried them recently, but I'd love to see what they recommend for you.
Hiiiiiii ur the bestttt I am so happy 😁
That Power Puff girl shirt is a stolen design. They literally even left the actual sellers name on the shopping bags. lol
love the video! in case you didn't know, you can find the tags instagram uses to show you ads (i.e. 'beauty', 'cooking' etc.) by going into the Instagram app, clicking Settings -> Security -> Access Data -> 'Ads Interest' (at the very bottom). The filters are hilarious - this only works on computers for some reason, if you try it on your phone it won't work. xx
I LOVE LOVE LOVE the hair. The contrast with the eyebrows is so GOOD. It makes it so interesting and striking.
Safiya should cosplay morticia from Addams family!
I loved the witch outfit! The shoes were so cute!
No one: Literally no one:  My phone dying when safiya uploads a video I have been dying to see 😂😵😳
her house looks so similar to Jenna marbles’ omg
today is my birthday, thank you for this gift
Those blue jeans! They were definitely grandma styled. But I think you pulled the outfit off nicely. 😃
I love the witch outfit sooo muchh damnn
eeekk!! this witch look is everything on you! you look so cute
Omg Webster Wigs in based in my City and i LOVEE their “Blair” style wigs, i want every colour !!!
The pink wig hits. I love it. Looks great with your eyebrows and the jacket. Staccato punctuation through the sea of pink lol also if you're ever trying to go incognito, for you saf, no one would clock you in the pink wig lol.
Yay im at the intro and I am soooo happy. I fkn missed u guys
Safiya I love your content can you and Tyler be my parents
i’ve been rewatching all of these lately and NOW THERES A NEW ONE!!! WOOOOOOO
Safs hair is giving me Morticia Addams vibes
Am I the only one who got less of a 70's vibe w/out the bonnet, and more of a "Definitely a witch in Salem" vibes??  Also. Like. I kinda wanna see what the pink hair looks like w/ that colonial outfit.
I think you were probably mixing up e girl with VSCO girl 😂 Love these videos!
I bet that pink wig would look good with the witchy look
Yes!! @Twice In Safiya’s Explore Page !!
Tyler you applied the wig perfectly
That tab was there the whole time
Ty good job on the wig, the pink looks good on u.
Saf in the opening is giving me Morticia vibes, even more than usual, and I'm living for it
You should try the pink wig with the black/goth outfit!
Ok can someone please say how close her living room looks to jena marbles the resemblance is uncanny
I'd tuck the strap in the rings but idk
Why don't you tuck the nipple flaps into the rings?
How does she still look look in the “e girl” look?!?!?!
I kinda... miss this videos 😍
Oh I'm super not digging those angel jeans. I wonder what that same outfit would look like with the velvet skirt. Other than that I think they're all cute, actually. The first one without the bonnet looks good, too, but I always like Saf in retro/vintage type stuff for some reason, and it def. gives 60's/70's kinda vibes.
hi
Jewelry and hair products
I love her videos so much
Am I the only one that thinks that her house looks like Jenna Marble’s
Dysentery.. Thinking about that makes me uncomfortable.
Ok SOOOO is this Jenna Marbles house? That living room is exact replica of Jenna Marbles living room!!  Lol
Just got this Notification so I'm late but let's goo!
Once like
Chaeyoung in the explore page
Why is nobody talking about the fact that Saf is GLOWING in this vid like yes go get it gurl
Tyler: I do have IBS Me (all excited screaming): OMG MY HUSBAND HAS IBS ALSO pretty sure the neighbors know too now
The last fit gives me more indie kid
A saf video is just what I needed to start my Saturday
SAFIYA TRIES COSPLAY MAKE IT HAPPEN
Only Safiya can serve us so many fashion twists and turns in one video!!!
I feel like the clickbait shop Poseur was showing you inspo for their clothes.
I love this intro
As someone who is obsessed with alternative fashion and is punk themself, this video made me die inside lol. No hate to you, of course, I enjoyed the video a lot- your clothes-related videos are always my favorite- and it was very entertaining! But all the references to alternative fashion caused me physical pain, so I’m going to do a very quick explanation on the subcultures referenced in the video on the fashion part of the subcultures, not the ideals and music (because most alt subcultures are only partly the fashion) So when she was looking at the pink outfits oohh I cringed so bad when she called it an e-kid style (using e-kid instead of e-girl bc it’s gender neutral).  E-kid style has only started to be recognized as alt recently and it has a bad rep in the alt cultures due to the so-called e-kids on tiktok (not hating on tiktok, I actually have tiktok myself lol) who don’t subscribe to alternative ideals. E-kid style is usually characterized by black shirts with a bright graphic design and a black and white (or red) striped shirt underneath. Female presenting people usually wear a red or yellow plaid skirt with ripped tights or fishnets and boots. Male presenting people usually wear baggy black jeans or plaid pants with boots too. There’s also usually an assortment of chains and other such accessories. I don’t recognize the pink clothes to be an alt subculture, I’m more on the darker side of alt so I’m less knowing when it comes to the brighter subcultures. I would say scene but scene is mostly neon colors and over-the-top accessories, not pastel pinks and hearts. The “goth” outfit was actually a pretty good representation of goth (I’m calling it goth instead of witchy because I’ve found actual witches usually dress more cottagecore than anything else) it was essentially just toned down goth, like what someone would wear when just sitting around the house. I don’t have much to say about this tbh lol. Goth is mostly black, fancy clothes. Very rarely are there any other colors. But yeah, great video! I’m not trying to offend anyone, I’m just trying to spread some knowledge :)
Safiya is a once confirmed 😌👏👏✨
You could always put the ends of the suspenders through the ring. It looks great on you :)
Pie yuh zere is how you pronounce it
HOKY crap safiya in her bonett-less outfit, SHE LOOKED LIKE SUCH AN EARTH 70S BABE AHHHHHHHH
You guys spark so much joy!!! Very well appreciated.
PLS COME TO COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG. I GO TO W&M. I'LL GIVE U ALL THE HOT GOSS IN TOWN AND BE YOUR TOUR GUIDE. But in all seriousness there are so many weird and long-lasting traditions both on campus in in cw (colonial williamburg)
I just noticed from the previous videos after you have a break, you look so fresh and blooming. I’ve been your fan since Youtube suggested your video and since then I binge watch your videos.
Do you like alive bats?!?
Me being confused at how close Safiya's living/dining/kitchen is to Jenna's. Clicks comments to see that I'm not the only one. Are they neighbors?
Yesss
Safiya looks so pretty in literally everything
Those moon boots 😍😍
I loved the witch outfit! ❤
🤔In 8th grade we visited a “colonial town”......no butter to churn but we got to play with it🤣😭😭😭  PLEASE do a Saucy Wench tee🤣🤣🤣🤞🏾
She has to live near Jenna marbles cause that floor plan is too similar
Modern Morticia🥰😍
Not me falling for TWICE when Safiya was screen rec her explore page XD
honestly saf with pink hair tho
I've been missing you this year. I'm glad you're back.
tbh you weren't that far off on the e girl thing because some egirls are like pastel goth
I love your videos when are you going to do more baking videos and you’ll know why I love them if you search my name .I loved the one Rosana though all your videos are super cool though
The pink makes your skin tone look gorgeous
Hey I actually like the mug idea 🤣🤣🤣🤣
You make me wait too long for your videossss!!! You should totally make videos more!👍👍
You should try to make a Frankenstein American girl doll or research them
Micarah Tewers is coming for you for taking off the bonnet 😂
Wow the thumbnail your pink.....   Read more
I am a huge fan lollll
“Hello fellow kids, I am one of you” is a 90’s kid mood
ok no ofnses but ive see like alot
Is the house tour coming soon ???? I'll be soo happy to see that
I think we all need something that makes us as happy as Safiya in colonial garb churnin' butta. <3
the SHOEEEEESSSSSS!!
Who else went to the shop tab after watching this video cause i did lol😂😂😂
I’m living for the Lazy Town vibes ✨✨
It is not so serious but I looked at safiya's dms, lexime.fairuse.org/q4MoJp/k5IOfq.html I admit that I am sad, poor boyfriend I hope it changes
Morticia vibes in this vid! Love it ♥
The last outfit is cute! If u had ur natural hair down it would look better!!
Hello safiya I know you won’t see this but if you do I just want to say love the videos and have a great day
Hi Safiya, instead of cutting the shoelaces, try looping them around your ankles. With regard to the suspender skirt straps, I think you might be able to loop them inside the rings and under the lip of the skirt. I hope this helps!
This cheered me up immensely. Thanks team <3
I heard them yell "Safiya!"
AYE THAT NEW INTRO
I wonder if, now that the shop tab has been around a while, it's better at guessing what people want.
Seeing Safiya in that goth outfit reminded me that i'm bi
I think the pink wig looks great!!!
I laughed SO HARD at 20:00. So, yeah, Tyler. I guess I have a dirty mind. And I'm not mad about it. 😊
The pink hair was good! You were rocked it well😍💖 But you resurrected my goth heart with that second look gurl!!!
So yes I would say they could be using tech to scan the items you are wearing and suggesting similar items because that is already something being done on forever 21s website they have a photo search option
yay
the third style would come under Y2K <3
Or-uh-gun :)
also, i LOVED the pink wig and the top half of the last outfit, but i agree, i think the pants are kinda outta place with the outfit. obvi they're cute on their own, but the tank and the jacket are ADORBS.
23:09 joey   be impressed rn
The one day I clicked into Insta and this "shop tab" just opened. I was like wtf is that.
Ohh my god!! I just looove that video so much. It is just such a fun video and exactly what I needed. Also, I think the kind of baby goth outfit was such a great look on you. I honestly want that skirt for my self, despite the weird nipple straps ;D
Safs background at the kitchen island looks eerily like Jenna Marbles’ house 🧐
“Are they 30 dollars or 50 dollars.....either way I am thinking about it” WHEEEEEZZZZ
I can't even tell you the pain I felt when she put the shoes on the table
0:34 uu--huh--uh ecsoose me , twice, bp ahshdkfkdjsl
T shirt tiimmmee
The background while unboxing the third outfit gave my major Jenna Marbles vibes
I want that witch shirt so bad and I can't find it 😭😭😭
I see those Bernadette shoes in your suggested shopping Safiya
Is that Jenna marbles house???
The Jersey shore reference gave me life
They dooo!! They really doooo!!😂🤣
I live in Virginia and I’m not offended. google “hobbits dream air bnb”, something tells me you would think it’s cool lol. Awesome video as usual 😁
Tip for wigs: pick out the hairs at the part to make it look more natural.
You should do like 3 versions(styles, genres) of a Morticia! I love you outfit videos sooo much.
The wig looks soo good
Hi english people. I am a non-native English speaker, can someone confirm me it’s not “aren’t I” at 19:16 that she is saying ? What is she saying then ?
Everything looks good on Saf!
You should mix every liquid lipstick from Sephora
She looks so good on the black outfit 🖤
It is not so serious but I looked at safiya's dms, lexime.fairuse.org/q4MoJp/k5IOfq.html I admit that I am sad, poor boyfriend I hope it changes
Why is no one talking about the rose on the powerpuff tank top?!?! It’s kinda irritating like why would the brand put it there?
Safiya with the long haired middle part looks like Salma Hayek and that alone makes her 10000000x more iconic than she was before (which was already a really high resting standard so...)
You should do a video where you mix all the bath and body works hand sanitizers
Yaaaaaaay Saf’s back
I've always been in love with this intro 😹
That wig is amazing but also where did that galaxy face mask come from, I loveeee it
“Do we not all live our live with Sammy Sweetheart as our due north” Fuck... best sentence of 2020.
Without the bonnet you could star in an Anne of green gables movie 😂😍 you could be her friend Diana
Omg she's back 💞
I know friends who work at Colonial Williamsburg if you’re really interested in that! I can ask them who you should contact for that if you’d like?
Ah yes the saga continues
The witch outfit was super super cute. I would genuinely wear all of those pieces but probably not together
I LOVE colonial Williamsburg! I hope you get to make your way out to VA for it. It’s worth it
I love the “e-girl” look tho! It’s really not my style but you look amazing!!
0:37 into the video: Me: *sees Twice and Itzy in her feed* 👁👄👁
CRYING nipple tassels 😂😂😂
OMG, she's gorgeous!
I had asked and hoped for a Halloween themed clothing video, so the trendy witch section if this video was immensely satisfying.
Saf why are there no captions for your video? I always watch w/ close captions and I am sure you have some deaf people in you audience.
Try tucking the straps, from the black skirt, through the loops so the ends that are floppy are tucked inside the skirt. Love that outfit its super cute!
Oh my goD I LOVEEEE SAFIYA IN THIS WIG!!!!!! It looks AMAZING!!!!!!
I’m probably a little late but congrats on 9 mil!!  Also I agree with you on the hoop skirt dress and colonial Williamsburg I hope you have that video at colonial Williamsburg that would be cool.  Any way have a great day and thank you for posting awesome videos.
The pink hair is amazing! I didn't notice your eyebrows until he said something. I pink jacket liked the pink jacket...the other 2 outfits were awesome too.
the pink look reminds me of pinkie pie from my little pony lmaooo still rocks tho
For someone who made a shit ton of money of social media, you know nothing about it..
Tyler wearing your colonial mask lmao
I am screaming cause I went to check my shop tab and there’s only food there 😬
Did you steal Jenna Marbles house
safiya referring to herself as “battie”   as a brit, she just called herself an ass lmao
The mask helps the " e girl look"
i liked the pink outfit and witch one.
Ok video idea: safia dresses up as every single American girl doll. Bc honestly that would be so cute
did they move in to a new house
I don't think it's too high-tech to suggest instagram can identify the colours of the clothes you usually wear. Facebook as the technology to identify things that look like faces, and on google image search there is a feature to filter images by the dominant colour in the image. I don't think it would be too hard to have a piece of software that looks for faces, and then looks at the part of the photo below the face, where the body usually is, and identifies trends in what colour that area usually is.
Her voice is just amazing. If she just talked into a microphone, I would listen to every video. ❤😊😝
Caroline Ingalls who??
lmfao Wicked Skatewear has made so many tshirts for me over the years. They were my unofficial roller derby tournament clothiers. Nice to see them get exposure! Love you guys, Saf & Tyler!
As somebody from Virginia, I already appreciated the Williamsburg content, but then you bought the necklace from candy corpse which is one of my favorite shops! 🥰 I feel seen!
The sheer amount of accounts I’ve followed from this video is astounding
OMG SAF YOU'RE BEWITCHING (heh) IN THE GOTH OUTFIT I LOVE IT
You could tuck the overall belt doobies inside the rings. I loved that witchypoo outfit.
You can image search things now on google and maybe other search engines.....  So believing that Instagram can scan your photos and do the same thing to me is not that far fetched.
your house looks like jennas?!
It's incredible how I can sit through a 38 min video from Safiya and Tyler, but can't watch a 10 min documentary for class hahaha love your videos!!!
I love how she’s still using the same intro she chose from one of her videos❤️
i really loved the witch look
You should try a cute pastel alt look I think you would look really cute ( you don't have to this is just a suggestion ^-^)
Oh no safiya fell into a drop shippers page oof 😭 the power puff girls tank was deff from ali express >.<
26:48 I love this outfit on you
So so so good. Thanks for the amazing as always video! Much love.
You rocked all three looks❤
Never realised instagram had a shop tab, but I just checked mine and I feel a little bit attacked right now. It’s incredibly accurate, it’s embarrassing!
Safiya = Biggest ONCE
Your house gives me Jenna marbles feels.. are y’all neighbors?!?
An e-girl make-over would be really cool
I love you guys jsjsjsj
THE SECOND OUTFIT OMGGGG IM LIVINNNNG
She would have been burned at the steak during the salem witch hunt.
YESS. SHE IS BACK.
I’m so so happy that you have Twice and Blackpink on your feed
I’m pretty sure that the second “catcall” they said safiya
https://youtu.be/GN-PJ6qAro0  Mia maples did this video six months ago! Please give her credit (:
Tuck the suspender straps into the ring. Try that pink jacket with that skirt (which will cover the rings anyway). The angel is an appliqué.
I love the goth outfit so much!! I wish I had the confidence to wear that in public bc I hate attention 😂
“Show her a baby account!” That comment was hilarious!!!!!
Let's take a moment to appreciate how much effort and time Safiya and Tyler put into every video!! There's not a single second in any of their videos that isn't sooo well thought out and meticulous and you can really tell how much they put into it 💞💞
The black outfit really suits - i would prefer it without the white writing but the shapes of the top and skirt look ace on you.
I love the care and time that you both put into this channel. It gives us truly great quality videos. And that's why I do not care how often you post. I'll be here for each video release. ☺️
Safiya, your bonnet is on upside down. The bit with no lace is supposed to be at the back of your neck.
Safiya, it was soooooo nice to hear "Hello Friends" in your tone. I missed your voice so much. Brought back memories from lockdown when I binge watched your videos. Keep waiting for your videos eagerly! Love you. ♡♡♡
Loved the video but as someone who has lived in Oregon, please pronounce it “Ore-gun” and not “ore-gone.” Makes me cringe every time.
the pink wig on the goth outfit with fishnets would be closer to egirl than what she actually chose for egirl lol
As someone who was born and raised in VA, I totally support your trip to Williamsburg.  As a kid and adult I would make frequent trips or field trips there.  Very fun and lots to do.
You look gorgeous! Seriously you look amazing saf ♥️
The wig looks amazing but it’s not really her. She still look good 😌
So Egirl is just modern Emostyle with a more Nu.Gith influence? I like that!
Who else had never heard of e-girls before this?
safiya ] grab you're vacuum cleaners  Tyler ] it's modern sanderson for sure me ] aaaaaaaaaaaaaa you guys really did watch Hocus pocus meeeeeeee tooooooooo yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Tyler did too good putting that wig on you! And you look damn good with pink hair sexy lady!
Safiya it looks nice on you also the pink hair for suits you a lot (you did well on putting the wig i wear wigs on daily bases)
Always worth waiting for!
The 3rd outfit would have been fine without the wig.
It's ok to be child free as long as you want/need (including forever) You do you Safiya <3
Omg petition for Safiya to dye her hair pink!!!
Yes the intro song! 😁
Go to Colonial Williamsburg dressed as a witch. Now THAT will be...interesting. I wonder how in-character the actors will be.
I love your videos Saf!!!! :D
Safiya you gotta know people love the cottage core/colonial type of fashion trends so please just be a gothic butter churner
Omg safiyaaaa you look suuuper pretty in those first two outfits 🥺💞 I loved the first look with and without the bonnet, although I feel like without the bonnet it looks way more badass, almost and Anne with an E vibe. The second look was just a dream come true for the lil goth inside me, like those boots are fucking gorgeous!! I’m gonna be honest, though, and say I didn’t really like the third outfit, partly because it isn’t my style, partly because it isn’t yours either (I mean this in the sense that I’m not used to seeing you in that type of clothes, I don’t think it’s bad to step out of your comfort zone fashion-wise at all), and partly because I think it was too much pink... the wig on its own looks quite nice imo but I thought it was too much when overlapping with the pink jacket.  For anyone who actually read this, I just think it’s fun to comment on the outfits and put my opinion out there, I know that it doesn’t really matter and it’s one comment among thousands, so even if it did matter nobody would notice it anyways, but I just think it’s fun. So thanks for reading this insignificant comment, and I hope you have a nice day :)
The witch outfit is fiiiiire
I can tell it is wing instead of looking like real hair
🗣Arent we all inspired by Sammi Sweetheart?! LOL
Hehe happy to see Taylor R on your feed!!
The editing on your videos is just impeccable I Stan
Why are you wearing a mask outside? Lol
I thought they were in jenna marbles’ house
The overalls might feel more comfortable if you tuck the ends of the straps into the rings
The gothy witch look was ridiculously hot 🔥 I wish I could pull it off
The first outfit looks kind of super comfortable??? And I looooove the belt
Saf: "Are these 30$ or 57$?" The item: "27$"
How about combining the pink jacket and the ppg-shirt with the black goth skirt? ... I think this could look really good :O
I just went shopping for the shoes! They don't have them anymore! How sad, they are beautiful. :) :'(
good, i have a thing for pink haired saf
Oh miss you!
oh my god, i wish you had a posh mark or depop so i could snatch those boots and jeans, i’m in love. i’m so happy that you uploaded, we missed you!! :)) 🖤🖤
ty for FINALLY posting. im not pissed nope. not at all. jk love u saf
Safiya should try to dress like an E-Girl.
The way you say Oregon.  It's OR-UH-GUN.
Your vids are always impressive. Thanks Safia and Tyler
I love Saf's videos. Her and Tyler have such a good dynamic
safiya ] Sisters Tonight We fly  me ] yesssssssss Have you Watched Hocus Pocus yaaaaaaaaaaaaa
The not so egirl outfit looks good together and it looks good on you
I definitely think the pink hair works...
Safiya in that pink wig reminds me of lavagirl🙈
I love when she shows all the e-girls and she included Julen 😭
Safiya is ONCE!! A fan of TWICE
I’ve seen her in black for years, and the pink wig suited her, but it’s weird to see her in any colors!😂
I just can’t get over how she looks like Morticia Addams so much in this video and I’m living for it
You should've added some pink glasses with the ping outfit-
My favorite from each piece is the blouse for the first one, the shoes for the second, and the jacket for the third. They were all so cute 🤍🖤💖
Is that Jenna Marble's house or just really similar?
Wear true e-girl fashion for a week!
I'm wondering if the belt flap things on the skirt are supposed to get tucked into the rings
Internet made me buy it Should be a Sub Reddit  r/IMMBI
When Tyler said you will have pink ass hair I laughed 😆  TY
We need Brad Mondo to turn your hair pink
the more i look at the third outfit the more i think it looks really cool?? like it's not ur style but also suits u?? at first i was not vibing but by the end i like,, wanted it also ur not alone in thinking that was an egirl look lmfao i refuse to believe that is not?? i only just started figuring this stuff out pls don't ask me to reevaluate
Safiya, you looks so beautiful! I'm in love with your hair! ❤️
And plus you know those masks that you wear don't protect you at all they are just sucking in the bacteria i am a doctor honey i know i just thought I would give you some advice
The pink outfit looks like what Dani from Bly Manor would look like in 2020
God i missed so the “Safiya’s new intro song” theme
Try the goth skirt with the straps hanging on your waist like 2005 punker
Love her kitchen! Also did she move into jenna’s house?
safiyas house reminded me of jenna marbles house so much- JDJFND
There are only two possibilities :  1. You've subscribed to safiya because of simplynailogical  2. You've subscribed to simplynailogical because of safiya
Waking up right now, saw the notification, clicked. Wonderful morning ^-^
You could totally make a great outfit with that blouse
I feel validated. I’m not the only person with a bunch of TWICE fancams interspersed in my Explore page
Can we just talk about the twice content  😂😂😂 we have a fellow once
“Never mind.”
Saf really suits pink
Omg your skin looks good !!!!!❤️
Safiya needs to be sent back to the ladies academy for good young women because I am scandalized!
But that home screen wallpaper tho...
I LOVE THIS INTRO ITS MY FAVORITE AHHH
12:38 *Me too Tyler*
Omg safiya should try larping
This video was too funny I want those starry moon shoes!! And saf your hair and everything so pretty 😍😍😍
Safiya you can see the reason you get the ads you do through your settings! Mike’s Mic just made a video about it.
The pink jacket with hearts and the matching skirt is soooo cute <3
I adore her videos 😍
Omg our explore pages are so different. Mine is almost all golden retrievers. 😂😂🤷‍♀️
god i love saf 😭
5:01 there is a trans pride flag!!!
I literally said the exact same words, just before you did, about the cutouts in the heels of those boots!
I think that store took the longest bc it just had items you commonly see on AliExpress 😅 like maybe they had to get it in from AliExpress first or they were an AliExpress store
Just a heads up. That image of the power puff girls is most likely stolen fanart. I've seen it all over the internet and I'm pretty sure that store is using it without the artist's permission
you just thought you could move into jenna marbles’ and julien’s kitchen WITHOUT US KNOWIG LOL
I love all the looks
Your way of presentation is so much fun, even someone who is not into fashion can laugh and smile with them. I wish you two all the best! (it's very intruding babystuff is marketed towards you as newly weds... not only internet and family are after one, the ads are at it, too!)
So glad you’re back and posting more! Fun, awesome humor, and very well done. You and Tyler total couple goals...like Gomez and Morticia. The black outfit super flattering! 😁
safiya and tyler's house really looks like jenna and julian's house
I love it im from Virginia and would go to the reenactments all the time its a big deal in Virginia. I've always wanted my own old school outfit for them.
Incredibly upset the rouge and wolf boots are out of stock :(
This makes me want to see a wardrobe swap with Pretty Pastel Please even more.
I'm never opening the Shop tab. Too dangerous.
The third outfit is exactly something my friend would wear though 😂 she rocks the look... and used to have long pink hair (that exact color, although she recently cut it shorter)
Can we have a day in the life of Saf & Ty? From skin care routine, to work out routine, and what you do day to day. I love you so much Saf & Ty. My fiancé and I are Sam and Ty and you guys remind me so much of us. ❤️
Omg the ""e-girl"' look looks like Olivia Obrien hahahah
omg can we talk about her skin? It’s freaking glowing ✨
You and Tyler are adorable and I'm so jealous!!
"We're ready to church some butter" *thrust, thrust* "That's just inappropriate. " 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
does anyone know where her white sneakers are from ??? NEED THEM !
2nd outfit suited her perfectly among all of the.  She look soooo beautiful in it.
SAFIYA you literally DRESSES UP as BRATZ wdm “why is this being advertised to me?”!?!? 😂😂😂😂💗💗💗💗
I actually really like that pink wig on you it’s super pretty!!
I absolutely don't know why but I really LOVE the pink outfit on you 😻
The Second One Was Such A Hit 🔥  It looked so edgy and so Saf ♥ I wannnnntttttt themmmmmmm 🌟
Twice in that explore page thoooo 💞
The pink outfit was kinda my favorite 😂😂 that hair looks good on you girl!
That e-girl Facemask, I want it!
It's just Mark Zukerburg's way of turning instagram into another facebook
I want to steal the witch outfit I like it so much ahaha
It’s an American Dutchess add! Look at it. With Bernadette’s shoes and everything!
SAFIYA YOU LOOK SO PRETTYYYYY
Yawn...
"hello fellow kids"  there is an impostor among us
That pink hair SUITS u tho. DAAAAANG
The bonnet-off look gave me Crucible vibes for some reason?
19:57 she didn't... she didn't put both of the skirts on,,, that,, that's just the underskirt I-
I’d love to see Safiya and Bernadette Banner collab once Quarantine is over!
The Virginia joke is appreciated 😌😂
It’s either indi or baddie
I think the last outfit might've been better with a blond with? I can see it working with a blond, straight, shoulder length wig
As an Oregonian, part of me died at how you pronounced Oregon.
Oh my GAWD I’ve missed you videos. They bring me so much joy
who else is european and having flashbacks to the sexy butter churners of eurovision 2014? saf you have to look them up. they will speak to your soul
My favorite outfit is propably the second one, i loved that. She should wear more of that type of style cuz it really looks good on her🖤🖤
No one :  Safiya : THEY DO ! THEY REALLY DO !!!!
Safiya made a shout out joke to Virginia, my state! Yesss!
Why is nobody talking about that she is in Jenna Marbles kitchen??
In love with her overall goth look 😍
E-girl Safiya reminds me so much of Marina and the Diamonds. Anybody else see it?
I think the extra strap is supposed to be tucked into the O-ring on the skirt. Maybe that will help?
I feel like Safiya makes the same video like 5 times
bro they put the shop tab where the notifications are and put reels where u usually press to post something on one of my accounts...
I love the second look and what tyler said was super right an insta morticia i dig it
Are you gonna do a video where you dress like American girl dolls for a week bc I would be down
i love you thank you for being here <3
3rd outfit is very much marina and the diamonds vibe
Damn, almost forty minutes of safiya. 2020 already getting better imo
That gothic outfit it sooooo nice 🖤
You should mix as many hand sanitizer as you can
The wig with the second outfit would be cute
OKAY WAIT TWICE ON HER FYP THO
Who else noticed that she has 138 text messages! Like how could you have that much
I got swashbuckling pirate when she took off the bonnet—
Safiya 😭😭😭 pluck the lace of the wig please i beg
The “e- girl” clothes are more soft girl
My little costube eyes did not miss the half second the Bernadette oxfords were on the page 👀
I actually loved the witch look and very much enjoyed the ‘e-girl’ look!
Safiya is a confirmed twice stan
SAF MY FAM JUST WENT TO WILLIAMSBURG AND I WOULD GLADLY go JUST to SEE YOU
hello
Saf is becoming the president of onces
I can tell she’s from the Midwest but how she pronounces Oregon
i looooove the wig!!!
Yayyyy I'm so happy! This is exactly what I need 😭❤️
i zoned out sometime during the video and when I snapped back to reality the first thing I heard was "this girl's either a witch or a civil war re-enactor"
The wig looks nice, and this is said by somebody who uses them since 2014. Just be careful when you brush the wig with large toothed combs (not a brush, a comb, possibly something you'd use on wet hair), start at the end and be very delicate or you'll create a lot of knots and oooh boy... when your long wavy wig starts getting knotted the only cure is scissors! 0.o Next video... 'collecting vintage items on Amazon'... I can see you order a butter churn XD
Hi Safiya, this was another very cool video. I didn’t feel that any of these looks were you, maybe the witch one without the straps. Keep them coming 😍🥰😘
As a kpop stan I really wanna know who Saf’s favorite artists are. Pretty clearly twice from her explore page and other kpop vid but who else?
Saf looks like she is dressed like Morticia Adams at the start lol.
OMG, your wallpaper is so funny though!
First thing I saw was the nipple tassels. lol
Ok I'm 100% gonna go buy those moon boots and the pink "e girl" jacket tho like they're so damn cute
You should do a video about dressing up like American girl dolls
Omg, the second look WAS SOOOO GOOD!!!😍😍😍😄
Alternative title: Safiya unintentionally discovers cottagecore (see outfit 1)
i miss safiya 🥺
Oh you brought back the old intro i  missed it
safiya tradgoth makeover when
Send saf to colonial Williamsburg
Here Tyler the credit you deserve. The wig looks great Tyler
i like that "heLLO BOX"
the one time i went to colonial Williamsburg my siblings and I were dying of heat and we had to beg our dad to pick us up from there
The second outfit looked sooooo good on you !
69k likes and 420 dislikes *NOICE*
I used to work at CW, side note it’s weird seeing people I know in your video, but don’t have any pull there anymore. Really wish I did!
Hehe
Wow that was ... cringey
Sorry I was sleeping when this aired
7:40 I have those exact boots from Memery and they are INCREDIBLE, inspired by World War 1 field nurse boots. It's a wonderful small business from Denmark run by one woman. Anyone interested in kick-ass vintage reproduction shoes should definitely consider supporting her!
I had surgery yesterday and this is exactly what I needed in my life
I loved this video!
I’ve missed these videos!💝
safiya.....safiya.....the 3rd outfit was not  e-girl.....it was a soft girl
she looks so cute with the pink wig!!
The reason the powerpuff shirt was such poor quality is because it's a cheap china rip-off of an omighty design probably sold for 2$ on aliexpress and wish!  It kills me to see all these instagram boutiqes reselling this stuff for 10 times the price..beware!
Where did she buy the face masks?!!
Your house looks like Jenna Marbles house. Omg
the 'goth' look has to be my favourite :P
Oh and btw I’m legit a witch and I did Civil War reanacting when I was a kid.
Don't worry Safiya. If you decide to ever have a kid (of course you don't have to do anything, and yes it's rude af to ask*!) people will ask when you're having another as soon as you deliver the first...  *We tried for 6 years for ONE. It's so rude.
14:19 Reminds me of LaurenzS ides ”How ya doing fellow kids” tik tok intro!!
omg i see blackpink and twice on your explore page  dshakdfskd
I checked mine. First time. First is Kmart. All the rest are mainly dog and puppy stuff 😂
You should send that wig to Jaymes Mansfield for a transformation
3:10 Me: Yay!    My cup noodles are ready! Update: Those noodles were goood!
My mom would have been so upset to see you put those boots on the counter. 😂
i think the thing with most of these “smaller” companies is that they sell limited sizes and really only cater to small/thin people. brands like these for for thin people with lots of money to spend.
Zukbot is trying to kill all of us
The last outfit actually looks pretty nice when Saf "half-wears" the jacket. Anw. I hope everyone's having a great day!!!
Thanks for the fun video.  The second outfit is definitely your vide.  I also love the shoes!  Keep up the great work.  Hope all is well, and you guys are hanging in there.
Yo, you got the same house as Jenna marbles now 😂
"hello fellow kids, I am one of you"
the last fit makes you look like you shld be in the boy with love music video
Ngl the witch outfit is my absolute favorite 😍😍
Safiya is really hinting that baby 👀
Saf: Aren't we all inspired by Sammi Sweatheart?  Do we all not live our lives with Sammi Sweatheart as our due north?  Me an 18-year-old guy who's never heard of her: Yes, of course.
You finally posted!
Soft pastel Safiya is my favorite safiya
Cannot stop laughing at "pastel edit cousin it"
Don’t worry, Tyler, I chuckled at “the MEMES...of productions” 🤣
Love your video 🖤
Honestly you look amazing in all of these outfits Safiya! <3 I weirdly love that pink wig on you, feeling a strange urge to buy one myself...
Can u plzzz try cupping I would really love to see it
The realisation that Goth Milk was indeed a pun gave me a good chuckle.
Omg I’ve never been to Colonial Williamsburg but I would love to go! You know that you could have Tyler get a pirate sort of outfit and then you could be pirates when you guys decide to go. (One of the legends behind the disappearance of everyone at Jamestown was that pirates got em). Omg and you should go to a Renaissance Faire!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
it’s not g-girl it’s soft-girl
Also imagine that Instagram algorithm becoming sentient and thinking "Okay this girl is a fan of black gothic witches and pastel pink E-girl culture... How do I mesh that?
e-girl outfit was definitely my favorite. where did you get the mask for it?
Love the new video!! 🥰 hope you’re staying safe and taking care of yourself
I’m honestly surprised that an Oh My Girl’s Dolphin video didn’t wiggle it’s way into Safiya’s explore page 😂
Wow with the unboxing aspect of her video, the literal part where she is sitting at the kitchen table, I could not get over how shiny her skin was. She must have great levels of melanin!
The “historical” outfit hurt. Like it looked like a 1970’s/bicentennial nightmare.
I love how supportive Tyler is even with ridiculous ideas! ❤❤❤ Saf:  Destroy every mug in our home and glue them back together! Tyler: Dude, that's a sick video.
Your hair MOOOOOM;!!!
no but i actually love the third look???? giving us 90s it girl
I love how much Twice is on Safiya’s explore page!
I'd never imagined getting this much joy from watching someone pretend to be a dairymaid.
"You can control the MEMES of production" Tyler, 2020, being better than us 24/7
Hah literally looks like you’ve moved into Jenna marbles house!
Those jeans are awful. High-waisted jeans are just always awful. Period.
the second outfit looks SO GOOD!!! also you should make a video wearing fun wigs
“Aren’t we all inspired by Sammi Sweetheart” god I miss OG Jersey Shore
I would be interested in seeing how your FYP/shop tab change after doing these
That pink look 🔥
I want "Gothic Fanny Packs" on a shirt.
Oh I see some Bernadette shoes! Get it, American Duchess ads!
That pink jacket actually looked really cute on her!
good morning homies!
PLEASEEEE do these more
Yes, YES! Do the 'Frankenmug' video! 🤩🤩 But maybe not wreck all your mugs, just 2 or 3
Yes, PLEASE go to Colonial Williamsburg :D
so happy because of the video, also saf is stunning with the long hair - middle part, love the vibez :)
Okay, but can we just appreciate Safiya's phone wallpaper? xD
SAF the rings are there to tuck the flaps into, like with a belt!
Love to see those Twice videos on your explore, safiya 😂❤️
The goth pink is fire on you, and you can totally pull it off! You can pull off the “egirl” outfit too but it doesn’t look like you at all! The first outfit is... not to wear all together unless you’re at a historical fair or something. Love you guys!
OK but the last outfit gave me major Marina and the Diamonds (electra heart) vibes!!
tbh as a non-gen z person I definitely thought that was an E-girl outfit too...
DO A FRANKEN MUG OMG YEEESSSS ☕
It's always so much fun watching Safiya
Loving Safiyas ig explore page!
The second outfit was everything ❤️
You look sooooooooo cute with a middle part!!!!!
It’s so strange to hear people not from Virginia reference colonial Williamsburg
Love the American Duchess plugs!
The witchy vibes look so good on Safiya 👀
That 'memes of production' joke was excellent.
These videos are so inspiring ☺️
PLEASE make a skating video :D
The Intro Song!!!!! YES!!!!!!!
Yaaaay!💞💞💞💞
Those jeans... soon 80's mom. They are begging to be prancersized in.
Safiya, I have friends who work at Colonial Williamsburg! Please contact me if you need me to forward you with any contact information!
That witch outfit is amazing!!! I want it!!!
ohmygod you looked intensely beautiful in the witch outfit!!
I’m from Richmond Va and I’m like an hour from Williamsburg between Halloween to Christmas colonial WB is amazing and def ur jam... Va isn’t all lovers got some shit ass drivers too🤣🙄
ooh maybe do an egirl makeover cause i feel like she would look so cute. and the character would be amazing ❤
"Do we not all live our lives with Sammy sweetheart as our due north??" 🤣🤣
'Control the memes of production' was my favorite joke of the video.
I love that I woke up to this video!!! Thank you for helping me to start my day off with some laughter, joy, and fun ❤️🧛‍♀️
Hey Saf! Have you tried sticking the flappy things into the ring of the overall? I think that would solve both, the flappy problem and the framin nip thing situation.
Safiya's intro : *intensifies* Me: ahh nostalgia 😌💓
Maybe it's just me and my lack of fashion sense, but the last outfit really works well for Safiya!! It's loud but it's cohesive.
Im a little sad she didn’t do a witchy civil war reinactor outfit because I feel like those vibes oddly go together
video idea make homemade butter
cab's ere
I loved how she wasn't worried about putting them on and going in public like this is high quality content
Last night I watched Addams family ( I swear you acted in it)
Anyone else from London where and get the joke with ‘Minga’?
As a British person all I see from the 1st outfit is armish person ahaha
The sponsor of dis video Honey is real I have it and Moriah Elizabeth has been and ice cream sandwich etc.
I know I'm being a hater, but I am concerned about Instagram pushing this amount of consumerism on young women.  Money is power.  How to keep young women from having power?  Separate them from their money by making them feel they have to have this stuff--fast fashion  and stuff Made in China.  Just my observation.  But I enjoyed the video and I am happy Saf included her opinion about the quality of the items.
YES THE CLOTHES VIDEOS ARE BACK YAYYYYY. Could you maybe do one of going to goodwill or do hot topic outfits for a week
"Do we not all live our lives with Sammy sweetheart as our due north??" 🤣🤣
Did anyone see Abby Cox in the footage on the first outfit
that tank top is a knock off from omighty
I definitely didn’t just drop 80 bucks on the witch top 😀
when the wig is more than what you have in ur wallet: 👁💧👄💧👁
that wallpaper on her phone..... gotta love it
That style is more soft girl than e girl tbh
I’m glad I’m not the only one fully obsessed with the historical costuber’s
Ok...quick question on the Powerpuff Girl tank top (which I'm in *love* with btw): Is Buttercup smoking....a blunt? 😂😂 I freaking LOVE that shirt.  I loved all the outfits actually and you pulled them off well, but I hated those dad jeans...probably because they were so on point and I see a lot of them where I'm from which is probably stupid to say, but its true. They are definitely dad jeans with the fit and everything. They looked so uncomfortable to wear too. Everything else was perfect though so amazing job! I hope everyone is doing ok during all this shit. Stay safe! ❤
i rly like the 2nd one on her the most
I really support and enjoy the content you post, but based on all the content other creators have been putting up I would appreciate if even we received more content.
The second outfit SLAYS ME, but I'm biased bc it's my style.
I never knew instagram had this lol
Tyler and Sof = goals 😍
Your hair looks so good rn! The length and middle part suit you so well :)
I actually bought those jeans a couple months back and I didn’t like the fit either so I made them into shorts!! So much better and more cute!
This video is tbh so big brain to me!
+1 credit for Tyler
Oh man, I’d like to see a part 2 just to see what else you could put together. Y’all cracked me up 😂 And now I need an actual e-girl video hahah
saf taking some seconds to remember totally spies got me really disappointed since I'm a totally spies girl all the way
So excited love the video
I bet the tiktok boys that yelled at you ✨distantly✨ are annoying... And I'm probably right
🖤
The letter that Safiya would write before dying  Hello 911 Mark Zuckerberg killed me.
I want the Franken Stein-mug.
Am I the only one that has the shop tab for one year and a half?
If you you like reenactors of history m Plymouth Plantation is VERY cool too!!  From Wikipedia:  Plimoth Plantation is a living history museum in Plymouth, Massachusetts, founded in 1947. It attempts to replicate the original settlement of the Plymouth Colony established in the 17th century by the English colonists who became known as the Pilgrims. Address: 137 Warren Ave, Plymouth, MA  (Unsure why it is spelled Plimoth instead of Plymouth) I went there when I was a teen and LOVED IT!!! I live in Ohio where we have Schoenbrunn Village. It has re-enactments also. Per Ohio’s website: Schoenbrunn Village is the site of several Ohio firsts—settlement, church, schoolhouse and code of laws. The village, restored to appear as it did more than two centuries ago, includes the original cemetery and 16 reconstructed log structures, as well as the church and gardens. Thanks for all you and your husband do!!
When opening items were you at Jenna and Julien's house lol?
Aah i missed your try on hauls! Great video, can only imagine how much work went into it! Loved the second outfit the best, it's just so you.....also, now i'm browsing through my shop feed thanks to you lol mostly expensive stuff unfortunately. Mix between classy and vintage :D
Wait is this video demonetized?
You can use acetone to remove the “Witch” from your top and wear it without it!
Turn the angelic pants into shorts and you have a LOOK!
I’m pretty sure the 3rd outfit is closer to y2k than egirl but hell knows
Safiya: that is my greatest desire... Me : did u watch Lucifer??
Their house looks like Jenna and Julien's house! The living room/kitchen layout is so similar!
I need that goth velvet dress omg. Where can I find it?
i think you could tuck the skirterall straps through the metal loops to contain them!
Wow! Can we take a moment to appreciate the perfectly matching masks? Gorgeous!
SMASH THE MUGGGSSSSS pls do a franken-mug vid
just one minute in and i feel like the algorithm learned a lot about saf's preferences since "i bought the first five things instagram...".
Her house reminds me of Jenna Marble’s house
I feel like I haven't seen a new Safiya video in so long. I was wondering if she was still making them. This was fun. 👍
Video Idea!  You and SimplyNailogical go to Colonial Williamsburg, she does nails and you do a food vid: Butter Churning!   LOL - 😅😘
Safiya is a Once!!! She “can’t stop” her awesome videos! ;)
We need a butter making video now....
Hey try out wearing saree💗😂
You are hysterical!
This background is giving me Jenna vibes
the witchy look I’m obsessed <3
Now I feel like you would thrive in a kidcore outfit
i would watch a 2 hour video by you i LOVE UR VIDS SO MUCH AND I MISSED YOU GUYS!!!!!!!!!!! love these outfits
💙🖤💙🖤💙
The 2nd outfit unboxing is like my usual unboxing video xD
Twice on your fyp 😏
A classic saf video is truly what the world needs right now!! 🤩♥️
After watching this video, i immediately went to check the shopping tag on my instagram... turns out, ignoring the actual merch of people I follow, the rest IS based on my like interactions, not spot on, but close!
Oh how I wish I had a cousin or aunt like Safiya, that would be so awesome
Please please Colonial Williamsburg, let Safiya churn butter. It’s her dream and she already has the outfit!
yes sanderson sister!!! lol😝😛
Her house looks like Jenna Marbles’ house
for the last outfit i feel like if you took off the wig it would be a lil better
Sending love from the Czech Republic. :) :) You guys are the best! :)
In germany, we don't have this 🤔
The camera angle and the head makes give me Jenna marbles vibes🥺
Hey if your not gonna take those colonial dresses I sure will! I love that style soooo much
The pink hair looks good on her
You did get the Franken-mug! Now we know where it came from.
She's the embodiment of Mortisha Adams lol I love it
Is none else noticing  her phone back round ? 3:14 Wtf?
I need those star shoes!!! 😍😍😍
Nayeon and a BDZ performance video at 0:42 tho, dang Safiya is a ONCE? Lmao idk it just caught my eye
Me trying to be cool "hello fellow kids im one of you"
Oh Safiya, my love.. You're gorgeous. ❤️
1:23 nayeon dancing to dance the night away weirdly would forever be the best meme 😂😂
I really want to see that wig with the witch outfit 😂
Pink wig it looks 🔥🔥
About the Selena Gomez horror short film. We only have a teaser posted by the director (Petra Collins) o IGTV, the whole thing we never seen 😂
The pink "e-girl" outfit looked like something grabbed straight out of BTS' Boy With Luv music video. It's a whole vibe, probably just not the vibe you were going for.
My shop page is just Gemma Collins I don’t even follow GC
But did you buy the Maleficent ears??
I live in Colonial Williamsburg!
omg the witch look is awesome!!  happy u and tiller are baaack <3
Stay with the dark colors, pink is not your color.
Why is Safiya in Jenna Marbles’ house ???!
The last one, isn’t it soft-girl aesthetic ? Idk, I’m bad at gen z-ing....
But Safiya.... Pastels?
I love her phone screen background 😂😂😂
I get loads of pregnancy and baby recs from instagram too and I mostly just use it to follow artists. Their [female = must want baby] algorithm is REALLY aggressive.
The way they say Oregon... am I the only one who noticed? Is this how other people say it???
Awww the twinkle light background   ❤
Awww twice are at her explore page !🥺
I studied archeology in college in Maryland next to Historic St. Mary's City which is the MD equivalent to Williamsburg; we did a lot with Williamsburg. I have no idea how things are in the pandemic but they are legitimately cool people whose goal is educating the public in creative ways. Seriously you should reach out and see. Or failing that I'm sure my current museum, the High Desert Museum would let you churn some butter and it's a little closer to you in Central Oregon.
Y'all living in Jenna and Julien's house? Living room looks just like theirs
38:21 When I say I cackled
When she was looking at all the vintage stuff I was literally like "ohh this is pastel egirl!!" so me too Saf, me too 😂
That is tiktok aesthetic, not E girl, good geuss tho!    :)
“Do we not all live our lives with Sammi sweetheart as our due north?”
I disagree, lose the wig n u totally rocked the pastel look.
"This is my E-Girl Outift...."  Does anyone else think she looks like she got purified and became a stepford wife? I am also have confused feelings Saf because your goth look is so on point that the E-Girl outfit makes me think Tyler chipped you and now you are a changed woman. XD No offense in anyway this reference is just the one I am sticking to.
WHY DIDN'T MY PHONE WAKE ME UP WHEN THIS WAS POSTED. I FEEL SO BETRAYED
The third outfit reminds me of Halsey for whatever reason, maybe it’s the pink hair. I think the black outfit was my fav, though the first was good as well!
Sees Twice, Blackpink and Itzy in her explore page... My love for you Safiya just got stronger❤❤❤❤💚💚💚💜💜💜💜
the witch look soooooooooooo gooooood
Anyone else notice the trans pride flag at 5:01
their house is like jenna and julien's house's half-sibling  (also y2k-adjacent safiya is iconic)
Time just flies by when watching your videos. I always get in a good mood when watching them. Love it 🤩
my american girl obssesion really sparked with the first outfit
That wig is soooo pretty
The witch outfit was perfect. It brings youthfulness and classic 90's vibes to the table in its purest form. It's a modern throwback and while you may have felt uncomfortable with the straps on the skirt, it was hands down quite flattering on you. It gave me some real "The Craft" movie vibes.
I am pleasantly surprised at how many of the same accounts we follow.
I need a video only for wig pls! You look so great with that hair
You looked so good in the second outfit!!
The dress with moons on it is just, yas girl
Such a fun video!  I thought the necklace you were wearing was familiar 😂
With the first outfit you look like a character From our little house
One of the few you tubers that I will sit through ads for. Wishing you happiness and succes girl, great content as always!
Hey saf, the look were awesome!  Btw, I think you can get rid of the flaps in the witch skirt by lacing that last part through the hoop, that way the flaps will be hidden!  Love your videos!
I live for safs videos and Forever living for the clip inserts of Jenna marbles 😍
https://youtu.be/hzXSLMeQ0es
The pinky and purple clothes literally anything that’s pastel or soft coloured is called soft girl aesthetic the opposite of e-girl
I believe the boot laces are supposed to be wrapped around the ankle?
With the last outfit I would just keep the wig and add that to the witch outfit.
How does Safiya look good in all three aesthetics,, this is true witchcraft
Other ppl about cat-calling: *be extremely serious and stuff*   Saf n Ty about cat-calling: *joke the hell out of it n churning butter*
We all miss Jenna so much we're seeing her living room in Safiya's videos :(
Wow Gartering of Goods better thank her🤣🥳got 2200+ new followers
This video was brilliant!
This video is a delight! Somehow this captures the energy of 2020 but in a less dire way? I don’t know... but I’m currently living in Williamsburg VA and I’m a costume historian so... I both appreciated and was frustrated by the discussion of historic clothing styles! Haha
At this point instagram should just sponsor her
SAFIYA THE PINK HAIR I WILL NOT SHUT UP ABOUT THIS IT LOOKS SO GOOD
The moon shoes would look cute if you wrapped the laces around your ankles and then tied them! That way you don’t have to replace the laces and they won’t be too long!
The intro song! Yes!! 😂
That first outfit reminds me of the outfit that the cast members wear in one of the shops on Main Street at Disney World
The second outfit is FIRE!!! Omg u look so good, and the skirt is perfect for you
I just love how she keeps it real, like with her breath. Makes me feel more normal that masks don’t smell great after an hour of wear.
Thought the video was great. The witch segment made me think of the classic British horror spoof 'Carry On Screaming'. If you haven't seen it, you might want to give it a watch. Very quotable and involves most of your favourite horror monsters.
REMEMBER WHEN THAT KPOP HAIR STYLIST SAID SHE'S LOOK GOOD IN LIGHT RED HAIR AND HE WAS SO RIGHT  *Get Safiya To Dye Her Hair Faded Red or Pink Petition 2020 (!!!)*
i need more safiya video's!
If you are interested in why social media is advertising you certain adds, you should watch Social Dilemma. It's on Netflix, and it answered all of my questions like that.
you’re so pretty with longer hair ❤️❤️❤️
Haven’t heard that intro in a while
She is looking really cute in that pink outfit
what’s killing me is that safiya keeps calling everything that’s black “goth”
i wanna see that franken mug safiya
I DRESSED LIKE AMERICAN GIRL DOLLS
Is it just me or am I just miss Jenna Marbles soooo bad but Safiya's background strongly reminds me of Jenna's living room
The last outfit served me Electra Hearts vibes
The blue and pink outfits are superb 😍😍  you look awesome
Mhm, we know the truth, she's trying to hide all her bat babies. XD
I don’t think calling that one outfit E-girl is too far off actually?? Idk I guess I could have the wrong impression of that style too maybe.
omg we missed u!
While still in quarantine: “We turned out house into Colonial Williamsburg for a week.”
having a chain IN the buttcrack sounds very hardcore and metal to me
You looked AMAZING in the first outfit, btw there should be a whole video on the colonial era and such stuff (clothes and MORE!). Also, Tyler would have to let you finish your Macbeth scene if you dressed up as a literal witch 😂
These were cute!  The trendy witch was perfect on you!
I hope one day Saf realizes she could literally just talk to the camera and most of us would watch. She is my favorite YouTuber, I need more of her. 😂
omg safiya is such a once! Cant blame her cause i am too
okay but outfit two with the mask?? such a look
Minga London is all up in my recommended as well but tbf I’m from England and love 2000s style fashion
Okay what in the world the pink hair looks AMAZING ON YOU
How can one persons youtube videos be soo high quality!?!?!
Jacket with black leggings, vest or long black T-shirt jess
Saf: “I’m not sure it’ll go with the rest of the outfit cohesively” The 2000s: “yeah. Duh”  😂😂😂
I wanna see the brown skirt
“My fresh cream brings all the boys to the yard” 😂😂
Lovin the WITCH look sooo much!!! Issa lewk!! 😍😍😍💜💜💜
anyone else hearing a tap drip around 9:00 ?
Safiya's hair gives me Morticia Adams but also Lana Del Rey during the L4L era
Omg loved the witch look, Saf 🖤
I would love to see her as a pastel goth.
How do you get wrinkles out of velvet?
😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻 😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹 I feel adding the wig along w/the,:"Witch",look would be pretty lit,&you should try it out that way,too,Safiya~!!!;"3 😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹 😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻
4:30 the girl on the right looks like kendall jenner
I never knew hocus pocus until i saw it like 1 month ago
My educated guess would be that few months prior rollerskating gained quite a popularity on TikTok, and you being a young woman in California was strong enough reason to market it to you.
I love the second outfit, esp the Witch top. Might have to look for it heheheh
Deadass the exact same wig I use on the daily 😂 I love seeing you dress up so much <3
Saf is a New Age Satanic. Confirm.
Please be aware of the contribution to fast fashion/cheap awful production lines this content encourages. I´m a bit sick of this kind of novelty, first-world, "just for the hell of it" content about buying shit.   The more views these creators get, the more you will see. Please think twice about encouraging these habits, nomatter how funny or sweet the creators are, they can make better use of their platform.  Unsubscribed :(
I don’t know why but the pink wig and mask make Saf look kind of like RCL Beauty... also the second outfit is so cute! But I agree the straps are a little weird and if they were just the grommets with no loops or tassels it would be perfect!
not gonna lie, I would totally watch a video of you destroying all your mugs and gluing them back together
Oh my goodness, Safiya's skin circa 18:30 is GLOWING.
Pink hair looks so incredible on her
Am I the only one who wish to see a Franken mug?
Omg TWICE, BLACKPINK and ITZY on your explore page😍 0:35
So no one is going to talk about Safiya's wallpaper
I love the pink wig 💓
What i learned: Safiya's idol is Sammi Sweetheart
I see that Saf and I have the same depth of comprehension when it comes to e-girls fashion; that is to say, none.
When you said fanny pac it killed me cause fanny means vagina in Britain
Safiya is giving me strong Morticia Addams vibes in this video
Or a pirate wench you work it the tavern all the pirates come to
I love the second outfit soo much!!!
OMG! That witch outfit!! I just checked out the shop tab on instagram, and found it was about 50% brands and aesthetics I follow and like, and then 50% things that are popular right now.
I think the shoelaces of your goth shoes are supposed to go around your ankle at lest once.
pink hair suits safiya really well doe 🥺💘
I love how Saf had a mask to match  every outfit
"Thot-icia" hahahaha
I LOVE your "e-girl" makeup look!!!!!
When she had Jenna footage on I almost burst out crying.... I miss Jennaaaaa
I would love a post apocalyptic look soon  😃
Minga/minger is British for ugly person btw
Don’t need to wear a mask outside when there’s no one else about like . . . Actually use your brain.       Ps. The virus is fake
'Control the memes of production' Tyler is Marxist confirmed 😁
Love your videos, Saf! Really excited to see a new video.  PS, you're hilarious and also gorgeous :)
Those boots 😍
who thinks that safiya should get highlights in her hair again? it looked sooooo good in your “perfect outfit based on body type” video. you always look good, but the highlights looked amazing 🤩
Okay but did anyone else peep american duchess' bernadette shoes?
I think the wig will suit your face alot more if it had a dark root shadow
Yesss omg I’ve been missing these kinds of videos, they’re my favorite!
I’m dying to see Saf in a full black bat outfit with that pink jacket. 🖤
her an jenna marbles have similar house and i love it
Goth look was deffo my fave, it looked so good!!!!
when did you steal jenna marbles living room omg they are the EXACT same its psyching me out
I LOVE the first two outfits 😳😳😳😳😳😳❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Safiya is a Once(Twice fan) confirmed.
oh, new intro song is back
Tbh I like the wig
THE WIG
someone get this woman a behind the scenes of colonial williamsburg
do you have a shop for stuff that doesn’t fit/you didn’t like them? like a depop?
I think the pink hair really suits you. Maybe you could use the wig and do an Instagram hair tutorial video
I actually love last outfit, I just think it may not be your style, and that's why you don't feel it.  My anxiety wouldn't let me wear it though.
U GUYS ARE THE CUTEST 😭😭😭
Safiya is a twice stan confirmed
"I Dressed Like an E-girl For a Week"  Please make this happen ❤️✨
19:07 opening and try on UwU
i’m pretty sure that the pastel one was more soft girl
Am i the only one who thinks her house looks like a darker version of Jenna marbles house ???
Missed this intro
😍
Safiya we saw your explore page being full of Twice content 👁👄👁
Girl it has been months I miss you wtf
So next video a Franken-cups collab with threadbanger then huh? 😄  Yes please!
CHAEYOUNG
Does anyone else get super anxious waiting for Safs videos to be completed lol...i darent watch this video because I then know I'll have to wait probably another week for the new video to be edited and uploaded haha
I feel like the pink wing might look really good in a high ponytail
Plz do dressing like different America girls dolls for a week
In 5th grade we were supposed to go to Williamsburg. She loved it and now it is making me sad. ☹️
Hello safiya and welcome back to the internet
Thanks Saf, now I'm on the gathering goods website looking to buy something. Where on earth am I going to to where these items? Idk. But love the website 🤣  Thanks for the video. Really enjoyed.
Wig tutorial pending
am I the only one who doesn't go around those tabs?
10:13 i have that scan on my phone . it scnas stuff and shows me shops where i can buy
*please do not glue broken mugs back together* 😂😂😂😂😂 Those shoes are gooalls
I think you suchs a cutie as an e-girl 😍
where is the flower mask from??
safiya is a once.... if i could subscribe ten times more i would .
I need the boots!
The pink hair is straight Lava Girl vibes
I have to say that I was quite surprised, when I saw, Kpop fancams
The e-girl make-up is lowkey adorable on Saf.
Why did the unboxing shots reminded me of Jennand Juliens livingroom shots 😭 I hope Jenna is doing good... I love these videos Safi 😁 you are super funny and witty and all around just great person thank you for being on the internet 🖤🦇🖤
That’s a soft girl
I feel the pink cutsey softgirl clothes got recommended to you because that's what's trendy right now
wait safiya stans twice??  TASTEEEE
safiya pls make more vids
Honestly, you can pull every style ✨❤️
I'm concerned with the fact that you really don't know who you're buying from. Some of these are not real stores. They're random resellers. Sus!
Thot-icia forever 😂🖤
With the bonnet off its just 😍😍😍😍
@34:31 Love the pink hair on you! It makes your eyebrows, eyelashes, and complexion really pop. Maybe try it with the witch look sometime 🥰
the pink is more of a soft girl look
"never mind" 😂
I know its random but at 0:56 when she was talking about her explore page I saw a meme in the middle that said: Champagne: that spooky shit  Me: *girl holding it*  And I can't seem to stop laughing, I want the same explore page as her
DAAAAANG SAFIYA WITH THE GOTH LOOK IS SOOOO GOOD.
I cannot fully express how deeply “diet goth/comfortable vampire” speaks to me 😂 This is how I will be describing my atheistic from now on.
the witch outfit is so cute 🥺🥺
I loveeeee the pink jacket
And this video made me hurry right over to ModCloth to find fun cloths.
Her voice is soothing as always
please post in the morning or before  nine pm so i can watch when you post
I hope you give credit to Mia maples who did this video idea first. Much love 🥰
the pink wig actually looks so good on you, you give me marina and the diamonds vibezz
I love the witch look!
The wig looks good but the eyebrows should be lighter brown to blonde for it to look right
Safiya's skin is literally glowing
EVERYTHING LOOKS SO GOOD ON SAFIYA HOW
The third outfit is a Y2K outfit I believe, Y2K is heavily inspired by the 90s and early 00s
That black outfit looked so good on you 🖤
Your long hair looks incredible Safiya!!
Witch outfit was awesome!
"Aren't we all inspired by Sammi Sweetheart?..." 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I can't ...breathe 🙈 eating bread sticks watching this was a bad idea, I'm dying, but that's on brand 🙌🏻
Safiya is a Twice fan confirmed
When she took off the bonnet and took out her hair, she looked like the girls that used to follow Charles Manson around (100% no offence at all, I just have an obsession with serial killers and it was just something I noticed)  AND You House layout looks so much like Jenna marbles and I understand that that’s just the modern build over there in America, but the way you set your furniture reminds me so much of Jenna.
The not E-girl one reminds me of an Anime character.
I aspire to be like you. Just free and having fun. I love you and your videos
Am i crazy for did your subscribers go down from 27 million??? People needed to be more patient with you! I can’t believe that many people couldn’t handle waiting for ya! Love your videos and am always so happy when you post!
I almost never use Instagram so I checked my shop tab and it was a bunch of garbage I would never buy...they don't know me yet
Has anyone noticed all the kpop content in her explore page😻😻
the "e-girl" outfit is more of a y2k style
Oh I hate getting catcalled with my entire soul!
Loved the witch outfit!! And you can just loop the tassels of the skirt on the metal loops so they dont hang 👌👌😂
Safiya you livee!!
Omg yeeees
Safiya just stans twice, specially Mina (*´ω`*)
The pink is weird because it’s cute but it doesn’t look like safiya
This intro always makes me happy lol
I'm so excited for this one 😹
14:03 that's a half indie half e-girl
great video soph, you should do a goth haul, killstar, punkrave etc! ad compare it with cheap goth clothes!
peep the chaeyoung fancam,, saifya is now a confirmed kpop stan🤩
that second fit was FIRE
As a 1765 reenactor I am so happy to see the first outfit
Where are the masks from? I love th galaxy and floral ones 💕💕😊😊
Lucifer: what do you most desire? Safiya: to churn butter
As a Virginian and historical reenactor myself, I appreciate the joke. Feel free to visit Williamsburg whenever, Christmas is the best time to go.
You talk somewhat like Prajikta of #mostlysane.
i am more intrigued by your screen saver photo 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Me as a click : lord.  This is deadly.. Safiya showing all the cool stuff I can’t afford lmaoo
I looooove the pink hair on Safiya! Brad Mondo, make that happen!!
I love that her explore page is Twice
Safiya “fanny pack” My British self: cringes immensely
The pink hair looks so amazing on you!!
Saf i started watching the addams family tv show and I literally felt so dumb never realizing you are the closest any human being will ever get to morticia
Safiya churning butter at Colonial Williamsburg video? HELL YESS
Lovee love love the pink wig, it defiantly suits you
omg i love that twice sneak peek
I LOVE YOU
I love witch clothes. I live for dark clothes and things. I also love extra kind of clothes but here, everything is boring and same. If you wear something "weird", we get cussed and talk shit about lol. They say it's impropriate
Saf has a glorious phone background
I lowkey want to see more of that pink hair in the future
I live in Virginia and to see you talk about Williamsburg makes me happy because I never hear someone talk about Virginia and our great historical Williamsburg that no one goes to.
Omggg you follow american duchess 🤩😍
Classic safiya video! Yeeeeeeees xxxx
I want those "goth look" boots! O.O
I love everything, except for the angel jeans. 🤮
Bientôt le milliard
YOUR TELLING ME THAT SAFIYA IS A TWICE FAN???? OMG
The witch outfit!!!! Its everything
im gonna say it, that witch top looks like it came striaght out of the W.I.T.C.H. tv show not to say it looks bad, i think its cute
I actually quite liked the first and second outfits
Love how her explore page is just Twice ahahahah
the only thing about the last fit for me was that there was too much pink on top, the jacket x wig combo was a little too overwhelming, maybe if the pants were pink and the jacket denim, it would be perfect i think
Saf. Can you do a video of trying different wigs? From casual to super eccentric ones?? I would LOVE to see YOU specifically do it!! That pink wig in the vid caused my "wAnt" to see this type of video from uuuuu😣❤💕! Like. I surprisingly loVed that wig on Saf 💕
I like the second one . 😍
So it may not be E-girl but I'm getting vaporware vibes. I def think you should try a vaporware aesthetic
are we just not gonna talk about safs home screen? BAHAHAHAH
I missed you so much, and i love both of you!!! 😍✨✨💜
I didn’t know you lived with Jenna marbles
"do you like bunching?" "yeahh oh yeah"
I need a Saf-Mia Maples collab Those two can get the biggest haul ever
The "egirl" jeans were just too small and the cut didn't fit nor suit. Would be better to go for bell pants ;)
Saucy wench. DIED LAUGHING!
Missed opportunity: Franken-stein
I tried the shop and all it showed me were cat print tees lol
I love how one of your explore recommendations was Twice's BDZ performance video 😂
I want the witch outfit so bad :(
Safia you loock like Morticia with your long hair. I love it!
I can't wait to see a Franken mug video now😏😂
❤️ love the shoes with the witch outfit!
Do tiktok ads next!
Love the "Witch" outfit 🖤
Loved the 2ed outfit the most.
You mean you make frankin mug we'd watch that
nooooooo not the dollskill support 😔
Try resin art
The intro song hadn't even finished and I already liked the video 😂😂
I see some Merch! Sneaky Safiya
OMLLL SHE'S SP PRETTYYYYY!!♡♡
Omggg the "goth" look suited Saf SOOO WELLL. I think the outfit itself altogether was really cohesive too!!! I love it♡ I hope to see her try and incorporate the pieces she bought in the vid (esp the goth look tho) in her wardrobe in da future ~
You look so good Saf!
The witch one is incredible. I would definitely wear that if I had the body for it. And with a black mask? Ahhh.
Dirty candy who
OMG HOW ARE YOU SO FUNNY!!!! OMG I DIES LAUGHING AND NOW MY FAMILY THINKS I'M MAD. LOVE YOU SAF❤️❤️✨
looks like you guys moved into jenna & julien's house lol
Lol watching at 12 am
I think this is the first time i liked all the outfits in one of those videos! And they looked like good quality too!
The old? New intro song made my heart so happy
37:14  THINGS ARE SHAPING UP TO BE PRETTY ODD
I think that the straps on the shirt are meant to be put through the rings and tucked into the skirt lol.
Was the 'hwig' a reference to Wendy Williams? Also the first thing that came into my mind when you said you wanted to churn butter was Weird Al's Amish Paradise lol
0:36 okay but saf is a once???!!!
PINK hair suits you sooo good
Safiya as a soft girl is so weird but cute
I really like the 2nd outfit ❤️
Yeah , new Safiya Video.... my say is saved 💃💃💃💃
12:12 THAT was 3 YEARS ago?  Damn ;-;
OMG haha maaikesan at 11:19 is an actual friend of me. Go Belgium gothics. Go follow her insta @maaikesan 👌🏼❤️
THE CHERUBIC PANTS AND THE PINK JACKET IS MY FAVE! LOOKS GOOD!!!!!
Can Safiya start her own clothing brand, NovaGoth lolll... thanks
I am loving the power puff girls shirt. I would by that. Also I am watching this at 1 in the morning
The top half of the goth skirt looked amazing on you!
i might be losing my mind, at 24:03 i was momentarily convinced this was jenna marbles house
0:56 I see Twice feel special and of course Mina-ri ♥️ Are there any ONCE here? Because I Can't Stop Me 3:22 twice Dance the Night Night Away 3:29 Mina-ri again
Saf with color looks so weird 😂 love it tho💜💜
I would 100% buy an outfit straight out of Williamsburg. I don’t know when I’ll wear it, but I would absolutely love it!!!!
tyler just comes out with the most random funny commentary i love it
Try the wig and bonnet and Williamsburg outfit all in 1
The wig looks like very good and it looks very well put on your head. Good job Tyler -Opinions from a cosplayer
Good job ty lol
women really can't escape catcalling EVEN in a historical outfit
"Do we not live our lives with Sammi Sweetheart as our due North?"...... Tyler: "Nevermind..." The tone in Tyler's voice cracked me up! LOL
Are you news reporter
Omg the goth look is gorgeous! Ugh I wish I could wear things like that - alas too many challenges to overcome :(
Not me getting the entire Third outfit because our bat Queen looked so good in it (that includes the wig)
Don't mind me waiting for the Franken mug video thank you
Maybe they gave you roller skates because eugene was posting roller skate photo ads and you liked his posts?
I really loved the witchy-gothic outfit! And the "e-girl/pink" outfit gave me Marina and The Diamonds vibe for a second.
Those black boots are gorgeous 😍😍😍
Aww, her wallpaper
do the mug video!!!!
The last outfit is the cutest! 💞
I love that Saf can just name drop American girl doll names and I dont even have to look at the reference pictures to know exactly who she's talking about
You looked so cute in pink
mabye its because i have two modes, like all black and pastell pink, but i think you look great in the pink outfit
You are beautiful no matter what you wear!! 🖤🖤 )0( blessed be!!
She rocks that wig
not safiya having a full production of macbeth in some barrel trash cans😭😭
kpop fancams wowow im impressed
The witch outfit was so good! Safiya looked great in it <3
The pink color of the wig looks good on you, just try to mess up the part. The middle parting is too perfect/fake looking and in your face.
The Gothic witch look was absolutely gorgeous on you Saf! Loved the video🖤🦇
25:46 WHY DOES SHE LOOK HOT THERE WHA
We love a once!!!!
Uh yeah I need those boots.
I think the "e-girl " outfit would suits you pretty good without the wig
The hair tho omg... inchesss
I actually loved all 3
Safiya, the clothing you were looking at before is more soft girl than an e-girl 😂😂
"Pink ass hair" is how I live my life 💃💗
I love that TWICE and Mina and Nayeon were on her feed!! And the video is in time for their latest comeback! Saf + Twice? 😍❤️ I’m in heaven 😇
The way you guys pronounced Oregon killed me as someone who’s family actually came to oregon on the Oregon trail 😂
Omg I forgot about totally spy's
Witch or Civil War Reenactor 😂😂😂😂🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
I miss the old background! But this one is even bigger and better! Love ya Safiya! 🦇🖤🦇🖤🦇🖤
Looked at the shop on my Instagram. It was definitely not directed and was mostly Dior which yeah wtf. It was just naff looking unlike what it was in your page
the first two are amazing
I think the third one looks good overall, but it’s definitely the opposite of Saf
I thought this was a re-upload
The pink and hearts stuff is called soft girls
your livingroom setup looks like jenna marbles' livingroom (kinda) 🥺 i miss her
Very fun episode. Thanks :)
i liked the pink jacket 😔✌🏻
The wallpaper gets me every time 😂😂😂😂
I found so many items on the ig shop that were drop ships from wish, alieexpress and other cheap online stores. You should do a video comparing items sold in ig “shops” vs the same items bought on wish and see if there is any difference in the quality.
We just got our electricity back and this is my first recommended vid. I'm so happy. Been looking forward to your new upload. ❤💙💚💛💜💗
Your new home looks comfy 😍
Damn, that’s a sexy witch! 🧙‍♀️
This is not e girl . It's soft girl . I just wanted to be clear ☺
Do Americans own Iorns ?
The baby thing provable is age cause im single and dont follow anyting or interact with anything weddign, marrige or baby related and recive a lot of baby's product offer.. they provable go; woman from 25 to 35. Baby age
I think the pink long hair looks AWESOME on you
I'm really curious to see what the outcome would be if these pieces were mixed and matched into different outfits.
the witch outfit looks BOMB
Is it just me or is Safiya talking really slowly?
The pink jacket would look soo good with an all-black outfit!
Without the hat you look like a pirate haha guys you are amazing! Every video gets better🥰
Pls shop from yesstyle and offduty ,like you did w wish and rombwe
When non tiktokers call a soft girl an egirl 😂
26:05 safiya looks so pretty here
You look so amazing 🖤🖤🖤
You threw me off when you mispronounced Oregon 😂
The first outfit went from churning butter to Westworld when she let her hair out! 😻
I can’t believe how much you look like the Electra Heart era of Marina and the Diamonds in Outfit 3!!
20:52 that reminded me of Amish Paradise by Weird Al. (And White and Nerdy too)
So the pastel 80s and 90s stuff would be more fairy kei then anything else. I'm pretty into fairy kei myself...though I don't have much of anything as I'm plus size and finding fairy kei stuff in my size is impossible and expensive lol.
Do you live in Jenna's neighbourhood? House looks like the same layout.
Goth Safiya is Ultimate boss Safiya, but hear me out, Goth Safiya with the pink wig 👀🔥
I love that flower mask!! I wish I knew where it was from
Love ur content!
Omg this is sooo early wow.
Would’ve loved to see that pastel look without the wig too!! I think it would’ve looked much better
I know the pink look is really not you, but I really love it on you my favourite outfit . Especially the pink wing... now I want one 😍
hehe maybe its the middle of the night at there but for me its mornig time and this is the best breakfast beside my coffee
Saf buying random things on the internet.  Ah, that's the stuff.
I too covet Bernadette banner’s shoes...
The for you page being filled with kpop is a mood, more kpop then mine has cuz I get distracted by food videos
Why are so many Americans wearing their masks outside? In the UK, at least my experience is, we only wear them inside?
Thats wasn’t egirl, I think it was more just like soft girl or like y2k girl, I hated that entire sentence. Also those teenage powerpuff girls actually existed, for a while I couldn’t fine the clip and hist thought it was a fever dream tho
it is not egirl look, y2k is more appropriate
I keep thinking she’s in jennas house aha
Appreciate the historical clothing knowledge!
The witch outfit was my favourite on you
All the Karen's be like "honey here I come"
The thing safiya thought was e-girl , is soft girl. <3
Oh my gosh you would so suit that 70s hippie, like orange, mustard, green, flares, shirts, headbands, vibe!!! The blow out curly hair aswell omggg!
Ok I can’t be the only one that didn’t know about Instagram shop until this video
I think second outfit will look a lot better with space buns. Safiya would rock it
My god. Your skin is glowing so beautifully. Tell us your secrets 😂
Beatriz Mariano aos 11:36 minutos. 🇵🇹 representado aqui!  For the english speaking crew: Beatriz Mariano @ 11:36 minutes. 🇵🇹 being represented here!
One for the algorithm ❤️
That black outfit was so you!!
The pink hair looks amazing!
The first outfit was totally ruined by the mask
OMG I missed this intro song
Just had a look at the "shop" tab. Didn't work at all for me, follow all kinds of goth/alternative brands but was shown clothes and accessories in blush& neutral colours and some really high end brands that I couldn't afford even if I wanted to😅 it's a hard pass from me
Outfit 2 was fucking amazing
You should do every YouTuber’s skin care routine!!!! Btw thx for the awesome videos!
The witch outfit is everything omggg 😍😍😍  For the straps of the skirt maybe could u put them in that circles at the end of the straps? 🤔🤔
tuck the extra strap into the hoops <3
Can u do dressing up like a certain celebrity for a week. Or maybe choosing a pop star and dressing up in outfits they wore in their music videos for a week?
You looked amazing in the witchy outfit & those moon shoes were awesome!
Add the pink wig to the witch outfit just to try it, I think it'd be fun
It’s crazy how she still has this intro.
That goth outfit was absolutely amazing!!!
her skin is glowing!🌟
I think this video just proved that women get catcalled no matter what they're wearing 😅
The pink wig looks stunning on you!
Ah girl. I wish 'honey' was available in Italy, I would have tried it ;) I'm cutting my online expenses to the bones, here where I live the situation is NOT good. Another lockdown, here we go! T.T I hope there is better, even if I'm worried a lot for your elections. 0.o
First I need this shoes, seconed I would watch the mug video  Have a nice day
You can pick the witch embroidery off if it’s too much for everyday wear
I love Tyler’s fashion commentary like where Safiya says “ it has potential “ and Tyler goes “ oh yeah definetaly”
Pretty much anytime I want to watch something mindless I rewatch Jersey Shore
She's turning into morticia addams
i love those shoes!
Hope she's not gonna get cancelled:'*
the masks fitting with the outfits are giving me life 💕
i love how twice is in your home page on ig hahahah
"Virginia is for lovers" What about Ohio then?!?
the 2nd look reminds me of one of those chinese streetwear tiktoks
watching these videos just makes me want to buy more clothes... also how could you forget totally spies, that show lives rent free in my head
this video gives me anxiety. you guys don't wash, disinfect items delivered by post before touching them all over?
safiya u look so beutiiifuuuulll
The first look without the bonnet had a casual pirate on the weekend - vibe 😁😍
The third look almost looks identical to what Carrie from Julie and the Phantoms would wear 😂
that goth fit
30:35 gave me pinky pie vibes. Just wanted to say that.
I think it would be so cool if safiya downloaded a whitching book and then chose a spell (not dark magic) and then tried it and see what happens. Remember this is just an idea its not intended to do it its up to Safiya.
CEO OF:hello friends and welcome to another video
Why don't u post more often 😔
She protecc  She attacc  But most importantly  The intro is bacc
Your videos are a whole episode. Love it
Yes, but now imagine if every piece of clothing had a wish-like description
I see in this vid that you follow both killstar and dollskill, thats a yikes from me Safiya.
Or GONE trail 🤦‍♀️ as a Oregonian im bugged
New Saf video: getting snacks, making tea, coffee, settling in with a cat and a comfy throw - best morning in quite a forever!
Isn't that gapped part of a bonnet supposed to go to the neck?
the first look without the bonnet reminds me of a -pirate-esc outfit.. it looks great eitherwise!
Joey has been real quiet since Safiya's ' how you doin' '
OMG TWICE!!!
She looks so pretty in the black outfit 🥺🖤
AHHH I love those witchy outfit shoes!!!!
Worth the wait-I have to watch this before a tropical storm heads my way in case I lose power. PS I love how the ends of your hair is auburn :)
Mia maples did this first 💖
🖤 the Hocus Pocus reference
Me living 15 minutes from colonial Williamsburg 👀👀
love how twice is everywhere
I missed this!!♥️
Omg her makeup free natural face she is truly beautiful like Snow White DO NOT NEED MAKE UP
I was waiting for this for almost a month
The first lewk was fun. The second look was so natural like a normal outfit for her. The third one is funnnn hahaha 🤣
I really liked the not an e girl outfit outfit. Made me wanna feel empty inside and listen to teen idle by Marina on repeat
Or-again. Not Or-E-Gon
Janet voice: Not an e-girl
Yay new video !  I missed your videos ❤️
The pink looks super good
Had to stop at 0:38 because I saw my TWICE Bias in my favorite YouTube content creator's video! When my two worlds collide!! ❤️
Oml that witch look was amazing
New video!!!!!!! Yay!
When your hair is parted in the middle, you look like Morticia Addams. Love it. 🖤
I NEED to see a video where Safiya wears a full on historical outfit or learns how to sew a historical dress (featuring bernadette banner :P)
You look so pretty here xx
Yesss Safia posts videos again
Why no info on prices? I bet that stuff is overpriced.
what u thought was e-girl is soft girl i think
Chaeyoung Nayeon 😢😢
ain't gonna lie but them enchanted bikinis look fun same with the bone me bralette lol
did honey safe you something tho?
safiya the girlgroup stan
id be careful with such print shirts a lot of them are stolen fanart but otherwise great video!
I love how the finger movement lines up with the intro song at that one moment
I’m not gonna say that your e-girl assumption was wron... because those are definitely things an e-girl would wear. So you were somewhat accurate, lol. But if you wanna be the most accurate, take the makeup and the wig of the third look and put it on the second look. And maybe the jacket.
I am so unlucky today , l saw this video on my homepage just 3 minutes after its release and couldn't watch it because l was in middle of my class :( btw funny homescreen photo
One time I watched one of your videos when I was high as shit. All I could hear was heLLooo FRIIennndssss. The pitch of your voice goes up and down so much in a sentence it mesmerised my high ass, dw I’m drug free for a year now 💪
I'm impressed with quality...cuz not all online shops have that good quality stuff^-^
the masks are so cute i need the flowery one🥺🥺🥺🥺
Thats not E girl its soft girl
you went from butter churner to Carrie Dayton real quick when you took off the bonnet
How can somebody look this good in a mask tho
*sees safiya wear pink* me: I can die peacefully now.
please do the mug breaking video
Oh no this is too dangerous, my shop page is way too cute
Those jeans look SO good on you!!!!
the way she pronounced dormeuse or poseur... I just can’t. Please put those in a translation program and listen to the lady speaking French. 😋
The way Mina and Tzuyu was shown in there 🤧
Just how is it possible for Saf to actually ROCK and look like a GODDESS in ALL of these outfits 😳 I’m so confused but also so aesthetically attracted to all three versions of Safiya. Also - the Make-up is on POINT 😍
Tbh wig application isn't super hard, the amount of times I've done it in a convention bathroom yo avoid it getting tangled an route
Yass TWICE in my favorite youtubers didsovery page🧁❣️❣️
I'm obsessed with that cropped pink jacket on you. This was so interesting to watch 😄
PLEASE PUT CAPTIONSSSSSSSSSSS
You look amazing! Wow! And even though the pink look isnt your vibe necessarily, your figure kind of looked really really nice in it. However it did in the black too, so it might just be you and not the clothing. I love that your confidence seemed to be back a bit more.  You're doing great! Continue 😄
Love the second outfit 🖤
Safiya you look more beautiful in every video!
Has there been a decision for Saf to speak more slowly in videos? Not bothersome, just an observation
I lovedddd the third look, it looks amazing, if only the pants fit better, I also liked the second look, loved the video ♥️♥️
Credit to Tyler, the wig doesn't look that bad! Especially for first-timers, that's pretty good!
Safiya thinking the 90s renaissance vibe is egirl fashion is lowkey adorable to me. I definitely understand the butter your brain was churning
I loved all the outfits
the last outfit is perfect 😭😭
Saf in the first two outfits I'm like "Oh it's Saf!" however that third outfit, literally for the life of me cannot tell it's you even when you're talking (i have really bad facial recognition issues), so to me, like, if you wanted to be outside and not get bothered that is the way to go as I'd assume you are Belle Delphine before I'd think you're Saf XD
the pink does really compliment your skin tone, I loved it! :)
Why are they in Jenna and Julien's house
jesus i *neeeeed* that PPG tank top <3
I loved Outfit number 2!! I fricken love it.  I might have to buy it for myself.
for people in Germany: honey doesn't really work, sadly. More of a US is thing I guess
I've been waiting for an "internet made me do it" for too long, I'm so happy!
Amazing love the 2nd outfit plzzz make qna video nd house tour video
I love you and need you! Thanks for this video!
I was unreasonably excited to see pearls and swine in your suggested. She’s an artistic inspiration and also a funny and smart lady... if you ever need a one of a kind amazing hat she’s my favourite
The pink outfit  was totally great nothing weird everything matched so like idk :D it's really really simple outfit  and just cute :D so great! It is very BRATZ like!^^
"Diet goth, comfortable vampire" 😹 this is how I now identify
I can't get over how beautiful Safiya is. Tyler is one lucky dude.
Alternate universe Safiya
Totally love the black outfit
You are an idol to me  I even look up to your relationship with Taylor  I’m 22.. and from all the people i looked up to the past few years , you are the only one that stuck You are not just an entertainer, you are inspiring.. and I really appreciate you.
For those commenting that the living room is apparently similar to Jenna's living room: y'all are creepy.
Yess saf is a kpop stan
Tyler did awesome playing a wig for the first time! My hubby would have been lost
I forgot to watch focus pocus on Halloween 🤦🏾‍♀️your reenactments made up for that.
Jersey Shore aired at that age for me as well and i will never get them out of my brain..not mad tho hahah i will most likely have to get that necklace too
WHY ARE NO ONE TALKING ABOUT HOW HOT SAFIYA IS
Omg the first outfit (without the bonnet) gives me Ella Enchanted vibes i luv it
The power puff shirt is a rip off from a brand “omighty” which is why it’s such shitty quality
I think that the wig and the pink denim can be used in your normal fashion to give it another edge. oh how fun would it bee to have the witch outfit with the pink wig >.< I mean if you want to post a pic of that i wouldn't mind lol
THAT LAST OUTFIT THOOOOO 🥵🥵
YAY SO MUCH TWICE!! ❤️
Love the video!! 👌 you are so entertaining and interesting!
For the skirt overalls, you're supposed to put the flappy part through the rings that way the cover the rings and the flappy part gets tucked in :) I hope Safiya sees this comment and tries it out.
the second fit was so cuute
Did you move into Jenna Marbles’ house? 😂  I love your videos, including this one. I did notice that your presenter voice is taking over a lot of the video though 😅 it is lacking a bit of your personality and is a bit too polished for me. I know you work very hard on these videos and it shows but maybe this is a tad over perfected? Also the music is a tiny bit too loud but maybe that’s just me. Great overall job though! Thanks for making these fun videos in a time like this.
It could be fun if you did a video where you dress up in historical outfits. There are some channels on YouTube that do these kind of outfits.
I love it so much when safiya widens her eyes dramatically like that. what a queen.
Tyler's short inhale when she says "is this egirl?" is a whole mood
Your videos are the hilight of my month
Why is nobody talking about all the TWICE / kpop videos on her explore page 😳😳😳
13:49 "now you're the butterfly meme" when i tell u WHEEZED
Even though Safiya's dad is Danish, she doesn't seem to watch Eurovision.... she'd love Poland 2014 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Omagod the wITCH outfit with the mask looks so frickin good😍
Ok so the witch outfit is so great it makes me want to play sims 3 supernatural so good job saf
I've missed that intro song alot
My favorite part of the video was the wallpaper 😁
I loooove the 'e girl' makeup on you it looks amazing
saf : sponser for this video... every youtuber : honey me : it gon be honey saf : ...........honey
Did Safiya move into Jenna's house?
“Virginia is for lovers and for reenactors. That’s a Virginia joke for ya.” Can confirm, very accurate.
Did anyone notice...safiya FINALLY got a new phone
Can we take a second to appreciate Safs Wallpaper that just looks like a drunk snap of Tyler 😂💕 marriage goals I guess
Lo e the wig and the color
Okay, safiya looks AMAZING in That witch look😍👏🏼👏🏼
I love that pink hair! I kinda wana see witch outfit with that pink wig
Anyone else freaked out by how similar Jenna and Juliens house is to Safia's?? They must be neighbours or something
I can't stop laughing every time you say Minga because it's one form to call the penis in Spanish 😂
I would wear that first outfit sans bonnet SO FAST IT SPARKS JOY
Try Indian clothing also cuz u'll gonna look amazing in Indian clothes....please try😘
Love the wig! It reminds me of Doja Cat! Maybe do her look?
She seems to lost so much weight! Looks gorgeous ether way 🌸
We missed you a lot! Loved the video and love you!
I hate the fact that this sent me into Instagram shop. I've been scrolling for hours
I waited so long for a new video....and now it is here.....
Rosé!
Omg it’s literally ‘Minger’ London and idk if you Muricans know what a minger is...
Are you going for number 5? I don't know this is out of control I need to be stopped 😂
Loved the video saf!! Really cool :) and i also appreciated that you didn't put any ad in the video, thank you 🖤🖤🖤
I loved all the 3 looks! My favorite was the last one.
Omg, I love the bright pink
Safiya: "How you doin'?" Me: OMG!!! SHE WATCHES F.R.I.E.N.D.S.!
I love how there's just a twice video there
I love the witchy outfit so muuuuuuuch 😩😩
Did you move into a house that’s a copy of Jenna’s???
You follow American Duchess!!! I love them!!! I own 4 of their shoes and their fashion book. <3
You can watch all the Totally Spies episodes on Youtube.. Just saying
That colonial shirt is a Look honestly
I saw Mia maples do this and I was so excited to see you do it too
This video is so well structured and constructed, it soothes my anxiety. Love you safty. xoxo
The first look without the bonnet is giving me some Frida Kahlo vibes
i love y'all, but the way you pronounce oregon...
Tyler, you did amazing on the wig.
the pink wig looks really good on you!
She reminds me of Sabrina the teenage witch
So much Twice in Safiya's explore tab I stan
Did you move into Jenna's house??
Please do the franken-mug video! Really want to see you two smashing up mugs and exploring the best way to reassemble 👌
Already waiting for the Frankenstein mug video☕️
👽
I looooove this! Missed your fashion vids, though I love all your content! Inspired me to go on a virtual shopping spree 😂
fuck, that witchy look.. its doing something for me. Safiya looks SO good in it!! it suits her so well.
i think the bonnet is supposed to go with the gap at the back... also maybe the that black witchy overall skirt thing you could tuck the ends of the straps into the skirt through the rings?
Her intro reminds me of phineas and ferb idky
I just looked through my shop tab. I got a lot of unisex option. 🤔 does instagram know I’m agender?
love it
The whole world is falling apart and the only thing saving us is Safiya nygaards intro song.
"MINGA LONDON" is an absolutely hilarious name for a clothing line... because in London, if you call a girl a "minger" then you're calling her "totally butt ugly"
I luvvvv the pink on you💕
are we not gonna comment on how much twice and blackpink content is on safiya’s explore page?
Oh sweetie. We can unlock our phones with our faces of course IG can scan imagine and suggest things.
Saf:“My breath must be terrible” Ty:”I mean it’s not great”  😂
I hate floppy shoestrings so I tuck them into the shoe. Pro tip!
So happy you uploaded! 😊
I can't imagine you in anything but black. So the e girl outfit was abit of a miss for me on you 🥺
Safiya honestly has the best video ideas hands down!
Just colour the witch in black! It looks so good on you.
love the pink wig.
Please do a video where you make an American Girl Doll of yourself!
I don't like the top of the suspender skirt. I feel like either it should end at your waist and have suspenders from there, or it should have a flap in the front like overalls, but it's doing this in between thing where it just looks like you pulled up your skirt way too high.
First of all... Saf I love you and seeing you makes me EXTREMELY HAPPY. Second... I need to hear BEYYYYN shouting MINGA LANDAN 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
It's confirmed sofiya is my fav blink lol i love her so much
YASSS ANOTHER VIDEOOOOO
I love the trendy witch outfit the most! You look the most flattering in it
Broooo pink wig is giving my hardcore Dua Lipa vibes. I think it’s the eyebrows
Thoticia hahah i died
😂 does this mean you need to do an aesthetics video talking to teens/college kids for help?
Saf makes a video. I click.
Woooooo
That pink wig looks so good on you tho!
Omg I just realised the first photo of taytay was in Feb geez safiya has been working on these video s for a long time   Keep up the good work saf x
I just love how you make 40 minute videos and I don't even notice that it was that long... that I'm legitimately sad that it's over 😂
I like the pink Denim jacket. The angelic geans  do not fit your hips right. Does Mr.Crusty furr-BRAT, help you edit the videos? Say walking on a keyboard?
I had never clicked that button... and I had the EXACT same suggestions. Historical, vintage, goth fashion and makeup 😂 I guess Safiya and I must follow the same accounts 😅
OMG MINGA IN SPAIN MEANS DICK I LAUGHED SO HARD SORRY HAHAHAHAHA
All looks were so amazing on you! The wig was so beautiful with the face mask and makeup *-* and I would love to see you do a video to the historical reenactment place! (once it's safe to go film there of course)
please do a house tour!!!
I think the pink jacket with one of your normal outfits or the pink wig with one of your normal outfits would be really cool actually.
No hate but I didn’t like the first outfit it looked weird
i would watch the frankenmug video lol
The clothing were you thought it was e-girl is actually more like soft girl clothing
Let her finish the scene. Geez
love the witch look!
Look number 3 is a bit like a lady gaga vibe, look 2 was amazing and you really suit it same with number 1 with out the cap lol, :) me an my daughter love your vids hope you an Tyler are keeping safe all the way from the UK x
Love your videos! Would you try a shopping spree at "Thread up"? It's an online thrift store I'm interested in and I would love to see, what you would put together there :)  It would also be an ecofriendly version of your fashion videos and it's also more affordable, I would love to see that!
I've been watching the process of how they make their videos. And i still dont understand why it takes them so long. I honestly dont think anyone wants to watch an almost 40 min long video about buying clothes on the internet and trying them on. I feel like they try to make their videos longer to compensate for the time they take to post something, but bigger is not better
The second outfit was so cute on her and ofcours them shoos damn
I think with the pink outfit if u'd pick black pants it would look 110% better. :D
I loved the “egirl “ look 😁
So Safiya likes TWICE ❤
I love the witch outfit! I need this skirt and shoes asap! <3 :) Are those shoes comfy?
Safiya posts a 40 minute video  Covid-19:cured World hunger:solved  War:ends My depression:gone... Hotel:trivago
Loved the video, you are amazing! My fav was the pink look, it really suits you 😻😻
I love that twice is in your explore page omg
I think you can tuck the tassels into the ring
I keep thinking you're sitting in jenna marbles' house 😆 I love it
to be honest I hate pink ;-;
0:36 JENNIEEEE
we love to see the soft girl fashion!!
Fun as always! And it sounds so good - whatever technique you are using i like it!  Also i want to shop at insta now 🙄😄
Safiya has an extremely different explore page than mine all I have are some friends memes and cute cats....
Saf loving historical fashion!  I really hope she follows Bernadette Banner here on YouTube.   Maybe Saf can recreate the vintage/historical witch hat that Bernadette likes to wear. 😄 I love Bernadette...(& Saf)❤️
18:56 Safiya looks so bloody good
her masks are so cute 😍
9:36 I’m nervous the skirt won’t come with petticoats
Those goth boots are everything. Everything. EVERYTHING.
0:36 omg twice & itzy on safiya's explore page!!
I can totally see pairing that peter pan collared blouse from the colonial look with high-waisted suspender skirt from the goth chic look for a bit of a gothic lolita/school girl look. Could be super cute. And those celestial boots are so cute! They make my inner goth kid sing. Is it weird to wish the suspender skirt didn't have suspenders? Because if it didn't, I would totally pair the pink with black heart jacket over top of the peter pan collared blouse with the high waisted skirt... all with the awesome boots. Cuz, what not?
Oh my god, the third look is giving me Gigi from Scream Queens so hard.
Hey it makes great viewing but have you ever considered the environmental impact of all the first hand clothing goods you're consuming, as well as the exploitative business methods you're supporting? Think you could do a great video on alternatives to fast fashion -second hand / depop / thrift to raise awareness and show alternatives to mainstream consumerism, especially as you certainly have the money to support sustainable fashion.
I was hoping for the dresses at 7:27.. you would have rocked them!
all the twice content on her explore tab .. we love to see it !!!
So I'm just observing the clips she uses to support/contextualize almost every word she says. And I'm sure this takes up so much hard work looking through your older clips to find inserts. Kudos to you! We'd watch even if it was just you talking with a blank background!
THE INTRO SONG IS BACK AAAAHHHH
safiya's goth outfit is the reason i nor identify as a lesbian thank u for coming to my ted talk
The goth outfit looks SO good on you??????? I love it so much❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I haven’t even watched the video but I liked because I love and missed you ❤️
With those 'dad' jeans, try them on in a male fashion around the hips and under the belly, you may think it too much skin, but if it's for comfort's sake then I see no qualms
Giiirl the witch outfit looked sooo good with the face mask 😍😊😊
ok but the witch look was just so cool!
Okay but you are misprounancing my state. It is pronounce Or-e-gun or like this or that, long e as in bee and gun like what you shoot.  The way you said it makes us cringe.
OMG Safiya, you are such a beautiful woman ToT!
Bone me *visible disgust*
Safiya in pink hair made me feel thing's
Saf the style u were thinking it’s egirl it’s Y2k
Safiya! How's married life treating you?
Diet goth 😆
Safiya is so much fun 5🤗❤️
Tyler has IBS?
I love the pink hair, fits you really well!
I’m here for the twice pictures in her explore page
Love all the outfits ❤️
OMG the pink wig, soo cool
saf said twice supremacy and I fully support that
you look like you belong in euphoria in the goth and pink outfits
25:25 Safiya wearing overall skirt: "OVERALL I like it"
safiya you are glowing in this video 😍😍😍😍
Omg I cannot get the totally spies theme song out of my head now.
Please do the mug video!
HIIIIIII
0:38 Chaeyoungie !♥️             👉😆👈
Omg that 3rd outfit with the wig i actually love it! It’s so fckn cute and I can’t stand the color pink but I love it! I love the jeans and the jacket ! 😍😍😍💕💕💕💕
oh damn i need that witch outfit so bad
I love the black outfit
anyone else think they were in Jenna and juliens house? it's looks so similar!
Okay but she looks sooo good in that witch outfit
Saf you should def do a drag makeover... maybe attempt one yourself or ask a (maybe well known lol) drag queen for help, or both!
What, insta has its shop? I never noticed. :D
ok let me just say, it’s 5 am where i am and i’m freezing anyway half of me wants to dress goth but the otter half of me wants to just ware ripped jeans and a loose and baggy shirt because i cannot picture myself on tight clothes because i’m insecure-
The pink wig looks SO GOOD on you!! 😍😄
THIS IS JENNA'S HOUSE
The Queen of Darkness has returned!
This is safiyas neww introoo songgggg. I missed this😍🤩
Safiya and Tyler give me hope that the straights are ok after all
Brightening up a chilly morning with your video! As another post marriage gal insta is all about trying to show me maternity shoots! I have a fur baby, he is more than enough for now. X
I think Minga London was playing on the slang “minger” which is pronounced minga but that seems like a weird thing to call your brand.. Gross London..? Ugly London..? Weird
I love the hocuspocus references (I think that’s how you say it)
You did great job and if I’m gonna an YouTuber wedding I’m gonna you and Todd I am right because I love cheese.
But like the last look without the jacket??
everytime a Safiya video is ending i get sad
Do you know safiya? I am joining your channel when your hair was long, then you chopped it, and now it is long again?!! Like, wth.. i am really into your channel ✨
the witch look it's perfect please wear it on a daily basis
is safiya secretly a once (aka a fan of twice. a K-pop group)
I'm puzzled by "Minga London"..... was under the impression "minger" wasn't a nice term in the UK!
Safiya tried to go for egirl and instead went for pastel goth
You are so beautiful it's insane 😭💗all of them fit you
Honestly love the pink hair on you🤷🏽‍♀️❤️💯
Saf looks soooo good in that pink wig imo
i loveeee tthat black bootss skirt and top aarrrrghhhhhhh!!
Im not even going to lie I think you killed these outfits!! You looked perfectly spooky in the witch inspired look! Also that wig looks so good on you!! I actually loved the pink outfit the best! I think you rocked it all around sis!
Lmao I love seeing twice on ur explore page
You can just tie long shoelaces twice; tie the long loops again ☺
the pink hair is so cuttee on you
Can we get a house tour?
I thought you were in Jenna Marbles Kitchen😂😂😂
Not particularly fond of pink but that jacket is cute though.
23:45 xD not
Sammi should totally crop this and put her on her stories. It would be so RAAAAAAAAAAAAHNdom
The 90s look reminds me of lola for degrassi next class
I mean, my instagram IGTV is  just full of clothing it's like my own shopping tab. Most of the stuff is acctually really cute
Rogue and wolf!!! Such a good brand ❤
My IG shop is filled with Korean boyfriend material guys and a hell lot of hoodies 🤣🤣
Oh my. How I miss this intro ❤️❤️
Saf is so pretty and this was such a fun video idea!
Next time try to find a fitting mask to every outfit
The whole “double double toil and trouble” scene from Macbeth took me back to GCSES Literature days 😂😂😂
14:03 omg that wig OO
Missed these videos. Actually became a follower because of the fashion eras videos. Thank you for more fashion related picks
When she takes the bonnet off, suddenly that's pretty much exactly how I dress day to day.
The amount of Twice videos in the explore tab tho...
Y’all Are saying OREGON WRONG. It’s Or i Gun. NOT oregUN. As a born native it drives us insane!! Just say it right!!! Ps I love you ❤️
Safiya you're old... and that's okay we can't know everything 😉 I don't know what myspace looked like 🤷🏻‍♀️
The last look was definitely had more of a Y2K aesthetic!
I absolutely looooove that witchy outfit on you !
damn the middle part on the wig makes it look more like a wig
As a kpop fan, can relate to having the casual fancam pop up 😂. Once you jimin  you can't jim-out  (sorry had to ok😂).
Yasss twice on the explore page
when you took off the bonnet... you looked like elizabeth swann!!!!!!!
Second outfit is my favorite
I wonder if Safiya and Jenna are neighbours, since the layout of their living room looks so similar
So after watching this video I immediately went on instagram to check out my shop tap. There are no fashion outfits there! Instead it kind of looks like the bad side of etsy where people sell stuff they made at home but it’s not really good stuff? I found vegan shoes but they are probably just there because I follow vegan accounts. So the algorithm is probably really based on the accounts you follow. I don’t follow fashion accounts, so I don’t get to buy any clothes 😅
We were only half a second in and joy just coursed through my whole soul
what? the pink outfit was legit great on you. maybe the front of the jeans is bland, but their back is nice with the art
I think with the "e-girl" that the wig actually looks really good on you
Ngl it's just a naughties outfit
you are the only youtuber whose videos i wait for so eagerly and when they come i make sure to put the video on full screen and watch in peace 😌
Your job is amazing. I’d love to just shop and film myself AND get paid!
For the witch tee, if you dont like the words on it then just rub some acetone over it and let it soak and itll rub right off
My boyfriend has ibs too lol rip Edit: If cousin IT was a soft Instagram girl😂😂😂
Omg as an Oregonian I thought people saying Oregon like polygon was a joke but it's real
Everybody is sponsoring honey it’s a good app
the like witchy/goth ish outfit was SO CUTE and i highkey want that skirt thing now
Okay but is this the same restaurant niki demar takes insta pics at lol
why does it look like she's in Jenna Marbles's house,,,,
When you took of the bonnet the first thing I thought was PIRATE VIBES😱😋
I love outfit number 3! but I'm definitely in love with outfit 2
Saf: "My breath must be terrible" Ty: "Honestly, it's not great"   LOL, goals
I love how you include Jenna Marbles' videos as reference in your last videos. It gives me hope for life.
I would like to see you do the sort of swim suit styled disney character but more in the disneybound idea frame. Like swimsuits not normally made for disney characters used for a disney style. Add matching accessories and stuff to how you want.
All these outfits and I'm still more interested in where that tops from that she's wearing while unpacking the outfits <3
when you mentioned that the wish video was three years ago i... lmao wow time goes by way too fast
I think the power puff girls croptop actually says o'mighty on it(on the bags they're holding), which is the original brand that created the design afaik
Hiii
I am e-girl 😊😊😊
I AM IN LOVE WITH EVERY LOOK!!!!
The longer I watch Safiya walk around with pink hair the more normal it becomes and the more I like it ☺️
The first outfit REALLY screamed “I saw Goody Procter with the devil”
okay the witch outfit looks so good on safiya
I love your videos. And I will always do ❤️😉
it would be so cool to see Safiya do like a "i dressed like a rainbow for a week" where she would base an outfit around one colour of the rainbow everyday!! bonus points if she wore a wig for every outfit!!🥺
Honey has never given me a discount in my whole life.  I've had the plug in downloaded for like a year now.  It's does nothing other than annoys me now.  Has anyone actually had a good discounts.
"Just a blur of pink"  Safiya calling out my aesthetic.
am i the only one who saw , when she took the bonnet off, like a very pirates of the caribbean vibe???
I love being European and waking up to a new Safiya video🍀
I would say your third outfit is more soft girl rather than E girl because soft girls have more of a pastel vibe and E girl has a more emo/scene vibe. (Edited. Nice, you are number 1 trending)
Can honey work in the uk
the last outfit looked great 🥺
I’m here to give this video a boost, carry on
I feel like safiya is the only person who doesn't need to go for Halloween shopping 😂😂😂😂❤️
safiya out here helping me with macbeth revision
So it seems I am not the only one who has been targeted with rollerskating videos on Instagram lately.
perhaps an unpopular opinion but the historical look was by far the best!!
Can u test all of christines nail polish brand holo taco and mix them
omg, as soon as you reached a certain age as a woman on socail medid you get all the baby stuff in your feed, the worst, I want cat babys not human babys.  and yeah I am pretty sure Instagram scans posts. same with whatsapp, a friend sends me picture of a new snack or what ever she got and a few minutes later I see this on my Instafeed as an ad. it's both from facebook so yeah they scan that stuff somehow
Okay, I just needed to say this. If you have seen Julie and Phatmons, doesn't the last outfit look like a Dirty Candy outfit? Because it gives that vibe 😅
That colonial skirt was skimping on the fabric, there's no way a hoop could have fit under that
I just realized the intro song is same as "weekly respill" from some Tea/Drama channel.
am i the only person who has an entire section for the shopping?? like i will never buy something through instagram— give me back my likes and following section ):::
Just me looking at her Lock Screen and Home Screen wallpaper of Tyler’s face? Yeh okay💗
Idk what you were talking about, I'D DEFINITELY SMAAAASH!!!! 😂😂❤️❤️
Is it just me or does Safiya look like Morticia Addams?
She kinda looks like Halsey with that pink wig lol
The intro is so funny lol
I'm down for that Frankenstein mug video!
The last look was amazing!!! You looked so good with pink hair
My shop tab is almost entirely art. Which. Yeah that tracks.
The pink outfit really reminds me of that doja cat vogue video. Is it the same hair?
You looked so great in all of these outfits,  especially the witchy look!
The "egirl" is more indiekid.
You could just let the suspenders on the skirt dangle down, may work for some outfits!
28:19 IM GOING TO QUOTE THIS FOR MY DRAMA ASSIGNMENT BECAUSE WE’RE FOCUSING ON MACBETH AND MY FRIENDS AND I ARE DOING THE WITCHES-
Their house kinda looks like Jenna marbles’ house 😳
PSA: Don't watch Saf's videos while brushing your teeth because you think you won't laugh and choke on foam. You will indeed laugh and choke on foam.
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEIR HOUSE LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE JENNA AND JULIEN'S
THAT WIG. THAT WIG. THAT WIG. Safiya. It looked SO GOOD
Anyone else NOT get the "goth milk" pun? Nevermind I'm an idiot and I get it now
The bat has emerged and is wearing color 😂😂😂
Really hate how Facebook forcefully turned my parrot's Instagram into a shop, I only wanted to share silly pics of my bird to make people happy and now my reach went to zero because of that ._. thanks for nothing Zucc
Well done getting it out! (No sarcasm I’m genuinely proud because I saw you putting so much effort in)
you looked great in all of them wow
27:26-27:38 😂
I know it's not really your style, but I actually think you looked really, really good in the pink jacket with the pink wig.  Kudos to Tyler for doing a good job with the wig!!
Omg safiya is glowinggggg living for the straight black hair 😍😍😍😍
i have been here so long and i still cannot figure out what that guy sings in the intro
The battie gothic look  Looked amazing on safiya like i loved it
okay but HOW COMFORTABLE ARE THE SHOOOOES???????? i need answers T.T
tons of twice vids on your explore page tho 👀
Pleaseeee can you try historical corsets from that shops????!!!!
Did anyone else notice Sydney when she was talking about e girls? Teehee
You're so pretty through this whole video and you're seeming happier ❤ hope you're taking care of yourself
Omggg the intro song is backkkk😭❤
Are those 118 missed calls?
Had to wait for this video for a month
TWICE ON THE EXPLORE PAGE HFDJSOFO
You were rocking that witch fit 😍
The wig actually looks really good for a first attempt! I would’ve just done an updo for this outfit to break up all the pink.
When safiya said witch the peoplewho cackled were probably like "SisTeRs!"
This be epic U v U
11:15 THE FIRST PIC IS XOWIE JONES OMMMGGGG
Not finished with the video yet but daaaaaaaaaaaaamn these celestial shoes are amazing
I'm loving the matching masks!
The goth look would go with the wig and k-pop makeup video and here your e-girl
After watching 6 mins of this video, I'm now moving to Instagram and finding those shops lollllllll
oml that set at 4:54 looks glorious i need it
Safiyas look in the video gave me some Morticia Adams vibe 🦇
girl get those edwardian inspired boots, I have them and they are AMAZING.
definitely want to see you do an Instagram wig haul! I would love to see you order the wigs from the same account from 0:48 (syndromestore), i always see them on my explore page and as well as ads.
say hi and i'll put on chapstick
I am amazed at how well you pull off pink. Also, I was immensely curious what they would offer me after watching this because I dont follow anything vaguely fashion on insta... my top recommendations were clothes for my parrot and interesting jewelry items like herb based lapel pins. Love it, your videos are always awesome!
It had been oh so long since I had heard the intro😍😍😍😍😍😍
Webster wigs are indeed very nice wigs that I cannot afford.
Is it just me or Safiya started center parting her hair after she got married??? Btw, coming to the point, u look beautiful 💓💓
This was filmed half a year ago!
For there next video Tyler should do this two and then they could twin that would be # couple goals
YES I LOVE THIS THEME SONG
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE your energy, intelligence and dedication to everything you guys do!!  Hope to see more soon.:)
Can you make a video where you mix every soap
Everytime saf posts a new video u can see the amount of time and effort she puts into her videos. It truly is top tier quality
E girl it's basically like emo girl without the feelings and with some kind of cloud rap instead of rock and like emostyle meets kpop style
After this I m checking my Instagram shop section for the first time,since the update.
I wonder how many of us are going to go look for those boots only to discover that the company discontinued them. Because I definitely did that. Great video glad to see you are back.
The reason the jeans were a little small may have been in the UK our 4 is your 0, so you may have bought 2 sizes small 😂
For someone who has never really worn a wig you did fantastic!!! Great job, Tyler!!!
omg the intro song is back ❤️
i think the last one would have looked a lot better without the wig, saf's dark hair would have been a better contrast to the jacket!
Notification gang gang😎
I want the wig 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I saw Nayeon and Chaeyoung :)
That third outfit would only need a pair of pink platform crocs to be  truly "bubble gum" cohesive. ;)
You can absolutely tell that Saf was a theatre kid 😭 I love her
18:36 Saf in June: "Since then we've been waiting for things to open up a little bit. Uh, they kind of haven't." Me in November: "Yep."
"The memes of production" was a good line cmon
That. Pink. Wig.
That witch top looks great on you Saf.
0:38 twice is that you?
No suprises here but outfit #2 is the BEST one ♥️
Loved the Power Puff top, and the wig. The wig needed a bit more height or side-part  to suit your face better.
Saf is the best youtuber ever
She could try picking out the witch stitches on the shirt maybe.
Your video make me so happy there soooo good you should post a little more 😭
The unboxing setup/backround reminds me of Jenna Marbles 🥺🥺 I miss her so much
I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS
Thot-icia looks good 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🦇🦇
Witch look 🖤
I would LOVE it if you made a sustainable fashion outfit hall where you try to find your style in earth and ethical conscious brands
MICARAH TEWERS, if you where able to see this comment, know that I love you sooooo much! And I know you are watching this video with me. HAHAHAHAHA
The pink wig/black eyebrows/star makeup gives me Marina and the diamonds vibes kind of and I love this part. Love the pink jacket and power puff tank top. But the ensemble make me feel something else 😂
THE INTRO SONG THE INTRO SONG THE INTRO SONG !!!!!!!!!
i love the jeans on you tho! they really flatter your figure though the outfit is a bit in-cohesive
Safiya is the only creator who says that she posts bts of her videos and actually posts them
Safiya has been glowing lately 🤩🤩 the hair, the skin, the makeup, the outfits!! Absolutely gorgeous 😍😍
I. AM. SO. IN. LOVE. WITH. THE. WITCH. OUTFIT. 🖤🖤 I want those shoeeeees
Why am I getting complete Jenna Marbles vibes from your house?
12:57 she’s about to reenact some witch trials. 0.0
Webster wigs was recommended to me by my friend who does drag just FYI
That pink wig is amazing!!! I loved the 2nd and 3rd outfits ❤️❤️
I can’t really believe how muted Safiya’s reaction is to her witch outfit, she looks so so amazing in it!!
IS THAT TWICE???
Are you neighbors with Jenna Marbles? The layout of both your houses appear similar
Is it just me or does Safiya's living room look like Jenna Marbles' living room.
not @ the twice content on her explore tab yes queen
Hocus Pocus is the best movie 🍿
Everything looked so good on her!
The "staaahhpp rahn!" took me back like 10 years, omgggg
what’s your take on daniel preda’s opinion on u
Did anyone notice that she has a looot oh k pop in her insta page like yaaaay
You were so cute in the witch outfit!
I'm sorry but I'm loving that I keep seeing twice on your feed
i really like outfit 2 !!!
thanks for being so funny saf, i really needed a laugh while having a mental breakdown 💜💜💜 also love the vid already and i’m only 3 mins in hahah
18:57 I legitimately had to pause for a second because I thought she was in Jenna and Julien's house
The second look just makes me sigh in satisfaction because it's so Saf 😂
One video a month is not enough 🥺😭
You look so beautiful 😍😍😍 #PRIYANKANAYAK #EYELINER1
SAF ARE YOU A ONCE??? 👁
The wig, mask, and brows really just radiated chromatica and I was living for it
The last outfit that you called e-girl reminds me of the soft girl outfits because of the pink and stuff tell me if im wrong 😅
i love how her home screen is a silly photo of tyler
loved the shoes, is definitely the usual amazing style. But strangely also loved the "e-girl" jacket and hair. do not know why or how but really liked the look with the wig, the contrast of the eyebrows and the skin against the pink looks fantastic.
You look like you're having so much fun with the 1st outfit! I thought the 2nd one looks the best on you though
Just an idea, you should use the items you have bought over the years and incorporate them into your everyday outfits. Some of them are really out there and it would be fun to see them worn in a more everyday way. Also sustainability etc
"A Brand for Baddies everywhere"  "change those ds to ts and thats me"  SAF THATS NOT WHAT A BATTY IS.
2:53 me being someone who lives in the uk and seeing just eat DId SoMboDy sAY jUst EaT
Why do their living room look like Jenna Marbles? HAHA
Tuck the suspenders ends back down through the hoops so they lay under neatly and don't flap about.
Her living room looks so much like Jenna Marbles' one that I gasped
You're incredible saf, you bring me joy in every video!  Also, LOVE the shoes of the second outfit!
You looked gorgeous in each and every outfit. In the first outfit, when you let your hair down 😍😍😍, just beautiful
I missed your face 🤩
28:28  When the hurlyburlys done,  When the battles lost and won,  That will be ere the set of sun. Where's the place? Upon the heath. There to meet with Macbeth. I come graymalkin!  Paddock calls. Anon! Fair is foul and foul is fair, hover thru fog and filthy air.    I was a theater kid lmao Macbeth is my all time favorite Shakespeare play     <3
Can we talk about how she has so many TWICE stuff on her explore page
I kinda thought it was egirl. Guess I'm just out of touch?
Safiya's home screen tho. 🖤
You were thinking of vsco girls when you were talking about e girls I think
OMG NOT A TWICE FANCAM :')
Ok but Safiya with pink hair.....
Now I’m intrigued in what Instagram thinks I want to buy
Well, I like the witch outfit.
The shop tab that saf had was so much better than the one they have now! Ig doesn’t even show like an explore page of products anymore they just show shops that I already know. Ig I don’t need you to show me Hollister ://
i fucking hate the shopping tab. i go on insta to check up on people i know or my favs not to shop (for it replaces the activity feed where u see who liked ur pictures)
Am I the only one in love with pink hair on safiya? Her coloring looks fantastic with the light color, light purple or blue would also look really good :)
Why don't you Collab with James Charles ! We would love to see that collaboration 🤭
11:35 Is THAT- is that tyler making a kissy face as saf's lock screEN THATS ADORABLE PNVEWPFNGS LKN
When you live in virginia  *Subtle chuckle*
I dont understand the churning joke...(can someone tell me what the meaning is) :3
0:40 TWICE stan we love to see it
where's closed caption? :'(
Omg I live for the gothic look i rlly wanna get it and it also makes u look gorgeous and it give u a pretty figure
Safiya it's called astetic and I love it lol its nor egirl lolololol
She's posting monthy
I think the witch outfit was gorgeous!!!?
I LOOOOVE the gothy skirt on you, Saafiya! You're being super-picky.
Hey safiya are you planning to open a couple channel ! If not please think about it because you and Tyler are amazing together ❤️
All the eastern Europeans watching her put the new shoes on the counter 😳
Joey graceffas ex boyfriend Daniel threw shade at saf saying she was difficult on set of escaped he night.
Omg... totally spies!!! 😂😂 Feeling old here.
Safiya: has a crazy idea about a Frankenmug video Tyler: duuuude that's sick!!
The witch outfit is everythinggg😍
Ok but the fact that safiya has so much twice content lmao
There is also a Pinterest shop tab(or link on fashion posts). HAPPY TO SEE A NEW VIDEO!
If you did a Oregon trail/pioneer look you should get memory rings/Nail rings. The pioneers would make a nail into a ring for marriage
Its the ✨bdz fancam✨ for me
As a historical costumer on Instagram I am enjoying the Redthreaded/American Duchess/Wearing History ads.....
okay but you have to get those spiderweb yoga pants, like just for casual wear
Omg I LOVE the pink hair! Tyler did a great job!!
i feel like safiya with that longer hair and the middle part looks kinda witchy and honestly we stan
The laces on the shoes should be tied around your leg/ankle above the shoe and then tied(just a prompt)
Every video I'm amazed how long Safiya's hair has grown.
What I normally do because I love wearing pink and red is that I pair them with something darker. So if I was doing a look I would have kept the skirt (because it is amazing) and I would have chosen the shirt in a different color in order to break that "witch" look. The shoes is a keeper because I want them for so long! For the third look I loved the jacket but the rest is a no no for me. The first look is ICONIC!
How your entire energy changed when you wore the pioneer outift was perfection.
Are you living in Jenna Marbles House now?
The pants are cute but a complete knock off of Fiorucci. WebsterWigs is awesome! So many styles! I have the same style in an orange/pink!
all the kpop in her explore page is something i very much relate to
You could wear the shirt from the first outfit with jeans or the skirt with a racer tank, that would make it wearable 😂
I really thought that colonial getup said "butter chicken" outfit instead of butter churning. Either way, sign me up
I actually love you in the pink wig!
Did anyone else see their sitting room and think they were Jenna and Julien's house even though the rooms look nothing alike??? 😓
You can’t tell me her and Jenna don’t live on the same street. They have the same house!
safiya and tyler are just so pure. 🥺
is it just me or does their house look just like Jenna/juliens house...?
Missed you guys!!! Tyler’s memes of production joke was the best
A part of me wants to see safiya do a colouring book using only her lipsticks...
Anyone else watch Jenna Marbles and think they have similar homes? Like the kitchen layout and living room look very similar. No hate, I love them both. Just something that came to mind.
Ok.can we pls talk about all the missed messages? 3:14
Okay but that lowkey looks like Jenna and Julien's living room
Where is that beautiful flower mask from? ❤️
I love the second look better.
You’re being to hard on yourself about the e-girl thing! No one minds ❤️
Saf looking hard like Morticia Addams today
I'm from Oregon and I cringed at how they said it😂
This is Safiya's 🎵NEW🎵INSTA🎵HAULLLL🎵
I really liked the pink jacket on you with those style of jeans!
the wig looks so good on her even though it doesn’t fit what she typically wears it’s so cute
I just realized every time Safiya does a video like these.  There is an 2 second clip from the beginning of one item she tries or buys. Haha!!!
Looks like the same house as Jenna and Julien
Honestly, buying every stone mug at the dollar store and creating the Franken dollar mug sounds fun. Added challenge, make it watertight/usable
the power that twice holds😌
If you took off the belt (and bonnet lol) your colonial outfit could totally be a #cottagecore look - that was a big thing here this summer, no idea if this was a trend in America. Very wholesome “apple picking and carrying a wicker basket”
Black suits you the best
I look in my instergram shop, ther are stores I follow, but the rest is stuff I never ever looked at and not following in any way....
I've also just started getting a lot of ads for pregnancy vitamins and other pregnancy related products. It started roughly around my sons 3 month birthday. Algorithms are weird.
TWICE LMAO
Okay but where were those jelly shoes??
Are the shoes from the witch look comfortable?
I loved the witch one
Would love to see your closet!!
I would honestly just watch you buy stuff all the time
*sigh* "never mind". best
Wait.... why Safia looks so good in the pink wig 👀😭 LOVE HER
Any other Spanish speakers chuckling every time Saf says "minga"? https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/spanish-english/minga
i think if you put the wig with the dark outfit and made the e-girl makeup that outfit would have looked a little e-girly. Also you should make an e-girl transformation or something but like a real e-girl style i would love to see that. Love u <3
Omg I always forget about totally spies I wanted to be a fancy spy so bad 🤣 🕵️‍♀️
I was so excited when she got stuff from mingalondon because I get all my clothes from there!!!
The witch outfit looks so so good on you
The intro song is baaaaack
Ugh they changed the layout and now at the bottom tab line there’s home, instatv, plus, shop, profile. WORST SPOT EVER!! I never use the instatv or the shop tab and was sooo disappointed when they removed those from the recommended/search area and onto the main spots. Made me hate Instagram a little more
I love that you follow the costubers! They’re so great
I like the second look a helllaaaa lottttt! 😈💕
I did not like the way y'all portrayed cat-calling. I get some people will like and see it has a confidence booster, but let's agree that safe base line is to assume most don't. Do not cat-calling people, it is not a compliment and makes people fill uncomfortable. Remember to please be respectful.
The witch outfit looked amazing on yoy!
The headband at 6:22 are actually two headbands! So still $57 if you want 'em both.
It is not so serious but I looked at safiya's dms, lexime.fairuse.org/q4MoJp/k5IOfq.html I admit that I am sad, poor boyfriend I hope it changes
Well good to know someone uses the Instagram shop!!!
Ugh you two are so great ily <333
Is this a commercial for instagram shopping?
TWICE ON HER EXPLORE PAGE WE STAN!
Ohhhh a Honey sponsor... get that bag, Sophia! or should I say that *BIG BAG* because let’s be real, we all know Honey doesn’t play!
I love all the outfits! Especially the last one!! So cute!
i’m really sad you didn’t take the opportunity to make the pun “cheru-bum” :(
I'm loving her own black square neckline dress safiya is wearing she looks stunning
It's immediately clear y'all ain't from "Ori-gone"
Lele Pons: Lilay Pons Me: Lee-lee pons Saf: Lay-lay Pons Me: WHAT?!?!?!?!?!
Safiya's new house weirdly resembles Jenna and Julien's or is it just me-
‘But we’re not there *yet* ‘  Wait wHat-
Omg i loved the 3rd look on you!! 🥰🥰 it’s so fun!
Safiya looks so pretty in the black outfit 😍xxx
The pink hair on you is amazing! Love it 💖💖
Why does her house remind me of Jenna's? Lmao I miss her
Is it just me or did she loss weight😳
I would really like to see you do something similar to this where you buy instagrams recommended outfits. Like those specific posts where the shirt/pants/shoes etc is all linked in the same post/photo. To see if the recommended outfit is actually a cute outfit
without the bonnet you kinda give westworld dolores vibes tbh
Can we just take a second to appreciate how pretty she is? And the pink hair is gorgeous. ❤
am I the only one that saw nayeon and chaeyoung,,
Those clips of twice in the beginning 💗💗💗💗💗
the pink wig suits you!!
I’m so confused! Her house is IDENTICAL to Jennas 😂😂😂 SAFIYA WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL US???
The witch outfit is soooo hot omg, you pulled it off
Thank you soo much for including my historical modelling tip video at 8.10 circa! My Insta is @ilfiorenero_costumery
i really love the pink look it did suit you just your used to wearing black!!
She looks soooooo good on the witch outfit(like the other outfits) but that one suited her so well she looked awesome😍
Is this her new home cause I am still in love with that bathroom from her bath bomb episode!♡ ❤😍
I am in love with those star boots!
حــالي بعدك.       حــال #شايب ذبلـه حســره وي #الجگاره #اوصـاح اووفـــ شگد حـنينه #الـعافــيه  .
I've watched you for years and I love your videos but it does feel very repetitive. I'd love to see more from you x
IBS sufferers unite
Just tuck the straps into the rings on the skirt!
saf's a ONCE we been knewwww RISKY RISKY WIGGY WIGI THIS IS AN 🚨 e m e r g e n c e e🚨
Them boots though 🥰❤
I am LIVING for The pink wig!! 😍😍😍
38 mins that went by too fast
It is not so serious but I looked at safiya's dms, lexime.fairuse.org/q4MoJp/k5IOfq.html I admit that I am sad, poor boyfriend I hope it changes
The pink looks very cute
Those boots call for a video to wear them for a week!!!
GIRL YOU LOOK SO HOT!! you're face. Wow. Goals. You're glowing!!
I'd like to see your natural hair as a second layer under the pink. I think that'd be rad.
On my instagram shop it’s literally screams cute and girly 😂.i follow cute  uniforms/stuff animals/Lolita/cosplay accounts so it make sense. 19:18 Reminds me of the game little hope
Do a video trying on different wigs professionally
The cutesy pink/pastel style is more of a soft girl than egirl but I get why you thought it was that. Egirl and eboy styles are more of a modern trendy emo style than the cutesy one
She doesn't upload much, but when she does it's like a Phoenix that is being reborn. Still, Safiya is so beautiful. My heart literally skipped when she was wearing that goth look. It looks even better with the mask actually. Stay safe guys!!!! And continue making awesome videos!!!!
safiya i love you so much but you look like a sim in these
waiting for franklin ice cream vid
Did anyone else see that emirichu outfit there???      No..? Just me....?
the pink sotes you
All of the best YouTubers have honey as their sponsors!😀
Not me focusing on the kpop idols at the beggining and literally not listening to what Safiya has to say
Ty’s “Nevermind” to the Sammi Sweetheart bit made me laugh more than it should have. He’s like “Nope, I’m tagging out here”. You guys are the best x
Looking away from the screen, and then hearing Tyler say "that's some pink ass hair"... Gotta say, I was confused for a minute 🤣
Anybody feel like Saf is in Julien and Jenna's house and its kinda trippy
You should definitely wear the witch outfit with the pink wig
Keep the wig!
no, sorry, but you totally can tell what youre wearing in your pictures. and yes, thats probably what theyre doing here. they hire people in 3rd world countries to take images of people and label them. theyll circle faces, shirts pants boots and maybe give them a bunch of words that sound like titles from wish "punk black goth boots shoelaces". enough of these pictures labeled(hundreds of thousands) and run it through some linear algebra and python, and viola. everything you need to be able to tell what youre wearing in your pictures. this is machine learning (incorrectly called ai, its not ai... its knows things, but doesnt comprehend)
i love all the twice on your explore page- 😂
Wow I really thought my least favorite was gonna be the pink outfit. But It really does look stellar on you! I think the contrast of your dark facial features and the almost neon colors of the hair just fit so well together. And the jacket is adorable! The only thing I'd change are the jeans haha, some pants look great highlighting the junk, but dad jeans are not it lol.
The second outfit I want it for myself lol
Where did you get the galaxy mask?
Show us the mug
I really like watching you but I can't take all the consumerism, every time I'm like "but who made it? Did they get paid properly and treated well? Is anyone going to wear it again? How much is buying all these cheap clothes and supporting these dubious companies effecting the planet?"
Yay! More saf videos!
CAN WE TALK ABOUT SAFIYA NEW PHONE WALLPAPER ITS TYLER 11:37 STOP AND FLIP YOUR PHONE THE OPPOSITE SIDE . ITS AN UNGLAM OF TYLER (so cute ) .
ppppink wig, thick ass, give em whiplash
this i really free advertising for instagram shop because as soon as i saw this i went shopping on it
Congratulations on 9 million subscribers Safiya!!! U truly deserve it...I love ur videos 😍😍😍😍🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Love your hair in this!
The witch outfit was SO AMAZING! Safiya looked SOOOOO GOOODDDD in it!!!
The “witch” outfit is so cute
wiiiiiii! Waking up in Belgium and drinking a matcha, having a muffin and watching your new video is how every weekend should start!!!
I don't know what's up with that comment about "Safiya's dms". DONT click the link. I haven't, but idk what happens if you do, maybe the comment just reposts itself. I hope Safiya sees it and fixes it:)
Yaai
when do we get a house tour
Giving tyler Credit ♥️♥️♥️
saf in the wig and makeup is so cute
I am wearing my PunkRave skirt the other way round and it is so cute, try it! Or you can trim the strap. Or it can be pulled through the hoop, so it is less flappy...😊 🖤  love all the looks you did 🖤
Honestly safiya, I love you and your personality. And I know what kind of brand you have built, but maybe you could try and bring sustainability into your content a little bit. Just mentioning it and maybe trying to make your videos as sustainable as possible. Fast fashion and consumerism in general are such a big Problem for the environment and I would love for you to address that a little bit. Lots of love ❤️
The third look is more like a soft girl
Safiya you pull off the pink so well!
Im weirded out a little by the Jenna vibes of the house
27:00 can tuck strapss in those hoops maybe
The pink wig looks great
20:50 Now when I look at butter I'll be singing that song. 🤣🎵
for anyone wondering: the “goth look”. boots are sold out😞😞
The one fashion trend I wish would never come back is those square shoulder pads!!!  I am so glad they went out.
You're supposed to wrap the laces around the boots, that's why they're so long
Tbh the pink hair is a little amazing
Please know: my husband has always thought it was HILARIOUS that you used the “safiya’s new intro song” as your new intro song. He was so sad when you changed it back 😂😂😂 I can’t wait to tell him it’s back!!!
Ok the Goth look was something a kpop star would actually wear 🖤🖤🖤
that jenna marbles e girl clip caught me off guard and severely hurt my feelings
SAFIYA IS A ONCE.
I LOVE your witch outfit! I would wear that everyday!
Try the strawberry dress? Hmmmmm? :D
Yay u posted .so happppppyyyy😘🥰
the last outfit that you thought was a e-girl, the style would be  'softie' and 'y2k' aesthetic
"kpop fancams" yet its all twice I SEE U SAF I SEE U :p
Pink looks amazing at you!!
love the shoes so much!! those heels are sooo cute!! Also like the pink jacket even though it's not really my style
Do you know... I think the ‘not an e-girl’ look totally worked once you slipped the jacket off your shoulders. 🤔 #pinkhairdontcare
I can't stop laughing. omg you are so funny
I love that second outfit.  Mostly those boots.
i wish she posted more
You really put so much work in every Episode! So sweet 🥰 Did you try to speak slower? I like the old Tempo, i speak fast myself and hate it when everyone is telling me to speak slower. Really hope this isnt a reaction on hate.
Any time ‘Safiya’s New Intro Song’ plays you know it’s gonna be a good one!
Its been a long time since she posted im happy that she posted
Collab with the YouTube channel “Townsend” to do some fun colonial stuff
We have now officially confirmed that saf is a K-pop stan
WHY DOES SAFIYA'S INTRO SONG STILL SAY "This is Safiya's NEW intro song"???!!! HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN AND WHY IS IT STILL NEW?
NOT THE MEET ME AT MCDONALDS HAIR HAHHAAHA
THE WITCH LOOK WAS EVERYTHING! And the wig looks good. The hairline says it’s a wig, but you can tweeze it to look more natural.
I loved the witch outfit. XD
Okay but Safiya is glowing!✨
I just want to warn you, since you showed some cloth masks, that cloth masks are proven to do absolutely nothing at all for viruses, especially not one with particles as tiny as the coronavirus. It saddens me how outside of Asia, esp. in the U.S., so many people make a huge to do about wearing a mask but everyone is wearing cloth masks and not surgical throw away masks. It's 100% like wearing nothing at all, there is no point. You can Google it yourself, they did tests. A cloth mask protected a max of 3% from coronavirus, the rest went THROUGH the mask. A surgical mask only protects 40%, but if both people are wearing it obviously that increases to 80%. So....6% protection vs 80%. Why wear cloth???
I can’t with the Sammie references😭 I watched that show way too young
brooooo the tiktoker strawberryelf that you used as your egirl example is my friend WTF 😭😭
The pink hair looks really good on her & Tyler did a good job putting the wig on.
hi safiya, just wanted to say that the outfit that you called e-girl is more closer to a soft girl look😚
I absolutely LOVE outfit #2. I oddly liked outfit #3, but you're right, the fit looks rather strange and uncomfortable...just enough to not want to wear them.  Also, may I say, you look especially gorgeous in this video. I mean, you're always pretty, but you have a lovely glow in your facular region. Anyway, happy to see you, you look happy, and that makes me happy. Have a great one!
omg the way they pronounced Oregon....
I'm sorry, but *how* are you pronouncing Oregon??
24:39 heart on my sleeve but it’s all black (Kris Wu ft. Jhené Aiko - Freedom)    Unexpected crossover 🥰
You look amazing
Missed you🥺🥺
Yessss safiyaa!! K-pop and mostly TWICE!!
I’ve missed you. :((
That is an e-girl look tbf
What you thought was E-girl is actually Soft girl❤💘
The gram implemented the fb market place 😑
Safiya: Last bits of the stuff Me, an ARMY: last BTS???
Websterwigs is my fave wigstore ever and I'm a cosplayer so that says something 😂💝 I'm LIVING for the Insta witch🦇
You looked too darn cute in that witchy outfit 😍😍
I love that your explore page is full of Twice and k-pop. SAME
The goth outfit looks gorgeous on you. Even the rings. You are just stunning.  And I really loved the hippie vibe of the first outfit when you got rid of the bonnet)
So glad you’re back, missed your videos. Watching old ones has been getting me through the election!
new intro and new background!!! what happened saf?! its so cool and so unlike u but itz amazing - loving it :D
Ahh yes, the three main styles. Goth, E-Girl, and Victorian era
Every time Safiya uploads I realize just how much I missed her 😭
It is not so serious but I looked at safiya's dms, lexime.fairuse.org/q4MoJp/k5IOfq.html I admit that I am sad, poor boyfriend I hope it changes
Safiya talking about the jeans riding up is me with 24/25 pairs of any trousers I try on #longtorsoproblems
Twice!!!
omggg the intro is so different :DDD ;)
For some reason on 38:22, you look like YammyXox
I was so happy to watch a new Safiya video!!  Fun looks.
I missed you!
Safiya's gotta try Demonia shoes
Content suggestions: Wear a Filipino dresses and eat Filipino food it's gonna be good ❤️😁😁😄
MISSED YOU
As someone interested in historical fashion/reenacting that first outfit is definitely better for Oregon trail type stuff than colonial Williamsburg, they’re very different eras. Also the way you said Oregon 😩
Safiya looks fire in pink!!!!
Werent you supposed to put the end of the straps in the hoops of the skirt??🤔🤔🤔
The background when she’s unboxing looks so similar to Jenna marbles house
Okay but I LOVE the middle outfit. It was honestly amazing
I love that the masks match the outfits  Also: I want to see how well you coped with the lace-front wig when putting it on. You two did a great job btw
Toss the jeans, keep the rest. You work all outfits. Thanks for some light-hearted entertainment. Just what I needed today.
11:16 the "disturbia" girl looks like someone I follow on tiktok
It’s 3am, and I have to be up for work in about 4 hours, but YOU BETTER BET IMA BOUT TO WATCH THIS ENTIRE 40 MINUTE VIDEO 👀🙌
Can you u do a house tour please
Are we just gonna ignore the fact that Saf’s house looks IDENTICAL to J&J’s house?
Pretty sure the skirt overall thing is called a pettifor but I'm not a hundred percent sure. I love the gothic look so much & I'm obsessed with the shoes. I must acquire them. 🖤🖤
Last one is more of a soft girl.
For a second I was like is that Jenna and Julien’s house????
I think the pink wig should have went with the black goth look. That would have been so 🔥💖
Love u
It's not enough to have family pressure you to have kids after marriage but now INSTAGRAM DOES IT TOO?
honey mainly works in the us it seems. i've tried to use it in the uk but it doesn't seem to always work just saying
Why are you only posting one video a month
At this point i'm just watching Saf to upgrade my vocabulary
NAYEON WAS ON HER HOME SCREEEEEEN AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH
17:00 am I the only one who thought WORK WORK ANGELICA WORK WORK ELIZA AND PEGGGGGYYYYYYYY!!!!! Oh. Just me? Ok.
Let's just say your Instagram shop tab is a lot more interesting than mine.
<3 <3
I love the pink one
It is not so serious but I looked at safiya's dms, lexime.fairuse.org/q4MoJp/k5IOfq.html I admit that I am sad, poor boyfriend I hope it changes
okay but outfit 2 was so fucking pretty
Y'all are so lovable and endearing to eatch other
I Love your vid cause there's no adds but it it's ok for you? . . . Cause for me it's ok to put some adds maybe you put from start of vid and put on mid Ang the end of vid it's ok for me and maybe for other ( ꈍᴗꈍ)
Always love your vids Saf but looks like you are having so much fun with this one (especially the 1st outfit) which makes me love the video more ❤❤❤
i had a visceral reaction seeing the living room cause it made me realize how much i miss jenna :(
A large part of me thought of Rachel Maksy when I saw the amount of vintage inspired clothing. Can't help but think her and Safiya would get on so well!
Is no one going to talk about the fact that Safiya and Tyler were in Jenna and Julians kitchen ? Lol
LMAO he said head over to colonial Williamsburg! I live 10 minutes away LOL!!!
Does anybody know the song that starts with the second outfit?  I couldn't shazam it or anything
Gonna be honest, you gave me major Nikita Dragun vibes with the wig and makeup. <3 Loved that second outfit though. Just pure love. I want those shoes so badly!!
She should just dye her hair pink :))))
safiya is glowing she looks amazing 🥰🥰
It is not pronounced Or-ee-gone! It's pronounced Or-eh-ginn. From a fellow Oregonian. 😔
I don't get the goth thing... Just don't get it.
Does anyone know why safiyas videos never have any ads I’m so confused 🤔🤔🤔😂
Brb imma go buy those moon dust boots
Random pro tip: The  'e'  in Oregon is mostly silent. Orh-gen / Orh-gon.
You should create an outfit dice by making a giant dice and then printing different pieces of clothing on the sides maybe one for shirts another dice for pants and Roll and randomize
I really liked the last look. All three were great
When Tyler said.... Pink-ass hair! 😂  Just gonna leave it there.
Who else is trying to find the moon dust shoes ?
The second outfit is so beautiful
Loved this video so much!! 💞💗💖🌸💞💗
We have to all appreciate the hard work she puts in the video [she's amazing 😍
Despite being very different from her normal style I think the pink outfit really flattered Safiya. The booty and chest were popping and usually she's like a modest bat. Absolutely loved the cropped jacket I want one for myself
Yaaaaaas the intro song
I never thought about ya’ll having childrens, I never thought that far about your lives outside of yt. Your life should be private if you want it.. or not.
Love the new vid Saf!
ORE-GONE??? Guys. It's pronounced like dragon or wagon, not like polygon or pentagon. You're killing me. Your friend, an Oregonian
Here’s the thing though, now I want that mug video. 😂
What a nice surprise to wake up to ☺️
You have a wig now ....so you can now turn Tyler into a drag queen like Cristine did to Ben 😂
that second outfit was such a SERVE
I LOVE THIS INTRO SONG
This is the first video that I've watched from her that isnt, like, 8 months old lmao
the way Safiya says minga lmao
Like i know you guys don’t live with Jenna and Julien, but it really looks like you live with Jenna and Julien
safiyas videos are the best
Love the amount of love for Colonial Williamsburg aka my hometown 🎉🎉
dont know if anyone is gonna see this but if anyone wants some totally spies nostalgia. the official totally spies youtube channel has posted allmost all of the episodes for free and  in good quality. so check it out <3
obsessed with the wig
Awesome video 👏🏻✨🍬😸❤️
I love all the twice on your explore page. 🥴 They’re my ults !!
Please don't cut your laces!! They're probably meant to wrap around the ankle of the boot once or twice before tying!! Like to save a shoe. :(
The necklace is from my sister in laws company Candy Corpse! So cool to see it in your video!
OMG Safiya! I actually love those jeans on you!! Lol does anyone else feel this way? 💕💕💗💗💓
the one virginian watching geeking at your love for williamsburg i never realized people outside of va loved it sm
And you are not fat don’t worry 😉
I absolutely loved this video. The 3 outfits were completely different from each other which made the video even more interesting to watch. My favourite part was "they see me churnin', they hatin" 😂😂
I think it’s more kweil
Is it just me or safiya is glowing with more than the usual amount of feminine power?
My shop tab is even replacing the heart 😫 I now have quick access to “explore” “reals” and “shop” when none of these are interesting to me.
I missed the intro song
I was wondering about the much talking about going to Williamsburg. But you guys were so young and the quarantine were still in the future.
the shop you got the powerpuff tank from us almost definitely a drop shipping site, i’ve seen that exact top on aliexpress for like $5
I will give Tyler credit for THAT SWEET, SWEET MEME PUN!
TWICE ON UR EXPLORE PAGE !!!!!! queens of kpop 🥺
Why am I getting this notification 2 HOURS LATE 😭😭😭😭😭
We should start a petition to get Saf and Tyler to Colonial Williamsburg
Is no one gonna talk about how Taylor R was the first picture when Saf opened her instagram??
Start doing more vlogs please
I want that entire witch outfit
Those flower things you said looked yummy remind me of sticker earrings.
That pink wig reminds me of Halsey from Boy with Love video
safiya’s wallpaper: 👁👄👁
SHE LOWKEY REMINDS ME OF LEXI HENSLER WITH THE PINK HAIR👀👀👀
Just tuck the ends of the skirt straps in through the rings...
Wow man you are patient that is one ☝️ of the reasons I love you I really hope you reapply you are my favorite YouTuber
Is nobody gonna talk about the powerpuff girls shirt having buttercup holding a joint
Loving Safiyas long Morticia hair😍😍
I see a video by you and I lick on it- simple!
I have never heard of e-girl, so sure, why not.
honestly you look so good in the goth look
I just wanted to say that with the pink wig and the heart under-eyes, you kind of look like marina diamandis
E girl is so arbitrary & lame. It’s basically gen z trying to lazily dress alternative with giving any homage to the music movements that bore those aesthetics. I.e punk, goth & metal fashion (emo is lame af) but they knocked that off too. It’s a lame fad that kids will grow out of like emo was. There are goths in their 50’s, their are punk rockers in there 60’s, there are old metal heads.....u can’t be 60 and an “e boy” or girl. It is perhaps one of the most useless teen trends since emo in 2006.
That witch look is ridiculously good on you! Like wow
Have you thought about dressing like its the Victorian era?
How embarrassing, it might be to film outside while every1 was laughing.
“I’m more like.. diet goth”..... as a type 1 diabetic and fellow all-black wearer, I cannot explain how much my soul appreciates that joke after this hell week 💀😂
Guess who's back, back again Safiya's back, tell a friend! Guess who's back, guess who's back? Guess who's back, guess who's back?
My Instagram doesnt have a shop tab :(
Her house where she unboxes weirdly reminds me of Remi's! 😁
Hi, i use this shopping thing to buy things from minor sellers to support them, its awesome, you don't need to find their pages and the item from instagram... We need to support them, this pandemic is harsh 🙂
Just the video I needed on an anxious day. thank you :-)
Bad witch ~Saafiya Boss bitch ~Lily  That was perfect...😂
That pink jacket was so damn cute
Is this not jenna and Julien's house??
I missed these videos so much, I loved it!
I fall in love with your Outfit look 2 👀♥️ Our beautiful witch 😂😂😍
Oop-
so next vid is the franken-mug vid? can't wait xD
FINALLYYYY ❤️
is this the same house they’ve always lived in?
The video is great! But I would be afraid that insta takes some money from shops (its ok if its big company with small they night takę to much money as Uber eats tends to do) its probably good idea to browser but maybe by directly from company website if they have one. If no go for it!
did they just call it OAR-UH-GOHN???? instead of oregon? it’s OR-ih-GHEN 🤦‍♀️😂 take from somewhere who lives there 😂😘
you looked so incredibly happy and beautiful in this video :) I’m not sure if you’ll see this but I had to say it
Did those shoes cost 120 dollars!? 😲
Saf looks like she lost weight. Absolutely stunning before and after 😍😍
The Powerpuff top is mad sus.  Long shipping times? Fishy quality? I think this PPG image is stolen artwork.
Did anyone else's instagram change to have the shop tab instead of the explore page on the bottom tabs?? It's frustrating lol and such an obvious cash grab
The way you said "Lele Pons videos" had me laughing for a solid hour
I love Safiya's black top with the big buttons! does anyone know where its from or a good dupe???
“are you a witch or a civil war reenactor?” “yes”
I'm just interested in why you have a bunch of commonly known brands of modern fashion and then BAM, Bernadette's shoes inspired by Edwardian fashion. When this pandemic is over or at least under control, you could try Victorian/Edwardian fashion  Edit: she did tit, ghe absolute madwoman
why do you literally live in the same house as Jenna Marbles????
anyone else or mines always been there-
This made me so happyyyyy 😊💜
How did she miss the "wearing her heart on her sleeve" metaphor on the witch top? . . That was my favourite outfit!
lol OreGONE XD
Oh no, now I also need one of those colonial style shirts! The one you have is amazing!
Ok so as I'm watching this video a page tries to follow me on Instagram and the most recent post has the witch shirt that saf bought!!!!!! Wth!!!!!!
Safiya, you’re so down to earth and confident which makes you so fun to watch and such an inspiration! This video was great, I loved all the outfits keep it up 🤗💕
I think facebook/instagram is trying to head down the WeChat direction with an app that does everything.. I think the gothic one 'suited' you, the 'pink one' I suspect the matching skirt would have worked better as an outfit, just not suited you as well personality wise as much, and yes pink eyebrows would have completed it :)
@safiya when you ask "is this e girl?" The answer is y2k #y2k
I would have loved to know the price of the stuff she bought 🤷‍♀️
did you ike move in with jenna and julien??? jk but why is your livingroom so so so similar. i do not understand american architecture
the e girl look u were calling ain't e girl its aesthetic
I looooove the second look. It's so you! <3 xoxo
Love that witchy look 😍☠️
Minga London stole designs from a small sustainable business... So guys try and not support them!
The fact that these boots no longer seem to be sold on rogue+wolf makes me sad 😭
7:57 lol I had that doll as a kid, I still have the book she came with but I think my family sold the doll
I would love to see Saf collab with someone like Karolina Żebrowska to get a full on historical makeover.
Ahh I love these kind of videos!
That pink hair looked so good on Safiya
Am I the only one who wants to see her attempt her own franken-mug now? That would be really cool.
Add the pink Jacket over the Goth outfit and you're 💯😉👍
I too aspire to be a gothic, butter-churning wench.
Am I the only one  that thought for a second, she's in Jenna marbels living room?🤣
watching Safiya's fashion videos makes me want to get clothes of my style and dress up. I don't like asking for clothes because my family keeps gifting me clothes and I don't know if I'll even wear the stuff I ask for (I get anxious about my clothes sometimes) 😔
the living room background reminds me of Jenna Marbles, god i miss her ;(
I like that on the third outfit, the moment Tyler commented on the eyebrows and Safiya I guess relaxed a little, the look just went to the soft pastel Sims4-builder streamer look. Don't know why but I guess it was the intense expressions that might've made it look odd.
WIGS HAUL PLEASEEEE!  btw, that "e-girl" outfit looks more e-girly without the jacket...
Ory-gun, not Ora-Gone 😛
as an oregonian it physically hurt me when she said “or-eh-gawn”
Hang on... You live in LA. You have a wig you're having trouble getting on... Mykie lives in LA. Where's your problem????  CALL MYKIE!!!  <3
🤣🤣 Minga London 🤣🤣 in Britain minga means ugly. This brand is basically called ugly London and the clothes were kinda ugly! 🤣🤣
Its a culture shock to see you in all that color,  but it doesn't look bad whatsoever. I personally don't like wigs that look fake, but overall the color is cute on you. I really loved the makeup.   As for the gothic look, absolutely in love with each piece. The shoes are an absolute favorite.
i assume she is a kpop fan...yass
Nearly a 40min video! 🤗 thanks Saf for giving me some great content to watch while I'm having dinner 😊
Who else saw the huesticks suggestion😄🙋
OMG I love this video. 😍 I think black jeans would have worked with the last outfit? 🤔 🖤💗🖤💗
if it was any other youtuber, the title would be "mark zuckerberg is trying to kill me."
Safiya looks HOT in the witchy outfit! Especially with the black mask 🔥🔥
Honey collects your data. No thanks. Nice vid anyway.
Omg Safiya! You look so cute in everything!!
You did a really good job with the wig! Like not even for a first time putting one on, just generally. The hairline looks nice and smooth and you can't see your natural hair. There also aren't any strange bumps you can see when the wig is on, which can be tricky especially with long, thick hair. So yeah! Loved the video, also I'm kinda glad the historical skirt wasn't as full as the photos as I feel like it'd be a bit of a decade clash (American Revolution mixed with the Civil War)
You should use the Instagram shop tab to pick a makeup routine or a skincare routine. That would be cool!!
Saf... Oregon is pronounced like “organ”. This is coming from an Oregonian 😂😬
Ahhhhh!!! New video!! So fun! Also, congrats on the new house, it’s gorgeous!!
The witch outfit was beautiful
i love the pink hair omggg
It is not so serious but I looked at safiya's dms, lexime.fairuse.org/q4MoJp/k5IOfq.html I admit that I am sad, poor boyfriend I hope it changes
Outfit #1 - I'm screaming with joy!! Safiya!! Churn me some butter, girl!! SUCH a pioneer woman! All my "Little House" vibes are ringing... :-) Also - that colonial face mask is a fine touch, I must say...
im getting mad early marina diamindis vibes from the last outfit !
37:20 comrade tyler
I’m in Boston. It’s 3am here. Sleep can wait.
Was kind of hoping you'd get something from Sourpuss clothing since it popped in so much and it's from one of those brands I stalk on Instagram but haven't bought anything from yet, but you ended up getting two brands that I ALSO stalk so I am pleased to hear the quality was good~ The second outfit in particular was something I'd so wear and it was awesome!!
You are so cute Safiya I wish I had half as much personality as you.
The timing of the cackling was PERFECT!
It if page is full of twice kpop fans here
Is it just me or were the cuts in the beginning a bit too jarring? I usually don't notice cuts but it caught me off guard
Wait, why is you're hair so long? I DONT REMEMBER YOU'RE HAIR BEING THIS LONG
that witch outfit!!!! so cute i love for you
I want that plant face mask sooo bad
As if Evil Queen isn't already sexy... 😏
21:23 "Tyler's getting dysentery" coupled with the leaf slapping 😂😂
Wig looks great Tyler, good job!
0:40 lmaoo is that a nayeon picture- 3:21 is that- TZUYUUU!??
I wish you would lose the jacket on the last outfit
Outfit 1 with the right undergarments would look amazing
That second outfit is EVERYTHING 🖤🌙
Good job on the wig! It’s very cute.
Third outfit, with a blond wig you could be in Bly Manor!
Tyler great job on wong deserves  the compliment
That “never mind” from Tyler was my favourite quote from this video 15:04
🎶rolled up to the party in my crazy pink wig . I can't get through the door because my booties to big. 🎶 just kidding I loved this video and I absolutley loved the pink wig. Altogether I loved the outfits in this video, and I kinda want to get the second outfit you bought because omg it looked so cool👊😎
okay but the rose and chae fancams 🔥
She's churning y'all.
TYLER: you're legit terrible.
The fact that Safiya likes TWICE 🥺
It's a true achievement to get all their referrence.!!
I hear Helloo Friends and know the day is gonna be good 😂
Wow I actually said damn with the second outfit. That skirt is soooo flattering. Great video as always!
its not really a safiya video if colonial williamsburg isnt brought up
How many other Oregonians are severally cringing at their pronunciation of Oregon ?
In the first outfit she looks like Winona Ryder as Abigail Williams in the Crucible lmaooo
You’re super pretty🥺💕
One of my most favorite channel where I literally wait when Sofia will post next!! ❤
i think you are supposed to tuxk the tstles
Golden content as always ☺️💜
"Honestly it's not great"-Tyler 🙈😂 I would've cried 😂😂😂
"aren't we all inspired by Sammi Sweatheart?" - threw me back to my years of jersey shore addiction 😂
Safiya! The layout in your new house looks a little like you’re filming in Jenna’s new house!
you look sooooo good!!! your skin is glowing so much and you looked so good in all of the outfits!!
safiya is low-key serving morticia addams realness, and i am here for it.
I love getting a notification saying you've uploaded xo
The 2nd outfit makes Saf look like Marceline and the 3rd one makes her look like Princess Bubblegum
omggggg i honestly love and would wear all of those fits and Safiya is literally so beautiful wtf!!
I'm not a wig expert by all means (only from watching hair vloggers like Stella Cini), but maybe for next time when wearing a wig a tip that I suggest is to style a bit the wig (if the hair is human hair) when it's on the head so it looks like having legit pink hair.
Well...I just found the shoe brand for me! 😂😂 Both in name & style!
Her videos are never boring and the way she speaks is soo satisfying 😌😌
Her "egirl" makeup is *sooooo* cute
Ive bought the Disney ears they are amazing. I recommend
I thought the thumbnail said "instagram soap haul" and was excited to see all the soaps she finds.
I MISSED YOU 👁👅👁
If you value your nostalgia don’t re-watch totally spies it’s weird
Oh gosh I missed this intro so much
Finally xD in Europe its 9 am so I woke up and can watch the new video
Okay, but can someone please tell me where Safiya bought the mask with the flowers on it!? I need it in my life!
The pink look gave me a strawberry short cake vibe for some reason lol
The first look, the skirt seems a bit small from the original pictures... like those were inspo pics.
SAFIYA IS BACK!!!!
I was really shocked to see Twice at Safiya's explore page 😂
nobody: Not a soul: Saf: Not even Crusty: Me: trying to find what to comment because I’m here before a day “...”
I wish honey had an app that worked...somehow. And also, those boots with the moons? I need them. Badly.
I loveee the shoes!!♥️♥️
0:37 GIRL YOUR RECOMMENDATION IS FULL OF OUR KPOP GIRLS ❤️🥺 i feel so proud
Love the witchy moony shoes. Very cool. But I feel like they are begging to be refashioned, by adding glow-in-the-dark paint on the stars & moons and hella glittery resin in the heel cut-outs.
Safiya’s home screen is life goals 😂
Thanks for the distraction from life. We needed it.
love the fact that saf's explore page is flooded with kpop fancams
Her background of tyler 😂😂
Safiya is looking more and more like living morticia addams
You NEED to do a "Dressing like an American girl doll" video like your brats video!!!
That shop poseur IG is literally a nostalgic walk through Limited Too, which was far superior to Justice.   At me.
I didn't know egirls were emo, i thought they were like online girls, fashionistas online kinda vibe, so with my defintion, you nailed it
This is great, Saf, and you look like you've lost weight! Keep on, always glad to see your posts, and I'm glad you're taking a healthier pace with videos.
Going with all the baby products insta is pushing, you could buy some popular baby products for crusty
Churnin’ up on a Tuesday
I absolutely adore you and Tyler together! Puns, playing off the puns, a really cute back and forth! You guys were so meant to be! 🖤 Also the witch outfit makes my little goth heart very happy!!! Love your content always!!! 🕸🖤
HAHAHA I SPOT TWICE ON THE EXPLORE PAGE 0:38 love the fact that saf is a kpop stan at heart
You're the least problematic YouTuber and that's why I keep coming back. Love the content.
Ohhh i love this, it makes me want to do this so much!
I honestly did not realise  that that was SAFIYA in the thumbnail.
This video was just what I needed for before I go to bed 😆
Maybe... facebook marketplace next?
for the witch outfit, im pretty sure the rings are there for you to tuck the flaps of the belt in there, so they don't flap around like nipple tassels lmfao
The new house from some angles reminds me of Jenna Marbles house.
Am I the only TNS fan here who remembered the egirls from season 1?
0:38 TWICE OMG
Safiya is descending into Morticia
OMG this was uploaded 2 hours ago!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So, Safiya is on her way to turn her videos into feature films? They're getting longer and longer!
Love that you addressed fit issues I wasn’t sure I was seeing. But how it was explained- literally lol at work in the middle of the night.
I needed a TW before I saw the Jenna Marbles e-girl clip cause I got very sad again. It’s like an ex that you’ll never get over
Please.. if you do see this, Safiya.. search Bate la Mayonesa.. it's from a song, in Spanish, that you might like 😅 salutations from Argentina!
I want Safiya to try the e girl look ☺️☺️☺️❤️❤️
❤️
Once again Tyler and Saf’s house looks so similar to jenna and Juliens. Like that lounge is v similar 😂😂
I’m upset at the fact that you didn’t call karolina for the first outfit
so is nobody gonna talk about Safiya's phone background..... so cute
38 minutes of Safiya? Big YES
11.45 you could say you were looking for the line of best FIT
If you had put the skirteralls back on with the pink jacket + powerpuff girls shirt, that would’ve definitely been an e-girl look lol! 💗🖤
It seems funny that she still had tyler's picture as her background.
When you gotta pause the video every five seconds to follow the gothic and 90s-00s shops because your Instagram shop is too basic...
O.M.G. Those moon shoes are so freaking cool.  Switch out the laces for sure but I ADORE THEM. I like all the outfits but the "witch" top feels like middle school where the girls always wore shorts with stuff like, "BOOTY CALL" on the ass lmao. I kinda dig the high waisted jeans and the pink jacket haha. You look cute with pink hair. Not really "YOU" but you owned it haha. And of course the "colonial" style was super cute :3 Always so good to see you, I missed you both!
Saf’s hair has gotten so long omg!! Love it
If anyone knows where she got those masks please tell me, especially the last one!! 🥰
11:36 look at her phone
Me: Thinking I might find some cool things to buy Instagram: Equestrian attire Me: 👁👄👁  TIL equestrian attire exists
Ok but the way that saf is filming kinda reminds me of jenna marbles in terms of the background ajskd. No? Just me? Probably 😂
Now my only wish is for her to post more often
Should I be concerened, that I am seeing this video in November ? Is this a time bug ? A Youtube bug ? A Safiya Bug? hehe, ovarall, joking. I'm just happy to see another video posted <3 I really enjoyed this video. It was wholsome, fun and informative <3
I think a pair of distressed shorts would have worked better for the last outfit. Also, the wig isn't really great.
The pastels and graphic shirts are more VSCO girl than e girl. E girl seems to be more like late 90s/early 2000s punk.
No one       Not even my bestie     Not even Tyler       Me:YASSSSS SAFIYA HAS POSTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Your editing is AMAZING 💜💜💜👌
If only you had put on the wig with witch outfit it would have been a better match to the e-girl aesthetic.
Tyler and Safiya are both slowly just morphing into the real life Addams family. And I’m here for it.
The wig looks great! Wonderful job Tyler! the witch look was cool. I liked how the c on the shirt looked like a moon like the shoes. Btw, mabe the laces should go into the boots, or use what we call 'militery knot' (I do not know it's real name 😂) The opening song! I haven't heard it for so long (actually not true because I was looking for your videos and colb videos lately 😉)
Girl the jokes were on point with this video loved it <3<3<3
i’m probably out of touch too but i’d call that e-girl lol
This, this is how I know you understand your audience- by uploading a new video literally in the middle of the night.
The 2nd outfit is the best one
I can tell you had fun (or at least you faked it well LOL).  This was great, the editing is spot on!!
Me anytime a new safiya video hits: its been 84 years
The overall skirt needed the straps to be thread through the metal rings 😉 Also, the pink jacket would look cute with the second outfit with a different black top due to the sleeves. My favorite is the second outfit😍
The pink hair is everything
I think a Safiya shopping haul binge is just what I need to stop myself from doom scrolling election result updates. I will do this today instead.
when saf said kpop fancams made me laugh so hard
Omg why is no one taking about twice on her tabs!!!! Where are my ONCES!!
no one saf&tyler: GOTH MILK! IT’S A PUN!
Isnt anyone gonna talk abt how she roasted those tik tok kids?
Safiya!!
was having the worst day ever till i say these in my notifications ❤️
🖤🖤🖤🖤
*safbat:* <rants about how the entire internet thinks shes pregnant and how its not true>   *my brain:* what if tho.
I love the second outvit the most but the pink wig is so cute
Where to buy this sunflower mask? It's so cuuute
I actually love the last outfit on you. The jacket and hair look amazing, and it sticks out because it’s so far off from what you’d usually wear.
Baby announcement wooden disc 🪵😅
i reaally like the X picks my outfits
It's probably lolita they thought you tried gothic let's add some cuteness to her life though they don't how cute you already are💜❤❤💙
The shoes with the second outfit are amazing! Just tuck those laces in, baby!!
I love the second outfit it looks so good on you😭
Why is nobody talking about the fact that the pink hair actually looks good on Saf
Thank you for helping me take a mental break from my deployment and the political battleground going on back home!
Also seeing Saf not in black is freaking me out
Did anyone else see the outfits and be like “oh okay yeah, nice” and then when she put on the mask be like “OH MY GOSH SHE LOOKS LIKE A HIGH SCHOOLER, SHE DOESNT EVEN LOOK LIKE HER”. just me?
When shoelaces are too long u can just make two bows in each of them. It looks cute and the laces won‘t bother u🥰
saf's wallpaper tho 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
she dyed the ends of her hair! i wonder if theres a video coming 🤔
Wait, Hoefina, did I get that right?...  Ye Ole Approvedth.
Huh. Never heard of IGTV.
Silly Instagram. You can’t pin down safiyas style. Not even Safiya can pin down safiyas style. It’s a fools errand to even try.
the third look is better off without the jacket
TWICE!
Let’s be honest... Saf’s one of the only YouTubers who still continues creating authentic unproblematic content 🤗
i honestly had no clue what an e-girl was either
Why r u the hottest person alive
Honestly, that shady looking site might have been stealing that art from someone else. It would be hard to find stolen designs that way with that 'hidden' system.  *Edit: THAT WAS A BOSS ASS PUN, TYLER! I loved it
Your hair looks really good in the center part
THE THOT-ICIA WAS SO FUNNY TO ME IDK WHY, IT WAS PROBS MORTICIA WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG
Anyone else keep thinking their house looks exactly like Jenna and Juliens house??
uh                                                                         hi 🥺
Pink hair actually suits you. Pink tones that you had on, are not a bad shade for your skin.
I need to know where Safiya's blouse with these grey roses is from 😭
The fact that I like her video before it even starts because I know it’s going to be good
hey saf, can you react on the novympia 'safiya nygaard parody'??? it's like really spot on... also <3
Tyler is so supportive of EVERY crazy idea Safiya brings to the table, it's adorable and very funny.
Yas! Gurlll! Get that Honey money!
Saf: "I'm so bad at roller skating" Ty:" you're legitimately terrible "  Lmfaooooo like wheres the faith tyler lol
Didn't zuckelberg make facebook not inst
i used to be obsessed with this girl in 2018😭
Fun fact. I work at the Australian version of Colonial Williamsburg and I have to dress like I'm at the 1850's goldrush
A tip for the shoelaces! I always tie them, then pull them almost all the way through and tie them again with the already made tie, if that makes sense. It looks cute and is very practical!
I love how y'all say Oregon.
Late night Saf video!! Yay!!! 🖤
Finally!! Wow! Was missing this so badly❤️
Wow the witch outfit tho... I'm in love!
not me recognizing where saf lives 👁👄👁
Her living room is built like jenna marbles , that’s crazy
Hi
Why you are aplouding so slow buttt!I still idle you!❤️❤️
Safiya is taking Mr.Beasts spot for the face of honey 🍯 👀
i missed that intro music soo much 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
You honestly remind me of Just Sharon
Watching and enjoying this vid on Insta shop even though i am not using Insta anymore cause it got me Bad feelings all along.
She looks so good with pink hair. Especially with her dark eyebrows literally the most unique and great look
Do they wear a mask everywhere outside there house? Like they were all by them selfs in most of the places they filmed.  Also, I only wear it in places and when there's a crowd.
I’m obsessed with the witch outfit and the long hair with the middle part DIET GOTH QUEEN
This was so needed. I'm going through a weird emotional time and was just dipping down into "crying into my towel because I thought a shower would make me feel better" when I noticed this posted!
Ok but that jacket in black👌🏼👌🏼
I actually loved the third outfit! You were rocking the wig. I will be patiently waiting for the franken-mug video lol 😆
The pink hair looks hot on saf 😍
Girl you rocked all the 3 outfits actually! especially loved the first and second one and omg i want those celestial boots so much 😭 also tempted with how cute that denim pink cropped jacket isss
Sophia: we are not there yet.   Me: YET WHAT
I think the shoelaces are long because people like to lace their shoes in fun ways sometimes and the styles take more length
The wig looks amazing =^.^= i remember how confused i was when i first started cosplaying. It can be intimidating at first. You should try some anime cosplay outfits.
Safiya looked so damn good in that second witchy outfit!! Yesssss ✨🖤
Instanstore:Ok you’ve got three choices Pilgrim Disney Goth fanny pack
Okay but I actually really want a “break a bunch of mugs and glue them together” video.
This is so creepy, but the layout of your new house looks v similar to jenna marbles'!!!! It made me feel nostalgic and happy and I'm happy you have a home to share with Tyler and Crusty!!!!!!!
The butter wench outfit reminds me of a fancy Mennonite. If you wore that in my area in Pa no one would give you a second look.
I'm down for the broken mug concept! 😂 Okay, maybe not ALL. But a few... then you put them back together and use gold foil in the cracks just like that popular Japanese method of fixing broken items. I loved the 2nd outfit, Saf! Maybe you could wear a jumper over the top to hide the text & to downplay its gothiness(?) 😂
Hiiiiiiii
Still waiting for the house tour 🧐
I think the third “genre” of outfit would be Y2K but I’m not sure
Chaeyoung tho 00:38
WHY ARE THE BOOTS NO LONGER AVAILABLE 😭
NOW A TYLER VERSION🤪🤪
YAY THE OLD SONGGGGG I RECOMENDED IT YAYYYYY
i love how her explore page is filled with kpop, like i tooo have fallen for that trap.
Safiya can really rock any outfit. I love the goth look!
I'm sorry 😧 I'm only four minutes in, but did everyone know that Instagram had all of these functions?!?!? 😳 Like- I've only ever used it to view photos and friends! Since when was there shopping? WHAT'S AN IGTV?!?!   Oh man, is 24 old? I feel so old.
Every time you put a Jenna Marbles clip in a video, my heart sings
Let Saf churn butter!
the witchy outfit looks so goooooddddd
6:01  *THEY DO*
“There’s no pun there....” *literally seconds later* “OOOOHHHH” 😂😂
*but let’s talk about how she has K-POP fancams* ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
If you decide you want to wear your ‘skirterall’ again took your tassels through the rings and into the top of the skirt so they don’t flap about
Their house looks like Jenna marbles house
LOL love seeing all the TWICE content on your explore page 😍
Tie laces around your ankle a couple of times
I think for the boots you're supposed to kind of loop them around the boot before tying? Idk though
That witch outfit was absolutely everything!!
Hi Saf, i think 3rd outfit's jacket would go really really well with the suspender skirt. Also, try sticking the extra flaps of suspenders into those rings as if they're belt loops, it will most probably solve your suspender flap problem 😂❤🙏🏻
I watched this falling asleep, and was so confused when you cut to you looking like you were at jennas house
Their new house looks very similar to jenna's
Hi mam I am your insta follower.i think you are so down to earth . And also I watch the stories you post on YouTube as well about the video processing between uploads the cat videos ,the music bits and you uploading a video and also you dancing with your hands and face for the music . Love  your content ,so fun to watch and don't know why your videos are so aesthetically pleasing and satisfying.lots of love mam,keep making videos but please make sure you are having some rest.lots of love all the way from India mam🥰🥰
not tyler saying  “now you’re the butterfly meme” 💀💀💀😭🤚🏽
you need to do more, can never get enough of your uploads !!
It’s a soft G in mingalondon, like a minger
"E-girl" Safiya oddly gave me big Electra Heart vibes. Also, for the mask thing, I keep mine in a ziplock with some gum or mints and it makes it minty fresh!
I really really want those moon dust boots 😔  But i searched and couldn’t find them...
Here you see Saf channeling her inner belle delphine
Outfit 2 was *chef's kiss *
14:22 did you just quote LaurenZside?
It’s funny to me how the “pastel not-e-girl look” was the look leaning more towards a fail. *aheh3m* (Based off my personal preferences) *ah3phlem* I feel like it was the cutest look 🥺💕✨
Me when I see anything remotely related to saf:      This is safiya’s new intro soooooonggggg bsh
hello 👋🏻 fellow 🤗 kids 😀 i am ❓one of you 👭
The girly 2000s aesthetic is soft girl I believe, btw those jeans look amazing on you!
Flaunt those nipple tassels, girl! Make Elvira proud! 😂
I must really miss Jenna Marbles. Ty and Saf’s living room and kitchen look ALOT LIKE Jenna and Julien’s.
The pink hair looked good! The jeans, not so much.
I think with the skirt-er-all, you can tuck the nipple flaps into the hole, down into the skirt without affecting the look :)
I keep thinking about that Powerpuff Girls top because that art/graphic was probably stolen art from someone. I doubt the shop that basically clickbaits would have designed that graphic, especially looking at the other stuff which looked more simplistic... I feel bad for the artist or editor that made that graphic that was probably stolen and isn't getting profits... this problem happens a lot where shops will just grab a photo off of Google, even if it's someone's art and is copyrighted...
I don’t know about anyone else but my dad doesn’t wear dad jeans that have an angel on one cheek and the word “angelic” on the other😂
Is it just me because  I think she looks great in a tank top
Next video: melting all of colonial Williamsburg together?
After the pandemic is over you should definitely come to Williamsburg!  One of my aunts works in ticketing, so she doesn't dress up, but she definitely knows some of the reenactors. I believe she's mentioned being invited to one of Thomas Jefferson's parties before...
Oooh! That wig, the black skirt, moon boots, and either the colonial blouse or black shirt would make a pretty cool outfit!
Safiya looks so cute in literally any outfit.
Saf you gotta go to the american girl store and get a mini me and then try to recreate american girl outfits
You know it’s going to be a fun video when you hear ‘This is Safiya Nygaard’s intro song’.  Actually who am I kidding, every video is fun!
OMG I WAS LIKE DYING ABOUT YOUR NEXT VIDEO THANKS GOD IT CAME OUT  LOVE YOU 😍
Safiya's childhood nostalgia is my adolescent disdain, and I'm kinda here for it.
I see someone else is a twice stan. You should do korean style nails!!
I love your aesthetic😆 that what I waNt my aesthetic to be !!! Given me very much .monster high and witch vibes love !!👽👽👽👽
Could you send me that wig if you don't want it? I sent a DM with the same username lol.
Just past midnight for me! This was fun to watch and also appreciated the Shore references 😂 ah, the good ol' days...
😂 Did anyone notice safiya's phone  wallpaper/background?
Saf where did you get your mask that has the flowers on it?
saf's skin is glowing 😍
I m trying to remember when last she wore a different colour shirt except for black
Maybe the Powerpuff girl top took so long because the seller could be a dropshipper (people who sell stuf they order from Aliexpress or Wish, google it 😘). So maybe you bought it indirectly from Wish or AliExpress 🧐🙀
Just enjoying a brunch on a beautiful day
Tyler's memes of production joke is so underappreciated omg
All the outfits are soooo different and contrasting 🤣👌🏼
I was waiting for your video ( finally)😍😍😍
Why does it look like she’s in Jenna Marbles house?
Those shoes are no longer available 😭😭
Nobody:   The video when my mom walks in: 34:56
Safiya this is so not what your vid is about but where did you get your masks from??? Also I love your content, so glad to see you posting!! <3
That wig 😍
Safiya can definitely work with pink hair that wig looks so good on her!!!!!!
I have a project due in an hour why am I watching a 38-minute YouTube video from Safiya?
I swear that last outfit with the mask, if you swapped the pants out for patent faux leather pants and the shoes for 6 inch heels, I get heavy Gaga vibes
Guys... You are awesome! 😂♥️
Is that a Jack phone case?!
Can we just talk about Safiya’s wallpaper-
Ore-uh-gun.
you look so good in stuff,  you're so pretty <3
according to the look of your house, you gotta be J&J's neighbors! i'm both excited for you , and super jealous! x
The mere fact everything in those shop tabs can also be linked to past videos pretty easily I wouldn't be surprised if it's also pulling from search history and such.   Also I'd absolutely love to see a wig video from Safiya, maybe like buying wigs then building outfits around the wigs or something.
Seize the memes of production.
fun fact: totally spies has all of the episodes here on youtube.
I'm so confused..  Why are they in jenna marbles house???
Can u tech us history becuz ur are so detailed
Ore-gun not ore-gone
Much joy has been bestowed upon thee from thine's video
Watching your video in morning is just the treat i needed
"OOOOOO SHES A WITCH" 😂🙏 LOVE THIS. LOVE TOO YOU BOTH
Safiya is actual body goals
Super fun video
that goth outfit was so insanely cute on her and i really want those shoes now
Loved seeing this video
Very happy to see u...❤️❤️❤️
The into is iconic !!! Love it!
I always get so excited when I see you post!!
Any day with an almost 40 min Saf video, is gonna be a great day!!!
Yessss, this is a perfect gift for my birthday! Always excited to see a new Safiya video 😄
TRYNA CATCH ME CHURNING BUTTER 😂
When safiya said witch the peoplewho cackled were probably like "SisTeRs!"
You two are the cutest, best couple ever! Love y’all!
i feel like the goth milk wasn’t even a pun it was just a weird product idea
Can we talk about how her house looks almost exactly like Jenna Marble’s house
You look so amazing😍🤩
I can’t be the only one that noticed how similar this room looks to Jenna Marble’s house honestly wow
Tbh the outfit is not *not* egirl. Each piece I could definitely see an egirl wearing 😊
I grew up in Williamsburg / CW and would loveeeee if you did a video there lmfao
Pink wig gives me Jewel Stait (Firefly) vibes. 💜
The pink hair works
Dress like your Escape the Night costars for a week
You guys and Jenna and Julien literally own the same house.
Love the Video 💗💗💗 thanks
No one  Not even a dust  Me: CHAEYOUNG ON HER IG EXPLORE😭😭😭
So sorry the angel jeans didn't fit.  They r darling!!!!  Also, luv the shoes!!!!!
Obsessed with her top in the honey promo, very morticia Adam's goes business
Please follow the Dwight Schrute makeup tutorial!
Yeeeeeesssssss!!!!!!!!! This is what I needed to cheer me up after a really awful week. Thank you!
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Why you post this at one am?
Safiya! this video brought me so much joy! that witch outfit was so cute on you & i’m going to have to grab a pair of those boots for myself! lol! 😌✨🖤
Bruh can we appreciate how hard Safiya works to make such quality videos💙
OMG YYAASSSS✨✨✨💖✨✨✨✨✨
10:28 I MAY HAVE JUST SCREAMED. YASMIN BENOIT!!! ASEXUAL BLACK ALTERNATIVE ICON!!!! IN A SAFIYA NYGAARD VIDEO HOLY SHIT
It is not so serious but I looked at safiya's dms, lexime.fairuse.org/q4MoJp/k5IOfq.html I admit that I am sad, poor boyfriend I hope it changes
"Fellow kids" sounds better with deep woman  voice like Safiya, Lauren...
House tour
you look SO SO good in everything you've got 🥺😍
When are you doing a house tour!!
I dressed as an egirl for Halloween and saw the same picture on Google😂
26:58 is there a chance that the straps are meant to be tucked into the center of the rings? That way the extra length would lay underneath the waist part and sit flat
Did anyone hear "Firework" lyrics? Just me? Got it.
What ever Safiya wears and does, in whichever month of the year, SHE IS FABULOUS IN ALL WAYS. I want to get out of my home, but seeing your videos gives me happiness . Love from me Safiya and Tyler. Stay safe and as jolly as you always. are
This really brightened my day! I have been having a hard time at the moment and this gave me the laughter and fun that I needed! Thank you 💕 love from Australia 🇦🇺
your content is always spot on. you’re extremely unique and so cool! keep up the good work saf ! 👏🏼
Saf in pink?!?😯😱
These are my favorite type of your videos! I think I would watch you do anything, but I love wish-type hauls and fun outfit shopping. :)
That kitchen set up looks sooooo much like Jenna Marbles house
ahhahahaha safiya churning the butter
Diet goth 🤣 the best way to describe your fashion. And the shape of the power puff girl top really flattered your shoulders!
Your hair is so pretty in the clips
17:43 thick ass give em whiplash
It’s been a month? Where you been Saf?
I enjoy your videos every single time! So nice <3
You gotta always love goth Safiya 😛😍❤️❤️
OMG Blackmilk got recommended to you on insta!! Amazing! <3
GTL GTL GTL
Colonial Williamsburg has some ghost tours if you’re into that!
Why does the 'egirl' outfit just look like gabbie hannah 😂😂😂
Till this day she is still using her Fiverr intro song
From what I've seen so far, my Instagram shop tab contents can be classified into two main categories:  1) beautiful men in swimwear/underwear with varying degrees of skimpiness  2) hockey jerseys  😂
i love this kind of video!
Safiya looks so pretty without make up
don't think i didn't see twice
Any Once🍭 over here?
You are so much fun! Thank you Saf and Ty!🍒
Love love love this. Also my wallet hates you for telling me about the Gathering of Goods store, Saf. I love historical clothing too much to not drool over things on there. Also, I do not live near Colonial Williamsburg but I do live near a 19th century historical village that would be a good use of your "Pioneer Woman" ideas. Just sayin.
I'm just curious to know did you get that frankin mug... and yes the idea of making a video on destroying the mugs and gluing them is legit... we want that video 😂
Switch the pink wig with the goth outfit and just have your hair with the soft girl one and they would be even more amazing
You do not say OREGON correctly. It’s more like gun like sun or son, not gone... or something like that.
I’m pretty sure those are stick on earrings, as a former preteen who wasn’t allowed to pierce my ears 😂
I love the witchy outfit! Seriously soooo perfect for Halloween season 🦇🖤
The more I watch the video, I kind of love your 3rd outfit 😊
Love your wallpaper!
I actually thought the pink wig looked cute on you Safiya!😍.. Tyler did a good job putting it on!👍    Anyway, I Love your videos!🥰💖... I was so excited when I seen you posted a new one! You & Tyler are so Funny & Cute together! ((B.T.W.-You guys have the best banter, one lines, & references ever!.. lol!🤣))
The franken mug is so on brand haha
love the matching facemasks 🤩
SAFIA WE NEED A HOUSE TOUR OR INTERIOR DESIGN VIDEO WHERE YOU STYLE  YOUR HOUSE  THAT WOULD BE EPIC
40 seconds in AND IM CRYING CAUSE MISS SON CHAEYOUNG APPEARED
they're boot laces on smaller shoes
The witchy look looks so good on you !
;0
With the wig can you put little pigtails coming off the sides would be so cute
I still don't get goth milk lol
My Instagram tab will turn me into a goth..........
This was awesome I missed these kinds of videos woohoo
Super fun! Thanks for sharing :) I’d love to see how you would maybe style your fave 1-3 pieces with your usual outfits as well. Let us know on IG how they end up mixing with your existing wardrobe!
Thank you for this truly. I needed this.
Me wonders whats in my own shop tab. **its entirely full of tea, bath bombs and skincare "Wow im really predictable arent I?" 🤣
her voice is so soothing
the memes of production 😭😭
Heart to create a petition for a Safiya and Tyler vlog channel!! I need more of her and just chill un produced content!!
I think you are supposed to tuck the extra part of the suspenders into the rings, like a normal belt. Not sure though 🙃
“Tyler...I nominate you for dysentery!”  “Fineeeee...I do have IBS!” “you do!” 💀💀💀
OMG TOTALLY SPIES
Saf! If you want to wear the ‘witch’ shirt without it being so on the nose you can cover it with another patch or something
I want her to do rare beauty Or something
Tbh the not-so E girl look wasn’t horrible. I feel like if the bottoms were leggings instead it would’ve been more balanced. The mom jeans ain’t it
Idk why the first look made me think of Ella enchanted..
I love minga London
This is SUCH a good video!!!😍😍😍
can we appreciate safiyas home screen for a sec
You're incredibly good at identifying trend eras and referencing dolls or characters with fashion! Like how do you hold so much information in your brain!! Love you
the "e-girl" look reminds me of Halsey from the BTS Boy With Luv music video.
Btw idk if anyone commented this yet but for that suspender skirt you could probably tuck the excess strap back into the ring. Not sure how it would look but it would minimize the flappage! if the straps look too bulky underneath the dress you could trim them and glue them down to keep them from popping up! The skirt is super cute on you i'd love for you to be able to get more wears out of it!
Came here to say that yes, you look INSANELY GORGEOUS with the pink hair!! I love it so much. And about what Tyler said, I think the black brows contrasting with the pink hair works so well! You can literally pull off anything you QUEEN
nobody does it like Saf when it comes to witchy outfits, she's a natural 🤭🙌🏻
I love how Nayeon is just there in your feed.
Oh honey (get it?) this has been here for over a year
Loved it love u saf
Hello from New Zealand 🌏🌈
I'm just so happy Safiya's back :)
The queen is back in business 😌
How can you look gorgeous in everything??? And Tyler you're hilarious, but let saf have her Macbeth reenactment...just for fun
Is Tyler in this video?
As an Oregonian it hurts to hear you say Oregon
for the skirt-erall you can tuck the straps into the metal loops i think like a belt !!
Did anyone else lowkey stress out at the number of unread texts and emails 🙀
please do mystery boxes from different shops
The mask was a little askward on the first outfit, but they somehow really complemented the second and third outfit! Also, the not-e-girl outfit was super cute, but so much not Safiya that it looks like she's borrowed it from someone else xD
It would be fun to do a dress up video like this but with Tyler like a couple cosplay or edit or something that would be cool
Okay but hear me out, the top half of the “e-girl” outfit and the goth girl skirt. Killer. That jacket was so cute on you.
The goth look was definitely a stunning look on you!
All 3 outfit are prettyyyy You totally nail it!!! Well I think the wig might too much for the look 🤔
please do mystery boxes from different shops
Mime shows me stuff i love but its either A) japanese sizimg amd i a phatt bitch B) expensive
11:17 she missed the lil peep reference/didnt know 😔
I make song covers on my channel! Please check it out!😀😀
please do mystery boxes from different shops
Not Safiya getting Twice/Kpop on your Instagram feed 😂
I love watching your process on your Instagram! It’s like rocket science of editing.
The way she subtly said she was a witch 😂 LIKE SAME GIRL SAMEEEE
Love it!
Tyler gets a good job from me for the wig! 👍
So no one’s gonna talk about miss Chaeyoung being on Saf’s explore page...a cultural reset😌
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I need a mix of all 3 out fits now
Oh how much I love this series and that intro. 😭 FEELS SO GOOD to be able to listen to it again, have rewatched the previous ones which had it enough number of times 😂
You rocked the black outfit 😍😍
That witch outfit was FIRE 🔥 🔥 🔥
at least she wore her petticoat
She looked like Marina and the Diamonds Electra Heart Era in the last outfit omg
Despite having the Thot-icia and 'e-girl' looks, it's the civil war reenactment outfit that gets her gyrating 😂
we see all the kpop on your explore 🥴
SAFIYA IS BACK❤️❤️❤️❤️
Hi
Love the video but it's not Oregon is pronounced 'in' not 'on' like 'Oregin'
ooh those shoes!! i’m in love! 💜💜💜
Safiya looks so good!!! She's glowing!!!
AHHH YES GURL FINALLY!!! I MISS YOUR VIDEO😭❤️
Actually surprisingly roller skates have been doing insanely well on Instagram not sure why but a lot of people are getting ads for roller skates
I love the Colonial Williamsburg outfit. Someone get her the appropriate undergarments! 😊😊
more shopping vids plz it’s cures my retail therapy needs 😭
that second outfit was actually so cute on you though
Confirmed: these videos are my favorite
Please let that be a Trail to Oregon Starkid reference about dysentery 😂
Wow dang safiya matured so muchh
i would love to see your one woman play wearing instagram outits
Dude! Im an hour late but id still consider this early!!!
Omgoodness, to be a fly on the inside of those cars Saf STRUTTED past in her cotton candy Power Puff Girl outfit! 🤣🤣🤣 Safiya, I truly admire your confidence.  You and Ty are so much fun.  Hope you are doing well. ♥️
In my opinion the "E-Girl" I think you mistaken the name I think you mean "Soft Girl"
When you say thin / swimsuit material, do you mean the material that Halloween costumes are made out of? because that just means that it's some mass-produced crappy thing from China. Learned my lesson about that with shein.
this must be fave makeover vid of safiya so far 11/10 would wear all three of them
It's been so long 😭😭😭
Regarding historical clothing: Do you watch Bernadette Banner on YouTube?  She is divine!
If it wasn't for the fact that I wear a UK size 10, I'd be stalking you for those damn boots! 😻😹
pink looks good
You and Tyler have the best relationship oml.
love your videos but would appreciate if you didnt refer to people whose name you dont even know as "she" it cant be that hard to use they/them.
Me: pausing to follow all these accounts because omg I need!
they said Oregon wrong
the way that i am the witchy and e-girl outfits combined,,, like that’s my daily fit
" I feel like the pastel galaxy vibe is bringing together  the sort of futuristic hair and the cherubim on my ass."
The butter churning wench outfit without bonnet gave me Ella enchanted vibes. 🥺💕
Saf: "I'm not sure if the pink wig looked good on me or not" Me:  😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
OMG YESSSSSSS I missed uuu
Not that it matters... but as one of Scandinavian descent of the same name.. it’s pronounced KEER-STEN :) regardless, love the video!! 💕😊
Similar fireplace to Jenna Marbles?
Now I'm invested and really want to know: did the Maleficent ears end up in the cart or not? They were by far the coolest Mickey ears I have ever seen!
so happy this came out on my birthday best birthday present a new safiya videoooooaaaaaa
BLINK in your areaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
The way an American pronounces ‘Minga’ is the funniest thing to a British person like me
I love her on the pink wig is that just me?
Cool
The baby's name (5:33) is Brynnleigh Fern. Thought everyone should know.
I need more videos from you! You are such a breath of fresh air in all this 2020 bs!
I kind of expected you to start singing songs from Trail to Oregon while in the Franken-American Girl outfit 🤣
Finally after SOO long safiya has posted!!
liking saf's videos the minute you start it cause u know it'll be bomb af <3
I wonder if this video was recorded before the Instagram update
When did her hair get sooo long!?
The Franken American girl outfit gave me Amish woman vibes (if you don't know what that is, it's easier to look it up than for me to explain but it's basically a very strict way of living where they don't use any cars/tractors/other motorized vehicles, (they use horses to power farming equipment and to travel around) they also most of the time don't go to school past 8th grade-ish, and they don't use anything electronic. If they need a vet, they use a friend's phone or they use a horse and carriage to get to the vet, and they dress very modest and more older times ways. Their modesty is kinda like the Muslim amount of modesty. They are also most common in the Midwest (specifically Michigan. They live mostly in Hillsdale) and parts of the west.))
haaha twice making an appearance goooo
The Sammy sweetheart necklace KILLEED ME 😅😂😂😂
Safiya’s phone background is just a low angle shot of Tyler’s face. I love that   3:16 btw
The 'e-girl' style you bought is called y2k style, Early 2000's style. Maybe you should make a seperate video of that style and I also like seeing you buying stuff YOU like, so I also like to see a video about that 🙂🙃
The colonial outfit: without the bonnet, you look like an actual witch in any period-based movie and it's awesome  WITCH!!~!! outfit: looks amazing. love it. not too much at all. nuff said.  The not "E-Girl" outfit: yeah, you look amazing with pink hair. I think the jacket could be worked into your wardrobe as a brightener but the jeans I would definitely toss.
Lmfao so I actually dress in mid-19th century inspired clothes every day, and back in the before times when I went outside, I got a lot of very similar attention. People are generally very excited and curious when you wear clothes like that, and it's kinda fun (plus it prevents me from getting catcalled by men for the most part, so that's nice).
the memes of production joke was great thanks tyler i appreciate you
Is that Twice I see ?
Okay but fr does that movie on IGTV exist?
I love that for the goth & pastel outfits the masks compliment the looks so well!
lmao “i am so bad at rollerskating!”  “you’re legitimately terrible.”
When i saw that intro my face went \[^0^]/
Can confirm the goth skirt was backwards JSDGKLSDJG Zip at the front is normal
Love that you’re showing the editing process on  insta stories now! Great content of course
I love Saf and Tyler but did anybody else die a little inside when they pronounced Oregon, Or-e-gon. It's Or-a-gun!
5:18 i wonder if she tried to look like shego or not
stay hydrated and take a sip of water every time Safiya mentions Colonial Williamsburg
Lo ves this video ughh yessss
Safiya looks so pretty omg I love it
i LOVED the "not e-girl" outfit on you lol
She's back
First outfit DEFINITELY looks so much better without the bonnet. Having your hair down makes it look much less stuffy and much more romantic. The second outfit is honestly goals! (I might. . . Buy those shoes. . . ) The third outfit would do better without the wig, since it's kind of overpowering with the jacket, a plain white tank/tee, and. . . Cuter shoes? The plain white sneaks make it very casual but the jacket kind of demands special shoes, like platforms. I'm thinking white with pink socks to kind of tie in with the jacket. (The wig does look super cute tho, it's just that it makes the outfit unbalanced since you only have pink on your upper body.)
maybe you tie the moon shoe's laces around the ankle like converse high tops. hopefully that helps you out
I love that Tyler was pretty much like LETS DO IT! to destroying all the mugs in their house....just to re-glue them!
Safiya on the second outfit is deadass the definition of e-girl and i love her outfit
I love the first outfit! But the third is actually my favorite
The. Pink. Looks. Great. Bish!! Who ya kidding?!
I love your videos saf you are so beautiful 😍🙂🙂
saf is looking so gooood 🥺
The pink looks AMAZING on you and I am so jealous of the jacket
Tyler Appreciation time!!  love the Wig <3
omg omg omg omg omg yaaaaaaaaaassssss they posted another vidio  love you saf hope yr well
This video sparks joy .
I love her so so much 😂 these are literally my three opposing aesthetics. Also love that she's confident enough to just dance around on the streets as a pilgrim lady, like in front of people's houses. Saf is the fucking best 🖤🦇
hi safiya, i love you
This look like Jenna marbles house
Safiya can you make a video about normal Korean wear, as in what South Korean people themselves wear not K-pop idols, as a lot of us are into kpop we get many recommended ads of Korean style clothing on instagram , you could start with user ‘mejiwoo’ on instagram ! who owns a very popular korean clothing brand on insta :)
THE PINK LOOKS SO GOODDD
Adds all items to cart
Men's jeans fit weird.  Like in the hips.
This is the kind of top tier content that I’m here for❤️❤️
Lol we have a Mennonite community a town over so the colonial Williamsburg outfit was very familiar.
safiya is a twice stan
I get so excited when Saf uploads a new video
omg i love this video i like the silhouteete of the witch shirt but i didnt like the "witch" print. i loved your makeup in outfit 3
"my fresh cream brings all the boys to the yard" I- IM EVAPORATING GOOBYE
It's "Or-a-gen" (say it fast like organ) You have hurt my Oregonian soul 😭
Never knew I needed “I dressed as an American girl doll” video until this lol
18:15 why did you break into jenna marble's house?
if you wear the pink wig with witch fit... tada e-girl!! am i right?
I am commenting 1hour later but that doesn't mean I am late I watched this video 3 times that's why I am late
Oh I have missed your videos soooo much! I don’t even like watching other people try clothes on and stuff but I seriously LOVE ALL YOUR VIDEOS!!!
I got an American girl doll ad on this video right away lol
who's here at 2 am to 4 am ?          just me lol
I’m from Virginia, locals still call it Colonial Williamsburg 😂🙄
Safiya embodies the Macbeth, but make it insta baddie aesthetic
Those jeans gave me real 'tight rolling my jeans in 5th grade' flashbacks😖
All those outfits are hella cute but the only thing I would change is for the 3rd one to dip the wig.
I saw Twice and Itzy on that Explore page 👀👀👀👀 who's your favorite, Safiya?
Long time no see you, both of you actually~
It is not so serious but I looked at safiya's dms, lexime.fairuse.org/q4MoJp/k5IOfq.html I admit that I am sad, poor boyfriend I hope it changes
the witchy outfit was made for you you are born to be witchy!!! looks awesome
My favorite parts of each outfit are the wig from the e girl look, the skirt in the old fashioned american girl doll look and the shirt in the gothic look! 😁 Love you Safiya!
Saf has the best memory I’ve ever seen
I think she fell into the soft girl for the 3rd outfit
hi ]
Why not tuck the straps into the rings?  You looked amazing.
do a mortcia adams cosplay please
Was that Yasmine Benoit in your follows? Love the allyship!
its soft girl look btw :))!!
I think the pink jacket would be nice with the matching pink skirt.   But I’m 100% more of the witchy girl type than a Colonial Williamsburg or Safiya E-Girl.
Safiya should not be able look good in the witchy/goth style AND the e girl style. That’s too much power for one person to have.
Been waiting so long for this
It's 4am here, but i don't care, I'm going to watch it
I actually like the pink outfit the best looks so good 💗
I’m so happy you are posting! I’ve loved your videos for years 💜
......the way they're saying Oregon😳😶
Had to like for the memes of production
Timing is everything! I can fall into neurodivergent heaven while listening to you infodump your research on me. You brilliant young adults 👏 Thank you for helping my end my night. Xx
Please dye your hair pastel pink or like ombre to pastel pink
It is not so serious but I looked at safiya's dms, lexime.fairuse.org/q4MoJp/k5IOfq.html I admit that I am sad, poor boyfriend I hope it changes
i think you’re supposed to tuck the end of the strap into that hoop on the skirteralls
I don't need Honey. I rarely shop online. I like to look at, touch & examine what I might purchase so I do my shopping locally.
I usually don’t like wigs but the pink wig looked great.
I'm kinda loving the wig and dark eyebrows
Mannnnn u pulled off the last outfit sooooo well
You look SO beautiful omfg dude!!@!
The first outfit with your hair down is giving me badass gunslinger lady in the wild west vibes. Like if you threw a duster on and a big cowboy hat you'd be in business. I think with the wig your super dark eyebrows do contrast a lot so maybe going for a brown instead of jet black eyebrow would have meshed better? But it looked really cute on you :D
Ppl: getting hearts from saf Me: gimme tips on how to be famous in the comments other than sinking in a pool of comments pls XD
i got a gay shirt on my shop page so they know me well
I am watching during my online class...😂😂❤❤ PS- @12:30pm
I love how in the first outfit she feels herself
I love these videos and have missed your old school stuff... Love you and Tyler!
Not to be dramatic but  *THUNDER AND LIGHTNING,  ENTER THREE WITCHES*
I was gonna say the last outfit does suit her
Why does Safiya look more and more like Morticia Addams?
YOU’RE BACK!!!! Hii ❤️❤️❤️
not going to lie, i thought this was filmed at jenna and juliens house. u gifts must live close to each others because the layout just looks too similar 😂
I truly want to see a Saf and Karolina collab or Saf with any vintage youtuber to give her a historical makeover
I love Saf and Tyler but any other Oregonians flinch at “Or-e-gone” ?
I want the witch outfit boots so bad
“Let me churn the butter...please.” We need this haha!! 😹
Hey, Saf, it makes me so sad that you are forced to talk slowly for the people who are just rude. Be yourself! F them! You will never be able to please everyone, and it's ok. Be yourself for your loving community and everyone who is not happy with your behaviours can just leave. We don't like them. I want you to be happy making content you love and not be stressed about people of the internet. Love you ❤️
Safiya has a new Phone and that disturbs me for some reason ...  RIP Silver iPhone 8, sorry Safiya murdered you in the night...
I live a couple miles from Colonial Williamsburg. Does that count?
okay but I need to know where you got the pastel mask tho
You both live in California and you can’t even pronounce Oregon right I feel betrayedddd  Psa: it’s Org-in not Ore-ray-gone
As someone who lives in Oregon, the way you guys said Oregon killed me 😂😂
Did Safiya steal Jenna and Julien’s house?
the tank top had a stolen design on it. The design belongs to Omighty, which have really good high quality shirts and designs
MY mom wwas just asking about your video abt a moment  ago .and got a notification ..cool
safiya u need the post more fr😔😅🙏
I’m sad that I already downloaded honey about 3 years ago I wish I would’ve downloaded it off of you instead lol I love to support. ANYWAY honey is legit I actually do recommend
The wig definitely would have looked great with the Goth fit!! Loved the video Saf!
When she posts at 12:00 am but u don’t get around to watching it until 1 am    My sleep schedule is just fantastic
do safiya and tyler live in the same neighborhood as jenna and julien?? their backgrounds look so architecturally similar wtf
AAAAAA TWICE AAAAAA <3
Waking up to this video ❤️ it’s gonna be a good day when Safiya posts a video
The "ore-gone" trail 😂😂
I see why you thought E-girl to those looks but it's more of a "Soft-girl" look which is basically a pastel E-girl so it worked out pretty well
Safiya is so beautiful 🥰🥰
OKEE DOKEE i live in oregon and yall are pronouncing it wrong  its or-gin or organ not or-gon
5:01 trans pin!!!!!!!!!! :DDDD
.
Safiya Nagrad: Posts Everyone one: RUSHES TO THE COMMENTS  I create vidz💯🔥
Yay she uploaded! I got my snacks/food ready let’s do this😁
You looked absolutely bomb in everything 😍😍😍 especially the “egirl”
Do you ever feel like a rogue wolf drifting through the wind wanting to start again?
Finally a new video 😁😁😊
Omgg I’m so happy when you upload. Take all the time you need with uploads, I just love you.
the power puff girls tank is a copy of omighty, that brand you bought from is probably reselling crappy aliexpress versions, which is probably why it took so long and why the quality is not great
The second outfit was absolutely beautiful Saf
Safiya’s interests: the bachelor franchise and kpop only
Just for future reference, I’m pretty sure the third “egirl” look actually falls under the umbrella of “y2k” style
Loooove the video Saf
go big at home
Soooo, is that YOUR house or Jenna's? Because they look similar from what I remember of Jenna's videos. I truly hope it is Jenna's just because I miss her so much.
Okay but do you and Jenna Marbles have the same house
why does the pink hair look FABULOUS???
Oh my gosh, welcome back, Safiya! I love you!! 💕💕💕
P sure this was a whole advertisement for IG shop hahaa (even if you didn’t mean to) bc here here I am after the video.... scrolling on IG shop
Everything about this video is great! Made my day haha.
literally I am so sleep deprived and me and my siblingshave the house to ourselves so Ima eat so much oof
Where did you get that galaxy mask? It is super adorable!
Looks like a doll no matter what you wear
Honestly, I'm loving the wig I think it looks very snazzy. Also if you're reading the drink some water and remember you are loved <3.
That pink hair is a good look for safiya
Williamsburg represent! So glad we left such a mark on you, Safiya.
I think the outfit would have been perfect without the pink wig
Outfit one and two I would wear but the jeans in three are a solid nope crop jacket yes but not sold on the shirt I'm  to fat for a crop top
GURL but the witch outfit looks so hot with the mask. You're like a... ninja witch
Nobody: Literally nobody: Me: Ooh! Sofia got a new iPhone!
"were churning were just churning" - best quote by Tyler
The memes of production is a peak joke. Good job Tyler.
I spy a Twice fan 👀
Man, YouTube ads for sure think I should be having a baby. To the point that I now get male fertility ads as well
Omgggg i loveeeed the black witchy outfit! You look amazing in it
Omg I love the goth outfit so much. Especially with the mask!
The way she OOOs and AAAs is the way we react to safiya wearing all the outfits ❤️ Fucking loved the black one like crazy. Yes yes yes!
I’ve really missed you 🥺❤️
I think the colonial blouse would be cute with the overall skirt!
0:35 you can see Twice and BlackPink.  Love that
did anyone else rush to buy the velvet suspender skirt or just me 😭 I love it sm
ok but the heart has to be there for when you do the Pledge of Allegiance to show people you live the country (even if you may not)
I think the way that the wig looks on you it works for you it's long and pink and it just brings out your tone more and it looks good on you it suits you pretty damn good
YYAYAYAYAYYYYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYYAY!!!!!!!
Omg that daenerys reference was all I could think of the moment Safiya put on the wig!!! XD
I cringed when she put the shoes on the table! Anyone else grow up with that superstition? Bad luck to put new shoes on the table
The shirt from the first outfit, skirt and shoes from the second outfit, and the wig from the third outfit would be CUTE AF together.
thought you rocked every look! loved this video :-)
I reckon the powderpuff top with the ober all dress
Omg thank you, I have been waiting for this moment
Saf those are stick-on earrings, not nipple pasties! 😂
Once stay winning, free plug lmao
She did NOT say Ore-gone.....
Love ur “e-girl” makeup 🤗
or a witch from the Salem witch trials! :P
i luv her video's
the overall skirt would look very good with the white blouse from the 1 fit, u know like trendy Zara vibe, they mix velvets and blacks with those types of collars this season
without the bonnet the first outfit is so cottage core!!!!!love it
nobody will see this but i just wanted to say like safiya is so amazing. she is so unproblematic and she is kind and she doesn't put on an act when shes on social media shes weird and a good way and isnt afraid to show it. she doesnt post super often like some other youtubers but i think its actually good because she doesnt feel pressured to and so shes not just putting out content so there is content she puts on content when she feels inspired and so she can actually have fun while doing it instead of some people who put stuff out because they feel they have to which can make the videos not so good. because safiya has fun in her videos and all the stuff i said before it makes every single one of her videos really good. like i have so much respect for you safiya i stan you queen or like you would say friend :) <3
so 2000s fiorucci angels are back...?
Twice BDZ... Your explore page got taste 😌
I think that the suspender dress the straps go in the loops and hide underneath so they dont flap ^_^
i am early
I honestlyyyy adore the pink hair on Saf ;0
Anyone else think she looks EXACTLY like Marina Diamandis in that pink wig and the make up!?!?!??!
Everyone's talking 'bout the clothes, but I see TWICE in 0:37, and it made me happy already.
you sparked much needed joy today! ily saf and ty and crusty!!
The shoes and the jacket are my favourite things!
That hurting feeling when you live in Russia and don’t hap option to put shopping tag on your items so my creations had no chance to be in Safiya’s video😭
the tyler homescreen>>
I am loving the witch outfit boots and wishing I didnt have big feet so I could wear them 😭
Don’t work there but live like 5 miles from CW my 5 year old and I would show you around and tell you the ghost stories (used to do the ghost tours) and what I remember from the educational tour (I remember more ghost stories not gonna lie it’s been like 8 years) if that’s good enough 😂 we have good neighbor passes maybe we can get y’all a discount ok
Safiya’s new house reminds me a great deal of Jenna’s house and it’s making me feel things
SAFIYYAAAAA
I dig the not-e-girl look
The rise of the center part
Safiya: hello fellow kids.... Flashback of Laurenzside: how do you do FELLOW KIDS?
This is EXACTLY what I needed
Ok but seriously has anyone the Selena Gomez igtv movie and is it good
You sent me down a very strange but wonderful rabbit hole
That first outfit was very late Edwardian. I love it 🥰
You want to stand there and pump up and down doe 30 minutes to and hour to make butter.
Only about 10 mins in, and I’m soooooo happy Safiya went with the boots from Rogue & Wolf.  Ive have those shoes for about a year and I adore them!
Safiya and Tyler's relationship is the best.
my question is how does safiya get all these screen recordings with zero notifications
For the witchy outfit tuck the belt straps into the metal loops in the skirt!!!
I jsut know that my sister watch you too
As an Oregonian I was deeply offended when they pronounced it ore-GON. It’s ore-GUN.
wtf is inappropriate about that
RON, STAHP!!
Minga? As in minger - British slang for ugly? Oh dear.
How could you forget about Totally spies?! 😎🛍️
I can’t tell if they were supposed to tuck the straps of the velvet skirt into the rings like a belt buckle, or if it really is just made like THAT
The witch outfit is honestly goals
I literally was looking at her channel today and was like "i wonder when shes gonna post again" aND NOW SHE HAS UPLOAD YAY
please do the franken mug video
I'm sorry I'm sorry back up... That ✨what✨ trail??? It sounded like you were trying to say Oregon, but I heard Oregahn... Just me? Ok
OMG why does Saf’s house look identical to Jenna’s!!!
Pretty sure I wore the second outfit in high school 02-04 era. Honestly, I kind of want all of it to relive some high school dreams. Hella cute. While I obviously can't make the boots, I might put forth the effort to make my own 'witch' bell sleeved shirt for a bit less expensive (looking it up, it's 42 pounds).
I am LIVING or should I say DEAD when you got to your Goth look. It looked amazing and all the jokes as well.
The boots and the sleeves on the top for the goth outfit are especially epic.
i swear to all that is holy saf your guys' house looks like jenna and julien's. Especially when u were unboxing
I like to just go on the shopping tab and just look at all the stuff knowing that half of these do not ship to my country.
She even got matching masks that is dedication
I feel like the wig looks really cute honestly.  Maybe not as a "dye your hair pink RIGHT NOW" but like "I could see her wearing the wig randomly"
oh my god please come to williamsburg it’s gorgeous and so amazing to see how life was lived here back in colonial times 🥺💙
I think the term you were looking for is like soft girl
The second complete outfit and the pink jacket from third outfit are so good!
Okay so i know the wig wasn't really your style but i thought the pink was a cute and fun look on you!!
for the first outfit u could of  braided ur hair and then u would look like Laura Ingalls
Damn I've never even heard of this tab before and I basically LIVE on Instagram
So I guess everyone is here at 2 in the morning
Is she in Jenna marbles' house???? Am I crazy??? That's the same house right???
Wait...... is Safiya a Once?
I loved the pink wig 😍🤩 And the series Totally Spies is amazing lol 💖
If you put the skirt instead of the jeans in the last outfit, it would be a cohesive outfit
Hehe my closet is all Black, Dark Red And Neon Green
Her wallpaper tho
Clown laces 😂 I suppose if there are Clown shoes there's gotta be clown laces
God now i want bell sleeves..
Doesn't she looks like nikita in the last outfit
I would love to get safiyas take on how to deal with skirts as a bootyfull person, as it seems she has the same problem I do where it's cute in the front but if I bend over it's just a whole butt hanging out.
“Ready to CHURN the butter” *thrusts*
Everyone IT NOT SOAP VIDEO
So, I’m a Wiccan. Like, that’s my religion. When I see people calling themselves witches based on aesthetic, I’m not ever offended but like... it’s definitely cringe-worthy (in a way that makes me laugh uncomfortably), especially when they base “witchcraft” off of the goth aesthetic. I’m probably the farthest from goth you can get without being a prep, in the my immortal sense
Doesn't she  normally show the price tags on these hauls? What happened this time?
OMG I miss the intro 😍
This is safiya new intro songggggggg...
I made a post on Instagram about my shop tab - I just posted what I found as I got distracted before I got started essentially 😂😂😂 I tagged you safiya if your interested the few fashion items I have being suggested to me is ACTUALLY very specific to an exposed level
A lot of the clothing on that tab looks like it's being dropshipped from Ali express for many tens of dollars more than the original price. Facebook and instagram really need to vet their sponsored posts because there's a lot of wofun company scams.
With the pink and dark eyebrows with makeup under her eyes I am getting super MARINA (Marina and the Diamonds) vibes.
Jesus , PICK SOMERHING FROM KILLSTAR  I've been diying for a killstar theme video , you Tease 🤣
Saf should wear a sleeveless dress she would love!! Like if you wanna see her wear such a dress 😊
i actually love the pink hair on you
she looked like ninja with black mask on goth dress.
Tell me why i was like shes probably doing a shopping video right know and this came out on my Home page today >u<
We need to see yall destroy all those mugs and put them back together !! 🥰
who got corrine from threadbanger with that second outfit??
The pink wig is amazing!
I have those boots - they are gorgeous and comfy! 🖤🖤🖤🌙⭐️
did anyone else see saf's screensaver I'm dead
Safiya including clips of Jenna in her last two videos has me 🥺
You should dress like American girl dolls
That wig is what I wish I could pull off but look like the Instagram logo when I wear it
Saf's hair is so long and beautiful and she looks so pretty like a 1970s witch
Okay but she looked SO good in that pink outfit with her jacket hanging off her shoulders. Those colors are SO FLATTERING😍😍😍
I liked the witch outfit best. Its so Safiya.
It's... it's or ee gehn. Not or ee gone.... my biggest pet peeve. Oregon.
The last outfit is hot idgaf 🖤🖤🖤
also congratulations for 4.3k comments in less than an hour. i thought i was gonna get to have you see my comment cuz it’s been 45 minutes but nah lol
I love you Safiya, you make me laugh xD
lol Saf, it's also a ha-penny, or half penny, but I'll be calling it a hay penny from now on
I can't believe wish haul was 3 years ago..! Also am i the only one who wants a house tour?😅
i would love to see safiya and john mulaney having a conversation! it's like she speaks in cursive and he speaks in print.
Yeah! I just woke up and there is a new video of you! Perfect start in the day ❤
Your said Oregon wrong but it’s ok because I love your videos
ok but the egirl makeup really suited her features
OR-UH-GUN guys come ON 😂
I love seeing my favorite people show up in my recommended videos!
Hi Saf! I am so stressed I can’t sleep and I keep pulling my eyebrows out and i hope this helps me
She looks good in the pink one
I love this videos
Colonial Williamsburg is friggin awesome. I’ve been there and I got a lil chicken with a hat :)
I think the light pink of the jacket looks really good but I dont think she looks as good in the darker pink in the wig
Ok! The witchy outfit is so safiya. It's basically Safiya outfit ahe looks so good in it
The fact that the dirtiest jokes came from the most "vintage" outfit is so hilarious to me. There's gotta be some irony there that I'm not seeing.
Big Jenna Marbles vibes from the house
I thought I was the only one who found out about it late😓
Depressed and scrolling because nothing is helping and boom!! A new saf video! It's hard to be sad while watching saf! Lol
Seriously safiya and taylor, do the mugs video !!!!!
Omg the disney bathing suits 😍
Wait- WHEN TF DID SHE HAVE 9 MIL I REMEMBER WHEN SHE HAD LIKE 1 MIL😳😳
The amount of Twice posts in your suggestions has me *quaking* Also like this comment if you also got an American girl doll ad below this video 😂🤣
1 a pink wig  2 a thick ass 3 a him to give whiplash 17:43
You "seize" the memes of production, Tyler.
The wig is definitely a nice color but it looks more like a cosplay wig to me than a wig that you would use everyday mainly due to the parting being so close together. It is a lace-front wig though and it looks like it didn't tangle much; which is a major problem for wigs that go beyond the shoulder. And yeah... pink isn't Safiya's color.
Ngl safiya looks really good in all these outfits 😍
The jacket from three would be cute with the skirt from two
In India these page sell all street stuff in a decorative way and with trice the price.
I was waiting for her to mix the three outfits together into a frankenoutfit
Love this!!! Missed all your videos
The not an e girl look would of been better without the pink jacket! The wig is amazing!
@23:35 when she took off the bonnet she looked a lot like a woman who should be on a pirate ship. Does anyone else feel that way or is it just me?
Just finished an exam. This is the perfect breather. Thank you Safiya!
Ore-gon. NOT. ORE-GAN.
ALL THESE LOOKS🔥🔥🔥 Are BOMB on her
Your Third outfit is giving me we wear pink on Wednesday with a 2020 or 2012 pink hair color.
The goth outfit and E-girl makeup looked so good on you!!!
I think we need a video of saf trying TikTok trend outfits now.. like e-girl and vsco girl, might be a old idea, but still would be fun :)
the apron is supposed to cover the skirt, it protects it from soot, spills, and everyday wear.
Y’all’s living room looks a lot like Jenna and Julien’s
The amount of Twice posts in your suggestions has me *quaking* Also like this comment if you also got an American girl doll ad below this video 😂🤣
I want those moon boots
The “Oregon” Pronunciation 😅💀😭
The setting in the living room and the video give me Jenna Marbles vibes and I'm crying!
Love love love the center part 👍🏼 So happy to see you again.
This is the intro song I love❤️❤️❤️
You should do a collaboration with James Charles
all those kpop content though lol
its 12 o'clock at night, but im still watching!
Does anybody notice Saf’s background? Like whattt
Thank you for another fun video Safiya! ❤️
As soon as I saw that pink and black heart fabric, I wanted it as a jacket. A shame they don't have it on their site anymore!
Safiya in the pink wig + mask looks like she's a resident of Chromatica
Next video: I live at colonial Williamsburg for the rest of my life
0:39 Safiya is secretly a once👀
I almost fell out of bed getting so excited you posted 🤣
last time i was this early, saf was still in in buzzfeed
Safiyas nee house looks like Jenna and juliens
I like the three outfits but I feel you, I always struggle with the fit of mom/boyfriend jeans
so excited whenever you post!!! xx
The witch one was more like an e girl style, but without the e girl makeup obviously
bonnet off, you look like a swashbuckler
I loved this video (as per usual). Love y'all! This was a perfect start to the weekend 🙌 😍❤
I can't express all the joy I feel by watching this video <3
This video legit made me wanna go out and buy a wig 💃🏽
how many times have you heard “this is sponsored by honey” or “hOnEy SaVe YoU mOnEy”
You look amazing!
Yassss the Kpop fan cams hehehe
THAT PINK WIG LOOKS SO GOOD ON YOU SAF!
You looked so much like Marina from Marina and the Diamonds with that wig on imo!
Ok but Saf talking about Colonial Williamsburg is making me relive the experience where you get to dress in the colonial outfits and complete different tasks around the town. Did anyone else get to do that as a kid??
Ok did not know about the shop button... On my way to see what Mark thinks of me...😂
Ok but now I really want to see the pink cropped jacket over the black velvet skirt-overalls-situation with the white puffy blouse underneath.
Can we just take a moment and cherish the fact that Saf didn’t have any YouTuber drama break out this year. I can’t lose Saf after Jenna 😭
Omg you brought back the old theme song.
You're just the perfect YouTuber, I always look forward to your videos 🥺 I really like this
Please, make Frankenstein mugs! ❤️
fingers crossed for the franken mug video 😂
"will I like outfits that I picked out" is that what we're asking here
Hey babe! The picture was from "totally spies" which that and winx club were what I was obsessed with as a younger person.
God how rich she is🥴
💛😲
Just in case anyone is wondering the aesthetic that Sophia was thinking was e-girl would actually be more described as soft girl.
Am I the only one who loves the final outfit ?
THis is like the classic Saf content I love <3 I love all your content but this has the same vibes as a lot of my old favs
i love saf so much 😂❤️ her uploads give me life
Safiya I went to colonial Williamsburg as a kid to and it CHANGED me too
Comrade tyler
I've figured it out! Instagram thinks Safiya is a witch who escaped the Salem witch trials, cast an immortality spell on herself, and now spends her days on YouTube searching for other surviving members of her coven under the guise of doing makeup experiments in batwing sleeves. Nailed it!
This is kinda weird but their house reminds me a lot of Jenna’s lmao ig the layout looks similar?
I understand yall have a life buy I miss when you posted more
it would be sooooo interesting if they did this but with tyler instead
So sad the shoes seem to no longer be on the site, I love moons as well
Long haired Safiya looks like a baby Morticia. Like.. dead on. You just need the moonlight glow that hits only your eyes.
OMG YESSS SSFIYAA QUEEENNN IS BACKK
YES new video!!!!
Queen
Does anyone else want to know where Safiya got her facemasks from 🙋🏽‍♀️🙋🏽‍♀️?!?
Your goth mask reminds me of The Winter Soldier from the second Captain America movie.
In the middle of the night like a fiend 😚😚😚
Thank you Safiya and Tyler for your videos, and all the heart and effort you put into each and every moment of the videos, they always make me laugh and smile, even when I have a horrid migraine like I do now 🖤 Your style is a lot like mine, as is your innate goofiness, and sense of humor! The second outfit is by far my favorite 🖤 It is so cute! Ahhhh I LOVE IT 😍 I love your longer hair style you are rockin in this video! Thank you for being you, you are awesome!
I MISSED THIS INTRO SONG 😭
Omg safiya i have never been this early❤️❤️❤️❤️
The pink hair is actually so pretty, especially when safiya  walks in it
Another great episode, love the outfits. The goth outfit was my fav by far, and based off of the fit you could honestly just cut the straps off the skirt and it would still fit you really well. Otherwise it was a rockin outfit
I seen sailor Moon 😁💜
Plz post video weekly once  Can't wait for a month
i love thinking about the fact that in the b roll of going out and getting the shots Safiya is all dressed up and Tyler is just..... in a t-shirt and shorts lol
Omg I love the E girl fit!
I think Safia has vampire or bat vibes in her body.And that's why she fits perfectly to the dark or black dresses she wear.
Twice in Saf's explore page 😭🧡
Their house is very similar to jenna n juliens house. Just wanted to point that out. Lol.
I was also under the impression that e-girls are pastels and hearts but I'm also nearing 25 so I don't quite know teen fashion anymore lol
in the style of "dressing like bratz dolls" a cool video would be "dressing like american girl dolls"
safiya looks freaking amazing omg
No one talking about that "I love you bitch" Candle?       Okay then
You look so pretty safiya💗💗💗💗
can you do  Filipino vintage fashion just kidding
I want that Frankenmug video
Lol how does she know all of the America girl doll names on the spot lol 😂 love it ❤️
You look good in pink. But you are the witch look. I enjoy everything you get yourselves  Into. Hugs for you both.
i loooove the witch outfit on you. i’m obsessed with those shoes!
it is just me or is saf’s voice a LOT slower in this video than normal?
Can you choose size on the clothes? (you ar the best Safia)👸🏻🤩
Without the bonnet Safiya looks like Jane Russell in The Outlaw.
When Safiya finds the brands I buy from.... Rogue+Wolf, Dracula Clothing, Sourpuss, Dollskill, Black Craft and Killstar <3
I loved the suspender skirt!!! I don't think they look like a nipple tassel, at all! The skir the shoes and the black pantyhose looks so good on you!!! You should definitely repeated that combo! Maybe with a pair of small scissor you can remove the embroidery name, obviously with to much care trying not make a hole on the shirt! Lovely! Looks so good on you! 👏👌
Loved the video but I wanna know where she got the cute mask with flowers on it😂
I’m fully expecting that Safiya went back and bought that Maleficent swimsuit
I got it you’re a colonial woman who was ostracized for being a witch!
Why does her house look exactly like jenna marbles'?
The last look gave me Marina & The Diamonds vibes. Even with the last outfit looking slightly off, everything looks so good on you!
I feel like she got cheek fillers
I’M IN THIS VIDEO AT 14:13 W THE GREEN HAIR ON THE LEFT (@strawberryelf on tik tok and ig) THANK U SAFIYA FOR INCLUDING ME AAA I LOVE UR VIDEOS 🥺😭💗💗💗💗
As a person who wears wigs regularly, I can say that your wig actually looked pretty good. You trimmed the lace front very well and covered your bio hair nicely. All in all, a good wig.  Also, I'm dubbing the last look "Softfya"
I have just been on her youtube stories and just constantly checking to see when the video was done, anyone relate?! 🤣🤣
my instagram un updated itself i saw the update hated it then when i went back on it was gone
OHHH MY GOD,, I NEED THOSE MOON BOOTS RIGHT NOW
House tour ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️♒️
The pink wig looks SO good!
Pink looks good on you
This was posted at midnight for me xd
I love the masks! Especially the colonial and 'e-girl' ones. Can you link us to where you bought them?
Love your clothing vids 🤧 thank you for more of my fav content queen
Nah-uh... Safiya and pink wig... Nonononono. Infact Safiya and pink DOESN'T go well together.  My fav was the 'goth' one.
Love that you’re returning to some Instagram/fashion videos!
You're phone screen is so cute!!
why does she kinda look like Marina Diamandis with the pink wig
Wait do you follow Taylor R aka tautay_xx? I love her 💗 she's amazing
tbh the hearts and cutesy e-girls and the more emo/punk looking e-girls are both e-girls, just slightly different forms of the aesthetic
Paused the video just to say, that last outfit (the "e-girl" one, hehe), genuinely looks STUNNING on you. Especially with the wig. I mean, you always make the clothes look good, but somehow it actually really SUITS you! So beautiful! ^_^ <3  Edit: LMAO, right after I restarted the video after typing the above, you said that the very same outfit DIDN'T suit you. XDDDDDDDDD Well, I mean, from appearance alone, you make it look really good, like it suits. :)  Edit 2: Nooo, I'm glad you kept your eyebrows dark - it makes you look like some sort of original character from an animated series. It's seriously a cool look with the pink hair! (I think pink eyebrows would have been too much.)
Okay, that first colonial outfit, once you took the bonnet off, it was like you were the rogue woman. Like one that would’ve been accused of being a witch.  Not making light of the Salem witch trials but it’s very fitting for Saf.
11:36 ..what is your screensaver?
The StarKid reference was beautiful 👩‍🍳👌
Safiya, while we are not Colonial Williamsburg, my husband is one of the owners of  the Louisiana Renaissance Festival, and I do own two butter churns. Let me know if you want to visit.
Alright is the mug of the day on insta inspired by this video???
That's not e-girl, that's 2015 DIY youtuber that bumps up that saturation every two seconds.
Oh my gosh, the way you guys said “Oregon Trail” hurt me XD.
this just reminds me how much better the shop tab was before; the new one that they're testing now is horrible and gives me the worst suggestions
Lmao Safiya's wallpaper at 3:15 😆
Getting close to 10M 🙃
Why does Saf get cool stuff and I get trash
tuck the flappy flaps into the rings like vertical belts :)
but did honey work on any of these websites?
TWICE yasss saf, you're a keeper
I had no idea that there was a shop tab
Confirmed! Safiya is a twice fan! 0:42
I love how she knows the name of the American Girl Dolls off the top of her head.
Road to 10 million Saf!
I actually do like Honey and recommend it to fam (this is rare for people’s sponsors)
We just gonna ignore her slightly referencing "Firework" by Katy Perry?!! 😍😭
I cant believe that shes straight.
You know you have to try and churn your own butter now right???
All hail
Can you please comment/add to the description box where you got your flower mask from? I love it!!
me a witch: i want the witch shirt so bad!!!! also i want the boot those are so freaking cute!
Omg American Girl books were my childhood
As an Oregonian, I can safely say that the way Tyler and Safiya pronounced "Oregon" bothered me🤣
i will be patiently waiting for the franken-mug video now 😌
Tyler giggling at Safiya is just the cutest thing and I'm just happier knowing that they are together
I am HERE for this content
hahaha weird because I just got back from a trip to Colonial Williamsburg
all the instas from the third look are so “Clueless”—with just a dash of early 2000s sassy fire & fur polyester. impractical and uncomfortable, perhaps—but still loving it.
instagram offering goods to safiya like "I can be your angelic dad jeans or your hellgirl top"
Safiya with the pink hair and the make up is actually really really cute and I am 100% vibeing with it
THE SECOND OUTFIT IS SOOOOO GOOD!! I thought it kinda look less like pasties too but it was really cute like not really noticeable
See that saf took the video months earlier and just posted few hours ago, but the content is not outdated
My suggestions on IG are terrible lol, only expensive stuff or stuff I would not buy usually.
I loved the black top ❤️
The ‘E-girl outfit’ is more like a soft girl outfit! ;)
when i see that twice clip in her explore page 😲
i was about to go to bed but I couldn't not click on this video... Safiya, you are so entertaining, just your personality but meshed with how you edit your videos just makes it even better. You are so worth missing a bit of sleep over
Oof I forgot how much I love the intro song!
omg my favourite time of the week?month?day?
$27 not $57 lol...The witch outfit was my favorite! Wish they would look good on me ;_;
I do like that type jeans on you. That cut makes you look so curvy!
Hahaha, my explore tab has none of those things! Brb, checking the shop tab.
Pink wig thick ass give em whiplash
Who else misses safiya
😂😂 virginian here that lives about an hour from colonial Williamsburg and visits a few times a year  "i want to churn the butter" #dead
OreGONE🤭🤭🤭🤣
Finishes video and instantly googles Frankenstein mug.
THESE. BOOTS. OMG. 😭😭🖤🖤🖤🖤🌙
Thats more soft girl than egirl
GIRL WHAT IS YOUR SKIN CARE ROUTINE?!? YOUR SKIN IS GLOWING! ITS SO FRICKEN PRETTY
I get Nikita Dragun vibes on the last one
"Hello, fellow kids." Right there with you, Saf.
Out of context but I just had a bts ad where they were proposing(?) with galaxy earpods and no, I didn't skip the ad.  Btw, love ur vids Safiya💜
i feel like the third outfit would’ve been so cute without the pink jacket!!
The witch style hits different with the black mask 😎
Why do they say oregan like that
omg the intro song YES
“We think this girl is either a witch or a civil war re-enacter...” that killed me
At 19:00 when Safiya said "helllooo box" and Tyler replied "it's me" was that a Todd Rundgren reference or am I just obsessed with the song Hello, It's Me and Tyler was just comparing himself to the box contents?
The wig looks amazing for first try Ty. Let's be honest alot of us don't know how to so it makes you our leader . A saying in urdu goes :Andhon mai kana raja (it means a  one-eyed man is the king in a circle of blind people)
In the future maybe for the suspender skirt  you should put the rest of the strap,the part that was flapping around, in the ring that's on it so its mor secure
Okay I LOVE the witch outfit it looks so good on you!
Hahaha poor saf and her e-girl mix up. Gotta love it
Okay anyone know where to find the mask with the little flowers though? Like I liked it on Safiya, and then when we saw it on Tyler I was really sold
Great concept 👍
i think you look really good with pink hair  the last outfit was great i really like all three of them its nice to have a change in wardrobe every once in a while
I have that "Boss Witch" patch! I love it and have gotten multiple compliments on it!
Do you like bunching? 🤣😂🤣
I feel like the e-girl has a pastel subgenre, just like goth, so she's technically right lmao
I just wanna say that she looked like a badass in the pink wig, jacket and jeans from the back. Definitely made you look good. My favorite one had to be the witch look though just because I absolutely LOVED every piece on you. 🥰
I loved the witchy look and if the wig was just applied a little better (though for a first time j think it looked great) I think it would look amazing. Also, idk why but I want to see her in the velvet skirt with the pink jacket...
she probably wont wear any of the colorful stuff again after this and we all know it
6:06 I think Sierra Schultzzie did a video on this
LOVE THE JERSEY SHORE REFERENCES!  I absolutely love JERSEY Shore & still rewatch the original series as well as the new JERSEY Shore family vacation series ( plus Floribama shore bc its a spin-off of the classic that I loved as a teen/young adult).     BTW// Vinny, Pauly D, Snooki & Jwoww are my top favs from the original 8.
Omg this is AMAZING!!!!!!!
OMG saf in the witch outfit and the black mask!! She is SERVING 😍🤩
Is it just me or does this video seem a little too drawn out and forcefully longer? Idk
Safiya : ( In youtube stories ) this video will be 15 minutes or more.  Me : Ohhh Safiya : Posts her new video Me : Saf you said it is gonna be 15 minutes or more but I didn't think it will be 38 mInUtEs.  Safiya I saw your stories and congratulations you survived this video
Hehehehehehe I knew I should stay up tonight😌
am i absolutely losing it or is this jenna and julien’s house
I feel like replacing the strangely long laces with a black ribbon would look so good
we’re just churning we’re just churning
Ok shockingly, I opened the "shop" tab and the very top link is a subscription I am already subscribed to 😂
HOW IS YOUR SKIN SO GLASSY?
she NEEDS to die her hair pink in some way. LOVE IT!!!💕
Hi im finally i little early
Tyler that wig application is amazing, spectacular amazing job xxxxx
Can we get a house tour??
Your skin looks absolutely flawless!
I love all of em actually💖💖💖
I just want to say you Pronounce Oregon “Ore-gin no hate
the second outfit was grand.. except for the neckline on the top. Too high around the neck
Ok but I would like to see you make a Franken mug. But maybe don't destroy all ur mugs for it.
Memes of production was so good HAHAHA 😭😭
“Type situation”   ** alr war flashbacks***
Do a haul for crusty
I've missed you Saf!
I kinda really dig the E-girl makeup!! Also the witchy boots were hella cute 😍😍
My insta shop tab only has expensive home decor products cause I've been obsessed with urban outfitters home decor
Safiya, love, that tab has been there since forever
Safiya looks so good. Her makeup is on point damn 🔥🔥
After long time
Thank god these vids are back!!!!
Jenna's house?
The wig does look good on you, tho. The thickness of the waves, the lenght and the color just made you look really cool.
I think you should feature Crusty in some way in all your videos. 😽
You know how to make an Oregonian cringe, Ore-GAHN :,D making it sound like we a shape
My first American Doll was an original Josefina doll. Begged my mom for months.
House tour?! PLEASE!!! 🥺❤️
Saf! Come to VA! I live in the Richmond area (RVA), and Colonial Williamsburg is only about 45 minutes-1 hour away from there. It's awesome; you can eat in taverns where actors will come out and greet you (and entertain you with song and dance of colonial lore). P.S. Love your VA joke. #virginiaisindeedforlovers
LMAOOOO WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE CHAEYOUNG FANCAM AND LIKE KPOP STUFF ON HER EXPLORER PAGE😂😂
I also live in Virginia. I’m also obsessed with your videos
the long hair is giving me strong Mortica energy I love it
Tyler: “You can control the memes of production.”  Nobody, ABSOLUTELY NOBODY: *crickets*  Me: *dies laughing in the corner*
I wish she would have tried on the brown skirt with the white apron.
an hour early :d
the last outfit is like alternate universe safiya XD
i am lowkey loving Safiya's long, straight hair. Also, safiya should mix together every lotion and hand soap from bath and body works like if you agree
I loved this video ... watching it fr 3rd ...n well done ty fr the wig moment ❤️ you nailed it
Omg Saf!! That tank top looks amazing on you! The fit is hella amazing
Not gonna lie, the Colonial Williamsburg part made me so nostalgic.
ma'am that's not how Oregon is pronounced
We all been knew that Tyler's an army👀
I love the pink outfit, idk what you're talking about😂 i thought it was cute AF
i really enjoy the inclusion of masks, setting a good example :)
Didn't expect to hear someone reciting parts of Macbeth on YouTube today. I feel... attacked
girl i cannot stress enough how amazing you looked on the 2nd outfit !!!! use it daily !!! or give them to me :'(
THAT JACKET W A BLACK TANK TOP, BLACK CARGO PANTS AND COMBAT BOOTS WILL DO IT
Please do a haul from Townsends
okay but safiya?? is so?? pretty???
No one:  Me: omg Twice, Blackpink, Itzy!!  🤍👄🤍
I rly rlyy want Safiya to release a full song version for both of the intros. Mann I first time heard it from earphones and they got amazing beats!!
the fact that this was filmed in June ☠️
When you took the bonnet off you gave me very Ella Enchanted vibes and I was liviiingg for it
The first outfit is bomb. That #Prairiecore life.
That eerily looks like Jenna and Julien's house lol
Its like you actually own your personal FBI agent🤣  *Safiya, post something or literally use her phone  Her FBI agent : "WRITE THAT DOWN!, WRITE THAT DOWN!!, WRITE THAT DOWN!!!"
Can we appreciate Safiya actually being an “influencer” who’s a good influence
no matter the length of their vid.. its never boring to watch... . love u girl .
Was there a bee in your bonnet...
Im so annoyed that they moved the recent activity tab and replaced it with the shop tab in the most recent update
Does anyone know where saf got her white mask or where I could get something similar? It’s really cute but it isn’t linked anywhere 🥺
Those angelic jeans would probably look better as shorts. The second outfit is my fav though.
hey Saf,how you doing ? love n light from Balkan
Whoa, your channel uploads late at night. I like it.
I really love seeing someone with my body shape/size. Thank you
that was a soft girl look, they like pastels and pink as well as a ton of hearts
ITS ME ON THE LEFT AT 14:13 W GREEN HAIR THATS MY TIK TOK @strawberryelf AAAA  (my ig is same user) IM FANGIRLING SO HARD THANK U SAFIYA FOR INCLUDING ME 🥺💗
I feel like the jacket is a bit too much for the 00’s baby look.  The wig gets lost with the jacket. Also, I was so tripped up I really thought they were filming in Jenna marbles’ house
WHEN SHE TOOK HER HAIR OUT OF THE BONNET IN THE FIRST LOOK SHE LOOKED LIKE YOUNG LIV TAYLOR
Ok, but hands down this is the video with the best outfits.
Im so distracted by the Morticia Addams vibes of your outfit in the intro, I love it
If Morticia was a teenager in 2020 that’s exactly what she would rock
One thing that i noticed that she wears the perfect matching masks with  her outfits, it was amazing
Nobody:  Safiya: Having her own production of Macbeth
I really like the pinafore skirt! The straps could be improved on for sure though.   Unfortunately the powerpuff girls top looks like they grabbed a secondhand undershirt and slapped a graphic on top.  And I think the tiktok kids are meeting at the combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell these days.
Honestly I'd watch the mug video
Girl... not trying to be a creep, but your butt in those jeans looked FREAKING IMMACULATE!!!!!!
ur house is similar to jenna mables? am i crazy? lol
I love all 3. Saf looks awesome in everything! I would look like a potato in outfits like these.  #Thoticia
here after looking at your ig stories cheeeeck
Saf in a pink wig is giving me serious lavagirl vibes
I am watching this at 12.30
The Queen is back!
You should do tictok next
This is what I needed for my break  from doing a ton of school work😍
okay but safiya actually looks stunning in that wig
Love the outfit appropriate face masks 😷 👍
the witchy look with the black mask looked badass
All the pink and pastel clothing might be softgirl style instead of egirl? Idk man
It is not so serious but I looked at safiya's dms, lexime.fairuse.org/q4MoJp/k5IOfq.html I admit that I am sad, poor boyfriend I hope it changes
I SEE TWICE 👀
Been waiting for this
i’m just amazed that she NAILED every section
Tyler and Saf are goals ❤️😭😭😭😭
You make me fill like the coronavirus isn’t a thing
i live how safiya is a whole twice stan. lol
The wig looks great
i live like 45-60 mins away from colonial willamsburg😳
Safiyaaaaa. It’s pronounced “OR-ih-gun” not “or-ih-GONE” 😂
i absolutely hate everything on my instagram shopping tab and it is not all like the clothes i wear 🥴🥴 how you get yours to b like that ???
omg girl answer your messages!!!!!
Can I just say that she can definitely pull off some pink hair
I almost worked with the seamstress at Colonial Williamsburg, dang it
Lmao my husband and I are civil war reenactors, i love the dresses and style so much
Um do you live in Jenna Marble’s house Saf lmao
why did i think they were in jenna marbles house...
have you ever thought about having a vlog channel? I know I would be interested in watching them 🙃
Safiya, you can pull of anything wth I’m so impressed
They definitely scan us My shop recommendation is definitely my style
Safiya looks stunning these days! Aaah, her videos are like slipping into a comfy hoodie and snack food. 💛💛💛
i have a whole shop devoted page. it has replaced the heart :(((. and reels has replaced the explore page
The third makeup looks like Marina and the Diamonds in Primadonna
“They dooo! They really dooooo!!”
Outfit #1 I liked- it looked really cute on you but I would have loved to see you with a corseted edwardian look personally. I LOVED outfit #2 it was such a vibe and looked AMAZING on you!! Although, I agree the suspenders were awkwardly placed. For outfit #3 I feel like from the chest up was really frikin cute but I didn't like the pants at all. I personally thought the wig looked good on you and that Tyler did a good job applying it. I think the contrast with your eyebrows to the wig actually added to the look.
I’m from Minnesota and I was pumped to see a wolves jersey pop up
I didn't know I needed a pink wig until this moment...
The longer your hair gets the more you look like Morticia!!! 😍
saf’s flower mask is so pretty 😍
They're like,-“We think this girl is either a witch- or a civil war reenactor”  Oh my god, Tyler! 😂🤦🏻‍♀️
Amazing video
u should try to cut curtain bangs
30 seconds into the video..... OMG Saf and I have the same phone case 😍😍😍 *eeeep* xD
But the Thoticia outfit looked so good on her 🥺 My god just a vision of witchy beauty 🖤
Honestly watching Safiya on my lunch breaks (overnight shift) is the best thing, absolute blessing on my week
The background of her house looks like jenna's house
Loved this video! Your fashion social media deep dives are so fun to watch
Went from goth to inverse goth
0:39 hi there Chaeyoung
How do you have the same house as Jenna marbles
28 mins in hoping to see a franken version of outfit 1& 2
i always forget how beautiful she is
~Memes~of production ❤️
Definitely get the jeans turned into a skirt but I really enjoyed this video 🖤💗
Sofiya- NEW VIDEO EVERY OTHER WEEK  Me-DO U MEANS EVERY OTHER MONTH? sTiLl ,  lOvE uR vIdEoS 😃
The pink hair gives your highkey lava girl vibes
Is no one going to talk about her wallpaper on her phone it looks like a picture of her crying
I'd LOVE to see you explore colonial, Victorian, or even medieval fashions. I think you'd like all the sleeve stuff going on there. Bernadette Banner and Morgan Donner are both amazing and would be great people to give you some tips
I LOVE EVERY OUTFIT ON YOUUU
i think the third outfit is more soft girl than e-girl. but honestly, idk
My Instagram looks the same 🤣
Did anyone else see k-pop/ blackpink post on her explorpage let's Stan that 😂
Without the jacket saf you look so gooood
The Oregon trail game was the best, everyone died of dysentery
The fact that she knows the names of the American Girl dolls is amazing.
I loved the floral face mask! Does anyone know where I can buy it?
Yes safiya give us those vids
13:40 i think those are more likely soft girl
Im not first  Im not last But im 1 hour late 🥲
The jingle is back! Yaaaay
I feel like the channel is slowly adding more and more slightly dirty innuendos and I'm not mad about it 😂 Also the amount she apologizes for saying egirl as if she doesn't know that we all love her literally no matter what
No iam watching in the morning at 11 30 am because i am from Pakistan ❤️ love from Pakistan safiyaaa ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Why does she look good in everything I only have one style and I still look ugly.    Well I guess it’s just me
We went to DC and Williamsburg for our Honeymoon 15 years ago <3 It was great!
Safiya, can I just say I relate to being drawn to two different styles. I love the boho hippie witch style and also the educated dark academia style haha <3 love your videos!
Yay new video! 🤩
Wait... that wish video was 3 years ago?!? That's crazyyy
Safiya I have some connections at Colonial Williamsburg- worked with two head admins there to hold events when I worked at William & Mary. I can get you in with the butter churners for sure!
Where did you get the face mask in out #1?
Would love to see this but in small business form!!
we have found a wild safiya in her natural habitat, in the colonial Williamsburg outfit
Loved the video ❤️
I've been watching election coverage pretty much nonstop. This is a much needed distraction.
pfft who needs sleep when we have Saf! 😹
This video was awesome! I love seeing safiya’s quickly side 😍😚
Saf should do something like this but with sustainable brands
It’s nice to take a break from constantly refreshing the cnn election page.
Why would you not tuck the strap flaps through the hoops and under the skirt?
you should do a real e-girl makeover look video next
Omg I literally go to YouTube every hour to see if you post anything. thank for taking away my boredom ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Dad jeans and mom jeans need to be bigger
This video was so much fun to watch. I've missed you Saf and Tyler. Great to see you guys again. ❤
Maybe it’s just me and my lack of wig knowledge and not really being able to wear one but I think it looked good on you saf 👉🏻👈🏻 especially in many shots it looked like it was well placed
i love all the twice and kpop i saw on the explore page lmao
OMG the Macbeth part triggered me after having to study it for the last 9 months for school
And pink hair looks great on you💯💯💯💯💯
The pink wig would look incredible paired with any of Saf's vampire/winged/gothish/witchy clothing  Also the lil clip from Jenna's video made me 🥺
safiya !!! if you like the design of the tank top its originally from Omighty, the quality of their stuff is supper good!!!! https://o-mighty.com/products/211/all/11627
Hey guys this is an educational video about maternal health during pregnancy. I hope some of you watch it. https://youtu.be/Tp74inHpAoE
Am I the only one who noticed her home page background at 3:16?
Wow
Ok but why do I like every single outfit on you. The pink hair looks good on you. But I still love our comfy vampire :)
Yay within an hour!
Definitely want to steal the witch outfit
that prarie dress look suited you so well
As someone who had (has) one of the historical American Girl dolls, I appreciate the reference.  And y'know with the hair down you totally gave off Josefina vibes.
Your neighbors are delightfully entertained.😁
you could threadthe strapsof the suspenders through the silver hoops to get rid of the flaps.
"There's some unwanted flappage" LMAO
Love that subtle reference to starkid’s the Orogen trail
Insta-shop will be the best Wish. Calling it now
You can't wear pink jacket with pink hair
I am literally going through the shop tab now lmaoo
why do you have Rosanna Pansino's Kitchen and Jenna Marbles' Living room?
Yt home suggestions  are faster then my notifications 😂
Okay, before certain people get to work. She look BEAUTIFUL in everything.
Honestly convinced that Safiya, Stephanie Soo, Jenna Marbles and Rosanna Pansino are neighbors. All of their house are super similar
Gee thanks, Safiya. Now I'm obsessed with Minga London. I don't have the money for this! But I'm still appreciative because I'm gonna buy one of everything once I have money lmaoooo. Also I was obsessed with the witch outfit, I hope you keep it!
I took way too many screenshots of shops/items she showed for only .5 seconds
Honestly I love the pink wig on her, it’s gorgeous
I feel like safiya would wear that pink jacket often😗
I also love Colonial Williamsburg and went when I was 9
I'm gonna be honest, these videos are my favorite part of each month :)
So excited for a new video! This type is one of my favorites 💖
Ah yes. This video will sustain my Colonial Williamsburg cravings just fine.
I respect the hardwork you guys have put in!!! Love from India 🇮🇳
1st look gives me SUCH cottagecore vibes. supa cute. 2nd look is my fave just for the skirt suspenders, i'm a little bothered that the blacks aren't the same tho, between the shirt and the skirt. love the velvet! 3rd look reminds me so much of grade school, walking home in 2008 while eating hubba bubba tape, i think the only thing off was the color of the jeans but i LOVE the backside. amazing picks saf and ty!
You should do a video where you buy things that tiktokers  got sponsored by
Hi Saf!!
Hey, it’s you!
alexa play e-girls are ruining my life! by corpse
PLEASE DON'T BREAK THE MUGS they are too awesome to be destroyed, even for a (probably great) video
32:22 i died
Nobody: SAF: RANNNNNNN
31:05 maybe if u took off the jacket and had a shorter wig it would look better
Love the pink wig on you Safiya!
I need those boots
am i the only one who feels this video could have been shorter? like waaaayyyy shorter
The pink outfit looked like if Stephanie from lazy town was on tik tok
I think the last look was recommended because of Kpop tbh
Do you like K-POP ? If yes which is your fav Band????
Last time I was this early Safiya was only known as that girl that left BuzzFeed
You're love!! You look so pretty altogether in all the 3 looks💯🔥
Who she hasn’t used that intro song in a long time
those boots are amazing and I wish I had them the pink jacket was super cute too but not with the whole outfit XD
I’m so disappointed she didn’t get the hell girl thing 💀💀
The way her explore page is just filled with black pink and twice content 😎
So we just aren't going to acknowledge the full jedi garb being advertised to you? 😂
I want that velvet skirt so bad 😍
here before 1 million views. I am so amazed with myself
I have been engaged for a year now and have posted a handful of wedding content and I went to my Instagram shop and IT'S ALL BABY STUFF (and a handful of accounts I already follow but that is like maybe 10%)!!! Like dang let me getting married first 🙀🙀🙈🙈
Saf’s waist is lookin tiny, and all around (so far- on the “witch outfit”) everything’s looking quite flattering
Wig looks awesome
Someone here is almost about to get that diamond play button😊
Will you be doing this again with different outfits? Because I would love that! 🤗
the all black outfit with the pink wig would be FIRE
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Always so excited when Safiya posts a video. :) She never disappoints.
actually thinking about buying one of the pinafore sets from that reenactor site now oops... it's just so cute...
Is there a reason why you never promoted Escape the Night on your YouTube platform?
The first outfit is very Marilla Cuthbert
Safiya is lowkey ONCEBLINK !!!!!! WE LOVE IT!!! TWICE,BP, and SAFIYA WORLD DOMINATION
Yayy I love these kinda videos from you and tyler!!!
The next video: “ Mixing all of my mugs together”
I thought the last look was amazing.  And that wig looked really nice.
Why does the girl in the blackmilkclothing ad at 4:30 look so pissed? Kinda seems like she's warning you off the clothes, like an insecure bitchy girlfriend looks at you when you get too close to her man
You can't print in cotton, that's why, the Powerpuff girls top, is in that type of "plastic" fabric
Did anyone else notice that her living room  looks exactly like Jenna Marbles? ? ?
I have work to do but Safiya posted soo.. you know
This is awesome!! You should do a video where you dress like a different BTS member every day for a week!
Anyone else see all the sneak peaks on instagram! I have been rewatching her videos waiting for a new one xoxo
Tyler’s “control the memes of production” joke brought me so much joy
I would’ve tucked the nipple suspenders into the useless hoops like a belt buckle. Don’t know if that would’ve helped though
Who else wants to see a house tour in the future?!?!?!
“Sabbath night fever” cracked me up
Churning butter song had me laughing hard 😂 🤣 😆
k but like as much as i love safiya's usual bat look, she legit rocks that trendy pink look. Like. She looks good in everything? She looks good in bright pink wavy hair??? I cant???
legit safiya pulled off that pastel look
You look so good 🤩
Frame the tank top
thank you for this egg in a trying time
Can you actually do the Franklin mug though kinda wanna see what it would look like
Why don’t you put ads in your videos? I mean I’m not complaining though 😆
Safiya feelin herself in the first outfit was exactly what I need in these dark times. So precious
House tourr!!!!  anything u post i loved it tho
idk if it’s just me but safiya looks kinda different...still gorgeous just different,, maybe it’s her hair idk 🤔🤪
The historic look is actually pretty cute without the bonnet!
YEEES YEEESS YEEEES 🥳🥳🥳
I'm 11 mins in and I stan the Tyler Screensaver LOL 11:35
try something related to india... hit like if u also want
safiya looks so cute in the "e-girl" outfit lmao it's funny how much she thought it didn't look good but she killed it
Just getting to the unboxing and I must say that background is beautiful, I love your home
Oh HAHAHA this was just posted? ow
The Morticia vibes are too much for me.
missed you saff❣️
Is it just me or watching syd just made me so happy lmao wanna watch them collab🙋‍♀️
“are these $30 or $57 ? because either way i’m considering them” *tyler wheeze*  😂😂
It’s the overall skirt nipple part for me .
You BOTH crack me up. 😷
ok but i would love to see saf in a real e-girl inspired outfit 😭
Can’t believe Tyler has hit the dad jokes phase 🤣
the "egirl" outfit really gives me gabbie hanna broken girls vibes
this was so fun to watch :D
R u neighbors with Jenna because that house set up is almost identical.
I’m expecting a “every mug in our house” mug of the day soon.
I think you looked good in all of the outfits
MY FRESH CREAM BRINGS ALL THE BOYS TO THE YARD 💀💀
The  last outfit, I don’t know if it’s the 1980’s or 2020
Hi I’m hungry
It's pronounced OR-GEN, not OR-E-GONE. My little Oregonian self just shuttered.
Love the WITCH!
am I watching this instead of going to sleep?      ....yes. I have no regrets
I’m living for color on saf😍 but outfit number 2 is my favvvv
i love how the pink wig gives safiya a "stephanie from lazytown" vibe
Ok but where can I get that last mask ! I love the tyedye galaxy looking mask
ITS BACK ITS BACK THE INTRO IS BACK
the powerpuff girls tank was definitely from aliexpress lol
the outfit (which I know is a little later than this period) and the mention of colonial williamsburg had me thinking if safiya was a schuyler sister, she'd be angelica thank u for listening
kinda earlyy hehe
I'm in love with the witch outfit!
I can tell they’ve never been to Oregon. Just a hunch.
Why is that second outfit EVERYTHING
I adore outfit two
The link doesn’t work?!? Am I the only one having problems with it?!?
I was so excited when she pointed out that that one outfit was a Josefina type look!
I love her in the second outfit 😍
Its been a while
Maybe without the jacket the third outfit would’ve looked more cohesive?
I kinda need the links for the black outfit..
Smashed the like button already, still half way through the video! 😎
I feel you so much this video. From the creepy tracking of our every move, but being.... pretty ok cause they.... aren’t wrong and book marking something..... lol to all the puns. So great to see you excited and seemingly happier again. Between this and Instagram, I’m hoping that’s the case. Love you guys so much. :)
Omg you're following historical fashion stuff, including American Duchess? I love when unrelated interests of mine (in this case, Safiya and historical fashion) come together like this!
Where's Krusty?
For long laces, after tying your bow, use the loops and tie another bow not an overhand knot
I love the witch outfit on you!!! You look amazing!!!
The second outfit looks so good on you!!!! <3 :)
I LOVE THOSE BOOTS!!!!! (The ones from the second outfit with the moons and stars on them) Can I have the link please?
Your house looks just like Jenna and Julians house! Are you like in their neighborhood?!?
okay but did you guys see Tyler in the embroidered mask? that was a good look
Wow I just fell down a deep dive for your channel and right when I was about to turn in for the night, you upload a new video. I am primed and ready to go
It gives me just pure joy, just seeing her! ❤️❤️
your house looks SO similar to Jenna and Juliens house. i hope y’all are neighbors lol
Duuuuude she killled the gothy witch inspired outfit like she looks so freaking gorgeous 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤👻👻👻
I LOVE THE PINK HAIR!!! LOOKS SO GOOD BABE!😍 Black outfit was the BEST...imo.✌
Okay, hear me out... The pink wig with the 'witch' outfit.  Pastel goth vibes.
The witch outfit was amazing!!
Your videos make me HAPEI ❤️😆
she looks so good with her hair this length- I feel so special to share a birthday with her lol
The wig looks so good on you! I just don't think it went with the pink jacket right under it. The pink wig with a black shirt though would be bomb! I also wish I could have seen the third outfit without the wig on just to see the black on pink.
JYSGUYGFYUWEJG LOVE YOUUU
Thx for attempting to do things I will never do :)
I think you killed the pink wig. It looked absolutely stunning. Startling at first to see SO MUCH pink, but it really looked good.
Anybody else look up the shops cuz they saw something they liked and then cried cuz they dont make it in plus size... just me?
I don't know if collabs are a thing anymore, but you should SOOOOOO look up Abby Cox, if you haven't already! She worked for Colonial Williamsburg (I believe) and works for American Duchess, and her YouTube channel is GLORIOUS.  I follow a bunch of straight-up goth channels AND a bunch of historical clothing channels, and MAN did I see a lot of things I recognize!
I actually really love Rogue + Wolf, they have really awesome 3D printed rings.
Me: About to go to bed *sees notifications* _Sleep was never an option_
i love the daisy mask! where did you get it?
The queen is back!
Anyone else see Safiya's lock screen? It's literally the cutest thing ever 11:36
"Unwanted flappage"
Safiyas videos are just like mini episodics I eagerl my wait for every day.
i don't know why i bothered to check my own shop tab; it's all anime and cosplay lmao
Saf went "I got three looks and that's it"
i live in japan so this is perfect timing !!! love your vids.
Please more videos of you being you!!! I love hearing everything you say! I see and hear the theater kid! My historic dress heart is desperately wanting a colonial Williamsburg series
Love your beidge n pastel galaxy face masks, the moon boots n that pink wig! I think the boots will look great with silver or glittery white laces. ♡♡♡
You look pretty
Gosh, how I missed ya'll 😂😂
Thank you friend, for posting! Really enjoyed it. The first two outfits were bomb dot com.
Safiye while going through the disney inspired bikini making page- Oh they do!! They really do!! My mind- Scooby Dooby do!!
The fact that she follows American Duchess on insta is the greatest thing.
I was about to put my phone away and go to bed and got this notification and like NOPE we are up for a other 38 minutes to watch this!!  . . PS I totally love all 3 outfits on (first one without the bonnet) and I feel that the last one is actually really cute one you and totally works (more of a soft girl then e girl but I see how you got those vibes). LOVE LOVE LOVE 💕
I didn't realize how much I missed Safiya's try on videos!
IM STILL EARLY OKAY! only 58 min ago.....
Completely off topic...  but I swear Safiya and Jenna Marbles have the same house
you should watch -- The Social Dilemma -- on Netflix
I like your wig I have that cind of real hair
I was just rewatching Safiya’s older videos and was thinking i miss her intro
Saf is giving a modern Morticia Adams look and is rocking it.
Anyone noticed that Safiya's house look A LOT like  Jenna Marbles's house? I was like "wait... this looks familiar "  🥺
Yay great video!
Safia's "E-girl" look was actually more of a soft girl look.
I live for your content💜
The second outfit is so frocking cute
wow 57 mins and 3,578 commentd
Think the witch outfit looks amazing and does so much for her
*SHMASH SHMASH SHMASH SHMASH*
Is anyone rethinking their style chocies? I am...
a video of *"i try to buy a lolita outfit off the internet"!!!!!*
The colonial and witch outfits suit you so well! The 3rd one is questionable but interesting. I'm so glad to see so much kpop in your explore page. Twice is showing up so much😍😂 Looking forward to your next video! Love you Saf💕
lots of times the zipper of these skirts are actually in the front. it is sometimes annoying because when they break you just feel fat. xD
Safiya somehow managed to rock every outfit ... I specially loved the trendy witch with the black mask on!! u were ready to roll a halloween party Saf!!
Safiya can you do a collab with Melissa Hunter?  You have the mega Morticia Addams vibes and she got famous for her Adult Wednesday Addams show that she's not allowed to do any more.
Safiya is very on brand with Unus Annus
This brings me so much joy.
Safiya is the person maths books talked about in their problems
I quite frankly think you rocked the pink wig. I think it was jarring because of your tendancy for darker colours. I think what made the last outfit flop was the jeans, because shots of you from the waist up were fantastic and you looked great, but the jeans....
I love watching any video you make where you buy and make cool outfits. They're so interesting! I actually thought your pink look worked well! The only thing is that the angel on the pocket fought for attention with the absolutely adorable power puff girl tank. But the light wash of the jeans worked.
When u took off the bonnet i feel like for a second i saw the Emily Dickinson played by Hailee Steinfeld.
Safiya: *calls herself a e-girl in the last outfit* Actual e-girls: 👁👄👁 am i a joke to you?
I have never been this fast
Black dress suit you most.......
yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaas
Omg the goth look on her?! I can’t it’s perfect 😁
The pastel aesthetic  that often features Care Bears and hearts evolved out of a Japanese street fashion called fairy kei
28:30 ha Macbeth
why not tuck the buckle flap things down inside rings ? that outfit was my favorite by FAAAR. i need all of it lmfao
TYLER!!!!!!!   You slayed that wig boy! Good job 👍🏾 😂😂
sorry if this is random but did anyone else think their living room looked similar to jenna and julien's living room at some angles? i love it
Why is the background look like jennja marbles house?
People: getting a heart from safiya   Me: aw I want that
No one: Not even Crusty: Youtube: **recommends this video an hour after it's been posted**
I’m early
Safiya, amazing video as always, but girl...you and Ty gotta learn how to say Oregon (as do most people from other states) 😂😂 It's Or-ih-gun, not Orygone 😂--Sincerely, an Oregonian
the fact that tyler noticed the skull on the girl's chain shows that he really only has eyes for Safiya LMFAO
This is how vsco girls are made
The pink wig looks so good! It dose wonders with your skin tone and it's so fun!
OMG safiya I love your videos..i was waiting for a new video n this made my day 😄
Can I just say that I love how much Safiya laughed? It just honestly made me smile and I'm so happy to see how she seems to be really enjoying herself this video. 🥰🥰🥰
I am not used to videos I watch at midnight to be recently posted, but then again, it is Safiya
I love the cat, n that holographic jacket! Very cool!
Twice and Blackpink on your explore page >>>>>
Wow I never new how much I missed Safiya’s new intro song!   I replayed it like 5 times 😁
Her hair is so long and pretty. That’s all I wanted to say.😂
The intro song is bbbaackk!! 😄
I love watching you get to try out all these different styles! You are gorgeous in everything.
Why are all these so cute?? I actually, love the "E-girl" look. Lol
26:30 would look amazing with velvet shoe strings
Dude I'd never be able to share my explore tab 😂 the amount of fandom would reveal too much. Absolutely loved this video! Your videos are always so fun to watch, and yours and Tyler's humor and back and forth is great
Are we just gonna ignore that for a split second we saw safiya's background for her phone was a very odd selfie?? Haha
Safiya uploaded we've been summoned
wig and brows look DOPE! Glad to see a new video from you :) also kind of a shame gathering of goods is anti-feminist
The way they said Oregon hurt me soul...
This made my day!! Jersey shore was an iconic show and I loved how you said “ aren’t we all inspired by Sammi sweetheart”! I wish she would come back to the show already!! We can kick Ron out!! 🤣🤣
Hi favorite YouTuber!
Early
I love HONEY...
I'm sooo excited!! 2 videos in a row in under a month 😍😍😍 I wait for this sooooo much
Why did I think that the woman at 8:13 was Toby Maguire 💀💀
Yay!!!! I’ve never been early to one of her videos!!!!
Every time I watch a video like this all I want to do is spend more money online omg
I kinda wish you guys had a podcast, i miss hearing about you between videos 😅 (i know adding more workload probs isnt what you need, but itd be awesome is what im saying)
someone please tell what her shoes are in the “e-girl”/pink wig outfit!
The pastels would better suit "soft girls." Yes it’s a thing lmaooo 🤣
We want more crusty content!!!
YOUR HAIR’S SO LONGGGGG
Not one hour late
The pink, baby blue,  heart, nostalgia, feathers and sequins fashion is sometimes referred to as 'y2k' it's not technically E girl but sometimes they overlap
Lol tuck the n/pple flaps into the n/pple rings and they might be more hidden by the waist band. 👍🖤
We are one safiya .😂
Woohoo your back!!!
imsomnia isnt a bad thing when you find good company. Rocking the masks .After you moved how is your organization. I still return to your practically perfect videos when I need cheering up. Your style is perfect for halloween, but how do you decorate for christmas. please post more videos, I love you guys.
thank god we got some new Safiya!!!!
Im in virginia. Meet up??? Virgina is for lovers!
you probably could have tucked the extra suspender length into the actual metal loop and maybe it would look better i’m not sure
plz post moreee
Nobody: Safiya’s explore page : TWICE!!
Good job Tyler. 👍
I still don’t get the Goth-Milk thing 🤦🏻‍♀️
Love your videos!!!🙌🙌🙌🙌
Aw the fake Fiorucci denim jeans. Fast fashion is always so quick with it 🤣☠
why am I kinda down for that mug video..........
I lovvvvveeee the wig on you it looks so pretty 💖💖💖
omg all the twice content........ we love to see it
0:38 You were not listening to saf because you were watching the dance 😁😁
I also had to ask my younger roommates to explain e-girls and the current trend names. I'm an old emo lol or "diet goth" as you say. You were never more relatable!🤣🤣🤣🤣
Me, an Oregonian, when I heard how they pronounce Oregon: 🤭🤭🤭🤭
My face when I see itcy and twice on her Instagram 😮
I could watch Safiya do literally anything <3
Actually if you take fit num 2 with make up and wig from fit num 3, you get e-girl. Is this comment trying to get you to transform into an e-girl with Cristine? I don't know, y'all tell me.
The powerpuff girls teenagers image is actually from an episode in a later season where they did a clip show. one of the clips was a flash forward to them acting like typical 2000s teen girls shopping at the mall
No one's going to talk about , how beautiful Safiya's phone wallpaper is ?
37:21 if you guys ever decide to have kids, Tyler's dad's jokes are ready lol
I really lovvvvved the "witch" outfit on you!😍😚😘
please do the mug thing
I MISSED YOU!!!
Welp gotta say its 2am in safiya’s place and in our place its 2pm and also thanks for the good quality video again safiya🖤
I'm so sorry! I almost skipped your promo because I thought it was an old video before I realized this is a New video. Yay!
The number one way to get Safiya to like something is to just slap the prower puff girls on it... apparently...
Saf’s videos just keep getting better 💜
You should partner with Karolina Zebrowska for a vintage dressing video.
I really miss this intro song
I'm here for Tyler's "Memes of production" dad jokes!
I love that Saf’s phone screen is a goofy photo of Tyler 🤣
I feel like the “egirl” outfit is more a soft girl outfit
I'm so happy to see this! Ive been following your progress in your instagram stories, and now that i see how much time and work you put into these, its even more awesome!
American Girl was mentioned. My night is the best now
the fact that she got matching masks 🥰
Dude Safiyas skin. It's fucking magic
I feel like the last outfit gives of cotton candy vibes
Saf at the Princesses: They do! Saf at the Villain: THEY REALLY DO!
you looked really pretty in the witchy outfit
The pink hair is sooo gorgeous on you
This is amzing! ^w^
Ugh, she looks so incredibly beautiful in everything
Hiii
I went to look for toofastclothing for those Spider web Hellz Bellz and it didn’t exist :(
FINALLY YAY OMFG
Safiya looks SOO good with pink hair
The pink hair looks incredible on you ❤️
It is not so serious but I looked at safiya's dms, lexime.fairuse.org/q4MoJp/k5IOfq.html I admit that I am sad, poor boyfriend I hope it changes
👋👋👋
when the world is not on fire, please come do a panel at william and mary!!!! i’m sure everyone would love to take you around colonial williamsburg and churn some butter ;-)
Made my day AHHHHHH love youuuu. Its like a day before my exams but thank youuu❤️
She Back👀
The wig/third outfit is giving me such strong Marina vibes for some reason
Safiya's house looks like Jenna Marbles house, whoa.
I love when Safiya posts
/
Dude those night sky shoes spoke to me.
On the off chance that Safiya actually reads this comment I just want to say that I have been watching your videos for years and I love how much you have stayed true to yourself. No matter how down I am feeling, your videos never fail to make me laugh. I hope you guys are doing well❤️
The pink hair gives me Lava Girl vibes
I thought I was dreaming when I saw the notification 🔔 for this video
HAhaha, love it
Ok, at 10:57 there's an image of Theresa Fractale, and I really think everyone should know about her.  She's amazing.  That picture?  That's her - all the time.  and she's on instagram, please go look her up.
I’m obsessed with the pink wig! More Safiya in wigs please!!💖
The wig was a little much by I liked everything else about the last outfit. But it def wasn’t your style.
I’m obsessed with the pink wig!! I think it looks amazing on you!!
PSA to the world: It's Oregon, not Oregone. 'Gon' like 'gonna'
Congrats on 9.07million subs
I mean id like to see you research and do an Egirl fashion look, to me Egirl is a combination of pastel and grunge aspects, like a lot of denim and fishnets and crazy hair colors but with a touch of soft lovable and feminine Eboy on the other hand is more a mox of punk prep and a bit of emo, combined with the same soft vibes You and tyler could do an Ecouple video
next time if she loses her too long, you can wrap them around your ankle one or two times to eat up some of the extra length!
Safiya PLEASE tell me where you got the shirt you are wearing in between the try ons I absolutely adore it!!!! Love the video😊
I really like that wig! It’s such a pretty color!
Saf dont worry, the e girl makeup fits the soft girl aesthetic
Saf: instagram thinks I'm a witch and a pioneer woman, and they are right Me: is this a thing cause me too
i wish i can wear those :----(
30:04 did anyone else notice that that is Jenna Marbles house or old house like the same exact background
Started at 12:58am let's see how far I get before i pass out
how does she know all the American girl dolls by name 💀
Yay kinda early for once 🥰🥰🥰 love your content soo much Safiya!!!!
dude I need those moon shoes 🥺
I love that you uploading gets me so damn excited 😂
SAFIYAAA YOUR EGIRL MAKEUP IS SO PRETTY
I’d love to see that pink wig with the goth outfit 😍
wear 👏 the 👏 pink 👏 wig 👏 with 👏 the 👏 black 👏 outfit 👏
Honestly, the pink outfit did fit with itself.
I love this channel so much.
No one:  Tyler: “They will control the -memes- of production”  😂😂
My explore page literally looks the same as yours😂☺️✌
Am I early!! Love your videos
You look good in everything Safiya. Even the strangest of the looks(in general)I think you will look good even in a potato sack. I'm so j😯
I like the look of that black goth skirt, I'd love to have something like that if I actually have money.  Edit: oh wait, I forgot that suspenders part, I'm not liking that part
My favorite quote: “Mark Zuckerburg is trying to kill me... *nods* MARK ZUCKERBURG IS TRYING TO KILL ME” 😂😂😂
Hi I am from India so it morning rn
safiya: i feel ready to churn some butter   me: ... um
I've never paid attention to that tab. Let me check it
Safiya i think we're gonna need to see you in the pink wig and all black outfit
Around 32:06 for just a general timestamp This look oddly reminds me of the teenage daughter off of American Housewife where she tries to match the trendy brands the town sets .  Also- good for you for correcting yourself about the egirl mistake but keeping the footage 👌
yo! Ever since saf made that kpop makeover video and had to search up kpop things for the video, her instagram is now recommending her those kpop videos and to be honest..I ain’t mad and is kpop fans shouldn’t be as well.   BE PROUD OF SAF AND TAKE CARE OF HER WHEN SHE SWIMS INTO THE FANDOMS. MAKE SURE SHE DOESNT REACH ANY TOXICITY
they way he said NEVERMIND 🤣
ME: Don't put those new shoes on the table it's bad luck Sofiya: Plops shoes on counter
She knows none of her followers sleep gotta stay on brand we are night owls lmao
Totally Spies! Love it, Canadian kid tv at its finest
honestly an ABSOLUTE shoutout to saf for always being on top of crediting ppl in her vids. she showed us all these small accounts instead of just their photos so we can go follow them too and i really appreciate that
The all black outfit looked soo amazing on you.
That’s crazy you love Colonial Williamsburg! That was my field trip in elementary school, and I live like an hour from it!
I’m so happy you posted!! I was so excited!! Every look was perfect on you! And on the last outfit your makeup was so cute!! 😁😁❤️❤️
OKAY BUT CAN WE TALK ABLU TWICE IN 0:39 uwu Nayeon and Chaeyoung!
Also I was watching this with my dad and he was so into it,he liked your outfits 😂
Got here at 47 minutes and there are already 3.2k comments
oh gosh nothing quite like some safiya for a friday night in !!
I had no idea about the shop tab lol. Mine is full of nail polish brands. Btw I do love the pink hair on you.
Wait... I thought the history AG dolls were a new thing... How does she know so much about dolls
I know the last look is so not your style but you look so damn cute I love it haha
The final outfit is definitely cohesive and actually my favorite of the three lol
My favourite thing about Safiya posting this video, is that she posted it at like 12am EST and litterally as I was about to put my phone down to go to bed, I saw she posted and was like “I must watch this 40min video now! It cannot wait! She has posted!”
I want a shirt that says it’s a haypenny a glass buddy
AHHHH
I feel like the not an e-girl look is actually a y2k baby look
You can tell that Safiya has taste
Hmmm ah yes the forbidden amazon
I love that you thought it was e-girl cuz same 😂
0:38 seyoung-ah! Lmao Edit: and nayeon too Edit 2: safiya's insta is full of twice lmao
Jenna's house looks different here
I loved the wig on you safiya
Gothic fanny pack tho
Oh my goodness, please please PLEASE do a franken-mug video. That would be amazing!!!
Nobody: Literally nobody: Safiya: Smells a flower with a mask on
Oh my gods i would SO wear that witch outfit. Ugh. I love it so much.  I think the last outfit would have looked better without the wig. The contrast of the pastels and your black hair would be better than SO much pastel pink
I've missed these guys. Saf and Tyler are the best.
Just when I thought I was going to bed 🛌 lol. Another great video
I never watch long videos. Safiya is the only exception.
Im here so early!!!!
If you like that, you should try a bunad!
I kid you not I was a favorite student to my gym teacher and when I was in elementary school my nickname that he gave me was Sami sweetheart 😳🥺
I feel like the reason I love these videos is the theatrics. Safiya is such a theater kid and I adore her! I only hope to be as fun and funky as she is when I’m older. You’re an inspiration, my dear!
Ok please don’t dye your hair pink, it is not your color
i wish the shopping tag still looked like this :( it’s so cool and i love seeing put together outfits
Thank you for always staying the same and making me happy when im sad and your hella funny and so cool
Outfit one w/ bonnet: house on the prairie/ Little women   Outfit 1: W/O bonnet: Cottagecore
I love that she went with a re-enacting style look because I live historical fashion! She follows American Duchess and that’s taste💖 I also love the witchy goth look!🖤
The 3rd outfit it’s The grown up version of Stephanie from lazytown
Oh wow Saf looked really good i n that witch outfit! I didnt know that there was a shop button on explore page, its kinda fun
I love the masks so much haha!
I really like the pink hair on Saf!!!
Hi Safiya! I’m a big fan of you and Harry Potter so maybe could you try do a Harry Potter themed video? Just an idea 💡
all of the outfits sparked joy for me
Yesss historical fashion :D
SHE POSTED SHE POSTED SHE POSTED  SHEEEEE POSTEDDD
COMES TO WILLIAMSBURG!!! THE WILLIAM AND MARY STUDENTS WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU!! I have a friend who works there!!! And I see the colonial employees in target and that KILLS me 😂😂😂
The first oufit is the most ugly thing
IS SAFIYA A TWICE FAN? I see twice everywhere on her explore page 😂
I love this long hair 🥰
The Powerpuff girls shirt looks like a little girls undershirt you get from the swapmeet tbh
The surprise pop up Bernadette banner shoe made me smile
*cries in Oregonian over how they say Oregon*
the pastel things and childlike items very much give me age regression/age play vibes, hope this helps (also before anyone comes at me, age regression is sfw, and while ddlg is not, its no one's place to when it is consensual and between two adults)
“Do we not all live our lives with Sammi Sweetheart as our do north?” - Saf 2020
Every time she said "minga" I died laughing https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Minger%5D%2F%5BMinga%5D%5Bminging
I want that witchy outfit so bad!
Im early
When you're early but you can't make a relatable comment 👁️👄👁️
Every time I watch one of their newer videos in the new place I always think whoever built/designed jenna marbles house must have designed saf and Tyler's house cause their kitchen is super similar and  the walls and trim.
No one:  Absolutely no one:   Me: *vibing to her old intro* 💃💃🕺🕺
Safiya and Tyler =best couple. #powercouple.
I missed u
I'M CHURNING BUTTER
Her house looks so similar to Jenna Marbles' that i thought she green screened herself into Jenna's living room for a second lol
18:55 is that Jenna Marbles house????
Loved it saf
Tell me why I thought she was at Jenna marbles house 👁👄👁
Love all of the outfits on you, super cute and on trend. Also love watching you wear them out in public and Tyler's reactions haha. Its so cool seeing the variety of businesses on Instagram. Look forward to the next video :D xx
I feel like a lot of these designs are stolen from bigger brands. I’m pretty sure the pink cropped jacket is a Lazy Oaf design
I'm here after she posted on Instagram that she was uploading a new video, and so with nothing to do I hurried over to youtube. Overall, the video was very exciting, and I love hearing her talk.
Totally going to go buy those black shoes now!
Quickest 38 minutes of my life lol. Y’all know what that means.. replay!! 🤪 btw I soo wanna see the shoes from outfit 2 would look sick with the jeans from out 3 & the top from outfit 1 on u, Saf! 😊👏🏼
I'm so disappointed at your pronunciation of Oregon. Phonetically it's Or-ee-gun. 😁👍
The witch look would look soooooo cute with pigtails or braids! Also I'm surprised they suggested webster wigs as they're mainly sold to drag performers since they tease down and have a lot of lace and hair. 🤔
Without the bonnet the outfit is giving me Anne Hathaway in Ella Enchanted vibes.
Okay I was not ready for Saf to drop hard American Girl Doll historical doll knowledge
marina and the diamonds with the third outfit
*So you like twice,itzy and blackpink huh?*  I see that the kpop also attracted you😆now you won't be able to escape it😂
Tyler and me are twinssss! I also have IBS
The first look without the bonnet looks like a look someone would wear at Westworld
Does anyone else think honey has sponsored every YouTube video but don’t get me wrong it is pretty cool
Plss give me a shout out
As an Oregonian I HAVE to say... it’s not pronounced Ore•GONE it’s pronounced Ore•GIN😉
I LOVE THIS BRING OLD VID TYPE CONTENT BACK
:0 I'm early!
I follow food the most. I got suggestions of clothes.
Girl I love you and will Support anything you do, but I am SO glad we got a break from the soap content😂
wait did she just say “hello fellow kids”... is Safiya a Laurenzside fan?
I MISSED YOU!!
is Safiya's phone background a close up picture of Tyler doing a weird face 😂 11:36
I feel like the title of this should have been MARK ZUCKERBERG IS TRYING TO KILL ME not clickbait
Im not the only one who heard 'grape' right? 24:24
Awesome as always 😍❤️💜 love Safiya and Tylor 💜
PLEASE DO A WEEK WEARING AMERICAN GIRL DOLL INSPIRED OUTFITS!!!!! I wanna see you live your Josefina/Felicity/Kirsten dreams!!!!!!
"this is safiya's, new, intro, songggg" *has a ring to it.*
The witchy outfit looks so good on you too!!
The not e-girl outfit, I could be wrong but I think it's called Y2k fashion since it's inspired by the early 2000s and some from the late 90s. Like pink tracksuits and the brand baby phat is a good example
Let's be honest ... Safiya can pull of any outfit she wants .
I love when you tubers post long videos like this! I feel like so many you tubers get weird about posting long videos. Love the content and the humor❤️
Oh how I miss the intro song! 🖤
I bought those pair of earrings in her montage. The ones from birthday life vintage. They were so cute. I couldn't resist.
Is it just me or does the last outfit look super indi?
I love outfit number 2 the most.  add a pirate hat to the first outfit without the bonnet and you got a rebel pirate.
no ones gonna mention she is literally in an alternate universe jenna marbles house
TYLER AT 37:21 OMG 😭🥁
Is it just me or does she sound like like one of those people talking in the background of one of those The thing or miss mojo videos-
Hi safiya i am indian and actually its midday here....anywayss love u ❤️❤️❤️ will support you no matter what ❤️ur biggggg fan ❤️ and a small request for you to do an q n a ❤️ and also one more collab with rosanna
Honestly you just remind me of the Amish and Mennonite families in my area with the Colonial Williamsburg outfit lmao but it's super cute!
okay im in love with the witch outfit, I dont usually wear stuff like that but I'd totally be willing to try that
I want that "witch" outfit.
Phone: Sends notification 43 minutes after the video was posted  Me: *visual confusion"
Wowww love the second witch outfit
Oh, you got a new phone case I see. I like it!
you’re my favorite
okay ONCE safiya, i see you 👀👀
twice and itzy in your areaaa
i love safs middle part oml
With the bonnet off, Safiya is giving Anne Hathaway from Ella Enchanted
On the wig: For someone who knew nothing, Tyler did well! Very proud of him. Lacefronts can be really difficult to deal with and learn how to put on properly.
she looks so pretty in the second outfit 💔💔
Still waiting for the new house tour!!☺️☺️👀
Middle part Safiya >>>>
I spot American Duchess😀
So bizarre, some shots around the 22-23m mark look like Safiya is filming from Jenna/Julien's house.
i kinda love how fast i saw this video. i also kinda love that i'd never seen the shop tab before because i have a shopping addiction and now i want to know what instagram thinks my style is.
18:15 looks like Jenna's background
honestly saf suits pink hair
I told myself I was gonna work out but it can wait
Ok is no one gonna talk about how Safiya's explore page is filled with Twice and Itzy's graduation photo
i LOVE the jeans so much!😍
I didn’t even know IGTV had a app girl I-
I’m 23 and single BUT IVE BEEN GETTING THE SAME HUGGIES AD ON YOUTUBE FOR 2 YEARS. I’m NOT kidding!!!! So don’t complain of 1 baby pic. It has expanded beyond huggies but that has not left me. I follow no kids channels. The closes might be mr.beast however. I guess they assume A women who watches makeup videos must also be interested in children SMH 😑😑😑
I genuinely love that Witch shirt, I just wish it didn’t say “Witch” on it or I would wear it in a heartbeat. I’m not a witch, but I wear things that give a witchy aesthetic (similar to Saf actually).
all of these outfits look so cute!! specially the 3rd one🤩 so happy you updated<3
THE SECOND OUTFIT WAS SO GOOD OMG
Ugh my queen is back. Your voice is seriously so calming I’m watching this before bed lol LOVE YOU GUYS!
Ohshooot, this is probably the earliest I've been! Dangggg love yourr content as always Safiyaaa 💖✨
Safiya is a once!! She has good taste :]
Safiya are you a once? Because i see a healthy sprinkling of twice in your explore page
hi
Safiya say's: "Minga London" I hear Beyyyn! Saying: "I feel like Rimmel London" Rimmel London! I hear Jen Cristine's (simplynailogical) sister  saying Rimmel London! Help Im stuck with Rimmel and Minga London awww! 😣🙃😊♥️❤👽🦇🖤
wait... instagram has a shop tab???? safiyas videos keeps me updated 😂😂😂
saf’s explore page is all about Twice fr 🤣 what a taste🤩
Definitely more soft girl than e girl
have some credit for that wig tyler! it looked great
Safiya giving BWL era Halsey vibes in outfit three~
I missed u 😔
YESSSSSSSS ANOTHER SAFIYA MASTERPIECE
I really love the pink on you, it makes your dark eyes pop and gives your skin a glow!
Just tuck the loose strap from the skirt-overalls through the nipple ring and it solves the flapping.
that 'egirl' look is like equestria girls Pinkie Pie
K but I'm gonna need a link for that pink wig
That witch outfit is EVERYTHING.
Was totally thinking about totally spies before you mentioned them
These two really just said OraGONE. I do not understand why people can't say Oregon correctly.
I'm surprised that you didn't mention the hundreds of scam stores on instagram. SO many stores steal photos from Etsy and rip people off. Always check the store before you buy!
You never fail to post entertaining videos. I think you look good in whatever you try on.
The only thing that could have improved this video was Safiya saying “there is a cherubim on my cheribum”.
Colonial Williamsburg is a highly unrated Saf meme.
I am in the shop tab. I not even follow half of the clothes they suggest.
SUCH AN INDIAN MOM THING LOL Instagram is suggesting Safiya to have a baby now that she is married. Such a mom thing to do 😂   Now that you are married, when is the baby coming? 👀
Yes queen your back! So excited to watch!
Ok but this is Jenna Marbles kitchen? Lol You guys have the exact same kitchen/living room design! Maybe you are neighbours 🥰 loved this video! Especially the butter churning haha
Have missed you guys!
You should wear the craziest wigs you can find for a week. Or make clothes and then you can only wear those for a week. Undergarments included.
Who else went to go buy those celestial boots from Rogue and Wolf and noticed they didn't have any shoes?? 🙋‍♀️
I can’t understand half of Saf’s references. I’m not that old, she’s speaking a whole other language with these verbalisms.
Oof the goth outfit looked SO good on you!! Very sexy goth love it
Someone get me a man like Tyler...;(
This video couldn’t have come at a better time for me 👏🏽👏🏽
I really like the pink hair!
Did anybody noticed her wallpaper😂
I honestly love the wig on u
I'd love to see the pink outfit without the wig, I think it'd help with the "too much pink" thing, also you could say it ties into the black hearts on the jacket, but that's just me!
Hmm I think if you took the pink jacket from the “egirl” outfit and the wig then put it on the witch it’d be fire
BlackMilk featured at the start! omg so cool! I made those :D
Can someone pls tell me how to get ig dark mode on Android 😭😭
So Colonial Williamsburg Angelic Witch?? Would that be accurate portrayal of Safiya's instagram feed???  Edit: Ahhhhhhh!!!!! I love the second look!!!! She rocks it so well!!!!!
Okay but where can i buy that witch outfit? especially the shoes and turtleneck
I need to know these early 2000s memes pages please!
Why does every youtubers house basically look the exact same?
11:19 If Charli Dmalio was goth...
saf is a kpop stan & im here for it 😌
Love the Pink wig looks good on you.
I unsubscribed cuz you say the F word so that’s why
3:55 BERNADETTE!!!!! 😁😁😁
Dude good on Tyler. The wig looks extremely good. Especially for a first time.
Safiya is literally so pretty! Ugh I’m jealoussss
Excuse me is that twice’s bdz on your explore tab? My kpop heart is satisfied
i loved the last look!!!!
This has probably been said...and you probably won't see it but maybe try tuck the straps of the skirtoveralls into the ring hole? I feel like it'll look a lot nicer rather than flapping
No one  Litrally no one Person how many Youtubers you want to sponsor? Honey : yes
Is it weird that I typed in your name to find da videos then I see that we have the same birthday July 16 XD
i’m watching this at 12:30am!
my childhood oregon trail playing hermione-esque self is fixated on how it's dysentEry not dysentAry
Holy shit I’m EARLY🤣 Love you and tyler, keep up the amazing work🖤
Here in Greece it's 7 in the morning, but my cat woke me up and here I am
It's only been 40 min an this has 14k likes wow
Tyler you did a pretty good job in putting the wig👌🏽🤘🏽
I looved that brown skirt!!😭❤️ Hoped she'd wear it.
I think you look great in all the outfits. The second is my favorite
me: * c l i c k * :)
Yay!
ooooo curated social media shop videos i missed
💕
love you guys!! 💗
Was really happy to see a video from you!
"It is a pun!", is my new favorite quote.
I need to know what hair products you use! I feel like your hair grows so extremely fast!
Me: Hasn't played more than 10 seconds of the video  Me: *SMASHES LIKE BUTTON*
The third outfit gave me a Vanessa LaKosh Vibe from Lily Singh's vice presidential debate parody, from *Sketchy Times With Lily Singh.*
Okay but genuinely do the frankenmug. Drop some mugs and glue them together and then encase it on both sides with a clear resin maybe? For safety. But yeah that sounds lit
As someone who loves history and history outfits, I respect you SO MUCH for just full on getting that entire outfit 😂 And honestly I loved how it looked without the bonnet! Totally wearable!
I think you just needed to style the wig different? like make the hair style more 90s/early 2000s?
Please someone tell me I’m not the only one who thinks their living room/kitchen layout looks JUST like Jenna and Julien’s house??? Obviously it’s different but there are houses in my neighborhood/community with similar layouts reused in design.
What’s the difference in mom jeans and dad jeans? 😭
This made my night
This is just safiya exposing herself as a once stan for 38 minutes
would like to see that franken mug please!
I am living for the pink hair. It looks so good!!
Some theme-fitting self promo: I recently started making handmade jewelry, such as ashtrays and rolling trays! The Instagram is @selinebiewer, I’m trying to save money for my trans top surgery 🥺 I also have a GoFundMe 👉🏻👈🏻
I STAN YOU POSTING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
I feel like the last outfit has a lot of potential. I really like the pink wig and jacket with the color of the jeans. I think it would look nice with skinny jeans of the same color and a plain white tank top underneath because the print on the shirt and jacket was a bit much imo. But it looked really good when the jacket was off the shoulders
ur living in jenna marbles house except it’s goth
I liked how different each outfit was, though favourite was definitely outfit 2👍💛✌
Selena's horror short-film was actually made to be a preview to her next album but the album was cancelled because of her health afflictions and treatment, so in retrospect it seems kind of confusing 😅
I am HERE for that last outfit and the wig is amazing!! I know it’s not your vibe but GURL IT LOOKED GOOD!! Also love the other outfits too 💕
When are we going to see the "Colonial Williamsburg Trip" video?
Saf is such a gorgeous woman.
i see the queen uploaded 😌
Her life is iconic , but whose here at 12 am 💀
I like how many things saf buys for her vids, I hate it when youtubers make these vids and order like 2 things !
“Control the memes of production” was the best lol
Omg hii love You and then look
Can you see the moonss? ...Proceeds to cover them...
I love this intro song so much.  Best $5 you ever spent, at least on youtube haha
As someone who lives in Virginia and once dated someone who worked at colonial Williamsburg, a Safiya episode has never been so curated for me. Haha 😂
Safiya needs to make a video about shifting realities
The witch outfit is so cute
Once you Jim-in  You can’t Jim-out
0:37 CHAEYOUNGGGGGG
10:24 on the left that's Yasmin Benoit! Asexual aromantic activist and lingerie model from the UK! She's awesome :)
Heyyyy Safiya!!! 🧡🧡🧡 Love the Virginia joke as that’s where I’m from lol
I LOVE THE 3rd ONE
petition for safiya to wear a witchy outfit with longass black nails and goth makeup,, go _full_ out
Oooohhh
Safia: I need a sponsor Honey: hi again ;)
Can you tuck the tassels from the skirt into the circle in the front
I really hope she washed that wig
i’m 30mins late broooo
I didn't know what to expect for the wig, but let's just say I'm so attracted to Safiya in pink
I’m watching this 38 minute video 38 mins after it was released 🧐
Uuaaaagg you look sooo good in the second outfit!!!
Ok, but that wig would totally go with the platform crocs
Oh no poseur is real cute but that cute af Powerpuff girl shirt is an omighty rip off ☹️
holy shit im early
Your e-girl is actually called soft girl
SAFIYA DRESSING Y2K IS SO POGS PLZ <333
safiya: posts a video me: stop everything this is an emergency
Whoever’s seeing this comment, god bless you!!! ❤️
i had to pause the video at 18:48 because i need someone to tell me where that face mask with the embroidered flowers is from!!!
Ok I know the jeans fit weirdly but I really liked the pink look!
Some nasty person just hacked me and bought loads of stuff on my card 😔 really needed this so thanks Saf❤❤
Why is she the only Youtuber that no matter what I'm doing if she pops up im sitting and watching. Lol
It would be great if Safiya didn't buy into fast fashion as much.
I paused The OA for this..
94k views in 38 min. Sofiya this is how you know you have quality content! <3
Hi I love ur vids but could u do a “ Testing TikTok small business products”
OUR QUEEN UPLOADED WHEN MY INSOMNIA STARTED YES
Saf’s pink hair is giving me Lady Gaga vibes
I have never clicked faster in my life!!
Safiya: Do they make other Disney princesses               They do they really do              Do they make Disney villains              They do they really do Me: LMAOOOOOO🤣🤣🤣
I love the trendy witch aesthetic
Just discovered that instagram explore area tags are a thing !
Hello to #notificationsquad
It’s OREH-GEHN  Thank you 😂👏
MONTHS ago?! Girl ... 🤨
Hi Safyia, you’re beautiful 💜
I missed youuu your funny ❤️❤️❤️❤️ stay safe
Who else here at 12 am.....
Safiya without makeup 😍!!
aahhhhhhh!
I work at the bookstore there!
I can see Tzuyu's DTNW fancam in her explore😁💜✨
SAF YOU LOOK GORGEOUS OMFG
*SAFIYA! SAFIYA! SAFIYA! TYLERRR!*
Sof please pull the wig back.  Please pluck the part  The straight way they cut this lace
Tyler TOTALLY landed that last pun 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I think the straps on the black skirt are suppose to be tucked into the rings so the straps aren’t just out Willy nilly
yes we are all sammi sweetheart (rip ron)
💀🤣😂 "unwanted flappage" That needs to be merch
Good video saf!!
I really like the second outfit it’s so pretty
The biggest issue with the 3rd outfit is that the pinks aren’t matching. Also it would have been good to see like a combination of the 3 outfits - like the blouse the velvet skirt and the wig. Otherwise all the looks are very strong vibes and aesthetics that look awesome!!!
I love this video
I was instantly intrigued by this, IG randomly stuck a big old shop tab where my notifications were! My notifications now sit at the top of the screen so the shop can be centre stage 😂 They really be pushing it
The second outfit was gorgeous! I love it
YOU'RE MY FAVPTOTE YOUTUBER!!
No one:  Safiya: E-GIRL
I hate lele pons
I actually love the third outfit. I think it works as a trend and has no chance of making it through the times. The wig for sure does not work, at least at that length. The wig also clashes with the pink jacket and it doesn't look as great
You looked like Winona Ryder as Abigail Williams in The Crucible  😂
I just discovered that there is shop tag in instagram explore area .... I feel stupid. 🌚
I’m happy that you’re back and uploaded your vids 😊
I cant believe she has never seen the Selena Gomez Instagram horror movie. SMH       Jk i don’t even have instagram
Ory-gun, ory-gun.. oraGON is so difficult to hear lol
.. but do you stan loona 👁️
I want to be your cosplay mom so bad
i legit stan
the way my head popped up when she talked about Josefina bc I was obsessed with American Girl when I was a kid 😂 but only the historical ones.
completely off topic but shes sooooo pretty!
Man I hope saf says whether the star shoes were comfy or not bc I want them... Update - I mean I didn’t hear they were uncomfy soooo 👌👌 Thoticia here I come
I miss your 10 minute videos. I love your content but i just dont have enough time or patience to watch a 40 minute youtube video. I love you so much though and you are awesome, id just love it if you posted more frequently and shorter vids please
🖤🖤🖤👽I'm so freaking early 🖤🖤🖤🖤👽
Can we take a second and appreciate their amazing editing? ✨ You Can tell they have a vision and truly want to deliver ❤️
outfit three would look good with black sneakers or black boots! 🖤
The 'not an e girl' is basically insta wants u to be seraphine
Safiya looks like a wad of walking cotton candy in her 'E girl' outfit...😂
I hope you do this for makeup if you havent already!! :D
This is my first time being early 🥺😅
did anyone else see safiyas lock screen of tyler😂
Hi Pinn this if you care about me
YES SAFIYA UPLOAD
as we are all want to do  am i having a stroke hahahahah i want a shirt that says that
I actually truly love the second outfit! Like it's so beautiful and the shoes are awesome!
22:19 ew. this is why i love u Safiya. lol 😂
I honestly am loving saf with pink hair. I think it works
Love the video
I cant wait till i get home so you can tear that cherry out
I like the second outfit. Minus the print.
its 1am on a friday, im bored with nothing to watch and then BOOM. right on time.
Me: *6:43 am, just about to go to sleep* Saf: *uploads* Me: 👁️👄👁️ sleep is for the weak
Saf you looked so good in all the outfits but the first two were definitely my fave on you and that I want to buy them now 🔥🔥🔥😍❤️
These videos are awesome!
I love the jeans
The pink wig suits you!!!!!! Maybe use a lighter brown on your brows, but the shade of pink suits your skintone!!! 😍
I love watching people buy stuff I can't afford
I don’t dress like that anymore but the second outfit is fire and I want it oh but that 3rd outfit 😍 the pink looks so good with the light wash jeans
I really like the 2nd outfit look!
I LOVE THE WITCH OUTFIT ITS SO COOL
It's 12:42 am in my country but it's Safiya soo here I am.
I look forward to Safiya's videos more than any other YouTuber!!
The white socks with the gothic look really threw me off... I was hoping she was going to remove them. Also love the pink jacket!!! It would definitely suit the goth look
ALSO, @safya if you add a bandolier to the colonial wiliamsburg w/o bonnet outfit and braid your hair you look like a mexican revolucionary adelita
35 min ago earlyyy
Try tucking the straps into the rings and into the skirt. That should keep them out of the way.
I really like the pink outfit lol
Ugh my family and i love Williamsburg! My brother's going to school for historical preservation and he's goping to get a job in calonial Williamsburg!
Honestly, egirl is more an attitude than a fashion
Saf is one of those people who looks just as good in a mask as she does out of one. I would love to know where she got that black mask from. It frames her face so well.
i think the last one is called soft girl
Lol always makes me giggle when people pronounce Oregon that way lol.
Yayy, clicked the notification as soon as I saw it ♥️😊
Honestly I can’t stand a lot of sponsored ads in videos, but honey is a really good thing to download, I’ve saved a lot of money with it 🙌
🖤🖤🖤
Due to the American girl references in this video, you should do a video customizing American girl dolls. You can look up videos about it. You can eye swap them, wig swap and do makeup
Safiya's middle part is giving me Morticia Addams vibes
As someone born and raised in Oregon, the way Saf and Tyler pronounce it is so adorable
Your answer to the e-girl pink clothing u where questioning its called pastel goth style.
Safiya got the cottage core look!!
Instagram will wonder why there is a bump in sales overnight
Me: (sees notification)Its probably a comment notification.(checks it ) What the- who is- its- its 1.30 in the morning Safia!
The witchy outfit 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Love this so much!
I love the Morticia Adams vibes
Yay I love Saf’s videos
Don’t say that, you are no way close to lily sing. You are naturally funny and don’t rely on sexist stereotype or men evil type comedy. Also you are not annoying. As a pan sexual woman of color, I find you entertaining and intelligent unlike Lily sing.
I’ve been sad lately and seeing that Saf posted, made me feel just a little better about things.
Tyler’s defeated “never mind” made me laugh so hard!
YESSS!! We know it a "the internet made ne buy...." Video with the classic Safiya intro song!! Luv ya Saf!
the pink hair looks so goood!!
I just got a snack and came on yt to look for a video to watch while eating and saw that saf uploaded. the timing couldn't have been better
OMG THE SECOND OUTFIT LOOKS SOOOO GOOD ON YOU!! TOTALLY LOVE IT 😍
i’m loving the mask coordination along with all the outfits
Pink hair is lazy town vibes
Hay peeps
It's literally the middle of the night and I am watching her wear pink hair..
Lol you were looking at SOFT GIRL apathetic not EGIRL! 😅🤣
oraygone trail ahahahahahaha
Their house reminds me so much of Jenna and Julien’s house
Me early to a safiya nygaard video? I don't think I've ever done that. Also that outfit is so Josefina but I didn't ever think that safiya would say that.
Blame Tyler haha. Or give credit. Hahahaha
I NEEDED this video today! I choked on my water when you were talking about your titty tassels 🤣
Nobody: Me after watching this video: Let me see what my shop tab has to offer me. Sounds fancy.
that goth look HIT oh my god
Saf you look fire in the second outfit
The way that Tyler had to walk away at 28:26 😂 If you ever want to do a more lowkey video, I would love to hear more about your favourite Shakespeare plays or scenes! Brittany Broski has been nerding out about art history things on her channel and it'd be so fun to hear about what you're passionate about.
i think the third outfit is called "soft girl aesthetic" but i dont know either, im the second one, the hoerticia
The shop the tanktop came from is an aliexpress reseller DO NOT buy from them
im studying macbeth in my english class lol
I LOVED the last outfit mom/dad jeans just do it for me 🤤🤤
wait Mark Zuckerberg created instagram or someone else i am confused
idk if it just me. BUT SAFIYA LOOKS SO SO SO SO GOOD. Don't get me wrong she looked gorgeous before but she just glowin so different!!!!
The second one is my favorite
Any ideas where her floral shirt from 18:37 is from?? I need it in my life!
I could watch these kinds of videos forever
Yass queen
With all this election stuff happening you uploaded just at the right time. Thanks Safiya 👍🏼
Man I've missed that intro🥺
ok not @ all the twice content on your explore page STREAM I CAN'T STOP ME
Yay! I made it literally 30min after Safiya posted 😁😁
Post more
it’s been a while
Ive never been this early before... YAAYYYY ❤ u safiya!
My insta is always full of those damn Kardashians
thank you so much for the virginia jokes. i also work in colonial williamsburg but at a seafood restaurant so i very much enjoy the williamsburg references in your videos
you look so good!
Gotta love that mask coordination 😷
The only fan jokes 👁👄👁
I got curious and went to look at my page. I was sorely disappointed...
Video idea: Make a Franken-Outfit with stuff Instagram recommends you
Omg right when the Instagram shop tab appeared I was literally imagining Safiya making a video on it XD
I AM EARLY ?!!!! ❤️
Not fully through the video but Safiya 100% needs to watch the Poland Eurovision performance from a couple years ago, she is ready for their sexy churning dance!
Wait omg im IN LOVE with the last outfit! Maybe because its rare to see safiya in any color other than black but i kinda love it. Even the wig hahaha. Also like i want that denim jacket lmao
A lot of the pastel clothes are more soft girl style and the like more care bear and powderpuff girls things you were looking at are are more of a style called indie
Saf about the third outfit: oh this is trendy but way too pink and my least favorite Me: would give my firstborn to wear this outfit
I’ve waited soooooo long for this ! Like girl come on please come see us more often 😫😂😘
Saf’s long hair makes her look even more like Morticia
Yay you got the video up!  I'm proud of you guys,  you work so hard on your videos.
As someone that comes from that part of Pennsylvania, what you look like in that first outfit is Amish. XD
Oh my God, Queen Tzuyu making a guest apparence on a Safiya Video.
You look so beautiful with the longer hair! More grown up, I love it!!!
but do you know where your black and gray rose top is from?? it's so cute!!
I was never this early:)
i didn't expect to love the franken-american girl doll outfit as much as i did
It’s the AC running in the background not generator unless they have no regular electricity then their generator would be on.
I’ve never been this early 😌😌😄
WHY DOES YOUR HOUSE LOOK LIKE JENNA MARBLES HOUSE?!
I'm a Lil late is that ok?
<3
How did you know I was rewatching some of your style videos today? So glad to see another one! Loved the historical outfit!
“Did anyone see the movie” ...no...literally no one has seen or even heard of that horror “movie” 😂
Tyler and I can do dysentery together 😂😄🙂😐😕🙁😖😩 And that’s on IBS 💩
saf's videos are getting progressively longer and I'm here for it
Really like third outfit too though
Safiya, I love you and your videos and I’m watching this at 11:30 at night, your videos give me my daily dose of serotonin... if only they could also give me a nightly dose of melatonin.  😂😂
I like your other intro better
the second outfit is definitely my favorite
Hey! JennaMarbles has that floor plan too!
maybe I’m just high and tired cause it’s 1 am but THAT WIG LOOKS SOOO GOOD
Safiya posts Me : dashi run run run 🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️
This brings back memories of the good old days. EDIT: 5:01 I see that trans pride pin.
2017/18 flashbackkkk
Oregon “Or-i-gin” 😁😇
TWICE IN A SAFIYA VIDEO??! HELL YEAH 🥰
safiya thinking an egirl is ✨pastel✨ was too funny and too cute.
You look so pretty in all of these outfits
i think saf was mixing up egirls and softgirls
Outfit one: Colonial  Outfit two: Witch  Outfit three: Mean Girls
*HERE BEFORE TRENDING!!*
Your videos always make my day!
The second cat caller sounded like a girl to me kinda
I looooovvveeee your hair lately. It looks so good. The middle part is very Morticia  vibe like
Yay! The return of Safiya’s new intro song!
I've never been so early to a video 😂😏
I’m currently early
Anyone gonna talk about Safiya’s phone background?
For me it's 7am
Thank you Sofiya!!! This is just what I needed right now!! :))))))
Hey ! I just Subscribed your channel few minutes ago and you uploaded a video 😂 and I'm from India it's not night here it is 11:08AM
Saf's hair is so long now!! It looks really good 🥰
Would love another era video! 40s perhaps? Maybe dive into a decade in the 19th century? That would be great!
Minga london would not be pronounced 'ming gar' it would be 'ming ah' as a play on the word 'minger' in the UK xx
I needed this lol
Tuck the “tassels” in the rings that’s why it’s awkward
I have early class tomorrow but I can’t sleep knowing that there is a Safiya video to be seen
i think there’s a way to take vinyl prints off shirts!!
Outfit 2 is gonna be the best. I can feel it
If you come to colonial williamsburg i would love to come lol i live 2 hours away
Ugh she’s so damn pretty 🥰✨
The angle of unpacking your 3rd outfit looks like you're visiting Jennas place..
I POOPED A POTATO                        idk what to say but good video❤️❤️
I believe that e-girl was first known as emo girl but now e-girl is also pastel colors. As much as I dont like it many females who stream on Twitch are called e-girls becuse of their pastel ascetic and the videogame/ anime nerd. So in a way you aren't too far off of the current e-girl aspect
Love the bernadette shoe showing up in the chat for a sec
i was watching ur ig story and waitingggg for this
oml Saf i need to go to bedddd
lol love the Shego cosplay at 10:44
Yay im kinda early!😁
I spy the Bernadette's in the new shop tab 👀
Saf stopped filming in the room with the table? Tbh...kinda miss that room 😂
Yesss, I was (in)patiently waiting for a new video
I've watched all of Saf's stories of editing and filming this video and i had suspected something insta related, and it's finally here!
Yes finally
Im so glad that you posted!! I love your videos Saf :)
it kills me how they say Oregon 😂😂
I enjoy Tyler's commentary to no end lol
Tyler's offcamera "nevermind" was the most relatable thing for me this week.
I was literally watching your old videos as I got the notification you uploaded a new video, I’m so excited 😁♥️
i love opening youtube and seeing a new safiya video
Saf can you please mail the jeans for me I would kill someone for them
Me: waiting for Safiya to upload  Also me: finished watching another video, sees her video and saw the new icon.  YEASSS
Omg Saf’s explore page has Twice 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Yassss Josephina vibes!! Omg what a throwback 😂 living for it😍
Did you know you don’t have to wear a mask when you are not next to anyone in CA outside. Just saying
Is it me or her house looks like Jenna’s 👀
Am I the only one that found it funny how they pronounced "Oregon" ?!?
Early ( ish ) squad! 😂
Yessssss Safiya that second outfit looked so good on you!
People who never hated safiya❤️  👇 👇
your house really really looks like jennas house omggggg
Everything I watch Safiya I always want Kraft Mac and cheese. And I don’t know why
The pink hair looks AMAZING on you!! Also, I actually absolutely LOVED the whole pink outfit! I am going to go buy those pieces right now lol
Earlyyy I love ur videos 😄
I have a TON of jewelry, comfy clothes, and beauty hehe! I love u safiya n Tyler (n crusty)
STREAM WHAT THAT SPEED BOUT
She looks so hot in all the outfits hut the witch one is even BETTER!! Omg gorgeous!
I'm living for the hocus pocus quotes
finally!!!
Omfg🤣🤣🤣 I freaken can’t with this video🤣🤣
Love have a great day
She does make the pioneer thing work
Wow I'm early. Love the video
I'll go to Williamsburg for ya! Want me to hit Monticello and Mt. Vernon while I'm out and about? I dont even like va that much, thanks military
i want that witch outfit for myself, you looked so good
The pink hair looks really good on her!
The skirteralls is just WOW (also boots)
25 minutes late!!!!!! SCREEEEE IM EARLY
There is so much American Girl Doll knowledge going on right now 😂
18:16 bish did you move in with Jenna marbles and not tell us?
I know nothing about egirl style.  Can someone pls explain why the 3rd outfit wasn't that?
SAFIYA NOT KNOWING WHAT EGIRL IS WAS SO CUTE LMAO BABE
In addition to looking 1970’s with the hair down, outfit one is also looking a little Westworld.
Totally with the 90s 2000s trend 😌💖
Stop glowing!
Safiya I’m an avocado mixed with a potato 😀👍🏻
haii C:
I like the last outfit better with the mask because it brings the pink and blue colors together.
It was only on the screen for like a second but I can't be the only one who saw a trans flag around 5:00
I'm so gay for goth safiya
i appreciate all the twice videos on ur explore page saf
idk why but why does the first outfit plus bonnet safiya look like the conservative mother to the rebellious first outfit minus bonnet safiya 😂😂
Instagram keeps trying to get me to buy capes and cloaks 😂 As much as I love a good cape, I think I'll take Edna Mode's advice (though I was admittedly intrigued)
I think the pink outfits are more of “soft girl”
It is 8:35 am in Turkey so Good Morning Saf!
I’m loving all the kpop references :)
14:10 whats the measurement from your shoulder to your crotch   Lmao saf what you lookin for
MingaLondon is one of my fav shops ✨
Saf’s house reminds me of Jenna’s
Is Safiya basically living in a Jenna's lookalike house!? Like THERE SO SIMILIAR?
SPONSOR SAF!!! This woman just scrolling through her shopping page showed me so many things that I want to buy 🥴
We missed you Safiya! 💕
Saf walks out in the mask and her full goth outfit   Me: mm I'm gay
SAFIYA!!!!! YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL!!!
They bought a house!
All the aussies be like  YESSS ITS THE PERFECT TIME
Idea: Make an eyeshadow palette from combining different eyeshadow colors together
I thought honey was a scam but it low key slaps
Yikes... in Australia “minga” (pronounced Ming - ah, no hard G in the middle) is NOT a nice word 😬  It’s a word used to describe someone (pretty much always a woman) who is considered ugly + slutty + trashy. Yuck
AYYYY OO
I'm wondering if that that second skirt with the first outfit was a pettiskirt or the one she wore was one. Historically accuracy would involve multiple skirt layers for modesty because underwear wasn't a thing.
I live in Oregon and because I live in Oregon my school made a big deal out of the Oregon trail we had to spend 5 months studying the same subject okay sorry I had to get out of my system
hi
11:36 look at her phone you won't regret it lmao
For once, i am early holy! Love you Safiya!!!
I’ve been watching so many Cherry Wallis videos that when you said the Intro I was expecting “Hello friends? Witches wizards and mugles!” Then i was like Oh- this is a a normal channel..... 👀
who’s here before 1 million views?!i love you saf, and thanks for the hard work into your videos! ❤️❤️
ALSO I havent been able to screenshot proof of it but I'm horrified if its what I think it is:  One time, I was logging onto IG from the web client and right before the first page on my feed loaded in, something that seemed to be an auto generated description of the picture. I've been trying to catch it, but the site always loads before I can get the screenshot. Long explanation aside, you might be right about them Ai scanning your pictures 😩
Safiya I think yourrrr soo coool OMG omggg can u reply that would make my LIFE
I feel like my style is in the middle of tomboy e girl soft girl and girly girl. I cant decide!!! I'm indecisive lmao.
Her second outfit matches the street fashion trend
The last time I was this early, Safiya was still engaged, betrothed AND affianced!
Ok, I’m back. Got distracted by the disney bikinis. 🤣
I'M SO GLAD SHE'S BACK AHHHHH
As an Oregonian, it made me cringe the way they said Oregon 😅
Posted when I woke up :0 (7:34am)
Waiting for this 😊 love it ❤️
Da queen has uploaded yessssssssss
The clear jacket reminds me of JYP in MAMA 2019😂
You guys say Oregon the same way Mulder from X-Files says it, maybe you’re from the same place?
Historical and vintage fashion... *Karolina enters the chat*
Everyone is saying that I am watching this video in midnight but Not in India we are seeing this in morning  😄😄
no hate but like the way they said Oregon tho 😑😂 OrOgon trail
This channel has truly become my YouTube equivalent of comfort food. Like when I just want to watch something I know is really awesome (and that happens a lot), this is where I come. I might have rewatched each of her videos upwards of 15 times. Love u sm Safty
I missed these videos
Been waiting for a video lol now I have something to watch at 11:33pm😂🥰
Early
POV: Saf is now Cottagecore (bc of the first outfit)
you’re gonna tell me this isn’t jenna marbles house?
I am living for this long hair, middle part, Morticia Addams vibe 🖤
Lmao I think what Saf thought was an e-girl would be considered a soft girl
"This is safiya's new intro"😂
I'd like to try Honey but it isn't available in my country
I lhink she looks like a pirat after she thook the bonet of on the first outfit
This is the type of happiness and slightly tom foolery we need during this really ridiculous week!
The 2nd dress was best.
Your YouTube comments pick your outfits
Im so I love with the witch outfit!!🖤🖤🖤😻😻
Safiya's explorer said stan twice
I work with Colonial Williamsburg. I could get you in there very easily. I am not sure how to send an email to you with more details.
You posted this at 11:23 for me this but I don’t care anymore
when i saw safiya in pink at the thumbnail i was just like: oh no, what did she do to herself-
ELHOFFER!!
Hehe it’s the middle of the night Saf!
me who lives in oregon: or-gen  safiya and tyler: or-e-gon    me: *confused existential noises*
I love how she went from Witch to angelic 🤣
*Sees Safiya posted, looks at the time.* “What is sleep? Don’t know them, this video is important than sleep.”
*safiya posts* Me: helloOo frens
my mouth became agape when i saw those moon shoes
HI SAFIYAAAA ILY
The way that the interior of Safiya's house looks just like Jenna Marbles' is freaking me out
I love your videos❤️❤️❤️
I've never been this late and early in the same time... 😅💕
I love watching Safiya buy random sh—!
why does it look like she's sitting in Jenna Marbles' living room for the intro
Imagine she starts a trend with the first outfit.
This made my day I am so happy now
New video,fun to watch❤❤❤....fan from Singapore
Your couch is as big as my room. :'D
I love that Safiya just said "Josefina meets Felicity meets Kirsten American girl doll love child". That sums up a large part of my childhood.
Yes! The Selena Gomez horror movie is cool
I was eating dinner so i had to wait but I'm here!! Hi Safiya give Crusty pats for me!
Love this Saf❤️
no one : not even minhos cats :  me : **ADMIRES TWICE’S BEAUTY IN SAF’S EXPORE PAGE**   stan twice for clear skin 😚✌️
Virginians that are actually surprised that Virginia is mentioned this many times in a YT video, like here
Have you guys ever gone as Morticia and Gomez Adams for Halloween? That would be perfect!!!
Safiya: *shows her explore page* Me: *sees Twice in said explore page* Also me: 👁👄👁 Love you Safiya! And I love Twice so much.
Saf i need to see you go to Colonial Williamsburg, it’s everything i need in life atm
Opens Youtube. Sees Safiya notification. Life is good.
I deleted my Instagram about a year ago and I am soooooo lost with all these new added features hahahah!
The way Safiya jumped to the Sammi "sweetheart" comment from Tyler😂😂😂
I just watched the same mia maples video!!!
their kitchen/background looks so much like jenna marbles house it’s tripping me out
Outfit #2 gives me Lydia Deetz (specifically the musical version) vibes
I think the third out outfit was more of a soft girl/ y2k aesthetic. Loved the video!
Nothing is more 2020 than watching Saf buy the stress relief line from bath and body works in its entirety
Ahhhh!!! Yess! So excitedddddd
Hey Safiya! Since you guys are so stoked on Disneyland...I recently came across this etsy shop. This guy makes like super awesome custom animatronics based on Disney characters. https://www.etsy.com/shop/livingmotionprod
Dashiiiii Run Run RUN
That last part of 2000s pastel trendy vibe on your shop page is called "y2k" aesthetic and is very popular right now, so not surprising that it was suggested
Hi yall
31:06 the clueless ref!
Was not expecting this but I’m so happy it happened 🤍:)
me watching this at 12am like 👁👄👁
yay a new vid!!!
Only the OG's can like this comment.
Early xd
0:55 Rosé😍💝😅
Another video
I just felt like I need to say I’ve been loving the middle part Saf! You look so good with your hair like that! Also, the pink hair looks great! 💕
Its morning in india
Kpop for life Safiya  Yoongles will get better
Hi Safiya! I’m a really big fan of your videos and I love your personality! I watch all your videos with my mom. It’s always the highlight of my day when you post. Hope you are doing well!
Queens back!
Hey!!!! New video 🤩🤩🤩
Literally every outfit that Safiya wore she slays😪
Wait didn’t Mark Zuckerberg make Facebook?
Safiya’s done decade outfits, now I’d like to elect that it’s time for her to do century outfits
Twice on your recommended is a sign you need to stan
OMGGGGGGSGSGS YESSS
the "e-girl" look is straight up like Halsey with pink hair, i adore
She is getting cinsistent with her videos again. YAY!!!
I love your videos! :)
Safiya with a middle part>>>>>
Yayyy finally an outfits video!!!!!!!! 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
saf should do an outfits inspired by American girl dolls!
😀
did you move into jenna marbles house? lol
Safiya, June: "We've been waiting for things to open back up, but they kind of haven't even after a few months."  Me, November:
Why did I think this was Jenna and Juliens house for a sec hahah
The setup on the counter looks just like Jenna’s 😭😭😭
They literally just changed my entire explore tab into a shop tab instead
Oh how I've missed this intro song
Safiya blesses us with posts when we need them most :D
Ha Im 2030th commenter Beat that!
Hi saff I was eagerly waiting for new vid ❤️u
I get my shopping fix watching this ty hehe
Y'all are gonna get shredded for that pronunciation of Oregon lmao 🤣
Safiya, I just want to thank you for making me feel a little bit better about things. My cat, Embers, died yesterday and I'm really upset because I feel like I could have done something to help but I didn't. I am literally crying as I'm writing this, Crusty really reminds me of her, and that helped because now I know she is in heaven eating all the tuna she wants. She loved me, and I loved her. Goodbye, my little baby. You were a good cat, thank you for being my cat. Safiya, tell Crusty PLEASE that he is loved by me. I'm supporting you no matter what, Saf. You are the best
Yes hahaha
I genuinely need the angel pants. Just saying
Helloo Saf, thanks for being awesome <3
Totally Spies forever.
Who did this?!?      🤣🤣🤣
Love the American Girl references
I almost got Carrie vibes from Julie And The Phantoms
20 minutes ago is a bit worrying
I am here somewhat early Usally I get here and it’s 10 days later
I just watched mia maples do the same thing 😂 and I am here for it👍
God, I missed your uploads! ps I´ve never been this early...
Hahahaha. Me and Safiya said "BOTH" at the same time when Tyler said that instagram thinks she's a Witch or a Civil War Reenactor.
Colonial Williamsburg really is that girl though!
If I heard someone screaming “W I T C H” I’d immediately assume that there would be a Safiya lurking around in the shadows
seeing an unexpected clip of jenna always both warms and breaks my heart
They see me churnin, they hatin is iconic
hi
So we really need to discuss all those unread texts and unviewed phone calls.   I’m so Type A that this killed me. 😱
Hear me out... Skirtspenders
Safiya: Hello fellow kids Me: *inhales sharply* HOW DO YOU DO FELLOW KIDS
Her eyeliner game is on POINT🕷🖤
All the kpop girlies in Safiya's IG explore page tho!! Chaeyoung, Nayeon, Jennie, Mina, Rosé and Tzuyu (to name a few) 🤩 We love to see it~
Your house = Jenna's house 😂
FINALYYYYYY YESSSS I ALWAYS WAIT FOR YOUR VID TO COME UP SINCE I SAW THE BRATS VID IM INTO YOUR VIDS 😍
Ahhhhh I'm earlyy Aww thx for the like :-)
Hello I am the bog witch
I got you Saf! I think my friend's sister works at Colonial Williamsburg. I'll set it up.
omg their house has the same layout as Jenna's ;-; the table they're filming at is reminding me of Jennaaa
Yay!!! So happy you uploaded! We've missed you!
Safiya is slowly starting to look more and more like Morticia Addams everytime I see her🖤🖤🖤
Safiya posted a new video on my birthday!! The biggest and greatest gift ever.
The people here before 1 million views  | l V
Okay I can't get the shoes from 5:04 out of my head. Has anyone actually purchased these? Are the comfortable? Why would you buy them? Do they not cut off your circulation?
I never knew I could be early for one of Saf's posts-
I have come out of hibernation for this
Can't wait to rewatch this for 926 times
know i know why she takes forever to post     18:22
Her little laugh right after she said “you don’t need to see my explore page” was the cutest 🥰🥰🥰 my mom and I stopped what we were doing to watch this ❤️
hi saf
pleaseee do an egirl transformation omggg
yay finally a fashion video. was getting a bit tired of weird diy stuff.
Ok so I might be later than some... but I haven’t been this early since before the Instagram hack video
THE QUEEN HAS POSTED
“Don’t we all live like Sami Sweetheart” Yes
Halfway between me n lilly singh -Boss Witch
It’s late but yay the Bat queen is back. (Tho I can’t believe how long it took her to find the shop tab)
Who else noticed the slu (?) of twice in her explore page. I see chaeyong😌she do be listening to bdz (bulldozer) Edit: a few minutes later I SEE MINA
Safiya: posts Me: I AM SPEED
"Safyias new intro song" still going strong 😂😂
Idk about y’all but a safiya video is EXACTLY what I needed right now. This last week has been a long year.
Would it be possible to insert English subtitles in your videos? That would make your videos perfect!!
Ooommggg I love the witch look so much omg like so much I need it!!!!
0:35 - 0:40 you can clearly see twice and blackpink in these few seconds SAfiYa ArE u A OnCeBliNk?
missed your amazing videos safiya :( i love you so much
0:41 i can't tell whether safiya stans TWICE or if it's because of all the research she does for kpop-related videos lol
When you can't sleep.
It’s good to see you, friend. You are looking spiffy.
Just started watching and I am here for it 👏💕😁
Has the Selena Gomez horror movie come out ?
its the ✨wallpaper✨ for me
yay ive been waiting for smth new!!
Died at the part with the swimsuits 😂😂  "Look there's a "Belle (from beauty and the Beast) bikini!! Hmmm wonder if they do other Princesses??"  * clicks through* "OH they doooooo!!!! They really doooooo!!! Wow wonder if they do villains as well" *scrolls down* *gasps* " THEY DOOOOOO!!!!" THEY *REALLY* DOOOOOO! !!
0:42 , just queens doing queen shit. Anyways, Stan twice ✨
Did you film in Jenna's house?😊
( ◜‿◝ )♡
I dropped everything to watch this. I watch a lot of YouTube but nothing beats your videos. You get everything perfect, no matter what anyone else says!
I think that the style is a soft girl. 😅 correct me if I’m wrong but I’m pretty sure it fits that category.  I’m talking about the third outfit.
Who's here at 11:27 at night after they've just watched an hour of tiktok memes? Haha me
I love your "This is Safiya's new intro song" videos lol <3 :-)
Saf: "Totally spies! I completely forgot about that show"  Me: Heart breaks
Like a bulldozer! Like a tank like a soldier!!! LETS GO LETS GO!!!!
why does her house look like jenna marbles
Was looking for something to wash my face to thanks queen
I can't be the only person who's wondering why she had twice on her explore page. Safiya, are you an once?
I would love honey if it worked on phones!
i love saf so much that i dont skip her sponsor section
18:15 why did I think that was jenna and Julien's house
You have no idea how happy I get when a video gets posted :))))
SAF!
Yaay!! I've missed your videos & now I have something to watch while I eat my meal!! 🤗 🍜
this video calls me poor in 69 languages and i don’t like it
It's so funny when people say "Orgone."
When she mentioned Sammy sweetheart I have never agreed more about something in my life
Never been this early to a Sofia video! I love your videos like this so much💜
Also she said are the ears 57 but the tag said 27
Hey I loved it babe
Liked the video before I even watched it just bc it's saf
Are you gonna try tiktok items too??? Please do, it would be so interesting!! 😊
Safiya does the things I am too broke to do. I live vicariously through her. I feel like she was the kid who got all the as seen on tv things.
There is a shop for Instagram? Why not. I dig it as long as you are there to hold my hand Saf. It’s a scary shopping world out there.
11:37 she has Tyler’s face as her iPhone background 🥺
Loving the co-ordinated facemasks
YESSSSSS FINALLY A NEW VIDEO ASDFGHJKL
Finally you upload 😭😭😭
I feel like I’m the only one who missed the old intro “this is Safiya new intro sonnggg”
hey safiya! did you know you can actually upload pictures to aliexpress and they will show you similar products if not the same? quarantine got me turning into an aliexpress shopaholic and i constantly use that feature only for extra coins 😅😅
🎵this is safiyas neew intrro sooooong🎵
I AM SO EARLYY 👁👄👁
I miss safiyaaaaaa😍😍
Orange milk tea TEAAAA
I’m glad you chose something from rogue and wolf! I love their designs, I’m waiting for Black Friday to get one of their lovely cardigans! 🤩😍
I didn’t know how badly I needed a pink haired Saf until now
0:37 is that Chaeyoung I see
HI SAFIYA IM NOT THAT EARLY BUT THIS IS THE EARLIEST IVE EVER BEEN
YASS SAFFFF IVE MISSED YOU
I love the way you talk, so like fluently...?
Wow I love your phone background 😂
woah saf posted such a miracle
Safiya you should make a fraken bath soap!
Early for once! Only for the queen. 🔥
You should do a: I buy the outfits that the models were and attempt to recreate the photos
The intro is still epic after this long
Classic video premise, 10/10
you should do a video where you shop with tylers instagram
Missed yoo Saf xxx
Man but the comment about colonial Williamsburg and churning butter... I could saf living in a little cottage in the wilderness like the cottage fairy or something and being a cottage core mysterious witch Edit - got further through the video and clearly ig agrees 🏔
I'm early for once😂😃😄😉😆
Yay! It seems like she hardly ever posts!
0:39 only kpop fans and onces will notice nayeon and chaeyoung❤️😂
you are such an icon and an inspiration <3
Did anyone else notice Safiya's I-phone wallpaper?  LOVE IT💖❤
safiya: posts everyone: hi we’ve been summoned
Happy early wedding anniversary Saf and Tyler!
The best part of my week and I wasn’t even expecting a video today. I love a good the internet made me buy it from Saf ❤️
0m0 intro song changed?

SAFFF So happy to see you again!
Low key loving Safiya exposing her self as a Once, watching those fancam haha
Can we just talk about her long luscious beautiful hair💖

Insta: So do you like Goth or Old-timey clothes?  Safiya: *y e s*
Yay new video! :)
MIDDLE NIGHT PEEPS WHERE YOU AT?
I love the aesthetic of “either a witch or a civil war re-enacter”
I HAVE BEEN WAITING ALL NIGHT!!!!!

Omgggggg imiss this♥️

YOUR VIDS ARE AMAZING KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!!!
Early yesss
saf I know you will never see this but you are my favorite YouTuber ever. I have been watching you for a long time almost ever since you have started this channel. And I just want to say how much you have impacted on me. Even tho I don’t know you. But I just want to saw your videos make me laugh when my day is horrible. And thank you for just being you. Love you saf ( and Tyler are crusty )
I feel like Safiya would totally be accused of witchcraft in colonial day for some reason.
Saf your “e-girl” is probably a soft girl. OH PLEAAASE DO A SOFTGIRL VID.
Hewo
this is the earliest i’ve ever been to one of their videos, sick.
Couldn’t find anything to watch before bed... then Safiya blessed me 🙌🏼
E Girl
omg i was literally watching your old videos and now i’m early tehee :)
What an afternoon treat! thanks Saf!
Safiya THANK YOU SO MUCH like for real I needed this today so much thank youuu
I mean.... Salem witch trials, so Insta isnt far off with goth and colonialism
no way love u babes
5:50 the whole internet thinks you're preggers because you've got that _glow_ !
https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4a/73/ed/4a73ed39824b0fba5e34ec8c0fd6ff02.png
Nevermind 😂
Is she a twice fan? XD
Safiya: but before we do that i just want to thank today’s sponsor  Me: *pauses video* it’s gonna be honey *clicks play* Safiya: Honey! Me: told you so Safiya: now if you don’t know what Honey is Me: *pauses video again* then you’ve been living under a rock for the past year  *clicks play again*
Safiya like K-pop ✨confirmed ✨
YEAAAY°°
Hi
WHEN YOU UPLOAD I SMILE I SWEAR
Right now, most people Watching this video. Have not read the comments yet
Yess ive been waiting all day!!! Also can we please have a house tour.
I like a good late night video, this is perfect.
Yay I'm early!!!! By 15 mins
This is exactly the content I needed rn 😅
Hello freinds
Oh to have the new update with the trolley at the bottom
i stayed awake for this 🥰
call me a hater but the overabundance of disney princess clothing/makeup marketed to twentysomethings gives me nausea
15 minutes late 🥺
Check out @miamaples she made a video with this theme in April!
Your videos always make me so happy for some reason
Actually I think Instagram can figure out what you're wearing. Sometimes when I'm using the Instagram website instead of the app, and the pictures aren't loading, there is just a text description of the photo - like girl, teen, standing, sunset, etc. So I'm sure figuring out what you are wearing in your instagram photos isn't too wild
I love when you add clips from Jenna. Man I miss her
Shmashed that like button even before watching the video 😀✌
I see TWICEEEEE👁️👄👁️  are you also a ONCE Saf??💙💙💙
Eeeeeeek, I can't believe I'm early! Any aussies here?
i think safiya might be instagram shop’s first customer
Helloooo plss notice me
I CLICKED SO FAST
i ran so fast when i saw you posted
I just seen this and then though why the hell do I have so many of her video just chilling in my watch later🤦🏼‍♀️
Omg Im so here for this
Never been so early in my life
Heyyyyyyyyy saf
Twice pics really went on your discover page😻✨
Finally the intro that we all miss
I was going to go to sleep but when I see Safiya I must click.
safiya said stan twice 🥰🥰
Hi ( * 3 * )
Hello Friends. Can someone help me out? Lots of times in these outfit videos Saf uses the song Greensleeves. This song is a huge trigger for me. Can some one who watched lmk if it’s in this and possibly a time stamp before I accidentally give my self a panic attack. It’s happened to many times with these videos. Any help is appreciated! Thanks in advance
WE ARE HEREEEEEEEEE
WE reallyed missed you Safiya
Watching the queen🥰🐈‍⬛
me, getting ready to go to sleep at 2am: better check youtube for some sleepy videos sees new video: guess i aint sleeping yet
The clueless quote really resonated with me
I love any content of Safiya’s always answering the questions I want to know and doing what I am afraid to test
With the pink wig she kinda looks like Nina Dobrev at times or is that just me? 😂😂
Anyone else's instagram update so that all the buttons moved and igtv + the shop tab are now where the explore page and the notifications were and those are now next to the dms? It makes me sad seeing safiyas like this cause I hate the update
The pastels are soft girls saf xx
yey finally Early for this vid
Am I the only one who thought she kinda looked like Morticia Addams in the beginning of the video?
Wow Tyler on Safiya’s screensaver is such a mood
0:37 omg free twice promo
Safiya’s pink hair just slays too much i think she killed me
18 minutes 2k comments
I love when we get Safiya's New Intro Song
You have no idea saf....I literally wait for your videos. I am just 15, and I love ur videos. Love you saf and Ty ❤
It's really not that hard for them to scan your photos to see what you're wearing. See, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines...
0:35 omigosh I have spotted blackpink I’m so happy And 0:56
I seriously thought I might have a chance at being “first” since this was literally uploaded 12 minutes ago.
I’m early
hi i watched this 11 min after it was posed
Literally I have never even noticed that shop tab...What a bizarre little corner of Instagram!
AAA already so much comments. I love you saf!
if u think about it NOBODY has seen the video all the way through yet
....
Welp. Guess I'm not going to bed like I thought now 😅
i never clicked on a video so fast.
I love you saf
Hehe here before 1 million views 😊☺
i click on this  vid:OoOoooO new vid    the vids to click on: safiya nygaard      my brain: ok time for some throw back vids
It has honwstly been a while since I've watched a video right after it's been posted. Bless
Wow first time being soo early
I WISH I could afford to buy my Instagram shop tab!
13 min ago
It's the early gang hereeeee
Hello friends!
Is Sophia here
Never Clicked SO FAST 🔥
safiya!!! <3
Me:Oh only, 22 seconds ago! I’m really early! Comments/Views: BAHAHAH, no.
Literally was catching up on her videos and she posted during one I was watching... pleasantly surprised
this called me poor in every way and form possible
I like you and your videos but you have to stop upspeaking. It’s hard to listen to for the lengths of your videos.
Worth waiting.
Assalamu alaikum sister!
It is so late
i love that i can tell how long ago this was filmed by the fact that there is still a fairy light backdrop so it was before they moved..... LOL
yaaaayyy another video finallyyyyy😭😭💓💓💓
Yayyyyyyy
The intro is back
Me, who goes to William and Mary, whenever Safiya mentions the possibility of coming to Colonial Williamsburg: 👁👄👁 🥰
Hi!!!!!!!! Oh My God!!!!! I am so earlyyyyyyyyyyy. I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS!
OMG SAFIYA’S LOCK SCREEN IS TYLER
Yaaaay finally! Missed u saf 🥺❤️
I clicked so fast, this election being so close is killing me. Thanks for letting me breath for a moment 💙
Hi I love your content, me and my friend watch you together, and I've never been this early before
Early I guess
IM EARLYYYY     Well no actually I'm lat-
12 minutes ago!!!!
i've actually made it a competition to see if saf or cristine uploads a new video first.   i guess we know who won...
A wonderful 1 am video!
Who would watch 38 minutes long video? Me: I would.
The next video:  Buying the same outfit but from different brands ( Amazon, Wish, Facebook, Instagram...) See who has the best one 🤷‍♀️  Edit: Btw Safiya what happened to your merch store?

SAF I MISSED YOU
hey you...yea you... hope you’re having a wonderful day!
Early for the second time!!!!!!
Oh how i missed that intro🥺🤣💙
Whenever I see Instagram models working out, I am inspired to do my own workout.  Unfortunately it’s only for my left arm.
Early! Love your vids
Holy f***, I love her. 😂
Ooooo yayayayay
Dammit I was ready to sleep Safiya
˚✧₊⁎❝᷀ົཽ≀ˍ̮ ❝᷀ົཽ⁎⁺˳✧༚
Your videos seriously make my days so much better <3 <3
pov: you havent watched the full video yet
Yay i love your videos!
love the content so much, saf ❤️❤️
Seeing all the updates she puts on her Instagram story has made me appreciate safs videos so much more. Thank you for all the work you put in! It’s so worth it !
didn't you already do this I'm glad that your posting thought
Can we talk about the fact that Saf’s explore page is full of Twice
I LOVE PUNKRAVE! THEY ARE AMAIZNG!
ekkkk i miss ur vids😍❤❤💕
I've been summoned but 11 mins late🤣💙💙💙
IM SO GLAD YOU POSTED  you bareley ever post!
Hello u are so cool please keep doing things like this 😁😁
Why there are lots of kpop stuff on your explore tab saf 😂😂😂
OMG SAFIYA HAS A NEW VIDEO SJSKSKSHJSHSK
omg i’m early
Safiya is such a kpop girl group stan hahahaha
safiyas a once?? I was just looking at chaeyeong and nayeon when she showed the shop tab
35k views 10 mins after posting... yup seems accurate!
Yessssss 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
BDZ ON HER EXPLORE PAGE AS IT SHOULD(OMG AND DTNA AND A MINA AD) 😭😭
Omg! Finally a bit early!
Anyone gonna talk about her wallpaper.......no ok then
i never realized how much i missed saf's videos :(( luv u safiya, ur such an inspiration :))
it’s so weird to hear her talk about Virginia as a Virginian. I always forget that people don’t visit colonial Williamsburg on the regular and that it’s an actual trip for some people
Well this is totally unexpected but such a pleasant surprise lol  I saw your insta  stories about the editing and export and was like "oooohhhh yeah... video tomorrow!!!"  Then I saw the pop up notification and I jumped right over here to come watch it.  Also,, is anyone else just noticing the shop tab on Instagram because of this?? Lol had no idea it existed
Fun fact: everyone who is watching the video right now hasn’t watched the whole video yet
May I just say that I'm REALLY enjoying the new content! I think you've come back from your break better than ever, and I'm so glad you and Tyler were able to take some time for yourselves (:
YEEE SAFIYA 💕🖤💕
Can someone explain to me how honey is making money? Because there must be a ton of data mining associated with a program that looks at what you’re buying and they’re running a ton of ads and sponsorships. Feels iffy to me?
4:55 okay but that orange outfit looks like literally the most comfy outfit alive and I need it 🤤😫
I’m a hoe
i was so early, SO early, and then i watched half of the video and realized i didnt comment. Fml. Love you tho Safiya im ur biggest fan✋🏼😔
took a break from my crocheting to watch this 👀👄👀
i would love to see a ‘i lived like a woman of the 18th century for a day’ filmed at colonial williamsburg!! i love historical fashion! you could ask abbey cox, she used to work there and does sewing and historic fashion youtube videos!
You look like Ready To Glare in the pink wig
I just LOVE Saf's long hair. ❤
I SAW ON IG SHE POSTED AND CAME RUNNING
the intro song ✨ 👌 ✨
Just checked your story and I saw that you will upload in 10mins and I immediately go to YT to see my norif of ur channel! Whoaaaaa excited much!
We just gonna ignore the fact that Safiya is a kpop stan? Right.   One more thing I have in common with Safiya!!
I love the speed that you deliver your videos as a person with auditory processing problems!
Hey VA shout out only 1 hour from Williamsburg
Drops a video at midnight.  Me: ok
Posted 10 minutes ago and already has 6.5k likes
Timestamp from when i clicked out of this video 7:07
Why post at 12:00 am in nyc (;´༎ຶٹ༎ຶ`)
Saf, if you’re alive, like this comment.   Just making sure
Anyone else notice twice at the beginning 😭😌💅qweens 0:41
I see a vid from Saf, I click.
I absolutely love this!!! I even came in after 1min! I've never been this early!  Saf, I wish I was as adventurous as you in my fashion choices. 😅
HEY, SAFIYA........ *You uploaded this when it is 11 P.M. where I am and I have insomnia sooo.....*
Its the twice for me 😂
Pausing the video to head to ig shop lol.
I'm so excited you're posting again!!
I love the intro song. I stan whoever sung it.
Safiya is truly my favorite youtuber. I get so happy when she drops
It’s 11:10 for me but I couldn’t resist watching! Love Ya!! 🥰
woah  hello there early club
Good, I was hoping you didn't gloss right past the Twice posts on your Instagram
Oh you should totally go for those ears from aloha ears. I own some and they're comfy and lightweight.
Safiya: Talking about how bad she is at roller skating Me: Once I wen't roller skating with the school my mom worked at and a woman tripped on me, hurt her ankle, blamed it on me and now hates me...       I was like five.
PLEASE DO DRESSING LIKE BRITNEY SPEARS FOR A WEEK YOU WOULD KILLLLL THAT LOOK LIL MAMA
“Mark Zuckerburg is trying to kill me” 😂😂
I had a god awful day. I needed this so much I almost burst into tears. 🖤🖤🖤
I've never been this early to a Safiya video lmao
it's the twice on the explore page for me WJSNJS 👑👑
love ya sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much Safiya! you make my day!!!
early!
Ohmahgash yaaassss
CAN YOU PLEASE RECREATE SEO YEJI’S (KO MUN YEONG) OUTFITS FROM THE KDRAMA “IT’S OKAY NOT TO BE OKAY”?
Me: clicks right when I get the notification so I get to the comment section early, guaranteeing many likes on my comment  Also me: leaves for a sec and there are already +1k comments
Safiya making everyone's day by uploading😊
Wtf it's only been 10 minutes and there's already 16 dislikes i- HOW!!?
Nobody:  Saf: LET ME CHURN THY BUTTER!!
SAF you need to play among us with Tyler and friends
safiya please make a video going to colonial williamsburg it would make you so happy
I never am awake when you upload videos I feel blessed as the 2020 election ravages my anxiety
Yes just yes
Who’s chilling at one am
i love how she has twice on her explore page
10 MINUTES AGOOOOOOOOO LETS GOOOOOOOOO
I think your fashion vibes overlap a fair bit with the roller derby scene so maybe that's why you were getting skate suggestions
Kinda miffed she said crevice and not *C R E V A H SE*
Its 5am... I shall not sleep until I have watched this video..!!!
Thank you for this! Needed the distraction
safyia drinking game: take a shot every time she mentions colonial williamsburg
Oh how I've missed this series
This is fun
Tyler’s face on Safiya’s phone wallpaper 😂
Hi 🌻🌻🌻✨✨✨✨❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love that Saf’s phone background is an unflattering up close selfie Tyler took, I’m betting when Saf left her phone unattended. Which is exactly what my phone background is, dumb ugly selfie my man took when I wasn’t looking. He even set the background himself.   If this isn’t what the kids mean by relatable content....
You’re so fun to watch!
pink
Imagine Sofia only wearing Colonial clothing for a day 👀😂
Dammit i thought i was first! Anyways Hello Friends
Claim your "here before a million views"
Instagram is so different now there r so many updated 😐😐😐😐...........
Aaaaahhhh yay this just made my whole day better 😁
I love you I are my idol and I want to be like you when I grow up ♥️
👽🖤👽🖤👽🖤👽
her voice is literally my favorite thing in the entire world. it makes me feel safe and warm for some reason.
7 minutes in and 5 haters already on some chick reviewing something so innocent living her own life

Sup. Also omg I am so happy you posted
Hi

I love that she always posts late at night. Just got off work and was so happy when i saw the notification
0:38 Is the Chaeyoung and Nayeon i see👀👀
Next video: Safiya dresses to match American Girl Dolls for a week.
Me: Ill get on YouTube by I’m bored  Brain: You legit watched all the channels you are subscribed to’s videos less than an hour ago there’s nothing new  Me: eh  *gets on*   Me: YUSSSS SAFIYA POSTED
MISSED THIS INTRO
I thought I clicked to your old video because of your intro 😂
Can you do anything acnh related
Hehe, we say, speed ❤️✨
I can't tell you how I was so ready for her to post a new vid, Im so bored rn lmao
Hiiii I love your content I’m kinda new and I watched your getting married video! It was so amazing! This was too! I love the song you guys bought 😂
I’m actually early
I’ve never been this early, I missed you!!
LOVE YOU SAF!!!
SAF IS A ONCE?? YALL KNOW YOU SAW CHAE AN NAYEON ON HER EXPLORE PAGE
HELLO!! I AM SO EXCITED 😆
EDIT: as of 11/13/2020, it looks like instagram has actually put even more emphasis on the shop tab in their newest app update by placing it on the bottom bar of the app, just to the right of the "reels" tab! So, it looks like it's here to stay - and if you're looking for your shop tab, check the bottom bar! xoxo, saf  HELLO FRIENDS!! here is a quite lengthy deep dive into the shop tab that i had a really fun time filming - i feel like i'm lowkey exposing myself & my instagram habits in this video, but that's ok 😂let me know what's on your shop tab in the comments below! xoxo, saf
My fingers go zoomy zoomy
I'm early
okay but safiya with pink hair, *PINK HAIR*

I love it when saf posts, it makes me so happy
This is the earliest I’ve been
Before a mil views gang?
Imagine commenting before even finishing the video? Couldn't be me-
You know it's gonna be good when you hear that intro
How has she not been sponsored by Disney
I was only 8 minutes late & already 1.8k comments 😭🤣

Me: *about to fall asleep* Saafyia: *uploads video* Me: guess not 🤷🏻‍♀️
0:40 I see I’m not the only one that has been binging K content in quarantine 👀
Imma fight the 9 dislikes. How can they dislike the video when it hasn’t been up long enough for them to finish the video 😒
Please do a Frankenhandsoap! PLEASE
Thank you so much for a new video, Saf! 5 stars!! I love your ad/algorithm videos! 👏🏼
I’m 5 minutes late

Uploaded this video 3 minutes ago and already 6 dislikes ?? How are you already disliking the video?? No way you even watched it...haters 🙄
You gotta get into acting
Fun fact: usually the person who is actually first doesn't comment "first"
I saw the whole IGTV thing and the shop tab but I never even cared a little bit lol. I always wondered who cared. Appearantly nobody.

❤❤Saf bb we love you. Please don't feel rushed to get videos out. Put your mental health first please. We will still be here whenever you come back. And if I've got your attention here, could you please leave up any text or notes up just a few seconds longer? Sometimes its really hard to pause at the right time to read them. Its just a small request but I 100% understand if you can't. Please and thank you for everything you do Saf. Please take care of yourself. ❤❤
I should be sleeping ‘cause here in Brazil is 02:10 am, but Safiya’s new video is way more interesting then a couple minutes more of sleep.
Thanks for the distraction from the election 💕

notification gang!!!
New Saf video Notification  Me: Clicks immediately
yayyy update!! ilysmmm
I just realized I’m sitting here, eating a meal I ordered from GrubHub but couldn’t afford to tip over 10% for, in a college dorm, trying to figure out how to afford a replacement mirror for my car and gas to get home for Thanksgiving. I’m not looking for pity, I come from an upper middle class family, but dad is being a jerk lately so we are struggling, but not much. So seriously I just happened to have this realization of how I’m like an adult who can’t afford anything suddenly. It actually is kind of not all bad to realize. Until my dad reminds me he can’t pay for therapy anymore. Ahhhh.
Oh my god, your cat looks like mine! They bothe chubby   🐱
HOORAY!!!
YESSS NEW UPLOAD

The fact that Safiya finds the numerous Black outfits to slay all day!
last time i was this early, saf was making franken-lipsticks
My Lord gave me a beautiful voice, so I used him to recite the Qur’an, but I cannot find anyone to support me. Is there anyone who supports the people of the Qur’an? May God reward you with the best reward   🌴🌴🌴🌴🌴❤️❤️🌴❤️🌴❤️🌴❤️

You should get tested for your Kibbe body type and then pick out outfits based on what his system says would be best for your body type. Tiffanyferg did a great video about this topic if you want to learn more!
