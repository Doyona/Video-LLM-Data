Lucky he is not from Columbia.
Johnny Placide would not make this mistake I don’t know why they don’t play him that day 😡
Lets go haiti 0:07
qui a gagner
you mean football
"It's a little bit awkward how that goes into the back of the net," is the understatement of the year.
He is a Canadian lol
Poor haiti, first the clintons kidnap and kill their young children and now this.
duverger (the goalie for haiti) was actually born and raised in canada lol
ConShitaf
Claus Reitmaier 2.0
oh wow.  that's just brutal
To be completely honest, yes it’s the goalkeeper’s fault, but as a defender you learn at a very young age to never back pass to goal. It’s a mistake by the defender to begin with, followed then by another mistake
Not that it changes much but boy is it a good thing that there wasnt a full stadium that day.   Everyone would have exploded in laughter.
"First touch isn't great..."  First touch - Nutmegs himself
I'm here after Hutchinson's backheaded goal
Give that golie, the Canadian resident card he deserves it
Worst keeper of all time
NUUUUUUUL

Hahahahahahahahah
八百長的なご依頼で　わざと？
Stupidest way of letting a goal in!
noone should have to experience that :(
I love how most people blame the keeper.  Most soccer academies train their players to not shoot on their own net.  Passing back to a keeper should always be done by sending the ball to one side of the net or the other; not directly at it.  Blame the keeper... I think not.  I blame the player that passed back to the keeper.
Everything going wrong for them this year Earthquake. They kill the president Deportation They got kicked out of Brazil Mexico don't want them Dominican Republic close to border on them Now the United States is not going to help them because of the kidnapping And the list goes on
As a Canadian soccer fan, this only happens to Canada.  HAHAHA!
八百長？
I played both keeper and sweeper on our University team.  As a keeper I made a tremendous save, had dived and stopped a one on one shot, had the ball in my hands against the ground, squeezed down and it went into the net.   All the comments were about the keeper, no question it was a huge "mistake" from the Canadian/Haitian keeper.  But nobody mentioned the idiotic pass back from the defender.  He wasn't pressured, the keeper was on the side waiting for a safe pass away from the goal, and he puts it right on net.  What was he thinking? You always play it outside around the goal.
This reminds me of the hella embarrassing goal Nuer allowed in his earlier days before BM. He kicked the ball straight to a guy on the other team (goal kick) and the guy easily chipped Neur. You could see his ears were red and he was shook up.
Poor guy. He should look at the bright side though. Kids will see this and realize not even the professionals are perfect so it’s okay for them to fail as well, as long as they pick themselves up. This keeper can’t have a tantrum and storm off of the field or yell “that doesn’t count.” You pick yourself up. That’s what kids need to see.
Xd
Did he forget he could use his hands
thats a huge goalie mistake but also the reason why defenders learn never to pass directly towards the goal but beside it, which this one didnt.
No worries m8. just keep a stiff upper lip.
Jeffrey Julmis at it again. Lol
this is exactly the reason keepers never want a back pass that's heading for the goal, no matter how slowly it's moving. look where he was standing before la franz hit the pass. duverger was to the side of the goal where he wanted the ball, and the pass was to the middle of the goal.
Horror
Now i know who insipire the EA Sports
ゴールマウス外してバックパスしないからだ
First time ever a Youtube title undersells the video.  That was the BEST own goal ever.

Que triste contraste aquí los haitianos juegan al fútbol y respetan al rival, no hay entradas rudas y violentas en donde se ve que no van a lástimar al rival, menos los envían a éstos al hospital Y cuando van contra México, son un equipo con actitud muy negativa, "juegan"(?) mostrando todas esas mañas que guardan desde tiempo atrás, en éste "torneo"(?) de muy baja calidad deportiva demuestran toda la violencia que hay contra nuestra selección de fútbol Y si nos ganan (debes en cuando) hasta parece que ganaron "el mejor partido de toda su vida" pero con todo, menos jugando al fútbol E igual, árbitros que van "todo contra México" Espero que todos esos equipos que están en este torneo(?) jueguen verdaderamente al fútbol!!
It feels like he did it on purpose
This used to do while playing games in PC but now its is even in real
🤣 🤣🤣 🤣🤣🤣 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 🤣 🤣🤣 🤣🤣 🤣🤣🤣🤣 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Gol yg sngt fenomenal
Tu mérite pas de  jouer o foot
RIP Career
Rip career
That's brutal. That goalie gonna have PTSD
Does anyone know if this goalie he’s gay ??? Well he’s gay to me 👎🏾
That was intentional
I felt that as i was a goalkeeper to
Ou pa wont????? 🇭🇹🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Haiti voodoo is working
aw man you’ve got to feel like an absolute muppet
If your girl still with you after that trust me she’s the one
Who let that bozo be a goalkeeper??? 🤪
He shoulda gone to specsavers😂😂😂😂
tiene que asepta
Jonathan David being of Haiti descent was just excited that he choose the right team
Worst own goal ever.. Dubavka hold my gloves
Fuck mee, this will haunt him for the rest of his life. I feel for this guy
This was his last game for Haiti
It's painful the first time.  And then they play it over, and over, and over, and over again, from every conceivable angle.  Ouch.
I did that one time in 7th grade PE. I still remember the embarrassment, and I'm 45 now.
Dubravka og is better
Trudeau threatened the keeper with revoking the citizenship if he didn't let Canada win
Omg
"You Haiti see it..." I see what you did there ;-)
Took his eye off the ball before trying to pass it...cardinal sin.
You Hai-ti see that happen
Wait, my country qualified in football? As a Quebecer, I'm experiencing opposed feelings at the same time...
Dubravka just one upped this.
Karius : noone is worse than me.  Duverger : Hold my beer
I feel sorry for the goalkeeper
That's gonna be stuck in my brain for a good 10 years....
Shit happens, but the problem is that the world of social media will never see that misstake, instead they feed it to burn even more and at the end it will make him embarrassed for rest of his life because of bunch of motherfucking people trying to make fun of him!
They need to drug test that goalkeeper, he looks stoned
Kids... That's why when you pass it back to the keeper, you don't put it on target.  Having said that... That is laughable
If this is Canada's level of competition, we'll NEVER qualify for the World Cup
I love how almost the entire comment section is supportive & telling the Goalkeeper to move on instead of mocking him.  That's great sport right here
That what happens, when you drink cola instead of water
SMH this man had no business of being a goalkeeper you don’t make this kind of mistake when playing professional. He was so careless and negligent to catch the ball with his damm hands how hard was that???? He must got paid by the Canadians for that goal!
I vividly remember Thierry Henry pulling this exact same trick for Arsenal in a match against Everton back in 2005, but no-one laughed at him?
FOOT LAG
What a dumb ass! It’s ok though, soccer isn’t a sport so it doesn’t matter!
He was voodooed
0:28 like Eustaquio 7 putting a little salt there.
100k $ cash
Fifa Scripting.
Trapp in finale di Champions League ha fatto molto di peggio....
He have new job in mcdonalds now
Right foot: I'm gonna kick this ball now! Left foot: Nope!
$5k to each Haitian player to let Canada won
The goalkeeper is supposed to keep the ball out of the goal instead of. Scoring on the goal 🤯
Mm mm mm
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
How much did the Canadians pay the goalkeeper for doing it not once but twice. This is clearly THE WORST in history of football.
The goalie picked the wrong day to get drunk.   🍺🍸🍷  oh I thought the game was supposed be next week ah I'll be fine 🤷🏿‍♂️
Tiktok bring me here
“Doing a solid to his country” 😂😂😂
Ouch! Poor lad.
I think they won't call him next time for the national team lol
$$$$ money..
Impossible to miss that kick, soccer players on any level can relate and that’s all I’m gonna say!!!
😆😅😂😅🤣😂
どんだけヘタクソなんだよｗｗｗ。手でとりゃーよかったんだよな。
He got payid
I’m sure Real Madrid will sign him. Outstanding work
The Goalkeeper messed up, but the origin of problem was what the defender made...don't they teach them that "If you pass the ball to your Goalkeeper, you should always aim away from the goal frame" ?...that's ABC football
Sak Pase!!!
酒飲んでるんじゃね。ｗｗ
What a magnificent dork 😅😅😅...
Looks like he got payed off
I don’t believe it he did that on purpose no way does this guy even have a Haitian citizenship?
Must be on the payroll
Canada should goal own self too.. So Its fair
What the hell?
Check his bank account a few years later, he was bought off🤣🤣
Professional footie for you!
Fake.......how much money received the entire team?
Si Messi marro un penal en una final de copa América . A este muchacho no hay nada q recriminarle
"We're gonna need you to throw this game, but make it look believable." "Okay no problem."
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
You know that killed the whole dynamic positive energy the Caribbeans had throughout the qualifiers...sucks first T&T now this disappoinment 😒😲
Football blooper
How much did he get paid?
If this keeps up Canada will win the world Cup!
Basic soccer,  defense men never return the ball to the goalie's end zone..   pass the ball back on the sides,  this is why coaches know this error can happen and it did in this game and it is a sad day for the Goalie and his nation.  If you do not know the basics of soccer, you do not belong at this level of tournment.
Check his bank account....
I’d check the goalies bank account after that game. He might be the one laughing now.
When you bet: All in Canada..
Golazoooooo!!!!
Can't imagine what would happen if he is in an south America national team
Kalan bé la à besoin entré nan histoire li entre kanmen avek Kaka a li fe a

He did that intentionally 😂 so obvious

He ain't gonna sleep tonight...he ain't sleep for the next week....omg
Chiquito flores : "al fin un digno rival"
I don't watch soccer often but did the Canadian Team really all Hi 5 and huddle with each other over that? I know they never win at these things but this is just something you pettily walk away from, even your team sucks.
Malísimo una vergüenza para su pais
This is Johnny Placide's replacement?
Lol
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 Yoooooo
Bruh. No way this is not scripted LOL
The entire game would have been played completely differently from that point onwards if that play would have ended, ahem, ‘differently’. The final score could have been 4-0 for Haiti.
Awesome......
Spreadbetting ex Canadian goalkeeper, wins himself big money on the time of the first goal?
Fucking can't believe.
Thats some sorcery famm wow two chances to stop the ball
일부러 그랬지??
Him born in canada.
Looks a lot like a bit in my favourite movie of all time. Mike Bassett: England Manager! Brilliant!
#skils
Was eating breakfast watching some news on the euros when this just popped on. No warning, almost choked on my cereal lol
:D Holy shit... I have never seens something like this... yes that first touch - many have done that, but the end was a nightmare. :D
Haiti best country in the world XDDDDDDDD
I wonder how much richer the goalie is now that he cashed in his "will there be an own goal" proposition bet.  He should be investigated.
Fixed
How much money does he take?
Guess someone must of had money on the game
soccer is so fake ,, would never watch it,,, of course he let it in
I just feel bad for the guy.
Canada - he is one of us!
Putting Canada on the Map for all the wrong reasons!

His pockets will be full as fuck tomorrow xD
Match fixing for sure, he failed to stop that ball three times. A third-class goalkeeper would not make such a mistakes.
I swear this looks staged. First, looks sooooo avoidable, almost likes he does it purposely. Then the way he face palms, it’s like a normal person would be embarrassed and distract the focus from them, they’d want to crawl into a hole and die. Yet this guy exaggerates his theatrics, almost like he’s doing it for attention purposes.

just a mistake. It happens, dont get too overwhelmed by it keeper! Short memory ~~
Hope he got paid well for his match fixing
Nou vann match la pou kob
I wonder how much money he got!!
And the meme of the year goes to!!!! 🤣😅 poor guy, probably was nervous or day dreaming about what could have been if he played for Canada instead, next thing you know he is like "oh shit"
😂😂😂😂 he is fired
That keeper was probably drunk for god sakes
0:30 Eustaquio telling Duverger, "Merci mon frerot." #diplomacy
pog
Vudú time
On the plus side, great stepover?
Canadian born gola keeper ?
So the goalie was born and grew up in Canada? That sounds like a major conflict of interest.
You forgiven my brother. You're a great goalkeeper and that's how you get this far. Stay confident and learn from your mistakes. That's all.
Imagine being a keeper from Haiti watching this , I cant even find it funny no more
bruh

That defender destroyed the goalkeeper's career and reputation i feel bad for him
The grass was shit be honest near the goal keeper 🍃🌳
He was born in Canada,I think the Canadian coach should call him next time,we don’t want him anymore
The goalkeeper just scored for his country of birth nothing wrong with that
So a Canadian born playing for other team scores own goal. Okay I see
Dammit, hasn't Haiti suffered enough? 🤦🏾‍♂️
Looks intentional, I think he have make a bet anywhere.
And that said; Haiti needed to score at the other end. They didn’t.
Yeah sadly, there may allegations of fixing; but the second failed attempt suggests the GK is just bad with the ball at his feet. Many GKs have had this awkward across the body back pass and messed up the clearance.
Money is a he'll of a drug
Typical football from North America
Footstep's Falco's long lost cousin
If this Happened in the euros 😳😳😳
Someone needs to check on that man. He's not going to be okay for a long while 😂
I hate seeing that. I feel REALLY sorry for him and the Haitian team, but he was pressured near the goal line and that caused him to take his eyes of the ball.
Excuse me but what is soccer?
Koman ou ye gardien de but dhaiti hahah what a stupid mistake lmaooo
What was the end score, did this affect the team?
Ow no baby give him another chance
He was thinking about the pay from Concacaf presidente which is canidian
Who won this game?
Lol man did dat on purpose 😂
His reaction looks sus...
El primer error es del defensor: el pase atrás NUNCA se da hacia adentro del arco, siempre de los palos hacia afuera!!
Poor Keeper, can't unremember that!!
Need to investigate it looks fixed
Красава))
🤣🤣🤣

Talk about Freudian slip:).
Dude is seriously on the take $$$$$$$
Expect to see this in MANY a goalkeeper error video for years to come.
I am going to be kind and say the match was fixed or at least i hope so....
courage keeper I am with you, I want you to post leverton #8 🇭🇹 who killed canadians in the middle it is positive you will not post his ( ban nan gèt manman nou )
That’s fraud. It should be investigated
This is soooo cringe
Shit happens
I'm from Mexico and I can only say that not even in the 2008 game between Mexico vs Haiti with Placide and the only Haitian in the area did this happen
It's technically Lafrance who scored an own goal
Haiti will gladly pick a player from other countries that got cut Bc they not talented or good enough but will make Haitians that are born in Haiti suffer ask them lots of money for a tryout not surprised  Ik and see Haitians that are very talented just sit and watch their talent wasted Bc they never got the opportunity it’s none new this Haitian team should b name  francanatians 😂lots of French players mixed with Canada
Americans 😂
I'm just waiting for FIFA to ban that goalie for life for match fixing. He did on purpose and it's pretty clear that he wanted to make Haiti to lose. That's why football in north America will never be on top 5 best sports due to this type of nonsense.
Lo que hace el dinero, vender tu patria🤢🤢🤮
The Haitian goalkeeper is Canadian 😂. He was born in Canada.
And i thought Scottish Goalkeepers were shite.
Pobre guebon tenía la cabeza en dónde? Increíble
Who saw the last Canadian player looking at the keeper.  Saying in his mind to the keeper what a mess by you.
This only happens in America or Canada  U wont see this shit in Europe
Hahahhahahaahahahahahahahahgahahhahahahaahahaagahagaga he’s shit
Haha.bookies
Y dónde estaba PLACIDE el mejor portero del mundo?
On the plus side, the mistake didn't make any difference. Haiti needed 2 goals and didn't manage 1, didn't matter how many Canada ended up scoring.
Give him his pay check 50 k easy money what a joke
They got paid FOR SURE look at the reaction of the keeper 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ese negro lo que está buscando es que le den la visa en Canadá.

Match fixing
Showing his Canadian roots
Los de concacaf son corruptos por eso a la fase final llegan los mismos de siempre y clasifican los mismo de siempre y prueba de ello ese gol
No wonder yanks don't like football if that's the commentary. At least he said nil.
Betsson, Bet365, Unibet....how much did he earn on this??
He should’ve just picked it up and taken the indirect free
We were sleeping with the enemy. He was a spy for Canada! :(
Por eso mexico es el campeón,. Jjjajaajaj
match fixing... You can see him delaying, so he can step over the ball.  Next he makes an effort not to kick it.
That guy might as well pack up his bags and retire.  What really takes the cake is that he is Canadian.  Thanks for the laugh.  I used to be a keeper, it's sad to laugh about something like that, but I almost pissed my pants.  Poor bastard.
Oof
I don't believe this one bit, should investigate this keeper for match fixing.
The fact that the entire Canadian Team hugged and celebrated is even more embarrassing!
Como dueles concacaf, ya veo suspendido al equipo de Haití. Tenia q ser el presidente de la concacaf
Video titles can often exaggerate things,  but that is a legitimate contender for worst own goal of all-time
That's incredible.  You couldn't do that again if you tried.   Poor kid.
that's me when I am having a bad day
I feel for that guy…. Worst feeling ever
People always say How the hell does this even happen? Well, the pressure of playing an important game and in his situation watching the opponent behind him. It is a horrible mistake but he doesn't deserve all the negativity. Try to give the guy some support.
Never pass a ball in the direction of your own goal. Goalies can’t be trusted to block a pass in front of the goal. It happens to every goalie at least once.
Nooooooo

I believe it is because of what is happening in Haiti that brings too much stress to Haitian footballers that causes Haitian players to be discouraged so I will not judge the goalkeeper because what is happening in Haiti can cause them to be stressed😰🇭🇹✊
Lmaooo 😅👌
I still don't get how is this an own goal. Did the goalkeeper even touch the ball? Is there a good camera angle that proves that this was an own goal?
😕😕😕 Poor guy
I think after suffering through that as a goalie, I would've walked down from the pitch, right to the bus stop, onto the first bus that comes that way and be never heard of ever again.
I sat down for 10sec to think about the most foolish mistakes I have done but couldn't found any compared to this...

Let’s not forget it happened to Canada twice before against French Guiana 🇬🇫 and surprisingly Haiti 🇭🇹 (the one where they were winning 0-2 before Haiti came back to win 3-2) but damn this must’ve been dreadful as Haiti missed out on the octagonal
As a coach of over 25 years I have ALWAYS told my players NEVER to direct a pass back to the GK with a trajectory directly towards goal. Err, this is why. IMHO the defender is also to blame.
That is match fixing. Investigate him.
Kote jhony plasid
Gareth needs to hold back on the criticisms and "embarassments" especially with an own goal, the Canadian players reaction was extremely muted considering how big it was because everyone has been there and knows how hard it is on a keeper.

Everyone knows about that and you know that the goalkeeper of the Haitian section has dual nationality, he was born in Canada and he sold it and take a good look.
Money money
Nice goal, love it🏖️💯👍🗺️😘🍀🎁come friends today and always 💯👍🗺️
Im all in on this guy now, i mean the next save he made was pretty great, i hope he has a worldy against brazil or something one day.
This was so ridiculous. Match fixing investigation is a must here.
@telefoot
Clearly sus
Goalkeeper must moved to Canada
Since he is Canadian, does that make this a different kind of Freudian slip?
The only explanation for an own goal THAT BAD....bet365 And you know it!
His real nationally was Canadian lol
Obviously the goalies fault but defenders too cuz u never pass it back to the goalkeeper in direction of the goal
Está más arreglado que auto de mecánico 🕵️
No eso no puede ser, ese arquero se vendio
This guy kept Haiti in the game the entire first half and makes a huge mistake. No need to ridicule him like this OneSoccer. Have some class.
That goalkeeper was bought, no matter how bad he was, he had at least three chances to get the ball out and all he did was push the ball in a very clumsy and unconvincing way. Even his reaction when the ball goes in doesn't feel real. There must be a FIFA investigation into possible match fixing.
The irony of ironies:  In Gold Cup 2019, Goalkeeper Borjan makes a blunder for Canada that allows Haiti to defeat Canada.  Today, Goalkeeper Duverger makes a blunder for Haiti that allows Canada to defeat Haiti.
It's the worst Haitian team I never seen in my life..
His footwork is terrible so they made him play keeper.
hahahahahhaa
Haiti gen poul al nan koup di mond wi genle se le jezi vini sa map gade la yo poko jwè pou jwe koup di monde
What the hell is that 😅😢
Who has not ever been betrayed by nerves? we are humans 🙌🙏
#OBEAH
Los rivales de México 🤣
Oops granny voodoo the wrong team 😭
Gyèt manman w  vòlè
He got paid to do that. I dont care. That was intentional !!
Gadon kaka...
it was bad luck. his left foot hit the ball and his right foot mis kicked it,
Lè devèn nan boudaw let kayé kasé tèt ou
This is soccer shit happened it's hurt cuz I'm 🇭🇹 but keep your head up we still love you Zoe life
Fixed match
Merci pote!!!...nous a offert le but!!!👏🏿👏🏿🇨🇦
Despue ese gol desconsentra los jugadores haitiano el primer baron después la segunda mitad
I think the keeper was a secret agent for Canada🤣🤣
Viva Haiti 🇭🇹 ♥
Well..there goes all the hilarious women's football lowlights videos. This beats them all. Thanks Duverger 😒
Payback for Borjan's gaff vs Haiti in the Gold Cup
Professionalism at its finest with that emoji in the video title.
This is 1000% match fixing!!!
Josue Diverge es canadiense haitiano Jonathan David es canadiense haitiano que puede pensar en este acto tan complicada ??😂
Looked a little fishy
Gadyen sa pa bon du tou mnn .pks yo pat mete lot gadyen .anpil blan fe sou ayisyèn Li pa Bali yo blan pap kont parey yo vre mnn.
Increíble 🤭
He was born in Montreal lol. I've knew what he was doing 🤣.
Not his fault but I wasn’t expecting Haïti to go far after what is going on at home
Canadians celebrating 🤣🤣🤣
That's an understatement.
Wow what a nightmare 😳
no te mueras nunca CONCACAF LOL
Thats a dans it
X,,D hahaha lol error 🤣🤣😂😂
Stepped outside to grab dinner, and when I saw it was an own goal by the goalie I thought it hit the post and bounced in off him... definitely did not expect this...
Bruh is this a joke
Kalanbè gadyen sa kote yo jwn avèl
Esto no es un error humano, no jodas. Disimulen por lo menos.
reminded me of Karius lol
Not surprised because He's Canadian playing for Haiti He's born in Quebec by Haitian parents . Seriously loll
esto se llama apuestas y equipo vendido, a ese equipo se le tiene que investigar y sancionar con no jugar mas se ve muy evidente la intencion de hacer eso.
Where's Placide?
A ese lo nacionalisan canadiense es que de una vez
Kanmenm Haiti kalifye puw al jwe ligue des champions 2021/2022 felicitations ti mesye 😂😂😂
That’s corruption right there guys, how much did he get paid😡. I hate to say it but concacaf is buying Canada’s World Cup ticket, there have been so many concacaf teams that let their team down Bc they get paid just to lose. (Guatemala, El Salvador etc)
Funny thing is he was born in Canada...
Now I don't think Hummels's own goal for Euro is bad
Strong Country ,Strong Team that’s it ,Canada 🏆🙏
He sold
😂😂😂😂😂😂😃😃😃
Kot ayiti sot ap mange kk sa hummmm
Keep your head up and move on mistakes happen.
Ahhhh mon che ki bagaille ca wap fe la tchuipsss🤦🏾‍♂️
Honestly that’s horrific. The ball wasn’t swerving or moving anywhere else but straight and he still missed it
Nah this is so bad it should be a crime
should be fipping burgers at burger king real idiot
Kotel soti
Esto no hubiera pasado con PLACIDEEEEEE
Ojalá el portero supere rápido el error y le ayude a trabajar más fuerte y luego vendrán los mejores momentos.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
What a GOLAZOOOOO😱😱
yikes
Increíble
I'm Haitian, but it's for the first time I've laughed at something that is hurt.
It was on purpose
Jajajaja que chistoso  jajaja
Chawony
Canadian citizenship guaranteed😂
You can tell especially on that last goal that the defense just sort of gave up on him. Having been a keeper myself, it's hard to know how much weight you carry on your shoulders when it comes to these things. I do feel bad, but on the other hand love to see a Canada win lol
I don't feel sorry. Who felt sorry for us? #81
He’s only 21, still young a lot to grow
I saw there was an own goal, but really wasn't imagining THIS.
Looks like he ain't getting called up ever again
He sucks as goalie
Gyèt manman kk chen an... PJJ pi kaka ankò li pran yon Canadian kk met Anba kan pou bay ekip la gòl. Malpwòpte a pral chofe Canada nan mondial la wi🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Haiti ......
Ou wè de kk mesye
Soccer?
He's an dog
Med pou kk sa tchipppsss
POG
They paid him to do that
Misye merite lanmò wi
M pa t ap rive n’a eta kaka gadyen sa
academy award for best comedy act
CONCACAF....NO TE ACABES NUNCA CONCACAF
Thsts deliberate
This is the current status of concacaf. I prefer Mexico usa and canada play on conmebol copa america.
Haiti's goalie is Canadian. That's the cherry on top!
Oh i'm not happy for this focking goal about my country oh i don't like it fuck you goal Keeper
Lol damn
Damn, as a goalkeeper that's my worst nightmare. He really is gonna not sleep for a while that's something that breaks a keeper mentally man. Hope he pulls through
One of the worst own goal in football history *
Oso del año 2021
Well he actually did something good, since he was born in Canada he did something well for Canada🇨🇦
KKKKKKKK
😂😂😅
Voltaram pra o segundo tempo com o Pix na conta. Claro que foi entregue né, vendido total esse gol kkkkkkkkkkkkk
Maren sa
MAG!! 😂😂🇨🇦
EPIC FAIL!!
Oh i'm not happy for this focking goal about my country oh i don't like it fuck you goal Keeper
Haiti actually only need 2 goals to go through. Away goal rule.  Edit: this was made before Canada scored the 2nd and 3rd goals
Cough cough match fixing!
Merci gadyen
Happy to see Canada build on their lead, but dang that sucks
O time já é ruim
Damn I’m a Canadian and I still felt that
What the shitting fuck was that?
Feel bad for the keeper but let’s go Canada!!!!!🔥🔥🔥
