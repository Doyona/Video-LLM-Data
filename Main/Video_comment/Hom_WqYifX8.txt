You could almost say he was... energybending
Jon Jones will best this guy easily.
“Sober Costa is still undefeated” -Paulo “Mentally Undefeated” O Malley
I like how brash he is, like the main character in all my favorite anime’s lmao
Izzy admitted to being a wizard “witch I am”
Boom right in the kisser 😀
Jon Roids Jones is having nightmares right now
Style bender im a wite belt for life Justin Gathje im a no belt for life

Philosophical 🧐
My favorite UFC fighter israel adesanya is a beast going through all the MIDDLEWEIGHTs and its tells me Israel adesanya will never be defeated
POW!! Right in the kissah!!
Izzy cleaned a stacked division in 2 years
Israel is awesome
Commn israel do yr bst .......... Dnt  gve up .... 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
“Teach me how to be cool.”   Izzy: Just be you.
something  strange  happen  whit Paolo Costa , i see all is fight he look on drug Costa is so powerful
Man if he was on roids it would've been a first round knockout
This guy is a murderer's row all by himself lol. He's playing chess in that cage - whereas an opponent like Costa was playing Connect- 4.

Legendary Israel Adesanya
Peds o phile
I don't like Jon Jones but he would eat Israel alive.
1:40 This joke got me laughing, expecting nothing else from an anime fan
Adesanya he's good on attacks
We need him on bully beatdown
I Love this boy!! He came from heaven!!  A real warrior
Before the fight, Adesanya haters “ he’s too skinny “ after the fight “ he’s on steroids “
"My skinny shin sliced him open like a katana blade" 🔥🔥🔥
Izzy could play the 'bad guy' for all i care; I'd still root for him.
If something happens to Izzy soon , just know it's due to his paganism....dark arts attach to your body..........what that on his chest.....I know.
cant wait for the fight between Israel "Gynobender" Adesanya vs Jon "Junkies" Jones Im waiting to see which PED work better for them LOL
Izzy Vs Floyd May weather 💯👍
angeles azules
No more leg kicks! Automatic win.
Israel is an elite martial artist  period
Israel BUT adesanya
Boom right in the kisser 💀
The new Anderson Silva
jorge masvidal vs israel...i wanna see it even with weight difference
Champion and #1 contender have N.Z connections 🇳🇿😎
skinnys shins sliced him open like a ketana blade, joker
Izzy just grazed him and he went down if he land clean he would have been OUT COLD! Izzy has the Power even grazing him
Clown
Israel is reminiscent of Sugar Ray x Ali n terms of speed and Precision
Adesanya is the definition of confidence
i like your style bro......LASTYLEBENDER ....everything is IZZY.. they must have forgot.
A-cup Adesanya!
How many people believe he can beat Jones now?
game of thrones trailer 2019
Great young fighter.... Beast but respectfull ..
Great fighter but the iq of a golf ball lol very tito cringey
Israel "the A-cup" Adesanya
SLiced him up like a Katana blade! YEAAAA
is Israel the best guy  in MMA
“Your dad might be a bully to you “. I felt that one
i love how izzy's such a weeb lmao
Israel is good fighter.
Dude I’m a Izzy fan from the start.. before the ufc. but never ever did I thought he do Costa like this.. listen when a pitbull fight a Mastino.. a pitbull would lose as the Mastino is way more heavier... but Izzy did the opposite and the Mastino didn’t stand a chance.. so what this fight tells you about Izzy is... his is the last style bender!!!
Israel Adesanya smashing up all the bullies!!
OLHA COMO ESSE MALUCO É COMPETITIVO, APOS A VITORIA CONTRA O ROMERO, ELE FICOU PUTO E FICOU ESTUDANDO ESSE JOGO PRA CASO ALGUEM QUEIRA FAZER IGUAL, BORRACHINHA TENTOU E SE FUDEU
I’m surprised that not one person in the UFC is talking about Izzy’s gyno 😂
He's like jon Jones of middle weight.  Won't be going anywhere anytime soon but does he have to be a dickhead 100% of the time !?!
Send your magic my way Izzy! I want to be the best, please send your intentions my way. Love you.
I like him. But his metaphors suck lol
Israel Gynosanya
quotables  "He only fights human punching bags" "Do a look like a punching bag to you? I'm not fat enough, I'm skinny bro"
Katana blade!!!
"My skinny Shin sliced him open like a Katana Blade" 😂😂😂😂💯
força borrachinha
love u adesanya
He's on steroids the gyno is the proof.
So what about his gynecomastia ?
I wish the rematch against Romero or Kevin.
🇳🇬 to the world. A well spoken assassin, continue shining our light bro!!
Crazy to see how different each fighters careers turn out. Kelvin is on a down slide. Izzy is the king of the division. Robert trying to make a come back. Yoel at such a old age for an athlete still in the mix. Love that the world is getting to see the UFC and combat Sports more.
I don’t like Jones I would love to him whopped by Izzy
Costa was an ascended saiyan, didnt quite get the transformation right. Looking like trunks vs perfect cell. oooof.
Costa Fans: 20% Brazilians, 60% Izzy haters, 20% Casuals who think muscles win fights.  Those guys were previously Yoel, Whittaker and Gastelum fans. Now, watch how Cannoniers fanbase will surge out of nowhere and the "Cannonier is the man to do it" comments will be in abundance.
UFC is trash. Boxers like Fury will wipe the floor with these wimps. They have no good boxing stance and hit like girls. Only reason for KO in punches is because they hit a wounded man on the ground as in boxing he hits the mat and referee counts whereas this trash UFC you hit a wounded man on the ground and if you leave him he can get up any moment since their punches are like little girls
I like the way he has his t shirt  back on to cover peds that he was taken!
10Q Adesanya
You have to Admit that he's extremely talented but am i the only one who thinks he's getting a bit cocky
This guy finds inspiration from Naruto.... when u are inspired by that kinda thing, u can be inspired from anything.. thats why this guy is the best  middleweight..
Costa, joe weller wants his form back
when he says energy he's talking about chakras.
Test
Agreee.i saw the fear in the eyes of costa.
Wow whittaker has 22 wins? Gotta give the man props
Great film, great quote.
0:35 boi was blood bending 0:53 boi was fire bending 1:25 boi was earth bending 1:31 boi was air bending. Man is avatar of mma  6:20 just be you!
Hey random person scrolling down the comments..     Have a wonderful day :)
Costa could't juice to fight Izzy
Yeeees izzy ur not a punching bag
This guy is a monster.
He doesn’t even look like he’s been in a fight. Imagine getting locked in a cage with Paulo & not having a mark on your face
He doesn't seem as though he's been in a battle. Envision getting secured an enclosure with Paulo and not having an imprint all over

Spn o Borrachinha  quer  a revache de qualquer forma,  devido do desrespeito  por favor força  Adesania,  aceitar essa luta. Preciina o mesmo.
coochie man
Yo his antibullying bit is marketing genius. A fighter, a smart businessman, and a white belt for life. Complete package.
You can tell Izzy doesn’t like that commentator,

I would love to see another naruto vs sasuke fight in the octagon
Israel Gynosanya
Showmanship, Izzy the killer clown.
Great attitude, cool guy nice work Adesanya.
Nice win!! You are the undersputed in this division. Now time to destroy the drug cheat Jon Jones,which I believe will be an easier win then Costa
this guy stays blabbity blabbing
Pls help
bleached grain vs whole oats, eating g.o.a.t's "its time to roast what a beast"- bee a guess he will host without any bread Cain said he was Able to Toast
Wait till he fights a good wrestler! He’ll be done!
Loser of Whittaker vs Cannonier should face Costa, only then does Costa have the chance for redemption
Technician will always beat strength brawling throwing bombs. I like Izzy but he’s really weird, but cool. Sad the middleweight is the weakest of all the divisions right now but that new guy looks amazing.
take the steroids and white coaches out with the fight iq, and there is no Adesanya
"Boom, right in the kisser"
NARUTO VS SASKUE
Adesanya dry humping his defeated opponent is one of the most classless things I've ever seen in MMA. And this guy claims to be against bullying! What could be more bullying than humiliating a defenceless dude. Martial artists should have more dignity and more discipline. Terrible example for kids, too.
And, he humped that bullie!
Yea the doggystylebender at the end wasn't the best act of sportsmanship! LoL
He just tell kids to punch their dads at the end?   Well, I guess if they are true bullies and kids just aren't little shits.
Now I understand why Romero didn't move. 👍🏾
These niggas ain’t even wearing a mask whatsoever
Don’t lie, that’s Jamie Foxx
Motor-mouth Adesanya did a great job with stopping and derailing Costa's game and power by kicking his lead leg—kudos onya! And by doing that he won the fight. AND, he didn't face Costa's power or Costa's fierceness. So, yes he won the match, but no, he didn't beat "Costa." He won against a fighter who had been taken out of his game and power. A win is a win. But don't pretend that the best of Adesanya beat the best of Costa. The best of Costa didn't show up. That's his bad, but it's also not the win that Adesanya is inflating this to be. Adesanya is a trickster and a sniper (much like Coner McGregor) and with fighters who are susceptible to being taken out of their game and the negating of their power A. will beat them every time. But like what we saw when Khabib humbled Conor—when a sniper/trickster meets someone who isn't susceptible to their tricks and has a comparable fight IQ and ability to adjust and has answers for the feints, baiting, and lead leg kicks—that sniper/trickster fighter runs out of options -and tricks- and gets his lunch handed to him. Who is that for Adesanya? Maybe Jared Cannonier or ?? Eventually someone will come along with greater ability.
If you thought Stylebender was the underdog in any fight after he fought Silva, you need to reevaluate how you study martial arts. I don’t really follow mma/ufc but after that Silva fight I knew I had witness a new king in the ring.
After two more fights! ULTRA INSTINCT.
This Nigerian dude is a low class fighter, no matter what he should've show sport manship at the end of the fight, that's  not what Martial arts is about it
I'm glad we're finally addressing this final "act" in the cage. But still big questions lingering. Did Costa get pregnant, and if so, will Adesanya step up to father the child, Costa being the obvious mother? At this stage in Israels life...sadly probably not. Will Costa mother the child on his own? Or will it bring up difficult memories every time he looks down at the skinny body and big beautiful face? Israel makes a lot more money and will have to step and pay child support, I hope the Ufc will enforce this. At the very least Issy can come by every now and again and feed little Paulo from his right breast??  Sadly it was the only action Israel got the entire night, and it was really over before it began. Real disappointed in Costa's performance, didn't even give a look back. A second fight?? Noooo, im hoping for twins and it can all end right here.
Teddy Atlas was right to compare him to Ali, Jones and other charismatic champions.  I think he's going to be just as special outside of the ring.
I wasn't expecting this, congratulations.
What about that gynecomastia izzy got going on???
Greatest Fighter of all time
White belt for life
Israel has great trainers
Compare me to ALI and Roy Jones ahh please get real Adesanya you're not even close.
Bring Ryan Hall to more fights. Make it happen Dana.
Guys I lost my job today ... I punched my boss in his face.
Love you izzy!
He made costa look like a rookie
Ima fan but dude is too corny man just say one thing and leave it at that stop trying to add an extra comment to be funny
dont at me  he's the new and best
I’m telling y’all, this guy is just good, you would think Whittaker was terrible, Yoel Romero was trash and now Costa looked even dumb in that octagon.. the list will keep growing
i was sad for Costa, he really looked different, all tired, slow and doing more showing off than fighting... but Isreal is a great champ even if i dont like his way of being.
I don't think there is anyone who can challenge Izzy at this point. Cannonier is no match for this guy.
The fake champion, lets go for the really champ romero ecc.. bella ragazzi dall italia..
The actual Ricky Martin couldn't have done worse than Costa did Saturday night.
Israel boobs adesanya.
Why is flow important. Because with flow - you can control a man at a distance - its almost like you are playing chess with his reactions - He keeps second guessing himself. Its artistry... One of the principles of destruction.
If you do not understand what easy is saying. I will explain it to you.... Izzy was in a constant state of flow. You might not understand what that means because in the entire UFC Izzy is the only one that I have seen that understands this concept. And as they say - Flowing water does not grow stale... And that was what that was all about in there...
That was mad funny when he said he was a white belt too lmao
KELVIN GASTELUM Showed best disposition against Izzy in all his
Imagine taking steroids and thinking your the boss
So good in the cage and so bad on the mic
This guy is smart, thats why he is still a winner.
If you have faster fast-twitch muscles than your opponent and higher fight IQ, it's almost impossible to lose to them.  It was like watching the movie, the Matrix and Costa was in slo-mo, just like Whittaker was.  It must have been agony for Costa, still fighting but knowing he was going to be knocked out.
I don't know why people think a belt color is going to save them in a fight. 😂 - it's the dumbest thing in the world. He is white/blue, I'm black I'm going to finish Izzy. lol, fool.
Gastelum did much better than coste loste looser
Jones: can't lose to Reyes twice  Reyes: I'm defending my title  Blachowicz: nah I got this  Jones: now that you got Reyes out, tell em Jan I'm coming. I have to steal his shine
One love, bro. More greater heights...
Was that "Crystals", a shot at Jared Cannonier?
Israel Adesanya aka "The Last PED Bender"
Costa was fighting weird and acting strange with his tactics. But then again he was probably trying to do something different against someone who's never been beat
Izzy is HRT 100%  Look at his sagging pecs.
I can hear the haters now, he only does Shadow Clone Jutsu and Rasengan.
Israel is a preacher at heart, this one goes out to anyone that has been bullied. I love this guy. You certainly took the bite out of him.
Hi everyone! 💝 Stay safe 💝  💖  Slimebouncy 💖
Salute to izzy he handled business..
Another cringefest interview by Izzy 😂
Adesanya looked uncommonly powerful this fight.  Suspiciously so.
No one can make me believe they are going to destroy adesanya no one can make me believe they will smesh his face or nothing. He may lose one day but I can never see him being dominated. Will watch every fight like a kid excited for a new toy. Incredible martial artist
Thank you YouTube. I will never self promote again.
This guy's on a hip bus that's moving towards GOAT and he's driving himself there in front of us all. There's a lot of character in this warrior. He's a real-deal. Awesome.
I wish Usman was there for the interview, it would’ve been “ tentalizing”😭🇳🇬💯
I don't see anyone could beat Israel, not even Jon Jones
Israels chakra is unmatched! Cant fake the energies, he's right on!
Israel looks like a young Jamie Foxx
GYNO MORE THAN LAST TIME!
Does so much for UFC 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
''Only One Person Who Likes This Will One Day Be A Billionaire ''Good Luck'' 🍀
Izzy's ability to smartly and correctly analyze his opponent's style and adjusts appropriately is his greatest weapon
cringe!
Israel might take the cake for being more cringe than Henry Cejudo.  But you cannot deny he is a great fighter.
Izzy is a fcking Gem
Costa big for nothing lmao 😂
Israel bring out the Bruce Lee s__t and kicked Costa's a__ lol.
And... He is getting better and better...!! Good on ya mate...!!
Seriously the problem with Paulo costa was he was too focused on conserving his strength for later that he became completely inactive. He barely threw a punch, hence having no set game plan is best, just adapt and overcome,  you can take the example of khamzat chimaev
Salute to Style Bender
Did anyone see the gyno he was showing off?
This guy has scintillating charisma ..
I love adesanya but I’m disappointed knowing he juices. It’s like finding out ur super heroes are mortal. His skills are still Undeniable.   Beast.
Adesanya is so interesting  to listen to😂
Teddy Atlus and City Kickboxing?!? PLEASE GIVE ME THIS CONTENT COMBAT GODS!!!
hit different when he said bullies
no hate but i feel like adesanya was on some type of peds... the gyno in his chest
ADESANYA VS MCGREGOR LETS GET IT
easyrael made it look so izzy
I wish they looked at replays more during these interviews
He reminds me of Muhammad Ali, very funny and entertaining
Too Izzy.
ROLE MODEL! AFRICA BABY
At the beginning of the video, I thought he was Jamie Foxx 😂
Israel “gyro” adesanya
Izzy has gyno
Gynosanya
My man said "We'll do it like Naruto and Sasuke" on TV =)) legends!
Ricky Martin still be livin' that Vida Loca !
love him
I feel so bad for Israel he has immense MMA talent but can't talk on the mic to save his life. He ruins his insane moments in the ocatagon the  second he opens his mouth hahah
he did the exact same thing against yoel romero and people hated him
His striking has improved, considerably. Wow.
That's why styles like "Peekaboo" were created. You need to evasively get inside, throw a powerful combo and avoid as much retaliation as possible. You can't just stay in the outside against an oponent like Adesanya. He'll just punish you non stop and pick you apart.
Anyone thinks just shut up Paul, when paul felder talks? Or is it just me?😂😂😂😂
Why did costa think he was still fighting Romero by making those silly faces
Fighting aside , this guys the real deal when it comes to handling life 🙏👍🔥Adesanya ooosh
Izzy is a bonafide star
it may sound strange but israels hardest fight was vs  43 yo anderson silva in australia. haha. and i still believe that anderson won round 2 and 3 was close. lol
Israel Gynobender Adesanya 😳
He can play jamie foxx anyday
White belt mentality if you think you know it all you'll never know it all
he should be suspended for his * **move he pulled right after the referre put a stop to the fight . very unsporty from a guy like israel
He won't beat Jones though. Costa fought like an idiot. A terrible performance made Izzy look better than he actually is. He's good but his nemesis will be Jones, the goat.
Hes gonna have a million excuses the day he finally loses
Does anyone else Love Adesanyas Anime references more than me ?!? I blow up in excitement every time he makes mention of it. I feel like I’m re-living my heroes in anime—in real life ! Go Adesanya !!! Your so dope ! Much love from the anime community !
Paulo “please, don’t do it” Costa!
Looks like the Stylebender got right when he said Costa had T rex arms. Lol
The most surprising is at the moment Izzy wins he starts humpin Costa. I dont care if your trying to make fun of someone or your trying to Rub it in that you won (literally) but to hump another man like how my dog does when he is in heat REALLY MESSED MY MIND UP AND JUST HAD ME CONFUSED for the rest of the night till i went to bed.
GIVEAWAY ALERT!! . . .
costa got paid to take a dive sorry bit izzy is weak as paper no way he could of won
We sit here and don't know what those giy feels when they get into the cage with him. It's easy said than done.  If isreal hit you with his feets, you will be too scared to get close to get caught.  Because just one hit from him, no matter how big or masculine u are, you might get knocked out. His legs are stronger . Every Nigerians have that if you were born there. Mine too. We walk on bear foot most times. We don't use elevators  much like we do in the west. I moved out of Nigeria in my 20s and I knocked a guy out in the gym with just one punch. It's a struggle in some areas in Lagos Nigeria. U have to live the life to understand where we are coming from. No steroid needed to be tough. We are just monsters already made. Thanks to our bad government and curruption.
*I'm convinced that was actually Ricky Martin and not Paulo Costa.........*
*Once a random person who puts Like this comment will become a billionaire*
Paulo did exactly what Yoel did lol
Hmmm has anyone seen Costa dollar just seems like he went into hiding him and trash talkers lmfao
Still ain't herd from Paulo🤷 Must b retirement time🤣😂🤣 Well done Izzy 🦸
Youtube is getting real comfortable with these double 15 second no skip ads
When life gives you a hundred reasons to cry, show life that you have a thousand reason to smile.
G Y N O
“Energy Never Lies.” Man, Izzy is a striking savant.
Isreal ' BUT! ' Adesanya
Too easy for Izzy boy.
Izzy has crazy knock out power. Left kick is like a whip !
Love Adesanya demeanour
Africa-kenya we love you Israel Adesanya 🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪💖💖
master of communication skills, 90% of time used  by adesanya
Who did better? Romero or Pollo🐥🐥🐥Costa😅😅😅? I say Romero🔥🔥🔥
Paulo Costa supports the fascist president of Brazil. Communist congratulations to Adesanya. Welcome to North Korea. Save Nigeria.
I'M A WHITE BELT FOR LIFE! 🤣🤣
You can tell he’s self conscious about the remarks people say about his body
Merk Millions Martial Arts. YouTube.
This fight only increased my desire to see Adesanya erased and sprawled on the floor. Go Jared Cannonier, make us happy.
Never doubt Stylebender.  Ever.
****Everyone suddenly starts breathing through diaphragm ****
No 👎 no
GYNOBENDER
ISRAELITE ADESANYA WHETHER HE KNOWS IT OR NOT!! 😆 🤣 😂  🤴🏿🤴🏿🤴🏿💯💯💯💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿
Be silent boy!.
looked at the thumbnail and couldn't decide if this was post-fight or not
Paulo has never fought someone as thin as Adesanya
Great point on the purse. I’ve seen way too many fighters miss weight and win. They should cut the purse like he said so that they have to win if they don’t make weight. Plus a fighter that made weight not getting win money bc their opponent decided to phone it in sets a bad example bc on that note nobody should make weight
Boom 💥 right in the kisser 💋
The 50 Cent movie.
everyone called me crazy when i said that romero didn't engage cause he feared izzy's precision. They called me crazy, saying that romero could have easily blitzed izzy. Wanna know how the romero fight would have went if romero engaged? round two of izzy vs costa, that's how. been an izzy fan since he got to the ufc and i still am. Hype train full speed ahead!
Great champ.. zero hesitation betting on him for this fight, y'all casuals will never learn 😂
Izzy is the whole package.. the only thing that can get in his way is if he gets married. Lmao.
Izzy really is my favorite fighter and most importantly personality in the ufc. Awesome guy!
Costa reminds of Wanderlei Silva... all aggression with zero precision and one dimensional fighter.....while Izzy has an encyclopedia of arsenal skills.
Porrachinha??
I wish he wasn't so good.
gynecomastia , look at his right chest, talent ???  steroid fighter.
Paulo knew he didn’t have the energy so he was waiting. I believed costa could have won. He took a straight kick to the head and barely flinched. Adesanya although skilled and aiming for the head got an extremely lucky equilibrium shot but if it was a normal shot I believed it woulda just pissed off costa. Paulo could have dominated this fight and I believe he needs to earn a rematch. It was a mix of Paulo not doing his normal stuff and adesanya although skilled getting an extremely lucky knuckle to the perfect nerve. Costa literally took a head kick and barely flinched. Paulo could have won, and literally won by pure domination. Costa has taken YOEL ROMEROS HARDEST HIT, adesanya got an extremely lucky graze to the perfect nerve. Costa could have won but he messed up and adesanya who is really skilled did get lucky with the area of the head he hit and how he dug his knuckle in from a certain angle. Costa could have won.
My girlfriend calls me skinny, thanks izzy, everytime she calls me skinny now on I'll throw a leg kick.
Id like to see his character after losing
Israel proved me wrong 🤜. My money was on the bigger fighter in Costa but skill won out.
“Boom! Right in the kisser” LMAO
They cut out some real talk about those fighters missing weight
This geeza beats an in form mcgregor
Shoutout to Teddy
He's so good that no opponent can push him to his limit yet since he entered UFC. Jon vs Adesanya.
Izzy could go into commentating. mad respect
I was rooting for costa cus I thought he would clinch and fight on the ground I was wrong. I’m still pretty salty when Izzy walked up to the camera and called me mad and salty. He has my respect if he beats Khamzat or Whittaker 2 then he’s the 🐐
He is my new favorite mma fighter
I have advice for Izzy's next opponent.... DO NOT INSULT HIM OR MOTIVATE HIM!! He looked like a man on a mission in that fight
Israel is like watching a character from a mortal kombat movie fight
The interviewers seem so uncomfortable like they wanted you to lose bro trust me!
Where are the costa fan boys now?
Costa clown performance only all talk.
And did they ask why Israel have GYNO ???
You ain’t mike boy relax
Incredible fighter, incredible statement:  "Energy never lie(s)."  Two great fighters that'll probably go at it twice more, minimum - maybe Paulo's not all the way back yet - ye have to at least give Paulo some leeway in this regard.  Really soon to be going up against an IZZIE. .
Costa seemed gassed from the get go from too rapid a weight cut too close to the fight.
If this dude was humble he’d be absolutely badass.
did this for bully victims and goes on n bullied costa... his ppv rate is done now forsure tho lmao  fight nights from now on buddy boy
Dear strangers, hope y'all are doing great in this pandemic.Stay safe, stay healthy🤍
*Remember* *TODAY IS TOMORROWS YESTERDAY*
I remember getting into a YT comments debate about Izzy. They said they He was gonna loose because of the Curse? Apparently anyone whos been on the UFC game cover their 1st fight back is a loss. Happend to Gustefson, Rhonda lost to Holly, Connor lost to Diaz, UFC3 he lost to Khabib, and Masvidal just lost to Usman... Guess Izzy broke the curse then. 🙅🏿‍♂️💯💯💯💯
Mystic adesanya 😂
my skinny shins cut him up like a katana blade 💀💀💀
Hard to believe, but Costa did not do much in that fight... the guy looks jacked and he backed off all the time... It was all mind game... his team did not do the job well for that fight...But GZ Israel
Costa didn't only get exposed he got humiliated.
Like a katana blade? This dude is beyond lame, throw him in the ring with Stipe.
Going to laugh when he breaks his leg on Jon’s leg Silva style, then Jones caps it off with 5-10 12-6 elbows directly to his face after he collapses on the ground.
Is his man boobs due to Gynecomastia?? Never noticed it before
I don’t think anybody forgot Izzy ! You are the best in the game bro ! Respect ! Great fight !
The naruro vs sasuke reference is why I love him so much
GynoBender
Israel too talented for costa
Bro is it me or does he repeat everything in all after fight interview s
Congrats Izzy 👏
I 100% agree on the weight cut piece
Naruto and sasuke 😂😂😂 @5:29
Costa is going to improve and we're gonna see a rematch with these two eventually. Calling it now.
2019: *STAY POSITIVE* ❤  2020: *EVERYONE TESTING POSITIVE* 😷🦠
Costa had a horrible weight cut. He will be back
🐐
Did anyone else notice Adesanyas right pec?
Izzy you wiped the head off him
why not ask him how he got a titty in 6 weeks, massive gyno from test!?
wanna know why his kicks are so accurate? because he has awakened his mangekyou sharingan
"open like a katanga blade"
I Would like to hear what Paula Costa balloon has to say after that fight.
If you are reading this comment:  💕BE BLESSED!!!   x1,000,000💕🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊💫💞✨✨💞💫💞💞💞💞✨💫💫✨💞💫💫✨💫💫🥊💫💞💞
He slip
Self-confidence and attitudefor a reason. Highly intelligent guy!
Fighters with that much muscle don’t last that long in mma
Adesanya is the real deal. I’ve gotten into MMA going to Rumble on The Rock events and as time passes you see the next generations who evolve the game. Adesanya, Khabib, Holloway, Conor, and many many more who have done that the past 5yrs
Couple of times here Izzy accidentally lets some of his sport psychology slip and immediately realises. I respect how much he does the little things well. Kudos to Izzy, man isn’t going anywhere soon.
fight wasn’t that fun to watch. good win tho
Before this fight I still had doubts but now MY RESPECT HE IS THE REALLL DEAL I feel like he will beat anyone in the next few years !!
He is so accurate
The last gynobender
izzy slowly moving further and further round that table lmao
Weight lifting is a poor attempt to compensate for lack of talent. Muscle heads are exposed time and time again.
Israel Adesanya the people's champ! Not that I've ever been bullied but i definitely hate a bully, and i LOVE to see a technician destroy the bully.
Shout out to Atos BJJ
Cold blooded!!!!! The boy is bad to the bone marrow!!!!
He is an experienced kickboxer who knows how to use his reach both arms & legs., Maybe a strong grappler next time might get him tired kinda soften him up, put him in the ground & finish him there.
"teach me to be as cool as you"  "just be you"   chur
❤️❤️💪💪💪
Soooo Happy congrats Ricky Martin got Botched love it love it love it
Khamzat Chimaev is the only challenger
I told y'all he would beat Paulo and shock the world Izzy is a great champion
Beautifully said at the end 👊🏻
Izzy comes in why isn't anyone claiming this belt? you are a victim? of the system? Whelp ok Ill be World Champ and a Millionaire.
I thought costa was gonna bulldoze Izzy. He really proved me wrong 😋
Dude is my favorite fighter , so stoked for him!
Shout out to all the bully dads out there. Your kids might punch or shoot you after watching this video.
"My skinny shin sliced him open like a Katana blade" :)
🇳🇿🇳🇬🇳🇿🇳🇬🇳🇿🇳🇬🇳🇿🇳🇬💪😎 THE LAST STYLE BENDER FOREVER!!
Kinda funny how Izzy went on to talk about how Costa reminded him of every Bully he ever had but the way izzy carries himself and talks is almost as if he became a bully himself.
Where’s Khabib?
💉
He is the new face of combat sport he proved the theory of precision blended styles cardio, confidence, over write power (muscles)and speed.
Its because he watches anime I rate this guy!  The Naruto and sauske called out 🔥
Beast
Love this and be strong. You never know who you are inspiring
Does any one realize he isn’t that funny? He wants to be a meme so bad..
Shout out to Sherdog for putting Kendra Lust on a pro picks video😂
Energy does NOT lie. Cheers, champ. Jan is on point too.
It's hilarious to me how I see everyone backing izzy now ? Where's all the costa cazzys  at now ?
Pretty sure Cannonier will be next.. a few more wins Izzy will cement himself as the GOAT.
This guy is amazing !!    Time for Jones now!    You can do it!!   Go all the way
Israel "The bully breaker" Adesanya
I don't like the Ethiopian
I'd like izzy more if he'd stop clowning on my boy whitaker
Teddy atlas perfect break down for the KG fight and showed where costas striking ability is one dimensional for now
He doesn’t even look like he’s been in a fight. ideate getting locked in angstrom cage with Paulo & not having a mark on your face yes!
Paula "Izzy is afraid of powerful guys" Costa! 😂🤣
Izzy being a white belt and champion is like Naruto in the way that he was hokage while still being a genin

I don't see anybody having a chance against Adesanya.
That Calvin Gas was the best!!
He is cool xD
Can't stand this idiot
Right nipple!  He needs to explain.
Izzy is a genius. Love the dude.
💟💟💟💟💟💟 Have a GREAT DAY 💟💟💟💟💟💟 🙏 🙏 🙏 And Be Successful 🙏 🙏 🙏
I love Brendan too
Izzy funny manh
This dude is on roids! That is why his right chest drooped like that!
Wheres all those people now that said Costa was in Izzy's head😂😂
Did anyone notice as Izzy was punching Costa down, at the end of the fight he humped him from the back😂😂.    The disrespect 😪💔
GSP mentality, this guy is going to be in the books!!
Costa is crying but my uncle Izzy is laughing😅😂🤣 I think😅
Izzy is just tailor-made for that counter punching back humping style and Costa is tailor-made for bodybuilding not for fighting at championship level.
He should have a chat with, Colby Covington now.
Izzy has perfect ears no damage at all an been in the ufc how long? This guy dont get beat up on at all facts!
Poor sport
No one: Israel: "Jared is the Dark Horse"
If he was so slow why did he hit you in the ribs izzy?
Paulo had no business being there
Issy would put up a very good fight against Jon Jones. It's obvious.
It ain’t how big the dog is in the fight....it’s how big the fight is in the dog...
1st ufc champion i truly feel connected to
This is what happens when you embrace your flaws, you shine like no other. Fu*k what people say, they don't control your life, you do. Izzy work💪
adesanya makes some vodoo against costa
Hypnosis that's it
He is gonna destroy the records set by Anderson, no one will be able to handle him at 85.
I love the face he just shuts up the commentator regarding John jones
"Naruto vs Sasuke, he knows." That's why I love this guy. :)
My recap is that isreal was kicking leg punching him. Good kicks he then wore him Costa down. He countered hit him. He went down he hammered him. He finished him.
Run it back with Whittaker I reckon izy will lose
This is a comment.
People say this guy is invincible and so far he is. Hats off to him no doubt. However  I believe an opponent of his height could give him trouble.
Books out on Costa.
"I'm not training to fight israel I'm training to kill him"
Yes Israel Adesanaya my sexy hippie crystals boyfriend champ 🥰😘💘
I thought Paulo Costa would be a bit more dangerous, but I guess Izzy proved me that I am actually joining the thought that compares him to Anderson Silva in his prime. Last night was a demonstration of a beautiful class  of technique.
This is a very wise, dangerous man.  Energies do NOT lie.  You can’t teach this stuff.  Izzy’s on a level most cannot attain.
Surprised the world with that knock down. Woww. This guy is in another lvl with his striking. 🤯
Everytime i bet against izzy i regret it lol wont make the mistake again incredible fighter
Adesanya went Ultra Instinct on Costa
Imagine if Izzy fought Stipe right away, while Jones is bulking up.
Paulo is too big for 195. Too small for 205
Who needs accurate answers anyways😂
Booky fight🕶 shady
Can we get Teddy Atlas as special guest commentator
Costa FROZE AND THE WEIGHT CUT DRAINED HIM ,should have had
The casuals need to leave they mess up every sport they watch stick to reality tv and dance shows
Israel is on other level his striking is so good we proud of you# Africa
Izzy celebrations at the end of fights almost make me think he was surprised he won.
Why don’t fight with Khabib, if you win him ,you are king. In UFC,
I would like to see Paulo vs kelvin but kelvin needs to get a decent win soon
You should always play a fighter worse fight and there best fight side by side, and still act the champ, you better watch the fight when ya got knocked out, then have the same aditude
The only one who can defeat him now... "The Wolf"
I bet Izzy is a major pothead lol
HES THE FRICKING BULLY THOUGH ??? he bullies and when the other person responds he plays victim ..
The Last Style bender. Incredible fighter, I'm so happy to witness this guy fight.
Knew he was gonna lose based on the uriah hall fight,he was gettin pieced
Costa fanboys real quiet 🤫
His swagger is next level.
Izzy doesn't even care what the questions are 😂. He's just rambles
He wasn't going to beat the last style Bender anyways
Bro said I’m a white belt too I love it 😂
bruh why does Izzy have Gyno now????? his right nip is HUGE
Hokage!
As an African I'm happy for this dude he is the real deal Nigeria Africa Stand up!!!! lol
Love how he’s speaking up about people not even trying to make weight, because the % of purse deducted is a joke.
Hol up.did Israel just say to hit your mom and dad in the face.
paolo costa doesnt seem like a bully to me - he made the white belt joke, but he didnt push the narrative as izzy did.... he was aggresive going into the fight, but he was calm after his lost and took it really well (he even applauded as izzy´s hands were raised
Adesanya undefeated and undisputed
White belt for life = genin for life just like Naruto
"im gonna make you cry like a little boy!!!!!l"ol......
izzy 👑 could eat jon jones 🥱
Izzys gonna have to move up and fight Jan for the lhw belt just to keep it competitive. Champ champ time lol
Gotta take the bite out of the bully. A great champion!
Its all going to come down to how he comes back from adversity as time goes on.
So happy Izy is proving haters wrong every moment of his career!
People are Switching sides now They Love Izzy 😂😂😂
Who’s this interviewer guy? The UFC got rid of Robin Black and Jimmy Smith by saying they wanted to fill the positions with fighters. Then they hire this guy.
I was promised after the fight that I would see the fight of the year and Costa going to look like Ricky Martin botched
i seem to see a lot of israel followers all of a sudden
Hmm if Usman beats burns he should go up and fight izzy I think izzy kos him 🤔
Never watched him before but I can tell he's the next big thing.  I'll go back and watch his prior fights.
I hate when fighter play around too much in the actual fight than lose its the stupidest game plan
I like Izzy. I hate his fans that act as if they won the fight
Why does Izzy have gynecomastia on the right side???  ask him!
I knew costa would lose if he didn’t wrestle and pressure Izzy but good for u man  This will shut the haters up  For a lil while
If I had the skills, my strategy against Izzy would be this: block then counter his attacks ...Keep my punches high...Kicks low...Get to the final round if  I don’t finish him early...In round five make it a shootout...
I've been watching since spike TV and last night was the first time I legitimately shouted at the TV I was so stoked!
I’ll never doubt Issy again.
"He only fights human punching bags. No, oh no, oh no"  LMFAO😆🤣!
If Reyes took Jon Jones to RD 5, and Blachowicz knocked out Reyes.   The question is, just how good is Jan Blachowicz???
Izzy  is literally a real life superhero character  Since day one✊🏿 The last style bender 🔥
This man sponsored by naruto
Adesanya i knew you had it
this bully talk is hilarious..when u go back and watch, izzy was being the instigator and then, the energy was just reciprocated..talks too much but fights good
the best middleweight ever.
AaaaaaaaaaaaaDeSanyaaaaaa BaBabotched KOed  Ricky Martiiiiiin...
Izzy is the best
Adesanya did what he said he was gonna do, he picked him apart. He still has a lil more to prove there's still some haters out there. It's gonna be interesting to see where his career goes from here
I still hate izzy....just because he is so annoying...really a pest
HES SUCH A BORING FIGHTER
20 wins. 15 knockouts. “Too skinny bro”
Costa had one of the worst performances in a championship fight in the history of the UFC. It's like Izzy was fighting an amateur.
Too bad everyone in the ufc takes steroids or PEDs .... Makes it a bit less impressive
Question.... Is Izzy Naruto or Saske?
ISRAEL IS AFRO SAMURAI
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos✌️
This is a Bad Dude 🥋❗️                            The Peoples Champ .
costa got raw dogged  wouldn't be surprised if he comes back 9 months pregnant lol
The new floy fuckers 💪💪💪
Lucky there are no wrestlers like at welterweight
He got lot to show us
He is the best
"I'm a white belt for life!" -kid always drops gems in these interviews 🤣🤣🤣
Congrats to Izzy. He picked Paulo apart. But I still don't like his attitude. Don't like him at all. Lol I'll cheer for Cannonier or Whitaker next. He's just annoying and corny.
I can’t even lie I favored stylebender but still thought costa would knock him down at least once.😂😂😂🤷🏾‍♂️
Well spoken good interview greatness sir andesanya 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I hope there's a rematch
Amazing performance. Costa had no way to get in and hold Israel down. Maybe Paulo should move up to 205. That massive weight cut can drain you.  💪
I can’t stand his personality.  Ik he’s winning, but still,  cmon bro be humble
Cringy Izzy.....
If USADA see this video, they will go after Adesanya, one of  the main reason of gynecomastia in a athlete is anabolic steroids, Androgens, growth hormone.
So after he beats jon jones, who's next? McGregor? Khabib?
coincidentally programmatic
Izzy is that one weird kid with talent 😂
The interviewers are hating on the champ, respect the Swagger!!! Izzy’s a beast
African worrier.
There is absolutely no one in the middleweight rankings that is a match for Israel right now geez he has beat them all.
We’re are all the Izzy is a runner and he’s boring haters at ? 😂 I know your mad right now stay salty bae lol
Gyno champion of course the world... and what's up with the doggy style and weird comments? What a disgusting " champ" ' good striker tho.
True technic comes without effort, that's why it was such a easy fight.
Adesanya was smooth af in this interview.  Boom right in the kisser 🔫
Im Taking this L cause I thought Costa would destroy him but Izzy proved me wrong my Jaw dropped   I dont think anyone In the MW Division can Take Adesanya  I would love to see Izzy Jones now  I think Jones will have a huge problem with Izzy
Israel is lame, annoying & completely overhyped
Adesanya right leg was a whip.
Starting to like him dude
Izzy is a beast watching this interview n the way he talks n fights is real,his skills is on point.He still haven't leashed his power yet.
Izzy's gyno looking real bad this fight.. COUGH PEDs
this guy said "naruto and sasuke" smh
Stylebender is my new favorite fighter
Paulo costa figured out in the first moments of the fight why Yoel Romero was doing that
adesanya is the next anderson silva, im happy to watch his fights.
I was rooting for Costa but i was never ignorant towards the fact that Izzy had a way higher chance of beating Costa however i did expect him to actually bring the fight but Izzy turned out to be even better than i thought. Still don’t like him but I don’t think any middle weight rn atleast can beat him
Izzy is so great , i knew he will win , but besides that , paulo was weird in the fight it wasn't himself
Izzy crowded out the commentators until he was center screen. Amazing fighter and personality.
His boxing is good ! He should make a boxing career !
He need to fight John Jones now
*_MUSIC BRINGS A WARM GLOW TO VISION , THAWING MIND AND MUSCLES FROM THEIR ENDLESS WINTERING_*
I figured this fight wouldn't be close. Adesanya completely stifled Costa with his gameplan, technique, speed, and mental toughness. Costa never even got out of the gate. Adesanya is gonna be champ for a while
I ain't surprised
I don,t think any striker can beat adasaneya at middleweight it will need an elite grappler to do the job.
Gyno doesn't lie either Izzy
LOLOLOL I LOVE HIM!!!!!!!! Izzy Unstoppable!!!!
Know your strength and walk the walk! Talker sell, grinder win! Congrats Izzy on amazing win!!!
Costa was just not himself , it was strange .
Costa didn’t seem like a bully to me at all... seemed like a great guy. Just played too much instead of doing what he does best.
izzy made that look too easy
Immediate rematch!!!! Costa almost had him!
the thing is that adesanya is boring af outside the cage
So we ignoring the gyno?
Wanted Costa to win, but knew that Izzy would win.
Izzy will be no different than Silva. He will get to comfortable and then he will get caught. It happens to everyone but it should be a while before that happens. The way to beat Izzy is to get in his face and get a hold of him. If your dumb enough to stand on the outside then much like Silva he will make you pay.
Costa fans silenced 😂
When was izzy bullied he's like 6'4 lol
If Izzy beats Jared, he will have cleaned middleweight and it would be time for him to move up to the LHW div. There, he'll become champ with no problem. Hopefully, when that happens, he doesn't drop the MW title right away for him to become a champ champ. And that point, the Jones fight will be there. That's the BIGGEST fight that UFC can make. Crazy career the one that Izzy is having. He is the man right now, no doubt.
Go go Izzy Naruto!
Middleweight looks super dead, I see no contenders in that division right now.
where are the snowflakes izzy haters at now? so silent lol
There is lot of sense in the stuff he says. He could be a coach. He's was too intelligent and experienced
He felt that rhythm Paulo was not bombing because Izzy was picking that front leg mane shout out to the anime
I like Izzy now
Keep using those crystals Izzy! 😅😅😅
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM RIGHT IN THE KISSER HAHAHAHAHHAAHAHHAAHHA
Wow, we're in for an absolute snore fest' now with izzy and Darren.
Punched my dad in the face while he was sleeping thanks to Izzys speech on bullies
Pieced up.  Nuff said.
Izzy said something about sasuke but i dont know what he’s talking about? All i know he is a member of akatsuki which is obviously a dangerous person
Dumb Costa, Izzy made u look stupid asf
in sports money can buy everything. Most of the athletes refuse to fight if they get paid well. That was not Costa!
"Teach me to be as cool as you" was so cringe. Never say that again. Lol.
I do like his cockiness
Costa won if that went to a decision
Precision beats raw power. That's it that's all.
izzy needs some media training, he just seems to not know how to control himself when he's speaking....people hate on jon jones alot but i'd much rather hear jon jones speak than izzy....Jan blachowitz is pleasant to listen too, connor mcgregor and colby covington  not the most pleasant people but they seem to know how to control themselves when they speak......this guy doesn't know how to speak without using profanity at all....to me this is the most unpleasant champion to listen to speak....on another note at least he's not stupid when the fight begins...he literally picked apart paula costa just like he said he would....i guess fighting is when he is most comfortable (his comfort zone)
I don’t understand how Costa was a betting favourite
Isreal should come to the boxing world and get a real bag💰
Pure cringe. Conor wanna be
Naruto and Sauke type fight sounds good to me!!
*Izzy could basically see costa's every attack. He became so much faster and even so much more precise. It's insane!*
I like how he can kill you with his bare hands but at the same time a proud otaku! respect
Kids please don't punch your dad in the face.  He not bullying u.  He's showing you his passion for you to succeed.  So toughing up your feelings and become a man. Sad when people say dad is bullying you but the military is making you a soldier.  Great fight btw.
if it's izzy vs cannonier which one is naruto and which one is sasuke??
The Wizard of Izz!
Israel is so arrogant that it's hard to like him
did Izzy tear his right pectoral muscle?
Line em up:  GSP Jones Stipe
I loved taking the bite out of the bully... Quite literally. I bit the ear before Mike Tyson (which Mike was justified because Evander was cheating with dirty headbutting).
paula costa was stupid,,,he came to fight a champion that's undefeated and he chose to play games instead of fight....i didn't expect those foolish games from him.....only Anderson Silva gets away with playing those games in fights...it was unfortunate that chris weidman was his kryptonite.........like mike tyson says everyone has a plan until they get hit...
Izzy talks about ENERGY!!! I know about ENERGY ITS TRUE ENERGY DOES NOT LIES
Everyone said Paulo was in his head 😂😂
Simply amazing!
"slow cooking him"
how could you not like adesanya ? he just seems like a good dude and comes across very genuine when he talks i really like that about him hope he keeps the belt for a long time like silva
that was the best porformance from the last style bender
Izzy you’re the man. Not just cause you knock people out which I love but you stand up for the right things, you stay true to yourself. You keep your same crew around so much respect for you. You’re the real version of Aang.
Pretty much as expected.   Either it was going to be a flash Costa KO, or Izzy piecing him up the entire fight.  Tbh it was even worse than I thought, he annihilated him.
Masterclass, I enjoy hating him cuz he is cringe as f but auntie Izzy is the best striker in the UFC right now, he is def one of the best in the game right now, if he goes down this path he will be GOATED
That fight was definitely fixed.
This fight reminds me of the Silva vs Belfort fight
Izzy is the most humble guy!
"my shin cut him open like a katanga blade" this guy man. Such a beast in the game and the scrap.
The last few words about bullying, beautiful! Much respect sir!
If you have distain for Izzy.. you really should question where it stems from...
Paulo "sore red leg" costa
Izzy is a white belt because hes afraid to become a blue belt. He knows the baddest blue belt on the planet is the Black Beast and he want none of that.
Who that red headed interviewer he literally getting alpha'd by izzy on camera moving out his way LOL
Big Fitz with the memes gg
Why did I GOT emotional on the last message fr Izzy! Salute Izzy 🙏🏽! 06:25
Why tf did izzy air hump Paulo 🤨
I really want to hear all the stupid idiots that were supporting Pauletta Costa...explain your self please 😂😂
Romero would of finished costa if they fought 5 rounds.
I was completely wrong about this fight and Israel owned him. Great job sir, well done. 🙏💯
Nah Adesanya is unbeatable at this current stage, it's the movement and his dancing background I feel that gives him a big advantage. He is so accurate it's incredible. I knew I could count on Izzy!
Love teddy atlas talking about mma.
Costa dint come forward the entire time. Even when he got his chance, he got him vs the fence he let him go ! I ???
He doesn’t even look like he’s been in a fight. Imagine getting locked in a cage with Paulo & not having a mark on your face
fight a active Whitaker see what happens clown
Titty Adesanya
Over smartness caused him to lose  this fight
Costa wasn't able to hold the weight of his own ego and arrogance. As a Brazilian, i can say never liked that guy.
It's called the force Izzy lol.
He needs to challenge Usman! This dude would get humble if he fights Usman.
Costa decided couldn’t go 5-rounds at his usual pace. The thing is he also believed Izzy wouldn’t break if he set his usual 3-round pace and he would be left gassed out against a master striker with cardio for days. This led him to lower his pace to something he could keep for 5-rounds and this slow pace is what allowed Adesanya to shred his leg with damage in 1-round. It’s not that Costa made the wrong decision it’s just that Izzy is so good he was forced into the only tactic where he thought he had a chance and he underestimated how much damage izzy would do before he could catch up in the later rounds. Izzy is the best.
izzy is the goat !
He is still talking about 'Anderson silva' this is the same old izzy bt more dangerous... Captured new beast
No bjj whatever
Izzy doing Izzy things
Lol yessir all the internet psychologists saying Paulo was going to win   Losers Izzy is the realest
Israel kept his promise making Costa look like botched Ricky Martin
"he really looks like ricky martin BOTCHED!"
LESSON! KING..litle cota to school ! : )
I'm convinced Izzy got that Sage Mode sensing all that energy 🐸
Jon Jones must be worring now seriously, for the first time.  👇 This nr of people believe that.
So glad that Izzy, the betting favorite, is helping people stand up to bullies by t-bagging underdogs in the Octagon after his win. Setting that nice example for the kids. Remember kid, if you ever get an advantage, gloat and demean the person you have an advantage over.
At least Costa still has the record of still has the record of not going more than two rounds
Click bait with that thumbnail 😂
Arrogant!
Let’s go Izzy blacker your boy Paulo with his BBC
I remember the names that were saying you were going to lose and I see so many of them dickriding now 😂😂😂
All lives matter bet you wish you werent so stupid changed your clothes to ufc now huh
"You guys must have forgot"  Silly analysts who have been talking about me all week, you have forgot things about me too!
Modern day Bruce Lee, I love this guy!
Izzy “gyno” Adesanya
The only thing that bugs me about Izzy is, he always talks about how everyone doubts him. But it was almost unanimous with fighters and commentators that he was gonna pick apart Costa.
Crazy, costa had no chance. I can really see what adesanya said. Costa wasn't doing what wanted to do and he looked like he had no idea how to do it.
Love him or what him Man you gotta respect him
Chimaev up next!
I feel like Izzy kept talking about bullying, but I feel like I just watched Izzy bully Costa for a week straight and then beat him up 😬
he said he won't be like Yoel and look what happened... he was worse than Yoel got TKO
He takes your style, bends it to his taste, and eats you off, picks you apart. LAST STYLE-BENDER. That was display of skill and experience.. Cheers Izzy...💪💪🏆🏆🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇿🇳🇿
Great fighter but not very likeable guy
Been watching since his second fight he is amazing i seen something even made 100 dollars tonight cuz i knew this guy aint losing( person i was betting was like his lil azz is about to get whoop i said bet 100 😆)
I will never doubt this man ever again, even if he goes up against Jon Jones
Had to stop the video less than a minute in... this dude is just too cringey
The dopest middleweight in history
Can izzy not stand on his mark to save his life? Bruhhhhh
Resume is insane put some respect on the champs name pound for pound best in the game right now
The bigger they are,the harder they fall, congrats Izzy😉
Lekker izzy!!!
You got it though
I wish I was lol
One important lesson to get from this fight-- Costa (though he has some potential) was overconfident...too sure to win easy. He totally disrespected and overlooked the skills of his opponent, and paid the highest price!! Apparently, he did not learn the lesson Romero taught him just a short time ago.
I feel like costa was being slow paced to start up in the last three rounds but adesyana just pieced him apart faster than he thought lol
When all the fighters win, they say the same thing,  they knew was going to happen blah blah blah, but in fact it is a Luck punch that came in the right place. Congrats
Where are all the “he’s living in izzys head rent free” idiots now?
Bravo - Speak Up Against Bullying --- Take the Bite out of the bully.....great message Israel.....good message, great martial arts demonstration - NEW Zealand fighters are awesome - Kia Ora
Paulo Costa will come back trust me you maybe won this fight and congrats on it but the War is not over yet he will beat you once he goes back to his fighting style without any restrictions
When Robert Whittaker said Izzy is too hard to hit in the Octagon Costa thought it was a joke....
Mr Alagidi downtown Lagos!
I make it look easy😁😁🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬
Adesanya vs Blachowicz. Jan won't get to 185.. but Izzy can put some mass... and let's go :)
Energy is a real thing
Cool how izzy gives such dope nicknames to his opponents
Not exactly sure what happened there...either izzy is too good or costa straight up sucked that night, he was very different than other fights
And the gyno?
Interesting great young career and there is more from him to come.
Theirs nothing he could do. Izzy game plan was perfect sit back and pick him apart when he tries to come in with his power Izzy would use his kicks to keep his distance and just stand back and pick him apart with his reach.. this dude is very dangerous... his long lanky frame is crazy!
precision beats power, timing beats speed
Awesome talker Izzy not a hype train he is hype
Respect Israel. I was doubting you my friend. You teached me wrong. From now on I’m with you in every fight. Congrats
This interview is 🔥. Izzy gets better every fight. I just don’t know who can give him a run at 185
The curse of the ea game cover is broken!
Israel Adesanya made it look easy!
Adesanya is really some kind of prodigy. His way of thinking and acting in the cage speaks volumes, he is like an Anderson Silva 2.0 yet still his very own thing. Very very impressed!
Izzy “ 2strokeafterHEdead” Adesanya 😂
Izzy is a true martial artist, it isn’t about the size of the opponent.
Homies living in a anime and I love it
I predict they will meet again, possibly next year. Can't wait to hear Costa's side of this.
That defensive minded counter striker is such a good fighting style it allows your opponent to always play into your kicks and punches
love what he said about costa reminding him of a school bully was so satisfying watching costa get what he deserved after acting like a clown the whole week and during the fight hahaha
Congrats to the champ! I’m very disappointed by Costa’s approach in this fight.... He juste missed a huge opportunity to beat this breakdancer🤦‍♂️ Should of put pressure like he always did ... too bad for him🤷🏻‍♂️
Izzys my spirit animal. It feels like he’s my long lost older brother 😂
Great guy.Well done.
Just wait until Skinny is forced to defend against Yoel Romero. And new!!
All the fools chatting me in the comments this last week are all quiet now 🤫 stfu. Forever. Bahahahahaha
I enjoy watching Izzy do his thing...  Congrats! BUT!!!   That it will be a great story when all that arrogance hits a wall.   A wall named Jones!
now u know who is Izzy
A truly embarrassing performance by Paulo. Let’s see how he comes back
I was expecting a championship fight, but man izzy makes it like just a sparring session, he did not just KO costa but KO also those casuals🤣 anyways i was expecting for costas team to be prepared for that leg kicks but it seems they did not and felt comfortable on just on the plan on bulldozing through the fight. I thought costa know bjj? but i didnt even see him try to use it when he was on his back.
That part at the end was great Izzy is a good man + the shout out to Teddy one of the best 💯👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Why did I thought costa  could beat this dude he bested *anderson* *silva*
How annoying is this guy?!
Izzy the 🐐! Great fight, Champ! 🏆
Naruto and sasuke he knows lol
Costa fanboys are now jumping off the bandwagon onto the khamzat chimaev hype train as the next guy to dethrone Izzy. 😝
im a fan of that anchor after fist bumping over a white belt lol
Costa is all bronze no finesse izzy biggest problems are boxers counter punchers but props he chopped the eraser dahnnnnn!
Take THAT, bullies!!
"Looking good man" 🤣🤣
Adesanya woke his Magekyo Sharingan before the match .... Costa never stood any chance
When I saw Costa having trouble with Logan Paul, i knwe Adesanya was gonna pick him appart. That performance just broke Costa's spirit.
I hate when they keep bringing up anderson and jones,they're great fighters but Izzy is his own legend
F***ing BEAST
Paulo costa : I will make Israel cry in cage I will hit him so hard.   Really ? 🤣🤣🤣🤣 where are all the costa fans now
The coolest champion EVER !
I like him for his anti-bullying stance.
What Adesanya did to Costa was incredible. He completely nullified Costa's power...in the 1st round but man... How about Blacovich. Jan looked like a different fighter to me. Everything he did was calculated and precise just as Adesanya was vs Costa. He made Reyes look like he didn't belong in there. Last but not least...BRANDON ROYVAL! This kid is fun to watch. The pressure he put on Kai was unbelievable coupled with his BJJ. I can't wait until his next fight👊
It's amazing men. Did anyone notice or was it just me?  Costa's face went from.. 🤪😜😝 to 😥😢 after that headkick.
This guy Walks the walk, Talks the talk, & Dances the dance. 👏   (&that's coming frm a Jones Fan)
How he cut them off after they tried to bring up Jon Jones 🤣😂😂 stylebender is the fkn man! Lol
Costa will be back.
Paulo Costa NOOOOOOOOOOO😭
This is why Romero didn’t move...
That’s awesome ...legend status
Jack Hermansson is coming for you!
"that leg is trash, absolutely trash."
A Bad Man this Izzy.
I really don't think Jon Jones could have handled Costa that easily.
It’s like Khabib said no one is going to beat him in the next two years.
He’s taking over that news desk too slowly pushing the other 2 guys out of frame. Lol
CONGRATULATIONS AND GLORY BE TO GOD OF ISRAEL IN CHRIST JESUS! FIRST....we should know the meaning of his name (=ISRAEL), then learn from Holy Bible and from history. SECONDLY, let's not underestimate him when we don't have even the chance to spar or fight with him personally on the gym or cage. THIRDLY, let's have an open mind because this man is a Real Champion - The Undisputed Champ and not a fake one... because the Association, the Judges & Referees that gave him credit & recognition as such, were wise people or by experience could be wiser than us!
The UFC SUCKS NOWDAYS . bring back the steroids era
Dam I wanted Israel to get knocked out.
Adesanya is an amazing human
izzy castrated costa
Gyno?  Talented, but extremely unlikable.  He needs a PR specialist/handler.
Lol the causals was wrong again. I like it. Izzy was my boy before mma.. every knock artist gases out early. People are slow.
9 fight win streak in the ufc, with only 1 possible soup can on the list?  IMPRESSIVE!!!!
WOW! Adesanya striking was superb! There are levels to this striking game & Stylebender proved he's at the top of it. Great win!
Paulo "lets change our fight style for title fights" Costa
What a tool
Now I know Kelvin Gastelum, is Israel Adesanya's only fight in UFC. The rest was pay-check bonuses. 😄
Adesanya is a great commentator already
Good job israel Adensanya and still 20-0
EASY FOR IZZY
Izzy is the real deal 🔥
All I can say is, izzy is very very good.
Normal TV Interviews, presenter closes show. Last Style Bender interview: hold my belt 😂😂
Izzy has become a favorite fighter. Brash but in a cool way. Backs it up. Fights everyone. One caveat: Yoel 100% outclassed him when he did the backflip, though.
Just keeps it up Champions
Izzy vs Bones 2021 🤫
Izzy he's the best middleweight champion right now . No body can say things about tha . Pple just they likez to talk using thier emotional not reality
Aye that weight cut idea is fr the next wave... im tired of people cheating their way to a win smh #90%
You wear an Akatsuki shirt, you show Akatsuki skills.
People hating on Izzy but his the best respect him Izzy is a god sent from the heavens
On his way to GOAT status
If the kicks don’t get checked, you get sucked into a matrix. Only competition I see Izzy having is Till. Both great kickboxers. Other than that, idk who has a chance
In RPG terms. Izzys level was just to high for Costas low level character.
Sometimes I think the coach's game plans are wack
Israel "I'm going to post memes and bully him" Also Israel "I dedicate this fight to anyone who has been bullied"
Israel vs Chimaev, make it happen
Now he won't shut for 6 months🙄
Is it just me, or does Adesanya have gynecomastia in his right pectoral?
ALL OF A SUDDEN EVERYONE IS A IZZY FAN GTFOH
Will admit thought he was a cocky idiot, but whether love him or hate him, you must respect him, he is wise with virtue, and generous with his confidence.
Jones is the real winner here, He's living in the middleweight, light heavyweight and heavyweight champs heads rent free
teddy atlas getting that shoutout, his analysis video was very fun
yo there is something he is a great fighter I wanted him to win but there is one thing that I noticed his right nipple is bigger than the left. it could be age or he took something before or fat.
Fight of the year yeaaaa right. Izzzy too good for this weight class he needs to move up one class to beat better fighters
Like adesanya he is a champion. But man his mouth is from a kid.
What a boring fight and and what a bad performance from Costa
Paolo looked shook in there, he got scared.
Congrats Champ! I didn't expected anything else! Great fight and well deserved 20-0! So happy about that! Keep it! Greets!
This fight was fixed. Costa didn't do anything. That is not like Costa. MMA is like wrestling now.
Izzy is slowly starting to become my favorite MMA Fighter. My current one is Tony Ferguson.
Nothing to prove with Izzy. He is still the best in WW division now.
This fight changed my mind about israel .... Israel adesanya is the goat🐐. Period!
They talk the talk, undefeated or not. But when it comes that time to square up against Omoba The Last Style Bender Isreal Adesanya, they run out of style, air and steam. Talk about ruthless aggression, what a way to end Costa's undefeated strong run! 🇳🇬 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
cried at the end
🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬
Great fight don't think costa was a bully thou
U  r the best 👌 💓
Izzy is a good kid
Paulo forgot his combos in Brazil
Hate this guy so much. Glad I missed it last nyt
Champ. No doubt. Bravo!
I'm a guy that, if I see people running away from something I'm like, 'Why you running away? What's over there?' - Israel Adesanya -
"He knows <3" thats weeab power and talk right there.
All the talent and skill in the world and still such a cringe idiot.
Izzy basically pushed them off the table 🤣
Love Izzy but that skinny comment has deffo got to him 🤣
No game plan by Costa, I was expecting him to use his jiu-jitsu he had no chance standing against izzy. I think a decent well rounded wrestler is only capable of beating izzy.
Naruto and sasuke😂!!
Can’t stand Izzy the guy is a bellend.
This guy is brilliant af, studies all his opponents so good
Khamzat has entered the chat
Izzy basically just said punch all of your bullies in their face even if it's your dad🤣
Izzy is the truth 💥💥
Is this guy from New Zealand... why doesn't he fight under their flag. And why does he hate white people.
Reyes: “ can’t wait to defend by lhwbelt..Jones was scared”  Jan: “hold on I’m talking brother!”
I wonder if there is anyone who could beat Israel. Jon Jones maybe? Usman? Chimaev?
Boom right in the kisser with a gun shot. Hmmmm .....sure that's how u wanna advise the youth?
I called it. I knew Costa would gas.
That wasn’t an easy fight he made it look easy
Everyone is surprised they didn’t think Izzy could do it
Set up the Jones fight already..those two are talking too much on Twitter
Izzy's gift is his movement, coupled with abundance of fast twitch fibres and technically sound, have you seen this dude dance?!
Boom right in the kisser lol
Talks fast runs in faster
You cant beat some1 that does the Naruto run..
Congratulations Israël easy u make the fight easy bro. We are very proud of u Africa is still reigning and ruling the world
izzy is right about the 30% not being enough
Izzy is on a level never seen before. He's on a historical streak now. Tonight was a GOAT status with a technic and skill level we have never seen before.
I love this dude.
Izzy is the most skilled striker in MMA along with Wonderboy
If you hate Izzy you’re hating on success
Whos Next for Israel?? 🤔🤷‍♂️
Cool guy
This dude is so afraid to fight John Jones.
My mannest man.... Izzzy congrats.... I always knew you will win.... That over hyped Brazilian
You guys are all blaming Costa. Isreal fought better better here . He would have done the same to Romero if they fight again. Isreal has worked on his upper strengths here. His punches got harder . U need to be in that cage to feel it. Costa felt it and lost his confidence. And lsreal tried to take punches here which he didn't do in Romero fight. He looks ready here. And believe me, u don't want to be in a ring with isreal when he doesn't look scared. He did the same to Robert . He wasn't scared. As a Nigerian, I knew he was scared a little with Romero. But he did learn from that fight. He would kill Romero next time.
Adensaya mereceu ganhar aquele borrachinha é um otario metido a besta ,,bunda mole que pensa ser o bom
My man was war ready
Yes, Izzy. Beat up the bully, like to hear that.  Wish Connor McGregor faced someone like Izzy.
Izzy is a G.O.A.T 🐐
I hate whoever uploaded this video with spoilers before I was able to see the fight. Unsubbed, but the fights were great!
Kinda strange how his closest fight was against the Italian dream.....
Ill never doubt this guy ever again.
COSTA IS A BULLY
Gyno
Izzy his nice gyno titty to go with his earring
No speak English
Please translate 😫😫
I told you so.Izzy and still @Ufc253.
I am A FAN of Azzy from today.
ELE É KARATECA FRIO CALCULISTA NÃO DESPERDIÇA GOLPES NEM ENERGIA ESPERA HORA CERTA SABE MANTER A DISTANCIA E ATACAR NA HORA CERTA NO LUGAR CERTO
Cant stand listening to him ramble on. Great fighter, just pipe it down a little
Izzy made it easy. I could see the fear in @PauloCosta's eyes at the introduction by @BruceBuffer. Well done Champ. Getting better and better
costa will probably never get another title shot until izzy gets defeated by khamzat
Who is left that has any chance against this man
I’m just disappointed in humans when it comes to just giving credit where it’s due. I was hearing the whole time how Costa was an animal and he was gonna destroy Izzy. Costa looked like an amateur fighter vs Izzy. Makes me question Costa’s fast rise in the ranks.
GOAT
thanks izzy winning it for the buillied
Katana blade ?!!!! 😃😃😃😃
Israel Adesanya vs Jon Jones. Thats it. That's the fight.
He's Special🔥 Love the bully shout out. Gotta stand up to the bullies in any form. RESPECT ✊
Israel adensaya is the truth I baltently doubted him for this fight but he's the real deal
Costa was pressing the taunt button too much.
Izzy can talk !
I never liked Issy before this fight  but I liked his last message about bullying.
That moment when Yoel Romero did a better job than Costa
Where the haters at? Izzy styled on your boy
i enjoyed watching all you bigots hate izzy simply because he is black and nothing else.  you bigot white boys what about now? i love the facts 90% of Hispanics and whites were finding fake reasons to hate izzy simply because he was black lol
WOW I thought Costa would bring more then that... Good job Izzy !!!
I couldn’t love this guy more. Wonderful showing. Fantastic role model. Long reign the Champ! 🤘🏼
20-0 wins and 100th win in all combat fights — he didn’t get here by trash talking
Ricky Martin *BOTCHED*
I knew it was over when Izzy called him Romero 😂
In his way to be GOAT
Costa looked sapped. That weight cut had him
Izzy " I tooold you guys" Adesanya
Called it. I honestly don't believe UFC takes care of its fighters. They should be measuring testicles and bone density before putting them up against each other. Ur secret ain't a secret adesanya. It's testosterone. Been having a genetic advantage over your opponent's.
He’s a London roadman “he ain’t about that life” 😂😂
Isreal is super extremely FUNNY LoL Hahahaha 😆😂 Hahahaha LoL Hahahaha 😆😅😅
Naruto vs Sasuke reference 😂
"Too much weights and not enough speed" Jake the muss - once were warriors
I think all conors fans will have jumped over to izzy now
Costa so easy to dislike glad he.lost.
Israel you make me proud
Congratulations to you Israel. You done it e
We've been saying this for an age! The Last Stylebender, Champion of the World!!
He talks like a weeb I like it
He is annoying!!
I laugh those who say conor is the best striker. Connor has not koed any top contender bigger than his size, he has only knocked midgets in featherweight division and a washed up cerrone. If conor and   izzy are made of same weightclass then izzy would eat him alive in standup.
2008 spider silva wud eat this fool
Fighting is not all about punching and energy but being smart too. Adesanya did it against Romero now Costa. Congrat Izzy
costa didn't show up at all izzy put him in a genjutsu
My boy izz
I guess it
a great fighter but be humble, apparently bullied at school? he acts and talks like an arrogant black american rapper but is a New Zealander?
Izzy has solidified himself in my opinion. Dude is on his way to a GOAT
King of the middleweight Izzy
Costa can't vary his tactics and is stupid enough to try kickbox a kickboxer who is faster (Adesanya). Costa is a BJJ black belt he could have surprised Adsesanya with e.g. a takedown. MASSIVE FART NOISE! to Costa's performance.
It’s so hilarious seeing the comments before the fight. Izzy deniers say he’s going to get knocked out, why? What makes you think such an elite striker is going to get knocked out as if it’s his first rodeo. Shows how dumb so many people are assuming “muscle man beat skinny man” mentality.  Timing beats power and accuracy beats speed don’t you listen to Conor McGregor?
Still baffles me when people say "Why didn't Costa just come-forward like he usually does?". This is his first 5 round fight. That would've been an idiotic strategy seeing as how he was clearly gassed after just 2 rounds against Romero. No fighter goes into a championship fight thinking "I have to win it in the 1st or 2nd round". If they're intelligent, they prepare themselves to possibly go all 5 rounds. I knew before this fight even started that there was a 0% chance Costa would just charge forward, swinging wildly and gassing himself out.
How can you not like Adesanya? Sharp.
Izzy  is just gonna keep getting better. He is a Puzzle and a very Dangerous one 👑
BOOOOM!.....right in the kisser!
Congratulations brother.
Energy? The guy cut too much weight.
Easy win for Izzy
Disappointed Costa didn’t show up 👎 That’s not the costa we seen fighting everyone else was it?
Everyone has plan until they get a low kick from Adesanya
Fighters should never ignore leg kicks. You get one - you give one. Hope Khabib rememebres that when he faces Justin!
Are we just gonna ignore the fact that Izzy humped costa?
Issy will be remembered as well if not better than Anderson Silva. Like his style and his skill set. Not always a fan of the trash talk but I get it helps sell fights. Glad he puts out the message on bullies. Just think when he was a kid he was bullied! He should pull up on those that bullied him. Mind you they are probably in the gutter so no need to even acknowledge them! Hope young people take his message on bullies!
So that akatsuki t was to tell the fans he was going for beast hunting. OBITO'll be proud.
That "run for your life" promo looks all worthless now doesn't it? To all those Haters!!!😂😂
Costa literally showmanshiped and paced himself to TKO 🤦🏽‍♂️ congratz to Israel
Where are Paulo's interviews??
I was just wondering when some people think that Israel will be running away from Costa inside the ring. It's not all about Physicality, your muscles etc. It's all about your inner energy. Shame on those who thought Izzy will run away from this huge for nothing amateur called Costa who thinks he can just enter the ring and just bully every fighter by just rushing them to hit them.
To anyone who thought the fight was boring: 1) His fights are ALWAYS better when you REPLAY it and watch all the details of his GAME! 2) If you STILL find him boring in rewatching- you PROBABLY NEVER SPARRED or don't know how to fight well! Israel is an intelligent fighter who uses MANY tricks in his game! I LOVE watching him in replay! The fight looked boring/quick to me live but I ENJOYED it the 2nd time around! He made Costa "run" in the 2nd rd and he wanted to punish him in Ground and Pound but the ref stopped it!
Such a character! Bash those bullies!!
Unbeatable Adesanya
Now Izzy let's discuss the elephant in the room... Your gyno....
Imagine Izzy words during the first few seconds were the words of Diego Sanchez. You guys would tell him he is crazy.
Costa got exposed, you could actually see the fear on his face, that was no poker face. Izzy sized him up the other day and said when he shook his hand and grabbed his shoulder, the man felt soft, he looked it last night.
Dana”costa v adesanya is gonna be fight of the year”white
Can’t see him losing by anyone now , but tbf it might be the guys we think will lose may destroy him - I thought costa was gonna win mainly cause of brute force
Khamzat, that's all i have to say. GOODLUCK
I Know You’re Mad, Stay Salty
I think Costa simply felt the effects of sudden weight loss and sleep deprivation. He's far better than this performance tonight.
Someone asked me why I was a fan of Izzy. I responded that "his confidence and skill is in perfect measure, he will be a dope UFC champ and I put money on it". Long story short........here we are. Feels good to be right.
Lovely
Izzy is great, but he's cocky and it's annoying. Even if he can back it up he's just unlikeable.
This is what happens when you combine Anime obsessiveness with elite athleticism.
Closest costa got to finishing Izzy off was when Izzy gave him those two pumps at the end
Now he wanna back off jones
"I will make it look easy" - Adesanya 2019. He sure did make it look easy.
These haters will bring up chamev to beat him.
Costa looked for the opportunity to do boxing. Adsanya was very smart by keeping him away using that low kicks. Perfect tactics
Team white belt for LIFE! F u BULLIES
Costa got 🐕 style.. 😅
Izzy "Hippie Crystal Energy Genki Dama" Adesanya
Reminds me of a young Anderson Silva
So many haters got hurt tonight and I love it! Crazy how people can hate on another human being!   Pretty sad actually.
And still !!!
He is not losing to any kickboxer.. he is a kick boxing champ .. GRAPPLERS ARE THE BEST FIGHTERS
Crazy to think that gastelum put a better performance than Robbie and Paulo costa
Okay give him Khazmat 😂😂😂
I am very sure if Israel had let Costa rush in like a raging bull, he still would've got picked apart and still knocked out. And some would've still it was the wrong tactics from Costa... he should've been more patient and conserve his energy. Lol  Izzy made him miss a lot... Costa gets dominated either ways. Respect where it's due!!
Bit of a Cocky Kunt.. still has a bit of young guy Ego. Still hasn’t lost yet... GSP would destroy him 👍🦶😎
He’s a fantastic fighter but the arrogance is so cringe.
He looks even better than before. Great skill/mindset, iq, movement etc. Only thing left to see is him against a high level grappler that actually grapples in the cage. Romero just doesnt, even though being an olympian wrestler. Chimaev would be interesting one if he manages to keep winning.
Israel *Usain Bolt* Adesanya
Izzy is becoming a goat and I’m glad everyone hating on dude cause it’s just gonna make him wanna shut the haters up even more where’s the cringe Acosta fans at saying he was gonna get “ERASED” 😂 knew acosta didn’t have it in him to beat him Izzy is gonna be untouchable in middleweight and this fight definetly just sealed that
It’s odd he’d talk about bullying with all the trash talk and personal comments towards Costa beforehand. Making fun of his English language skills etc. Pure cheap shots and the classic bully move. Almost borders on racism. He did mentally affect Costa with this and break him down this way. This, in my view, is not an honourable way to be and belt aside, it should feel like a hollow victory.
I want to see him against Jon Jones.
Did Adesanya just say naruto and sasuke in the middle of an interview.  HE IS THE  BEST, CHAMPION.
Where is Chris Weidman?
Ricky Martin out there "Livin-la-leg-a-broke-a"
Izzy turned Paulo to Paula in less than 2 rounds.
Izzy is a really good man, I’m not just saying that lightly.
Izzy thanks for dedicating this to all those that have been bullied in their life🤴🏾🤴🏾👍👍🥇🥇
Costa was too stiff... you need agility ... not just being a muscle head
I honestly don't wanna see Costa again he barks too much
Some says he has changed when he has always been himself..🙏
This commentary team is honestly terrible
Where are all the haters that said Costa was gonna destroy Izzy? Y‘all always talk so much just so your fighter gets dominated when will y‘all learn to stfu until they actually fight
The Last Genderbender.
where are all the people mocking Izzy and calling him a runner? the comment section was full of them a few days ago haha weird
He's using ogun he even put it in his Instagram story
Khamzat gonna Smesh Skinny Claw Adesanya
Costa didn't fight like costa, he fought like izzy and paid the price.
“Izzy will get knocked out” where ya’ll casuals at?
Not fight of the year like Dana predicted, but Conor vs Sanches is going to be a war👁
Me (30 yr old) going to punch my 73 year old dad lol
at first Adesanya look for me a little pretentious, nothing impressive to beat small fighters, but the more I see him beat the best, more I'm impressed by the technique of counterpunch...congratulation.. but where the black belt jujistu Costa, he would propably more chance to win to try the ground after 5 minutes of Powerlessness
Did my man do a nauruto shout? hahahahahahahaaaaa
NICK DIAZ IS COMING BACK👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Izzy had gyno, doing some sort of juice for sure. Look at his right pec!!!
Izzy looked amazing but he likes his own voice a bit too much
"Izzy never fought at high level boxing tournament" the haters are 🤫
He is still idiot though.
5:27 naruto vs sasuke. So jared is sasuke? I dont know jared is otaku
One hard  brawler other technical striker with best backfoot counter punch.... Definitely the latter wins.... Sad for costa he looked pretty much confused in this match what he should do next (he is a good fighter)but Izzy is real champ.... He has similarity wit Goats silva and Jones.... He will b joining them in goat list soon...
Izzy was scared, that's why he blasted the roids💉 source: Gyno right titty.👍
Wrong game plan from Costa but he'll be back and be mixing it back up with the best
That was a flawless victory. ....
Time to buy the same earing as stylebender
Poor Costa . Most brazilians are devastated.
Middleweight is not for Izzy. His height is a really big problem.
He bangs he bang oh baby and he moves
He's got cannonier then hermanson lined up
Where are all the white belts for life ahahaha
Long legged black men are the future of MMA😁
Izzy gave him the one pump special after the finish 😂
Israel "Final Boss" Adesanya
Your so annoying obviously a p.o.s. can't wait til you have a real apponent not people that baby you
Imagine fighting a guy who's taller than u. And faster than u. And smarter...
It would be cool if Nick whooped him
Yo who is new new zealander here? I am
I told you all Casuals the only Goat in the modern era (not including guys like dc, Jones) is israel adesanya not Khabib
Great day, LeBron advanced to the finals, Izzy beat tf outta Costa, Charlo brothers won, and a new episode of power came on. Good day
On PAPER.....ERASER defeats The PENCIL... Sadly..the Octagon is not PAPER...ERASER just got thrashed by the PENCIL
You heard him folks. If your dad is being mean to you punch him in the face
Love that dude 💪🏾🇳🇬👑🤙 also it’s crazy that there’s an Espn guy that doesn’t seem like a totally degenerate for once!!! Good stuff
cringe
No matter how good he is, he and triple ccc should just have a super cringe contest. This guy i think now takes the cake for cringiest person of the year
Izzy humped costa after the stoppage, the disrespect 😂😂
Us white folks needs to stick together....  did u see the guys face 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😂😂😂😂😂
Izzy really has to stop scrolling through the comments at the casuals 🤦‍♂️
I like how izzy slowly took Paul's place
Has a point about the weight
Izzy is insane.. but my god he is CRINGEEEEEE
This guy is a brilliant fighter.. But cringy af😖
How does costa bounce back from this lol? He got humiliated by Izzy. Then his whole team got sexually assaulted by the champ lmao 😂
Awesome message at the end to all bullies
Izzy is jin mori
I wish to see STEPHEN THOMPSON VS ISRAEL ADESANYA in middleweight that would be a real super fight!!
Israel I’m some hippie adesanya
According to Stephen A. Smith, this guy is box office!!!
6:25 thank you Izzy mean a lot.🙏🏿
Told everyone 😂
20-0 how can he only have a 9 win streak lol
Fighter vs Body builder, this one seemed a vintage Ufc bout.
Im not fat im skinny bro 😂😂😂😂😂
Call him Paul Cuz Izzy took his O
Izzy now has a severe case of Gynomastia,  another unnatural fighter.
Anyone else notice the gyno on izzy ? Looks like he hopped on some type of gear
The guy's a grown man that watches Dragon ball Z and dances about like a clown. Just helped make the UFC more of a joke. Congrats.
Izzy is always to there faces for the perfect knock out....congrats Champ!!!
He backed up his own words. Period
Izzy ko Costa in the pocket. Would of never seen that coming. Izzy on of the greats
What y'all think about giving up 80-90% purse if you miss weight ? 🤔
I’m 35 and I look up to Israel, what a great champion.
He's on another dimension in fighting
I love izzy
The 🐐!!! I see him retiring undefeated in the UFC. The Mayweather of MMA.
Adesanya💙, go bruh💪💥
Yes sir style bender
Im so glad Israel won!
Massive respect to the Champ
I like what he said at the end, gone up in my opinion now
I like what he said at the end, gone up in my opinion now
I really don't see anyone beating him anytime soon
Ricky Martin botched... Turned up.
Cringey arrogant champion
adesanya vs mcgregor or khabib
You've gotta respect @KevinGastellum, and he's not even in this fight...
izzy shippuden adesanya
20-0, 2020!!!! I always struck with you Izzy congratulation’s brotha🤙🏼💪🏼
It was simple the pressure was to much for paulo costa
✌🏾🙏🏾🐜
Smart vs power Smart win!
Rematch please.
Lol.. he may be skinny,    I bet you can't touch him.
The pencil erased the eraser!!!
He was slow because he was drained from cutting weight clear as day
I love Izzy but why does he keep dodging “that” question 😔
Where are the Paulo as*lickers
Izzy beats Jon at 205. No doubt
🙏
Like a kitana blade.😯
Izzy is weak, he is always weak. How does it feel to be KO by a weak guy. A white belt guy.
Its obvious the physical attributes have really nothing to with FIGHTING, For example go and watch Andy Ruiz vs AJ , Roy nelson , Butterbean and Israel.
BROO HE TOOK STEROIDS!! THID ID CRAZY HE GOT SOO SHOOK HE TOOK STEROIDS COSTA WAS DEFFINETLY IN HIS HEAD SAD MAN 😩 HE SHOULD HAVE JUST DONE A RASENGAN
“I will break him.” - Paulo Costa
He said he was going to turn Costa to a “botched” Ricky Martin and he did.
Adesanya dry humping Paulo will go down in History as one of the greatest jujitsu moments and  will end up in the UFC hall of fame,ya'all mark my words.
Do you guys understand why Romero done nothing for 5 rounds now? You cant out move Izzy it's a chess match and every time you move your one step closer to Check mate.
Jones is afraid Israel is the next goat
Costa couldn't hide his fears
Yoel beat both of them
Khamzat will take the belt from Israel in the future ;)
5:25 WOAH, NARUTO vs SASUKE... yeah stylebender a true martial artist
izzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzy yesssssssssssssssss
Costa stopped himself by trying not to gas out. Neither did he strike nor did he defend.  Respect to both the fighters. Both maintain a good record
ODIO A ADESANYA... ME HUBIESE QUE GANASE COSTA
The Teddy Atlas breakdown of Izzy vs Kelvin was amazing. Anyone who missed it needs to go check it out.
Did Izzy go on a rant and they cut it lol
Thats what happens when you underestimate the best fighter in the world Costa did a mistake paid a heavy price
Izzy has that classic Kiwi humor and style. It’s classic watching the American hosts trying to make sense of it all. Well done to the champ.
All you muppets saying Costa wasn't letting his hands go Costa wasn't him self Costa this Costa that. You cant let your hands go with Izzy he will catch you it was just a matter of time the same would have happened  to Yoel Romero that's why he stayed stagnant
All that talk of Costa will just move forward and does not care? Lol. He literally pressured and opened himself exploded and then stepped back, and everytime he did that he drained his energy and kept getting hit, poor gameplan for costa.
You could see on Paulo that he wasn't mentally there.
Imagine beating yoel romper and pauly costa
Dominated Costa from start 2 finish 😂 Excellent 'title' DEFENCE from the SKINNY guy who's still the champ 🙄🤔😁
Very Great champion.
Awesome win from Isreal✊🏿👌🏿🐐🔥 Making Nigeria and Africans around the world proud🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿 Costa should taunt less and fight more next time
Izzy vs Baki. Now that's a fight
And Chimaev is calling him out already. Kids.
If he will ever be beaten first person to beat him will be a wrestler
That bullying speech was cringe but I'll let it slide this guy is a different level lol no doubts about him anymore
livin la vida costa exploited
Yeah brother I knew from day 1 you was gonna smoke that muppet haha he was scared asf watching your last fight haha No one can fucc with you brother LEESSSHHGOOOOOO
Who let him get film on itachi bruh😂
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Race y’all to troll the Runner Sanya video Costa put out.
Guys, how overpowered is precision? He didn't even full on hit Costa with that knockdown punch and he still went...And that guy ate some BIG shots in the Romero fight oO
Sasuke, he knows.
I hope some of you go to bed with full of tears!! We eat fufu in Africa!!
Izzy is so good at fighting that god made him cringe to balance things out.
Izzy is officially 100-5 when you combine his kickboxing and MMA record. I think it'll be a good idea for his opponents to know Izzy's background.
I WANT EXCUSES WHY COSTA LOST😂😂😂🧢
Costa scared of five rounds.
White belt just knocked out a black belt 😆
GYNO!
This what would have happen if yoel tried to engage more too. Wasn't boring cause of izzy.
Israel vs prime Machida would be fun to watch
Adesanya earnd my respect he talks the talk and walks the walk! i believe he has the skills to finish Jones he's that good!!!
That wasn't even a fight. It was terrible. The fights for 2020 have been garbage for the vets. 🙄
Thanks Izzy I’m gonna go knock out my dad rn
Costa did not deliver. His best attribute is classes lower that Izzy’s kickboxing and distance control. Hats down, champion for a reason.
These two are terrible at interviewing - the clearly don't like Adesanya..
told dummies Izzy had him lmao
Wow. Job well done. "That leg is trashed"
Right in the kisser.. 👊🏼
Pos Izzy at the Nigerian voodoo again?
Why Costa not use L2 and R2 ?
I fn love you IZZY
He is counter puncher and he is the best better than Conor  and want to see him fight a real wrestle like khabib
Nice bully message Champ.. Respect and bless up.
apparently Costa training with Logan Paul made him start to fight like him
Adesanya still champ, new gyno.
Paulo costa needs to fight robert Whittaker
Izzy has just such a cringe personality man it’s just a train wreck what he does to his opponents then the interviews after are always a train wreck as well
for the first 5kicks landed on costa, i knew the fight was over, Izzy was too fast
Energy dont lie - Israel adesanya
I can feel your energy - israel adesanya
Don’t think costa was mad, more like over cautious and got outclassed.
The champ slowly creeped to center stage. 😂😂
Now, it's  Izzy's fault for packing out Costa too fast "Izzy runs out of the cage too fast" Give credit where credit is due "Adesanya is too good and too FAST"
pretty much he said,  knockout your dad and dry hump him  6:47
my boi Izzy with Sharingan (^ ^ ) that's a truth... EVERY THING YOU SEE CAN BE A LIE
Boom right in the kisser
Someone ask him about chameav
Remove Anderson Silva from the record books. He is tainted with all his PED use.
I thought if someone was going to get knocked out in the first 2 rounds it would be izzy. I thought if he survived those rounds then it would be over for costa but I was surprised to see costa fighting the way he did and I was surprised that it was izzy who finished the fight in the first 2 rounds.
I wanted Costa to win, but I knew he wouldn’t. Izzy folded him like a lawn chair...
But he was just bullying khamzat for having a cleft lip tho
I  have to admit, I like the guy
Amazing performance
Why is no one talking about GYNO Izzy got? Besides us
Greatest Taijutsu user!😂
Someone needs to ask Izzy what is up with the right nipple.
Cant belive I doubted him
Cant belive I doubted him
The old izzy is back,the one before the romero fight. Was hoping we'd get him back! On point
Love what he said about bullies. Mad respect
Can't agree with Izzy enough...who wants to be punching bag in the cage?  Fighters with this mentality will have a long career.
🇳🇬🇳🇬
That was a much more hesitant version of Costa. He was on his backpedal and letting Izzy pick him apart at bay. Dana hyped it up too much saying Costa would march forward with reckless abandon, lmao.
Can anyone explain what was up with izzy and his chest was he sick or are we going to call it gyno. I mean good fight good win but whats good with your dropping breast.
That ain't Naruto, that was six paths Madara.
Costa was for sure in izzy's head,he should have fought his fight right from the start instead of trying to unload in 3,4 & 5 th round..props to izzy,.
Izzy did exactly what he said he would
give Izzy a period pad cause he a puss
93 costa fans disliked this interview!
oh so anyone that bullies me i just deck them in the face? Bet.
Considering how Costa’s parody video had Izzy running for his life a few weeks back, this time Izzy didn’t run at all and not a scratch on his face. I feel embarrassed for Costa, compubox had Costa throwing less than 10 punches in 2 rounds.
Is.he the 🐐
give him chimaev.....
6:06 "I'm a white belt too"   :D :D :D :D :D
boy said naruto and sasuke... mann this dude the champion of the weebs
White Belt Genin is Hokage level UFC Champ
Cant see anyone beating this guy . I thought Costa would cause him major problems and he made it easy .
Paulo never really starts throwing until he gets his opponent against the cage, which he never did to Izzy
The GOAT 🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🔥🔥🤪
Izzy answered all the trash talk with a win... skinny is winning
1:42 “My skinny shins sliced him open like a katana blade” LOOOL
I was like...that was dope the way they cut it with the trigger pull, and then Stephen A's voice came in and ruined everything.
I told you Costa fans that Israel adesanya will win stupid people style bender is too good I'm telling you
Paulo "Tyrone Woodley" Costa being the Chosen One.
Izzy is a real life created player, just racking up W’s until his longevity meter runs out.
I said 2 years ago that this cat is gonna be an all-time-great.......and believe me.......he will!!
Izzys right titty looks like he been on the juice bruce!! Cant stand a cheater
Jesus they should have cut him off at a couple of minutes. He just embarrassed himself bad.
Costa only improved on his English lessons and forgot to focus on Israel
Don't know why he complains about being skinny
Izzy 💯
Costa thought it would be too obvious if he used punches so he only used kicks
The dude came out clean. Face smooth af
I thought Izzy was cringe af leading up to this fight, and I thought he took the lower road in most verbal exchanges... and for that reason, I was rooting for Costa... only because I thought Izzy needed to be humbled a little bit... but, after it's all said and done.. you cannot hate on this performance... it was so tactically perfect, it blew me away... Izzy talks too much smack but he is a real champion. As an aside, I wish Costa came out as himself, but, he does not deserve a rematch right now, he's got to win at least 2 before coming back at Izzy. Let's see if he has the heart.
I had money on Costa to win, but there’s no doubt Izzy really is just so comfortable in that octagon
Costa showed himself practicing so many rib breaking body shots in his videos he posted. Zero were thrown in the fight
I be falling in and out of love with Izzy
hes a champ and a legend for sure but hes gotta be one of the biggest mainstream dorks ive ever seen its amazing smh
Enough wit da lameee anime references alr bruhhhh.....
Absolutely undeniable talent. Unbearable personality.
The end of the interview!!!
Look like adesanya do not want to talk about Jon jones
Is energy wasn't about that life
Great fight Israel. Great work.
Izzy being concerned for his teammate in the middle of his win is super humble
LETSGO IZZY!!! AND STILL.. 🔥🇳🇿💪🏼
Izzy is smart he got into Paulo’s head
Congrats Izzy, true Champ
Costa took the L like a man
Me: Celebrating Izzy win Izzy: Looks in camera: I know your mad Me: No? Izzy: Stay salty bae Me: What?
Nobody cares about Izzy
Israel stay water my friend much live from Naija
Connor McGregor chuck lidell Anderson Silva Ronda Rousey all examples of people who talked the talk and walked the walk be careful Izzy big talk is all good till it’s over....most kids who are bullied and learn to fight don’t even realize they become bullies themselves so enjoy it Izzy if I was khamzat I would silently dominate till Izzy is 40ish then shut u up
No one has brought up how flabby Izzy's titty was and how suspect of roids that is.
Nah bro all y'all that were prayin on izzy downfall quit showing fake love now
Everytime I think he can't get any more cringe he goes to another level. Great fighter but christ what a tool
Izzy does a brilliant post fight interview. Lot of good stuff he comes out with. Sharp mind.
The best gift of gab since Conor
The Hokage of the ufc believe it
Israel is a bad mother fucker best kickboxer and now the best middle weight of all time and I think he is gonna take Anderson Silvas spot forsure
Not even u can make me show my hands he did it with a middle finger to John Jones they cut it out for yt lol
🔥🌎⚒️BROKEN☠️NATIVE⚒️🌍🔥
Too much weights not enough speed work 🍻
khamzat is coming izzy............. be ready...
Wait until Chimaev gets to the top of the pyramid
Can’t believe casuals actually thought he was gonna lose.
Izzy please fight Colby next. White supremacy has to go down too
But what was up with his peck? I'm legit wondering that, all pouched and swollen. injury? Or Gyno?
Tyson Fury would stop him.
The African Warlord
Israel have a sharingan of itachi 🤘😈😈😈🤘
Well I think izzy is going to be champ like forever until his best days are behind him. With yoel, robert, kelvin, costa out of the pic and crossed in a list. Hes the best middle weight.
Costa tuff and so is yoel,  but they are use to bullying the opponent,  izzy is the definition of anti bully , or bully cryptonite in fighting and in life dude is mentally prepared for any situation
Thanks Israel
so much swagger and intelligence were witnessing right now in the sport of mma.
I Love these man so much because my lifestyle, movement,  skinny, talkative ,sensitive, and lastly truthful like him,  but I m white  Good job my man
1:51 he licked his mic like Tyson Fury licked Wilder's neck
Should be 70% of purse and a point a pound.
please don’t be on juice Izzy,  like this dude alot
This man is *DIFFERENT* 👑🐐
Only way to beat Izzy is on  EA UFC 4 LOL
That was so freaking great to watch!
Can we please accept that Izzy is the best striker in the ufc
Izzy’s on ped’s.  Needs to fix that right pec.
That’s why I’m a fan of izzi even though he smashed our champ rob Whitaker he is a real one and he is himself doesn’t hide anything from people. Be yourself like he told the analyst.
I love UFC but am a bit of a casual but can anyone answer why Costa and Romero don't try to take Izzy down? Surely that's what he is weakest it  Is it that they can't even get close? They're scared of being caught rushing in? Surely at some point they can grab him or shoot for a takedown
Congratulations to Israel Adesanya. God bless . I’m a Jon Jones fan , but I think it’s Israel’s time ,  Bless him .
Big mouth
Izzy said he was gonna make it look easy and look what he did.
Special
izzy mastered ultra instinct  if you know you know
GYNOGATE 2020
Costa trusted his chin too much
All props to him as a great fighter ...  But it's about respect and sportsmanship
Whats up with the gyno on the right pec?
In the dirt make it hurt
Adesanya’s reign is going to last a long time now.
Too IZZY!
adesanya did mention about Naruto n Sasuke...what an honor to Us the Manga readers...lol
Izzy talks so much about how you can’t get in his head etc, but all he talks about is what haters say and how they underestimate him and y’all must have forgot.  He takes it all personal.  Nothing wrong with doubting  some skinny dude 😂 it’s a natural tendency to pick the bigger fighter.  Don’t take it personal Izzy 😆 😭
Where tf is Angela Hill?! She was the main reason I wanted to watch this interview.
Adesanya broke the UFC Game cover Curse.
Where is Costa's  post fight interview?
Schooled the f out of Paula. If izzy was a little more humble and likeable outside the cage I'd be a fan.
You a king 👑 🇳🇬
Costa just didn’t have a plan
Great fighter, but 2nd only to Colby Covington as UFCs cringiest talkers. I wish everyone would stop trying to be Coner McGregor. I've seen Izzy on small, not well known podcasts with his friends. He's actually very engaging just being himself. He doesn't need this cringey act.
I wonder what it feels like to have talked all that you know what and not back it up. Bullying.
Izzy is the G O A T
that little speech at the end was good
Cannonier? Still the same. Jared get dominated and TKOd
My dude izzy humped him twice lol
Man, I love his energy!!
Props to Izzy for handling business but to say you KNEW costa was going to you’re lying or a casual fan.
Ask him about his gyno next time. And this guy dares to call out others on PEDs. What a joke!
Lol wheres the haters lesko izzy
Everyone has a plan until their leg is chewed up and they’re in a kickboxing match with Anderson Silva Jr....
why does izzy have gyno
He gets better with every fight. Very tactical, study his opponents well. A true champ
Note to Casuals! calling Adesanya Skinny unlocks God Mode . Its the Cheat Code
2019: Izzy Wins Fight of The year  2020 pre-Covid: Casual fans after he fought Romero, “IzZY Is BoRInG”  2020: during Covid Izzy Smokes 💨 Costa 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I like the way he broke down how IZZY fight to be the first time seeing him fight. Awwwww great job IZZY.
GynoSanya all the steroids
This guy just runs , Costa didn't even land a punch on him cause Izzy kept backing away, Even when Costa backed Izzy on the cage , Izzy just juked aside and went back to the middle.  Man's be running laps in the UFC thinking he Usain Bolt
..let the excuses begin
Izzy schooled and skilled Paulo..
Always underestimated..
Costa had only beat fat Johnny Hendricks and 54 year old Yoel. Israel has fought killer after killer in the UFC and went 75-5 as a pro kickboxer. Idk what people thought would happen.
Now if only he dropped some of the cringe.
Did izzy just broke the 2k curse? 😱
Izzy popped the overly inflated balloon animal called Costa :)
What’s crazy is kelvin gastelum has been the only true challenge to adesanya yet has lost consecutively since
Adesanya breakdancing 2 feet away from Costa as he’s getting treated on the ground will forever be hilarious
very well said IZZY! Great performance and great message!
Paulo Erazer?
He reminds me of the Avatar....I don't know why though
THE MOMENT WHEN HE STARTED SLICING PAULO'S LEG DOWN I KNEW THESE BLADE GONNA CHEW THE WHOLE TREE DOWN FROM ROOTS TO THE FRUITS
Did anyone else saw gynecomastia on his chest 👀💉💉
That's my guy!
izzy wins
Adesanya vs. McGregor
Boa nego amei
I'm sure this guy do black magic before all of hes fights.  Thats what African Brothers Budu black magic.  This are not real wins for sure.
Izzy trying to say he gassed?? This guys ego is insane.. humps Paulo and pretends to cum on his opponent’s coach. Not really like watching his point fighting anymore
3:50 needs to be a point deduction
"Ishael is chameful shampion" - Paulo Costa
First Kamaru is on EPO, now Asesanya is on roids?😂😂😂..the hate doesnt stop
Wher are all the Costa fans at now? Bunch of busters. You have no idea what you talkin about hahahaha ... suka Fuka MC's!! Ric Flair Wooooooooooooo!!!🕺🏽
Jon Jones vs Izzy  this is the fight
Staying at white belt is like staying at genin, then became a hokage...lol another naruto reference...
"Robert is calm compared to him." "Paulo is in his head." So curious to see what the Israel haters will say before his next fight. He's cringy at times, but he's undoubtedly the best MW and possiblyy best striker in the UFC right now.
Never forget how Izzy gave Costa two victory pumps
Wow what a skill difference. Izzy so composed in there. And his accuracy is deadly
Was it Paulo costa or Romero again? 😬
This boy is too skinny, this boy does not have power or strength, this boy can't last 2 seconds, I know you are scared and I'm gonna beat Costa before the fight  Izzy...... don't worry let's get into the cage boy
My boy mindsmash is gonna dissect this vid for sure! Congrats! Izzy.
He can tear apart khamzat in round one ... Israel is just on another level
Israel “Katana shins” Adesanya
MMA figters are already underpaid. 80% is WAY too much. Maybe 50%
Wow, if Gaethje lands leg kicks like that to Khabib, we might see a new lightweight campion next month.
Congrats to Izzy. Never counted him out since he beat Whittaker. This guy is something to watch. Congrats👏👏👏👏
Victory
Should I know who the commentator on the far left is????? Who dat guy?
The Last Gynobender, "Everyone is on steroids" - Nick Diaz
Protect this guy at all cost
Kinda a sore winner im not even a costa fan
Costa did not belong in there with izzy.. Very disapointing
I love the face he just shuts up the commentator regarding John jones
Cant wait for the izzy humble's costa video
Adesanya after Max vs Volkanovski : Numbers don’t lie Alex outstriked him  Adesanya on ESPN : Numbers might lie
“My skinny shin sliced him up like a katana blade” I’m so disappointed he didn’t say “Sliced him up like a wind shiriken” 🤣
Congrats to Marques Brownlee on his win tonight
Real champions don’t roid, that Gyno pec proves you arent a real champion
How is everyone not talking about how Bauchwicz tore Reyes apart.    Reyes got KNOcKED THE F OUT  But Casta got completely outclassed.
I don’t like Izzy but it’s clear that he might become the GOAT soon if no one stops him. He can beat all the Middleweights, Welterweights, Light Heavyweights, and Heavyweights.
Not making weight should be a blatant foul and start u off with a point deduction
All the UFC keyboard specialists saying Paulo in Izzy head, Izzy scared, blabla where are you now? Where the energy? RESPECT THE GOAT AND NEVER FORGET THE BEATING YOUR GUY RECEIVED TODAY 😂😂👊🏿👊🏿🇳🇬🇳🇬
The haters got disappointed by Costa now they are back to talking about the Romero fight its hilarious 😂🤣
When he talk about energy,you know he talk about chakra
All the bandwagons who backed up costa magically switched to izzys team 🙄🙄😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
He’s gonna make ufc bigger than boxer
Anybody notice his Gyno?
Izzy the man of the year we Africans love you keep making us proud
Israel is the Lamar Jackson of MMA
"Us white belts gotta stay together." I felt that
I mean, who else is left in the division besides meeting Jones?
I won't be surprised if Costa was fighting hurt. I don't understand the gap between the way he looked tonight relative to the previous ones
I like izzy but whats up with his right side of his chest
The new UFC belt is soulless
Those leg kicks to his left knee were so nasty.  Izzy made dudes leg start bleeding from kicks. That’s some serious work and they were already welted & blue before his left leg started bleeding too.   Izzy just chopped Casta left leg apart.   Costa was fast with his 1st kick lol  but  FR once Izzy started in on him Costa got real slow.
Stop bringin up Jones let him have his time
Can't wait for mojaheds video lol
To be honest im kinda worried for the Canonnier fight, he might have a chance agains izzy but only if he manages to use his wrestling, otherwise its gonna be hard. Also, i kinda expected the fight to end like this but i though costa was gonna throw more and get KOed because of it but he didnt even do that
Izzy the 🐐
Adesanya will be KO by Khamzat! Very soon
What Izzy said about the 90 percent purse deduction for missing weight is much needed in my opinion
Can someone please make a gif out of that last little doggy style pump that Israel thrashed his pelvis on Costa casual.
100% MORE
What does "gyno" Mean?
Takeaway - DO NOT call Stylebender skinny. That activates the God Mode 😂😂
👌💕💓💓💐💓
Now am an izzy fan also...👍🏽
Muscles with no heart won’t win you a game the skinny guy busted the muscular guy
Casto was completely outclassed.
Espn+ isnt working, i cant see the post show 😒
For the bullies💥
Izzy is playful and deadly af. He’s like Naruto😭😂
I saw so so many comments saying Costa would KO Izzy round 1 today 🤦
where are the COSTA fanboys @?
Costa fan boys have crawled back into their holes. Winning takes intelligence. Not muscles d*ckheads
Transmutation is real. Teddy. Respect!!
Both are the best in their divisions, no doubt. But this has to be settled :  Who's the king of cringe? Izzy or Cejudo?
I want to see him fight jon jones. Nobody at middleweight has what it takes to give this kid a challenge
Paulo Costa and Dominick Reyes were so disappointing
Haters riding this steroid narrative,bruh he didnt kill him with power,he killed him with technique and precision
Good interview izzy....ur the man.... Just lose the american accent...
A lot of you haven't seen the fight yet.. Izzy literally did  not get touched.
vince mcmahon IS ON IZZY FOR SURE
Izzy just has a gift where he can adjust to every opponent instantly which is insane!
I was one of the guys that tough costa might be the one to beat Israel but honestly he got schooled and he'll  be hard to beat, he's too illusive and accurate
is this ufc 253 *pre* show?
Izzy is classless for that move at the end. All of you laughing if anyone did that to you, you would commit sucide
Costa fans have left the building😳😄  🚚💨!! Stylebender baby !!!
Is he even human?
Jon Jones twitter had the third best performance of the night after Izzy/jan
JON JONES RUNNING TO HVYWGHT
Breathe through your belly guys
After that head kick that cut him costa was done he started retreating and doubting his self he forgot his failure of a game plane And went back to just throwing hands (for the first time in the match ) the second round was the first real exchange of blows in the entire fight and got counter punched then he gets dropped
Anyone know where the skinny talk is
My man Israel is like itachi no one can touch him
Gynecomastia in the right chest :d
At this point I dont think jon jones would beat Adesanya anymore, if he did win im 99.9% sure jones would fail some type of PED test...
@3:07 "He only fights human punching bags"😂😂
Paula Costa got clowned!!
Adesanya spiritual?
The Last Transgender
He can keep his white belt....Izzy is the real deal. Indeed your skinny skin slice him and I love how u beat those big juicy guys
Costa is now the shampion' of the toilets.. Yuri Boyka knew what that felt like 🤔
This Izzy would decimate Khamzat...
ADESANYA IS REAL
Izzy easy 🦾❤️
Izzy haters are Colby WWE fanboys!
Gynecomastia
Costa was underwhelming.
Izzy the dry hump king this guy a savage
I can't wait till he gets drunk on Instagram and walks us thru the fight. It's the best analysis you will ever see.
look at the right chest Adesanya and see who is the chemist, Adesanya uses hormones he has gynecomastia
As an Izzy fan really hoping his right pec is some inbalance of weight during lifting or an injury, becuase if that's Gyno I'll be hurt ngl. Still, I feel he would smoked Costa either way (if he is on something). From research you can't get that much Gyno over that little time but I'll let the body language experts decide that🤣
one punch turn the black belt into white belt
Most of us called it. There is a reason Whittaker said Izzy is hard to hit, and then Costa mainly shines against "punching bags". Put those two together and it's easy to predict this would happen. Gastellum is so far the only one that pushed him.
All Adesanya haters, go and hug transformer 🤪🤪🤪. Wisdom is greater than *POWER*
The win started from the walkout song: I was nervous until I heard the song  Opomulero mojalekan shama wowon niran, spit more in your mother's tongue. 9ice was dope that year
Costa what happened didn't you expect that 🤣🤣
Haha you thought Costa could win because he was a juice head turkey meatball
costa exposed so hard ..white belt destroy him...
I thought Uncle Chael had showed up
Costa casual fan boys real quiet in the comments now
My man still had his sharingan on. Kudos, Izzy.
Izzy vs khamzat needs to happen. No hype.  2 Beasts unleashing!!!!
I feel like Izzy won’t be challenged for a while.
As he says "He Aims and 🔥 boom"
what was with izzys right pec. Did he work out that one more than the other one?
I WILL NEVER DOUBT YOU AGAIN IZZY. You are the king. Undisputed
I like how Izzy always try’s to put his coaches and teammates in the spotlight instead of himself
*Bully has left the chat*
Too easy 😮😮😮😮 Well done Mr Lastylebender I can't believe you did it.
SOOO many Paulo takers, where are you now?!
This guy is pathetic.
Izzy the 🐐. If you don't agree. Stay salty 🧂and watch your blood pressure.
All the people who got paid to spar with costa and got knocked out by him is laughing, and feel like he deserved it.  Don’t disrespect the people who are trying to get you in good condition.
Costa had twood syndrome aka couldn’t let his hands go
Steroid cheat.   You can hide from USADA... you cant hide that Gyno tho
Impressive win but he's such an unlikeable character
Unlikable
All this people sad that costa lost. I’m happy I’m an Izzy fan.
Izzy haters be like "Khamzat Chimaev will KO Izzy!!"
Great fighter yes... but pretty...sorry brother but No! 😅
Please have teddy atlas and Eugene on podcast with you! Will be epic.
He will go to the history as one of the greatest.
By the end of the interview Izzy is standing in the middle of the table haha
Your muscles are of no use if your IQ is very low 😉
Haters :"Izzy needs to travel back in time and  break Undertaker's streak at WrestleMania to be counted amongst greats".
Only True IZZY fans here 👇👇  haters 😹😹🙈... Adesanya is David vs Goliath
Winner of till vs hermanson gets Costa
Never doubted Izzy for a second,where the haters at now 😎
Walk the walk AND talk the talk. As a Costa fan I am speechless.
I think costa cut too much weight, I even said that when I saw the weigh in.  He looked gassed out on the scale by cutting weight.
He's full of himself but the only thing proven here is that Muye Thai/ Thai boxing is the BEST ART OF MARTIAL   and not boxing of karate or what ever !
Izzy is a star ⭐️ I’m not going to lie
Reality check if ANY of y’all thought Izzy was still all hype
we ALL know khamzat will eventually come and im an izzy fan
Israel is my favourite fighter until he opens his mouth.
No one gonna beat izzy in the division. He made costa looks like an amateur. How did costa became an undefeated fighter first of all🙁
Class ACT all the way.......
I now like izzy. He showed a different side to himself for the press today
Why did costa think he was still fighting Romero by making those silly faces 😳
Paulo "erased" costa
My predictions were spot on
Amazing, brilliant, charming, inspiring. Thanks Izzy!
Your opinions and hate excused.. Izzy in special.. give that man his dues.. stop denying him. Even.i couldn't be confident today..  Masterclass
I knew he’s gonna get cocky again when he wins 😂
Running right through the division
Yes he did!
I was worried but I saw what izzy posted before the fight paired with thought of how well uriah hall did i knew izzy would get em...and he man did he. He even road him like a broke back poha in the end.
He’s the most natural superstar since McGregor.
That was Izzy
Paulo got battered
💪🏿
I will watch your fight anymore...  You make it so easy.... 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Dan Hardy said it. Izzy made him look like a powerlifter smh.
Were all the Izzy haters at people said Costa was going to KO Israel but he keep flexing on them haters
Did anyone notice during the broadcast for one of the fights, Jon Anik said something like "length doesn't matter, it's how you use it". I think he was talking about range advantage, haha, but nicely snuck in Jon!
Well done style bender work hard👍
Izzy got even better. Insane.
Casuals Costa going to KO Israel : Izzy who decided that
Amazing performance! Still i wanna see him against an Khabib or Cormier type of guy. Khamzat bether keep winning.
Casuals Costa by 2 round KO : Izzy pulls reverse UNO
What's wrong with his right pec!?
Israel: Understand that. Me: Believe It.
Costa said he’s gonna be the SHAMPION  Adesanya said not on my watch
With the final dry hump
Paulo “ skinny crow Adesanya “ Costa
GOD BLESS
*”hE’S tOo SKinNy”* lmfaooooo CLOWNS 😂 Izzy has *been* the real deal
Can’t stand Izzy or this other commentator. Felders cool Tho.
"CoSta kNoWS hOw tO GeT in IzZyS HeaD" what morons😂
I'm convinced that was actually Ricky Martin and not Paulo Costa...
Izzy Bolt 🏃🏿💨💨💨
numbers don't lie..
Outspoken, entertaining, undefeated 20-0 with a striking based background and a total geek! Izzy is the people’s champ!   This was his coming out fight which solidified his status as the undisputed defending MW champion 🏆
I thought you can shrimp out of a white belts mount if you're a black belt? ...LOL
"YoU'rE tOo sKiNnY bRuH" Ladies and Gentlemen, the Hokage of UFC 😎
Costa fought such a dumb fight lol. Izzy was flawless
Costa and Romero got robbed
The black belt of the stand up game.
Haters crying
And stiiiil 👑👑👑
Lenda
Israel told you guys
hey costa fans. hold this L
First. Congratulations Champ!
Adesanya has gynecomastia
Gyno on his right side - big indication of a hormonal imbalance. He's put SOMETHING in his body
Khamzat is coming for you take all the roids you can he'll still whoop you.
I don’t wanna hear any excuses. Give this man his props. He really doesn’t have much more to prove . He gonna go down as one of the best fighters ever
Anyone notice izzy's right peck that fight?
So happy for happy for Izzy
Izzy:My skinny shin sliced him like a katana blade 🔥🔥🔥
Lmfao i still hate this fool
ISRAEL GYNOSANYA
Dana White: Costa was never my friend
First
First one to like and comment
Adesanya the ped user just look it up.
He is genius
Lmao and people think cumrat simpmav is gonna beat Izzy🤣🤣🤣
Costa: 🌀💤  Izzy: Romero?  Costa: 🤺
Where all the costa fan boys and izzy haters now🤔
