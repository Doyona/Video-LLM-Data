Finally an appropriate comment of an actress. Thank you.
And that's why u get duis
This is ridiculous.  I hate her
notice how this opinion was stated before the media backlash ; it's quite disappointing if you imagine just how many people in that room agreed with will smith's action in the moment
Ass kissing at it's greatness 🤬
Nice interview with movie actress Tiffany Haddish. LOL@Tiffany hair. Wow@Tiffany body. I wanna kiss Tiffany feet, legs, lips, shoulders. Tiffany Haddish, Caryn Ward is hot black women.
She is way too smart to believe what she is saying, especially since she herself is a comediab who likes to push limits. I understand that both jada and will took her under their wings when she started out, but there are better ways to show gratitude and loyalty
G.i. Jane was never a gay slur. It was a term used against military women. She is just making things up
Tiffany haddish is very tight with her vocabulary.
She never apologized.
As a comedian her response was inexcusable
She's ignorant
Discipline needs to be administered? Like you and Aries Spears administered to them kids on video? And they fired Justin Roiland…
She's such a disgusting person
Are we really surprised? She's a sorry ass woman period. Hope Chris knows this is not his friend, she's disgusting and a very not funny woman.
No respect for Tiffany Haddish anymore for not respecting her fellow comedian Chris Rock. I would say I hope someone slaps her for an offensive joke she makes, but Chris slapped back plenty for all of us on his live Netflix special tonight.
Tiffany, your wrong, Will had no right to go up there and slap Chris Rock
she's 100% correct
Im still waiting for someone to slap her for one of her painfully unfunny jokes lol
After all this energy she put out and bang it came back and smacked her in the face 👀
No one asked her what brand she was wearing? 🤔🤦🏿‍♂️ghetto toxic.
They call you a p  for not standing up and when you do stand up they call you  a villain
And an idiot point to makw
Can’t believe his idiot is cast in the haunted mansion movie what the fuck
I lost all respect for her with that lie.
Well at least now she’s for sure not a comedian then again when kat Williams said she is not funny everyone called him a hater then she went on stage bombed hard af and now she’s defending the guy who couldn’t take a joke Tiffany haddish is not a comedian she is just some actor in shitty movies by Kevin hart
She is stunning her hair looks very gorgeous
Even in HER position she thinks violence is ok.   Black women complain that there arnt enough good black men about. Maybe u just want the wrong type
Damn.  She am blond! 😵
Wow! Discipline has to be dished out? So she is advocating physical assault to solve problems? She would teach her kids to physically assault someone for words? What about using words to fight back first? That's the civilized way of dealing with this situation. Not beating up someone!
Fast forward….you just played yourself ✌️😎
Nobody is calling Tiffany Haddish out on that homophobic interview? SMH
Tiffany giving the green light to smack comedians, also completely missing that it was a joke. As a comedian its embarrassing for her. #tomsegura had the right response.
🤣🤣🤣kon he ye aadmi "man" ??
Trash
Man it cannot get more shallow than this
I agree with Tiffany Rock got what he deserved
Being a comedian doesn't give you the right to insult others to be funny, as much as being an action start to kick someone's ass to be cool. Physical attack is never justifiable, but an emotional attack isn't too.  Apologize, take responsibility and accountability with what you have done. For you may get away from people's judgement, however,  "The Lord your God is a God of Justice".  By your words you may be acquitted, by your words you may be condemned.
She's really not that funny. She's a caricature, a cartoon character of a black woman that we're supposed to think is funny
Yep people you head live on extra its ok to administer discipline OH HELL YEA GIVE ME MY BAT WITH A SOCK FULLL OF BATTERIES ITS ON AMD POPPIN 1ST WORDS I HEAR I DONT LIKE IS GETTING A BEATDOWN. IF CELEBRITIES DO IT THAN ITS OK 🤮
WUT??😳 What do you mean GI Jane was an insult to a woman's sexuality?  Do you mean in high school boys' circles? lol!! OKAY, SO ONLY LESBIANS CAN BE STRONG MILITARY TYPES WITH SHAVED HAIR?!!!  That has got to be the stupidest thing I have heard yet. As a woman, I am disgusted by this comment and saddened that it comes from a woman I used to respect and admire.  I expect this type of response from ignorant frat boys who don't understand complex women Tiff....shame on you.
And she's a comedian???
Tiffany is an enabler. She's friends w them for a reason.
It's funny how Will has a problem with what comes out of Chris's mouth, however he doesn't have a problem with what goes into his wife's mouth!!! 😂 😂😂
Was her publicist on vacation?
I don't agree😤
This is just another ignorant woman talking
It ain’t none of my business  - after she gives her input
Tiffany isn't funny but she is a joke. lol. Smh!
This creature defending will !! countless creature no more no less
Jada treats Will like her slave, and Will treats Chris like his slave. This isn't about the slap, it's about authority and the fact that he can use his celebrity status in such a manner. Will was initially laughing at the joke before he sees his wife roll her eyes at him.
As a “standup comic” she should be absolutely ashamed of herself!  That dress is horrendous!
I love you tffiany you that bitch but to say that was cool hell knoll   your a comedian too what if someone didn't like your jokes and smacked you!! Who don't love will and Jada and Chris rock but there in the comedian business so this doesn't make since
she just never got over the fact that she got bullied
wait...isn't she a comedian? will she accept getting a slap for her jokes? bc for me she can be slapped for her annoying voice
you smack another grown man in the face on national TV because he made a joke about your wife which you were laughing at your net worth $350 million and you out here acting like Mike Lowrey from Bad boys
She's as goofy as her acting. 🤣
Tiffany Haddish put a different perspective on the situation... Women and Men of Color have Long Been Scrutinized About Our 'Natural' Hair Texture and Styles. They just Passed a Law About It Not Too Long Ago...also, as a Heterosexual,  I'm definitely Not Trying to Be Confused with the letter ppl.👩🏿‍🦱🤷🏽‍♀️🙅🏽‍♀️
She’s not even funny so it don’t shock me she’s defending wills actions
I am so over Tiffany Haddish. She isn't even funny, and her input on this is unfortunate.
Sometimes I feel like it’s not the brains at all that get people to be stars! She is certainly an eloquent example.
I hate will Smith now after seeing this video on YouTube.
Defending smith, you're love violence like NATO
I thought gi jane was the first lady to complete training course or something and nothing about demeaning a woman but oh well idk
You shake Tiffany's head and all you hear is nuts and bolts.
It's all about the money.!
ghetto
How a comedian can co-sign that B.S. is beyond me.
She is so wrong with her comments and oh so wrong analogy of what GI Jane means.
I still can’t believe the gay community hasn’t dragged her yet? Or any other beautiful woman with a short cut. She’s shown her full ignorance.
What are we teaching children  by our examples. As an observer with the Will  Smith assault  on our Brother Chris Rock Everyone is entitled to his or her opinion again  as an observer  on the situation .  Chris Rock didn't  know Jada  had   alopecia, My wife had  alopecia also didnt  have any issues  with the joke especially  when we see Jada was not hurt  but laughing at Will smacking Chris Rock  , also  at Chris  other jokes.   Jada Pinkett Smith was not hurt by that joke by Chris Rock he didn't even talk about her hair directly everyone assumed that based on the short haircut of the woman that played in the movie G.I . Jane. Regina Hall said a  joke about Jada Pinkett and Will Smiths open relationship  nobody had smoke for her and that was a very direct joke to both of them.  Many don't know because all we are  focused on is the slap of  a unfunny outdated  G I. Jane joke which is now doing great numbers online as a result of this negative optically sad incident. Anyway Before the awards online Jada Pinkett Smith was  saying how she loved her bald head and  don't care what anybody say,  She also laughed when Will Smith slapped Chris Rock then sat down  and said keep my wife's name out your f****** mouth which is playing on Tik-Tok from someone that recorded it sitting behind them with their cell phone. When you attend the Oscars or any event where the host is a comedian , many people get  roasted especially  sitting in the front row .  As Men we need to have more Tools in our tool box instead of   responding  in our emotions out of  anger,  rage, and violence  by hiting soneone without  The discipline too pull a person to the side and have a conversation like an adult especially if you know the person . Chris Rock did not know Jada Pinkett had alopecia.  As an observer  of the 2016 Joke Chris Rock made  that was worse than this out dated G..I  Jane joke , and if Jada Pinkett or Will Smith had a issue with Chris Rock they had his phone number  and could have  addressed  him. Also since 2016 they worked on animation movies together they also were  seen at events  together . Jada Pinkett or Will Smith could have addressed  him anytime if they had an issue with him..     This is  deeper then a unfunny outdated joke from the 90s. 😆     whether it was a nervous laugh or not  Will Smith  thought  it was funny  until he seen his wife's face then the  camera cutaway  for a few seconds then came back showing Will walking on the stage, so we missed the whole exchange between Will and  Jada which would have given  us more insight to why Will may have acted that way.  Again everybody  knows  how Chris Rock gives it up he don't discriminate  if your white black handicapped  gay or straight.  In comedy  the monologues at the Oscars  nobody's off-limits unless nowadays you're apart of the LBGT plus community or a Jewish person.                              Will Smith was totally out of line and I enjoy both of  these  Brothers work they are legends .  Now   is this going to set the precedent for a lot of people to go around slapping, hurting or harming comedians or hosts  because of their fragile Egos and thin skins over words, because  they don't like from  the jokes they may say about them , family  friends or loved  ones. 🤔 . For the record  that was not standing up for "black" Woman this  was a sucker  move by Will  Smith, because, if that was a Chinese person  a Jewish person , a lbgt plus person or somebody like the Rock , Michael Jai White , Floyd Mayweather Deontay Wilder, myself or somebody his size Will Smith wouldn't have  that same energy instead, he had to bully a elderly man almost 60 years old   somebody that's a hundred pounds less than him, non-threatening  comedian who tells everybody often he got bullied all his life and  don't fight ,  Will  gets  no points for that and Will Smith is lucky Chris Rock Goons  didn't take this to the street.  Many don't understand anybody can  be touched.  MEN NEED TO PROTECT WOMAN KIDS AND their FAMILIES and WOMEN NEED TO  PROTECT their MEN and FAMILIES.  Jada should have  ✋ stopped him. I Know a few people who are dead, loss everything, or in jail for life because  a  WOMEN putting a battery pack in them  to respond because  someone  said they looked nice or asked them for a dance.  Will Smith didn't apologize on stage in the public where he assaulted Chris Rock when he received his Oscar he apologize to the historically racist academy how DISISRESPECTFUL  He waited after the fact to give that BS apology his publicist probably wrote on Instagram.    In the short also  long run this makes Will Smith look more  like a punk and a bully.  Now Jaden Smith is online    saying  this is how we do it further adding insult to injury putting  a big target on there family having everyone  around  the world clowning  them..    Just like Will Smith,  Chris Rock has people  who loves him also and there is no amount  of money that can protect somebody  from Karma or being touched by street  or industry justice . Chris Rock now to many is  looked at like a person with class and dignity doing his job as a comedian and host   This is not a black or white thing in this case  many  comedians  like Chris go in on everyone  he took it easy on Jada.  Will Smith also his wife need healing but he  was  still wrong and must have thought  he was still in character  from his oscar-winning performance 😆  as a result  Globally real or fake the Optics also  imagery didnt make  American African Men look good on a great night put together by  our  American African Brother Will Packer and all the beautiful American African people that won awards. This was the blackest Oscars in Oscars history being overshadowed by  a selfish antic by Will Smith Slapping Chris Rock.   I  agree with what  Shannon Sharpe said a little bit  not all of what Kareem Abdul-Jabbar said also one  of the few times  I agree with  a little  not alot of what Stephen A Smith said , when he said" what Will Smith did was straight b******* and a shameful  act  he is lucky he didn't get his ass kicked  particularly  after it was over"  Chris Rock Had some real people about that stealth street life  with him just like Will does and this still may not be over Chris Rock still may file  a lawsuit  and for what???? Remember  biggie didn't kill 2pac and 2pac didn't kill biggie many times the celebrities don't pull the trigger or white ball or black ball a person , 😆 At the end of the day we don't even know if this was really staged to bring attention  to both of them because  we know attention  is the new currency.  I don't rock with the Oscars or any of these Awards shows because most of them are historically bias and racist  but This  didn't help the Optics or  image of us as American African Men  globally and  there were children in the audience seeing  also hearing the foul language Will Smith  displayed with the lack of self-control . There's a time and place for everything and many people are not prepared to finish what they start you can't underestimate people  also  take peoples kindness for a sign of weakness that's when people get the shock of there life 😆 just because Chris Rock didn't press charges don't mean it's not over on the street or corporate  white collar  level  and I don't want to see a bunch of brothers and sisters getting murdered over words and Men inability to control the emotions their emotions . At the end of the day this was a major distraction  while our country is passing all types of crazy legislation putting this continent  called the. U.s.a in possible World War 3 , starvation famine and all types of other situations,, this should be a teachable moment for  all of us because if people start slapping punching or hurting people because of what they said about them, their significant other or someone else this would be a chaotic world it's a time and place for everything again there are real-life consequences for everything we do or say to one another Chris Rock ,  Will Smith and his whole  family  needs healing, mental health is a very serious  sickness especially  for "Black"  People " in the words of Tommy Davidson " when emotions is high common sense is at a All Time Low"
WHO the hell is this person raddesh
I wish she would shut up
Overrated actress
Tiffany Haddish, my question is, what was so beautiful about a man slapping another man. That remark about that movie is a total lie, GI Jane is an awesome movie. Your comments are just stupid. Its not my business but you cant shut up.
Why do we ask stupid people questions.
this 🗑 was named one of the most influential people of 2018. we need to do better.
She's a clown too
Well said  Sometimes people need to get Chris Rocked👊🏽🤷🏾‍♂️🤣
Yeah she asked you about it but you didn’t mind talking for 0;45 seconds about some one else’s business. So is will homophobic is that the problem now? Or does a man need to control his actions? But what business of that is mine?
Was she high on daftness? Damn my lovely Tiffany I why do this to your career 😭
"I don't talk about people business, unless I'm in tha business..."   Well you sure had alot to say for it not being yo business... two face!!!
Disappointed
I lost all respect for her
I just hope no one buys tickets to a Tiffany Comedy show, and the ones that do, the moment she tells a rude joke, someone go and slap her cuz she said is ok
She would defend him. Guttersnipe from the ghette.
I know we're all talking about how dumb Haddish is for defending Will, but can we commend this red carpet interviewer for being so professional around this rude ass? Honey, you can't treat people however you like just you're famous...We get it, you're loud and sassy...But don't be obnoxious. Screw Will, and quite frankly, screw this girl too. Never understood her appeal.
Violence is never the answer. Very sad.
Oh so it wasn't about Jadas condition like everyone been saying?
excuses always coming from insecure ppl, and those who promote violence for self-serving reasons. bravo?
Tiffany doesn't know how to stop acting so darned ratchet; she's gonna get cancelled worse than Will Smith and Jada
I'm just successful!!! Bhaha low key diss on the reporter!!
Will been slapping niggas
i like tiffany but this was annoying to watch
Im here for when she gets slap and it's coming because she's told the universe it's ok.
She's one of the women that will have her dude 6 feet under over some dumb shit. She never been treated right,  that's why she's this way. Toxic women!!!! Men stay away from bi%## like this!
GI Jane is not an insult to women. It shows that women are in league with the strength of man and shows gender equality than any other film I know.
If Tiffany Haddish think getting slapped for telling a joke was cool, she might ought to rethink her position as an comedian.
Who?
Jesus Christ, and I thought Will Smiths wife was fucking ugly..
What a joke advocating for violance!!
Now I know why Common dumped her.
She is one of the last people anyone should be getting an opinion from.
one dum b..........smh
So, something is wrong with being a lesbian? That’s the heart of the insult here? Hmmmm…
now because of her support of will smith's assault towards chris rock, tiffany is officially allowed us to slap her whenever she says something insulting during her comedy show somewhere in the future. smh. tiffany doesn't care about the assault. she only cares about her rich friend. disappointing.
She should have just said "Ah give it the ghe-TOH stamp of approval yo!" Would have been more accurate and concise.
Tiffany is so beautiful gorgeous woman
Chris Rock got what he deserved, good for you Will Smith
Hypocrite
Will Smith did nothing wrong, I've would have done the Same thing
Damn I miss the dislike button! Would've loved to see the ratio on this one lol
Well Haddish, you just lost millions of potential fans. I look forward to discipline being administered upon you. You’d better watch who you joke  about.
I hope they shut the Awards down, because they're all leftist!!
She saying that she wants  Italian in her on live TV shows that she ain't nothing but trash that is non-recyclable.
How you can take the person out the hood, but not the hood out the person would look if it had a face. Straight Raunchy and tasteless.
I am a fan but Tiff’s way off base. Basically saying that being call a homosexual is less than. Obviously did not understand the shaving head scene. Will could have used his words to defend his wife instead of physically attacking Chris.
Tiffany Haddish…is ratchet. Why are we listening to her opinion? 🙄🤦🏽‍♂️
She's just as sick as Jada ,she need to take that blonde hair off her head.. she hates her wool hair.
She lacks wisdom.
so gi jade being the woman become the first seal and over coming the odds dosent come to mind for Haddish but instead assault towords women wow good job !
She has such a gross and unsettling voice. Ew anyways she’s a small brained celebrity.
You got it wrong girl! Better keep quiet.
In 1989 Will Smith was arrested for "vicious assault" after he nearly blinded him, after him & his body guards put a hit on record producer William Hendrix  ,after fracturing his eye orbit he managed to spend only 1 night in jail! ..I guess money does buy everything
I’m losing all kinds of respect for so many celebrities right now smh.  Why do we idolize some of these people 🤦🏻‍♀️
💁🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️
Tiffany better not ask Chris Rock for NOTHING when Jada & Will gets bored of her.
She ain't 💩
Sorry the bigger picture is that it showed u can go on stage and do that with out punishment .. next one will have a gun or knife .. more security .. she is worried about a joke .. scary now this showed it was ok to assault some one with not being escorted out or nothing .  What if Chris swung back and his security rushed will and fucked him up .  It could have gotten way worse ..
Bye bye tv project… bye bye acting career … bye bye money    Ur done and that’s what it looks like
Shit looks like a costume on her, also who is Tiffany haddish? Lol
Ugh
Not true: GI Jane was the opposite - awesome moviee empowering to women
She's clueless about both what the moive represented and male physical violence. Two thumbs down.
Her costume is ugly
She is so irrelevant! You would think as a comedian, she would have something better to say....! Well I guess it's freedom of speech.... Oopsie, Chris Rock got slapped for that! Oh well, I was never a fan of Tiffany Hater... My bad, I mean Hader, sorry Haddish or whatever. Hope she doesn't receive the same treatment from another Oscar winning actor. Although, she's not a big enough... anything, to have any affect on anyone.
What a sell-out. Biting the hand that got you out of living in the car. Sometimes discipline needs to be administered indeed.
She just reminded me why I’ve never liked her from the jump start.
Chris joke was in poor taste and insulting. But, responding pay slapping someone is wrong. Two wrongs don’t make right.
I like Will Smith and also Chris Rock I hope they be back cool with one and another" and I understand things went way out of hand but yall need to get off my girl Tiffany haddish 👀👀
Forgive me for the misspelling I'll simply saying is this is where we at in life now, you insult someone and they slap you for it sticks and stones may hurt me but words will never hurt me, we will talk that when we were little kids, Tiffany haddish and others all the dose of speaking on this and say will did the right thing well I disagree we're not children we're grown adults and adults make adult decisions, just because someone insulted you, doesn't mean you have to wear that insult
So this is what we had in life now kitten slap riposte cuz they said something at first I thought it was acceptable for real to do that but as I thought about it know it was wrong he could have handled in a better way I don't care how much tents and he had in him from the other insults that you had from Chris Rock handle that a different way, because kids watch Grown Folks don't you think your kid going to think that's okay to do that to somebody these are grown people thinking like children even Tiffany haddish thinking like a child when we are all grown now, and I'm disappointed in her in a lot of other people say that Will Smith did the right thing insult is an insult, you don't get the weather insulted people put on you and it's up to you not accept it
Standing up for his wife ? He only said that so brainless people will give him " a pass " for that fiasco of a behavior.  And this interview prove my point. I didn't buy that sorry excuse. 😜
Big Willie played his self.  Or like De La Soul   said,"Traveling at the speed of love Hey yo kids,( what's up?) Remember when I used to be dope?, (yeah!) I owned a pocket full of fame (But look what you're doing now?), Well I know, well I know I lost touch with reality, now my personality Is an unwanted commodity (believe it) Can't believe I used to be Mr Steve Austin on the mike (Six million ways.) i used to run it. I guess Oscar Goldman got mad 'Cause I got loose circuits (so loose,so loose) I be the mother goose with the eggs that seemed to be Fallin' Fallin' Fallin' You played yourself,you played yourself,you played yourself,you played yourself"....De La Soul/Teenage Fanclub - Fallin' - Judgement Day Soundtrack (1994)
If Chris Rock's comment is justified because he is a comedian, then hers is too. She was asked her opinion about the situation which she is entitled to when asked. Why ask her if she is not free to express her opinion
Once a ghetto always a ghetto
Tiffany sounds like a man. Deep voice.
You know what's sad? That this kind of behavior is apparently accepted among black people. There would be zero ambivalence towards Will's culpability if he and Chris were white. But because they're black, excuses are made for it and what transpired is almost viewed as culturally normative. Who would've thought that woke Twitter has more in common with the way klansmen think about African Americans than your average white republican.
Her sexuality?!? How? :D
Cause and effect.
Bruh why do all female comedians turn on they're colleagues as soon as they start getting TV and movie roles??? No fucking spine no fucking integrity smh
I'm shocked!! Shame on you Tiffany
I really don't like Tiffany Haddish.
Its ok 2 smack someone??  Your at the Oscars not in the hood honey....show some class!
Will thinks acting is going to take him safety through life. He things acting will save him from everything.
I agree with Tiffany. And honestly this has everything to do with people being against Protection for BLACK WOMEN! Foolishly, some bw are also ragging Will when he took up for his wife, because Chris has been dragging Jada and bw in general for a while. Chris needs to focus on the issue he has that ruined his marriage.
yall all forget Tiffany and Jada were in Girls Trip together, and they will do a sequel. Of course Tiffany will stay on Will's side. Simple like that.
Haddish's dress looks like an Aquaman signature clothing line purchase she made at Target.
It's quite obvious who wears the missing green Marriot Hotel banquet hall curtain in the Smith family.  Jada Pinkett is a manipulating puppet-master.  This is what happens when a bully from Philadelphia makes too much money for his reputation.  Pinkett literally has slept with every TuPac and August in Hollywood with her husband's blessing,.............but make one wrong comment about her head that she didn't like with just an eyeroll,...and it's on!??..........GTFO!
Haddish repeated this defense of Smith several times, so she means it.   Total trash opinion.  Glad it's not shared by anyone I actually respect.
She has a gross snob mentality. Cannot he a fan of that. Vile attitude.
cringe
I love her honesty whether you agree with it or not. Some people are too scared to share their opinions.
Any questions? Keep it pushing.
#Nolikes I agree . Chris should’ve stayed on script . You cannot control how someone reacts after being insulted about their illness .
“ It WaS...uh.. .uh..tha..the... I remember in school.” lol girl BREATHEEE!! Everybody twisting the joke into a little story they created in they head trying to justify the assault! take a fkn hike...
Wow ! She is justifying it. Crazy
Rigatoni!!!!
Tiffany is classless and sounds very uneducated.
How saying someone looks Like g i  Jane is insulting, she is being homophobic
Who’s surprised at this response from a Black woman? Not me.
That’s not gonna sit well with the comedy community, hopefully she can survive as an actress
Tiffany's classmates obviously never saw the movie. GI Jane was a hetero character the movie even went as far to establish her sexuality early in the film. Demi Moore as Lieutenant Jordan O'Neil was a  a powerful competent beautiful woman.
This be-ache looks a little like GI Jane!!
What the f*** is Tiffany talking about? Clearly this is why,,Common left her she has no common sense
Love u tiff love u bless u bless all u do bless all ur work baby girl ur a 🌟
Hey beautiful and gorgeous 🌹🌹🥰😘❤️🙏🏽🥇🏆😋👅🤤⁉️👈
She needs to shut up, she's so delusional that it's absurd, it was literally because G.I. Jane had short hair and that's it, it's not that deep, sit down and shut up.
Not one ounce of class
This just proofs how far gone Hollywood celebrities are.
are we shocked that a woman with this appearance thinks its okay
Rip Roasts.
She basically said It's messed up to be a homosexual .
Almost everyone that goes bald is a man.  But of course it's the few bald women who must be protected from insensitive jokes.
So Will Smith is fine with other men/man sleeping with his wife.... Just don't make fun of her non-life threatening illness. For that, is reason enough to justify violence? I implore you please explain this? For a reasonable person, will not be able to. The morals and values are Disgraceful!!!!
I used to like her. Now I can't stand her. When you realize how fake the whole Hollywood persona is, it hits you like enlightenment how delusional you have been about people.
Ignorant person. Period. She exemplifies the reason “certain people” struggle to gain respect in this country and around the globe.
Wat abt all the things she said during the standup shows
Jada Magoo didn't take care of her man after the show, she found someone else to pork while Will sat in the corner sobbing like a little girl.
Tiffany is just as crazy as Jada. Makes me wonder if this kind of crazy runs in the family and friend circle or is it contagious? I understand now why the world is going to hell. The fact is we all have choices to make....good or bad there is always consequences for our actions.
How dare you. Of all people, as a fellow comedian, and the fact that you’ve said some things over the years- how dare you try to defend and act like what he did was right or that what Chris did was wrong.
Trash......
The ghetto honey the ghetto mmhmm. So ya know now that if she makes a distasteful joke we can go up and Punch her shyt. Ya herd it from her yall. 👏🙌👌
Chris Rock was 32 when that movie was released. He wasn't in High School, he was my age. Should I know what High Schoolers are saying to dig at one another? No, you would be rightly concerned if I did, not appreciative of how well-informed I am.   Now, do you really think I'm gonna know in 2048 what High Schoolers were saying today to roast one another? What kinda creep would I be if I could summon that kinda knowledge?
Tiffany is just as ignorant as Jada and Will.
That’s how we do in the hood Compton style
They do the microphone injustice everytime they put one in her face.
Well,   remember Will is rich and have lots of connections  whereas Kris is only a Comedian that is probably why she defended him.  Unbelievable !   She is the only female dark comedian who sided with Will through out the 3 days I was reading all Feedback from the public.
Ms. Haddish has a warped view regarding what a "Gentleman" should be. You can publicly show love and respect for your wife without resorting to physical altercations over words. Men don't get upset over words. Children do. Being a gentle man (gentleman) doesn't imply weakness but a sense of maturity, refinement, and class.
She's just being rude all over the place, she can barely ask her questions and she's not even funny
If she wasn't personal friends with the Smith family she would be singing a different tune.
Ohhh Tiff done changed. We got you there with your Italian from head to toe
Ms, Haddish,  With all due respect, I don’t believe for one second that Chris Rock with his GI Jane reference was implying that Ms. Pinkett Smith was homosexual. Seriously??  I have sympathy for her dealing with that medical condition. My sister has the same condition, alopecia areata. Not easy.  But it’s not cancer. My younger sister does have cancer and a bald head due to chemo. Both have a sense of humor about themselves and what they’re dealing with. But then, they’re just regular folks.  If you can’t take the heat, get out of the ever loving kitchen.
Let us pray for Tiffany
U people think it’s just a joke abt his wife, but u don’t know what she felt in her emotions, I would have slapped him too. Even though violence isn’t always the answer.
She sound high asf
'Ya understand'. Can't stand people that talk to others like they think they're better, and try to do the tough act. Also agreeing with violence. If her mentality is that way, it's no good.
Defending Smith wtf?
I hope every black men that go around talking about the mother Earth hair aka the black women, learned something because this aquarian age is not playing..U all been selling out to these inoganic entities by demonizing the very wombman that manifested u into existence..Thank Will Smith, but u should have knocked his teeth out like Muhammad Ali..
And this is why she doesn't have a man Lol 😂
i freaking love her!  Finally someone in Hollywood with some loyalty and a backbone!
B sit yo never was alcoholic ass down.
This Woman got booed on off stage because her standup is weak then another comedian came to her rescue kevin Hart, then something like this happens and she sides with will Smith wow, what a way to go and not have the back of your fellow  comedian, she must of been friends with Jada because of the move she was in fake ass
Kissing the ass of a costar doesn't make you justify Will Smith's violence. Ridiculous.
I understand it wasn't right for Smith to slap him, but the dude found it on himself. Be funny but careful on your words. Not everbody will react the same way!
Unfollowed her thank u
it was not an insult to be referred to as Demi Moore in GI Jane ffs 😂 What planet is she from? Demi Moore was sexy AND strong asf in that movie and Haddish completely missed the point. Also, Jada has no need of defending because her "honor" wasn't under attack. It's called a joke. Maybe Haddish  should check to see the long list of people whose "honors" she's offended and offer her cheek up to be slapped before she so quickly condones this😂
Majorly stupid react video IMO!    Demi Moore as GI Jane was a BAD ASS.  Everyone that saw that movie thought she was a badass/strong woman. She never gave up.   To comment that Chris Rocks joke was about GI Jane being homosexual, etc...?  These people need to watch GI Jane again or they need a reality check.   Maybe they need to be slapped! lol
Tiffany Haddish is drunk and insane. What a super TOXIC take on the whole situation. She has definitely been around abuse her whole life to have normalized it in her mind as acts of “protection” and “discipline” SICK and SAD
She's an idiot!  What a stupid thing to say about a grown man.
She has a point
she wrong for that
i swear everything you do will be justified by some idiot, I can go right know kill 3 kids in the streets somebody will tell "yeah thats discipline them kids shouldnt be around at this hour" or whatever other bullshit to justify it
Surprised she sobered up enough for the interview
Haddish on that Hashish
Tiffany Haddish stop supporting bullshit
Tiffany haddish have on a beautiful gown she's one funny girl she makes me laugh
Absolutely Tiffany!!!!!!!
What Tiffany Haddish said had 👎nothing to do with what Chris Rock said 🙄 she was drinking 🍸 Will was wrong!
Uhhhh, she definitely didn't watch G.I. Jane if that's her takeaway
What an imbecile.  I remember when that movie came out, it was perceived differently, at least by me. He was in now way  hinting at Jada’s sexuality. This lady is behaving as if being gay is an insult, which is a very screwed up way of misconstruing this even worse.   “Discipline”? Really?   So hitting children to discipline is somehow also justified? Where does it end for this woman?   Looney tunes
that lady is probably as bad as Jada. WTF is wrong with people? Oh yeah, Hollywood. Entitlement.   This beyotch is so detached from reality. I bet if it was a white dude on stage slapping chris, she would be all over it as 'racism'.  Well, at least people can finally see through the illusion that these people are anything more than actors and ego whores. Justifying assault is a bad look, for anyone. It was a joke, from a comedian. Get over it.  Don't make it about 'women being gay' and all that assuming crap.
she sounds so effing uneducated.  I never understood why people found her entertaining and this just makes it worse
Wow... so  Ms comedian ur gonna make fun on somebody.. on stage .. wow...
Tiffany Haddish's comment on the incident made me concerned about society. Violence is always wrong, no matter what.
Imagine dwayne johnson on stage and smith hearing the joke from his mouth. Smith would have done NOTHING
Awkward. Clearly she did not agree with woman saying rock needed discipline or any of it
Who is this women?And who cares what she says It ain't none of her business😂😂😂
She is not the brightest person. Couldn’t even side with the fellow comedian.
So Hadish the comedian is ok with someone getting up and slapping her for a bad joke. You heard it here first
Both were unprofessional comedians pretend they are traumatized. Just because you are a comedian doesn't mean you can say whatever you want to people no let me correct that you can say whatever you like but you might get🤣🤣🤣
Shameful
This woman can’t even pick a decent role in a decent movie. And now we’re asking for her opinion on the matter? And of course it’s a raggedy answer. Yessh!
1st, Tiffany was Beautiful!!! 2nd,  whether anyone agrees with me, I can understand Will's "Reaction" when he saw Jada's irritation. 3rd, NO, I don't agree that violence was or should have been OK. Will could have spoken to Chris off stage. As a Black woman who once had Locs down my back, I can TOTALLY understand Jada's feelings about her hair. I cut my Locs for many reasons... I felt extreme shame that I couldn't make my marriage work. I took All the blame for its demise. I punished Myself by cutting off my Locs (hair). I have have regretted it ever since. For & in the Black community: Our Hair IS our crown. Whether due to illness or emotional distress, our Emotions are often Connected to our hair.
Well done funny how all the white peoples mad when they’re the ones who started slavery
Really Tiffany ????
Thank you Tiffany Haddish because lots of folks are struck dumb and seem to be disregarding the. Disrespectful tasteless words came out that dude’s mouth. Since 2016 he has made her the butt of his lame ass jokes. Yes, he got the taste and Jade’s name slapped out of his mouth. Thanks  Will for standing up, the rest are scared👍🏾🥂
She change so much...Gone Hollywood... Common sense.
She NOT ready!
Tiffany Haddish comes across as a bit of a joke herself here, (comedian or not) clearly defending her friend's wrongdoing because she is too close to them to see how out of order Will Smith was. WHAT is she banging on about, connotation’s of G.I Jane when she was in school for?........... LAME! Chris Rock told a joke with words, Will Smith assaulted him in front of a live multi million viewing audience. Im sure her friend Jada will be pleased with the support but the rest of the civilised world understand you don't put your hands on someone for telling jokes. Oh and one final word on Will Smiths apology, 'We are all works in progress my friend.
Be humble, sit down!! I hope she gets "disciplined" for driving drunk. There are repercussions for your actions!!! If you take what Chris said in it's context. He was clearly complimenting Jada. Calling her a homosexual my 🍑... 🤯🤦‍♀️
Will Smith is victim of emotional abuse. Lock JADAPINKETT up. Plus she's a cheater and a snake
GI Jane was a way to insult someone.. How the hell can someone be insulted if they look like Demi Moore in the movie.. SHE IS FUCKING HOT, Jada would be lucky to come even close to Demi... Im as straight as they get... but i still think she is extremely sexy in G.I Jane... Topping the hole thing is Will smith actually LAUGHING when Chris told the joke... then he just suddenly got oup and smacked the shit out of Chris rock...Chris got well paid for the smack though as tickets for his upcoming show went from 30$ to over 300$ the day after the oscars.. he sold out.. made more ticket sales in one day than they did hole month of febuary....If you cant take someone calling your wife sexy, strong, beautifull and smart.. you have a serious mental issue... maybe it was because Chris called jada a white woman that set Will off.. makes as much sense as the real reason
Until Will slap her on live TV..then she will know what violence and humiliation is...
You are wrong Tiffany! Disappointing that u think this ok.
👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
D Stoc A LOT and I cannot stress enough  A LOT of dumb people exist.
Haddish's last name sounds like the least ordered breakfast item on a Waffle House menu.  And what's up with that dress?  Look's like she got it from the Aquaman clothing line at Party City.
If anybody called out your family member on humiliating on appearance, wth would u do? Wil could’ve right out “PUNCHED” Chris flat on his back, in the emotional heat of the moment! Some of us, are like, huh?.. wow, Chris just said what?!..than there goes Wil.. Than again, it may be all a publicity stunt - got out all the holier than thou judging away..
Tiffany hadish definition of Dumb Woman
Wow...what a disapointment..
She high🤫 what she said didn’t make any sense
Chris is lying. He knew about Jada"s hair issues. He got what he deserved. STOP, being so DISRESPECTFUL to his wife. Chris, talk too much anyway. And, isn't funny at all. He isn't a victim.  Jada is...leave women alone. You never know what kind of day a person is having. Now, let's speak on Clarence Thomas and his wife. That's the SCANDAL!
Obviously Haddish is out of touch with the times and stuck in the past. Let start with her comment around the word discipline. First of all that's totally out of touch with the Smith's beliefs, who doesn't believe in hitting their children but its okay for Mr Smith to "discipline" a grown man? Really? Really? Let's call it what it really is, it was a senseless act of violence. So, is this how we combat black on black violence in our communities but instead of open hand slap its a hand firmly gripping the handle of a gun and the death toll just keeps on rising. She needs to come out of the past find her true sexual identity and become comfortable with that. If she wants to like girls go for it but learn how to open her mouth and identify with the times by using her platform to help us stop this senseless act of violence that is literally killing our black kids(mostly males). Speak out against violence. Help us here in the black community stop this senseless violence which was perpetrated by Mr Smith on live TV.✌🏾I hope Mr Rock accepts his apology even though I understand how hard that might be.🙏🏿❤
This world is fuxked 🤷🏽‍♂️ honestly there’s so much to say but that’s pretty much it best advice to everyone reading this comment just stay away from people👌🏽
when a so called ‘comedian’ doesn’t even defend another comedian’s constitutional right to speak freely then you know that person isn’t a true comic.   And defending will for legit assaulting a man live on national television shows me the type of person she is.
so ghetto😂
Tiffany is in her kissing ass stage. She knows dam well Will was wrong. She's a dam comedian! She knows that was not a malicious joke.
According to Haddish, it's wrong to be called homosexual.
How can any stand up comic say such disappointing things
Tiffany, a pathetic soul. Next time she makes a joke, she will be okey to take a slap if anyone is offended.  She is a straight up hypocrite
Really? So, now is ok to hit a black man just because he can do nothing.  What a hypocrite message!
She is the only comedian trying to defend Will Smith. I understand why, since she's friends with Jada. But it still makes her look like a clown
Wrong no you don’t slap Chris rock
Stop sticking up for the smith they are disgusting get off your high horses celebrities I think need to be knocked down off there high horse this was disgusting
Bye Bye, Tiffany Haddish. Nice run…
He definitely wasn’t calling her a homosexual…. But nice try tiff
Tiffany has had a Ruff life,I expect her to say something like that! She's been hurt alot and clearly haven't healed. Disappointed in her
Good job... Will Smith
She is Not the right one to ask about what is right or wrong or morals & values😏
Lost all Respect for her .......when she said black on black crime is ok
So in justifying Will's actions, this brainless, extremely unfunny person just associated being gay with 'shame' and therefore Chris deserved it. Ya see... woke and brainless! She'll be out next week talking about transgender rights, but won't have an actual clue what a transgender is
A joke not taken well doesn’t justify assault, her take wasn’t a good one at all.
What Tiffany said was moronically irresponsible. Will had zero right to do what he did. Tiffany seems to condone it. Meanwhile Chris never TOUCHED anyone.
Jada had a whole Conversation with will without talkin lol: Jada - oh you think this shit funny too huh will.  Will - it’s ok babe it’s a joke. Jada - it ain’t a mf joke, what I tell you in the house, let a mf make a jk outta me n see what gone happen dis why I fucked dat lil boy cos he more off a man then you are. 2pac woulda shot him.  Will had no choice but too slap Chris, this would been the final nail in the coffin lol dude woulda been announcing his divorce the that red damn table ffs ahah 😭😭🤣😂😂
Wish will 's mind could be more open , like his cruel wife's legs..
So many things wrong with Tiffany’s words, and I’m a fan of hers usually. First of all, it was never Chris Rock’s intention to be malicious in the routine he had. It was an extreeeeemely tame joke. Jada, frankly, should be lucky that Chris didn’t roast her even harder. Anyone who sees the joke that Chris made as offensive or insensitive or whatever…go to a fucking comedy club and I think that you’ll find a whole lot more that offends you. But besides that, Tiffany is saying that in the landscape of 2022, calling someone “gi jane” is “messed up” because that’s some kind of a gay slur?! No lol. It’s not. Like at all. It’s a fucking movie reference. “Oh no! Chris Rock said someone looked like GI Jane! How dare he!” Fuck off.
To Haddish, the whole legal system probably means nothing since one can "discipline" other with VIOLENCE any way one see fit to themselves.  The silver lining of this darkest cloud in Oscar history is that it gives us a chance to see people's true color.
Hollywood is no better than the rest of us. They like to think they are, but they're not. This is a prime example. But we still worship, adore them, and pay big money to see them.  I, for one, am done with the Oscars.
Tiffany still mad at common… that’s why she responded like that.
There is really no other way to say this. This mindset is indicative of developmental differences. Environment, parenting, ideals, respect of authority, priority. But it is the worst possible variation of that for the society we all want and need to maintain any structure or hope for the greater collective. The Wild West was in the distant past in this country, and it is glamourized in cinema. It was no picnic. It was a horror in comparison to current day. We exist in a time with perspective to that. And if faced with a reality where everyone basically took the law in to their own hands at any given time, we would surely recognize the horror of it. Just as a society 200 years from now would likely shake their heads at the workings of our own. Being intelligent is partially about not having the hubris of only living in the here and now and learning despite what the west has preached the last few decades, the world is not about YOU. Me culture is a culture on the edge. We do not exist is individual entities in the world we are used to. We have a system, structure, and complex mechanisms in place to sustain us all. Please do not disregard and disrespect that. They all exist only as ideas, that we have impressively conformed to over tens of thousands of years as humans. Order, law, currency, a bartering system, language and communication. Understanding! These are achievements, but are only as relevant as the people continuing their legacy and learning/practicing them. Tiffanys stance here is a step back. One that may be represented more staunchly in downtrodden areas, or communities less fortunate that many others. But that is a long problem to solve. Their is no short solution. Us acting like it is reasonable, acceptable, or relatable in any way gives credence to this poisonous reverse in civility and societal expectation. We must continue to strive to correct the injustices in afflicted areas of the world and our country. And help institute fairer systems. But we cannot alternatively allow the attitude she espoused here to corrupt the greater society. It sounds unfair and it is. But if we are striving for the lesser of two injustices here, choosing civility over understanding in some scenarios must be prioritized.   I wish we could rely on most people to be dually understanding of the world that people like Tiffany Haddish are coming from and live in, and also responsible in decision making for our desired path forward as a whole. But it just so often isn't the case. No one should be cancelled. But if anyone has to be, let us not target the Will Smiths or perpetrators of acts. Let us work towards eradicating viewpoints that will objectively take us BACKWARD, and lead to the loss of those vital skills and achievements I mentioned earlier. We are all striving to get better. It may work for the individual to two steps forward and one step back. On a societal scale, we just aren't that harmonious or light on our feet. A step back in an inevitable decline. Nip it in the bud. Speak harshly to people expressing opinions like Tiffanies. Understand where they are coming from if you wish, but remember the most important thing is to make clear they are advocating for regression for all. Putting themselves ahead of the collective. Totally understandable, but no allowable.
Tiffany Haddish is Crazy for her view of it, she must have been high when she watched GI JANE
Tiffany go back to sleeping in your car drunk!
Another   L🤪😜ney Running L😜😜se    And Jada was the one who provoked Will Smith not  Chris Rock. Bye Bye 👋 😘
🙄she was nicer before she let whatever fame get to her ramen noodle looking head
marry such a woman with such comments can make one have miserable life
I would have gone to the fetal position so fast I just know🥲
Tiffany is ghetto af and this statement was an embarrassment and classless. And to actually claim that committing a physical assault on another grown man was "administering discipline" shows she has zero sense. But then that is why these types of Black people are promoted to continue the stereotypical behavior.
No longer a fan of Tiffany Haddish backing Will Smith as a host of the event she should have STFU!  Chris was the man in this whole disgusting scenario.  Chris showed real class and restraint.  Tiffany was a real comedian and now she looks like a Hollywood bottom feeder kissing the ass of Hollywood stars... I will laugh my ass off when Chris Rock takes all of Will Smith's roles and Tiffany changes sides... I am Legend 2 staring Chris Rock will be amazing!  LOL
jesus christ, let's just allow assault, call it discipline.
If this was kanye.. this will be a whole lot different: fact!!
This is gross bro, wtf is Hollywood. This simulation is about to implode 🤦🏻‍♂️
After listening to her too many times,  She deserves the "hard-R"
Haddish likes Will Smith's action because she likes primitive ghetto behavior. Keeps her refrigerator on the front porch so everyone knows she's "rich "
THEY SHOULD NOT INVITE WILL SMITH TO ANY PROGRAMMES ACCEPT FUNERALS! ⚰️
So next time she says something offensive about someone it's open season on her ass, remember that!!
So you want to live in that world really because that changes everything
Tiffany Haddish is trash and an overrated comedian....NEXT!
Luv Tiffany but on this 1, please sit down. Thankies! 😘
If i see her making jokes in stage i would definitely slap her not the type smith gave but the kind nate diaz gives a Stockton slap haha
she has never bury a love one,who lives by this code.
Trash ...money doesn’t buy class.
Discipline? She's toxic af
Insult a woman???? Smh....... Discipline?
Please girl you geeked up or what? ,do you know how many men had to pull time or pay money for slapping someone who pose no danger to them?
Tiffany you just fell off the pedestal darling. This isn’t about you, this is about common sense and decency. Disrespect is wrong no matter what.
She wasn’t sitting next to him. She cheated on hers haddish needs to ask jada to pay for her actions she cheated with the sons friend
Calling a women a homosexual? Where the fck her Ramen noodle head ass get that from? Ain’t she a comedian as well.
Imagine if this was a white dude disciplining her for her insensitive jokes dude would be locked up for 10 years because white man equals racist right?
But yet Jada announced to the world about her alopecia and said she don't give 2 craps about how anybody feel BUT Chris didn't know she had alopecia and the joke was based on the G.I. Jane movie so NO Tiffany move yo ass on with that
Lol this is a wild animal being interviewed right here lmao nasty disease of energy she gives off
Some this celebs needs to go back to street and learn how real world operates
Toxicity galore. This is what an enabler sounds like. I don't know if it's the Hollywood thing getting to her head, but I feel sorry for her. She just told the world comidians are here to cater to the rich and famous and that she can and should be slapped if she makes a joke about someone's significant other. Either people like that need to be medicated or lay off their drugs and beverages. Chris Rock could teach her a few things about what being a comedian is really about, also decency, dignity and respect. Sorry about Tiffany if anything she just sounded like new rich trying to fit it by hanging out with the popular bullies at school 🤷🏻‍♀️ Girl bye. BTW I do like her and enjoy her as a performer, but this is not your battle girl and you clearly missed the point, and that could be because maybe.. Just maybe, just like the Perpetrator, she hasn't healed her own wounds. Love is not violent nor violence. That's toxicity, Codependency and trauma speaking. Also, the other thing she said about the wife having to sexually please the perpetrator in a very particular way, to thank him for the assault he committed speaks volumes about the type of interactions within a relationship she thinks are healthy. Sex should never be a currency, is not a commercial exchange and is right down sociopathic, to watch violence and then suggest for the partner of a bully to celebrate his violence because it was supposedly done in your name / behalf. Sounds like a psycho in an episode of Law & Order Criminal Intent. No joke.
Facts and you go WILL SMITH 🔥👌💯
Beautiful DRESS🙋🏾‍♀️
DUMB
The sense of entitlement and the delusion that he didn’t do anything wrong or more important illegal is disgusting. And shame on The Academy and ABC for not having the Police move him was spineless. Our family felt terrible for Chris Rock and his family the way he was allowed to be treated and then to not hold Will Smith accountable. Will Smith and his wife are absolutely not sorry for what he did to Chris Rock. Will Smith refusing to leave the Oscars when reportedly asked too and then to party it up at the Vanity Fair party is proof of this. Shame on Vanity Fair also for allowing him to attend their party.
… there is nothing appealing here. Nothing feminine. Nothing graceful. Nothing delicate. Like a truck driver in a line green dress suffering from flatulence of the mouth. Phony phony phony. Nothing to learn here other than sustained phoniness.  The American Dream is Dead. The baseline is for hucksters, charlatans, and frauds.
Most women that step out with low or no hair air VERY CONFIDENT about it and they don't gaf what anyone says.... she should wear wigs if she's shy about it
She’s not fluent in English and she’s American
Wow, how disappointing 😢
Ah, this is the new host of the show Kids Say The Darndest Things!
I used to like her and Will but after this nah..no respect whatsoever. It was a joke.   Also Tiffany clearly has never seen GI Jane 🤦🏻‍♀️ He could of shouted abuse at Chris all he wanted but the fact he was laughing and then suddenly up on the stage is just ridiculous.
Yes Tiffany, violence should be administered...over a bad joke...on a cheating and horrible wife...at the Oscars...while millions of people are watching. Ghetto just stays ghetto I guess. And I should know because I live in the ghetto lol
I think shes a bit messed up and she just talked about someones elses business, so she doesnt make any sense. A shame she condones violence. You can forgive Smith but you cant condone his behavior! Get real
She wouldn’t know a good joke if it smacked her on the face
And here I am wondering how her feet do? 💃 🕺
Wow! Cant beleive people condone this type of behavior.
Claffy
Thanks Will for being the Only real man to take up for black women.  This same Academy watched Harvey Weinstein rape women ( they knew his reputation) and didn't say a word and kissed his ass but when a BLACK man comes to the rescue of a BLACK women...they mad.  They have no respect for women especially black women after we were raped repeatedly throughout slavery.  Don't get mad because Will is more of a man...than you!
Tiffany is high that's not what that movie meant or the joke that Chris said
FAKE!!! Remember my name!
I agree Tiffany.  Everybody knows ( at least black people) that you don't keep pushing a black man and his wife.  Chris has been harassing Will and his wife forever...Chris was antagonizing Will...filled with jealousy cause he didn't make 20 million for Wild Wild West.  Chris is a little punk who can keep jabbing but can't take a punch.  Yeah...finally a real man comes to a black woman's rescue!!!
Tiffany Haddish being a sucker with the Smiths.🤢🤮
How and why this broad ever became famous I’ll never understand. She seems so condescending and obnoxious.
she’s saying that being a homosexual is an insult which is problematic in and of itself and then she’s justifying violence as “discipline”. this is a hot take.
And that's why their son is gay...
So comical two senior citizens fighting
Hollyweird justifying actions that are illegal as usual.
Who’s that lesbian
I’m sorry that her experience of discipline has been violence.  Chris rock is a comedian.  Hitting someone is assault.
Boo to Tiffany Haddish. Straight up lame. Guess that's what a little fame can do to you.
This is a rough this whole topic is depressing bro I just woke up to this video. And then it makes it seem like.. Cuz nobody can say the wrong or right thing because if someone says how they felt it leaves them open for hatred it's kind of like the best thing is to say is,"No comment" and keep it moving. But then if they don't say anything it's a problem it's like you can't win LOL I didn't think I would comment about this but it's a very shocking and uncomfortable topic, to me personally. I guess because I'm already going through stuff. So it's kind of just, very overwhelming
This woman is just as twisted as the Smith family. Let me guess, when a woman puts her hands on her man it's out of love because she's trying to show him the "right" way of doing things. Therefore it's a positive act. Wtf is WRONG with this kook?
Tiffany be looking like G.I. Jane for real.
Ure the multiverse of Marilyn Monroe
Wow this woman is really ignorant
I think it’ll be fIIINeeeEee 😂😂😂😂
Y'all don't respect women..Will was right, there are types of jokes but that one wasn't a joke..... Don't make jokes from someone's illness
Yo tiffany ure green goblin costume  describes u best
If you think these so called are wise,thunk of Tiffany Haddish.
That clearly means Tiffany Haddish support and encourages violence for disciplinary action!
So it's ok to slap you when you make fun of other....
She refuses to acknowledge the obvious, Will Smith criminally battered Chris Rock
The fact that Americans and even Brits are so desensitized to everyday violence—that people were outraged and offended at Will Smith who is an actor, entertainer, comedian, also a human, a father, a husband, a black man. It’s very telling, it’s not personal to you and it’s not your business when you don’t even know the full story. Everyone wants to have their opinion and bias and praise a host who is unfortunately a sellout. Comedians vary from far and wide with their humor and where they come from. I know most comedians make crazy nasty jokes but 9/10 it’s about themselves, their experience, their family. It’s not forced it’s funny and relatable they dont go out of their way to degrade and target specific people. I would think that’s respectful. Comedians don’t have to be smug assholes with fucked up humor and no boundaries in order to be funny and likable. Y’all are wild as hell.
Tiffany, you’re so wrong…I didn’t realize that I have the right to slap somebody for insult me or my wife, Shame on you
This girl right here yo! Is funny asf! She is real and out spoken! I’m happy she was fair with the situation!
This yellow hair has lost her mind. Disgusting human.ugh.
Tiffany, most people have never heard anything of the sort that referencing the movie "GI Jane" implies you are a lesbian.  GI Jane was a hardworking, independent, strong military troop leader. Why bring homosexuality into this?
Haddish can't be serious. She's roasted people WAY worse than that. So next time she jokes about someone at her comedy show it's okay if someone comes up and slaps her 🤔 noted
Now we know why her ass is single with that ignorant comment. Violence is not about protecting you simple minded women.
She’s off on this one.
Officially don’t like this broad.  Hope someone “disciplines” her, see how she likes it.
Gi Jane was a badass 😎 Tiffany showed her ignorant ass
So because this women is so ooorly educated and inept, and uncivilized… That means Chris Rock was calling Jada a lesbian, rather than his true intention. And furthermore she would stand by anti LGBTQ movements because she this obviously views lesbianism as a shameful thing. Correct?
Hopefully she gets DISCIPLINED next time she says some smart shit
Why are we just seeing black peoples response to this when they are 12% of the population. This wasn’t a black moment for you to own. There is no opinion even needed. It’s a criminal act
Discipline???  So you are OK when someone slap you after you make a joke with them, and this so call "discipline" should be fine with you because they give you a lesson ?? I guess you think it's fine for celebrities to slap someone insulting them or insulting their partner, we should redefine the terms celebrities.
This girls got her priorities completely messed up
She said he was trying to call her a lesbian, she reached
So, Tiffany is fine to discipline somebody committing a crime...? That tells you the level of some very low IQ like her... unbelievable!
It's messed up that he is getting away with violence.  None of her business sure...
Loud,Defensive,annoying.
She is so wrong
Tiffany sounds very ignorant..can't believe she blamed Chris & gave Will a pass..just ridiculous
Tiffany haddish she can say anything about anything she's a drunk😮
Hopefully Tiffany is prepared for any person whose offended by any of her jokes to also slap her on stage. She fully admitted that is ok.
And she calls herself a comedian if she was ok with that then I hope she has some good security for her next show or whatever she does because the same thing might happen if she says something the crowd doesnt like
GI Jane 3 starring tiffany haddish
who is she???
Her career is done also.
Okay. She is definitely insane
That's why you're alone again Tiffany.  Why would you stand with such a disgusting man.  That's so stupid what she said about the movie.
Well she lost my respect as a comedian
Ok so I guess we can slap yo Cool baldhead ass if you say something we don't like at the show . Humans say some dumb shit at times..smh Nobody should be disrespectful to any man's wife without atleast having a conversation!But let's talk about the woman he worships to the point that he is ok with being disrespected, in front of the world Pryor to the slap thing..She Told him she fucked another man and spoke about helping him heal 😩🤺 All while he is suffering from lack of Identity/and understanding how to be the alpha male..An the leader of his house hold obviously..He said I have to get you back.. Instead of Let's figure out a peaceful way to part ways without the drama!Now he made a little boy decision in front of the world only to be excepted an respected by the woman he loves the most!🤔He should take a moment to reevaluate his next move after publicly apologizing to the man he slapped in the face.. People are dying for less
Oh, shut up you!
I hope she never tells a joke for which someone feels the need to get justice.
Just remember this Tiffany....not everyone would keep their cool like Chris...so try if you must but if you get dropped like a hot potato don't cry assualt..
Hadidh better watch her ass and what she says on stage  with her comedy also. In case she says what somebody in the audience feel insulted and give her some "dicipline" lets see how she gonna like it. Aint nobody badder than nobody..We can all get got in life... She must have said all kinds of jokes that made fun of somebody..  The jokes that i hear nowadays shit.Calling someone .GI Jane is like a kiddy joke...
Delusional beautiful girl. 🤢🤮
Not my business but she made comments... Dummy
It's like she's conflating the whole GI Jane ref. Actually GI Jane could more likely represent strength, and power, Demi Moore was more of a heroic figure in that role. Jada Pinket even admitted in ref to her alopecia; you just gotta laugh.
What an embarrassment to womanhood, personhood
As ghetto as they come. She will be single the rest of her life.
She's no comedian. Kat Williams called her out and was 100 percent right. I hope every comedian let's her have it just like Jada and her wife Will Smith
Will finally makes a public mistake(I’m only calling it a mistake because he did) and he gets dragged and probably canceled when a lot of you have forgiven celebs and politicians for a lot worse.🤦🏾‍♂️ I bet y’all still listen to R. Kelly and watch Harvey Weinstein movies and will re-elect Trump or Biden🤦🏾‍♂️
Damn, someone that is used to comedy should've had a better response than that
Give me a break - spare getting opinions from these incoherent clowns.
She sick in the head like Will 👍🏽
Tiffany was it a joke when your ass was stuck in another country and you crying on YouTube because they didn't care about your status in America.
You're out of line, little girl. And it is none of your business... crass comments about homosexuality/gender styles and "norms" in this "woke" day and age? Shame on you!
Tiffany you are so so wrong it had nothing to do with sexuality it was a joke something you do. I hope these people who play on these TV shows that do stuff for laughs think about what their doing to make a dollar and insult women while there doing it Tiffany.
Like Chris said it was a fucking joke.
Tiffany doesn't know when to turn the ghetto off.... It's a little annoying
F every Hollywood actor/actress that defends Will Smith. Sidney Poitier must be spinning in his grave.
Thank god Chris is afro american, otherwise they would have play the black card
She is distasteful for thinking that what will Smith did was right. No 👎 girl he was so fucking stupid
people like this is why hollywood is sickening
Seriously?  I hope her man slaps another man one day, in "her honor," and then that man pulls a gun and shoots her man dead... Like, what happens everyday in this country.  She sounds so ignorant, it's almost as shameful as what Smith did.
And to imagine she's a comedian too... SMH...I pray no one who feels slighted does not get onstage someday to smack her...
The blame lies on Jada, Will was laughing, before she made a frown, didn’t she say she didn’t give a crap what anyone said or thought about her condition? She should be banned.
She’s supposed to b a comedian?
Because of Will's actions, hearing Chris stand there uncomfortably smiling saying "here comes 'Richard,'" as Chris gave more respect to the oncoming threat than Will deserved, I won't be seeing the movie about the sister's dad. My ticket, my viewership or curiosity about their dad is over bc of the actor who needs to face consequences greater than standing ovations.
She is 100% WRONG NEVER PUT YOUR HANDS ON NOBODY BECAUSE OF WHAT THESE SAID
Tiffany brings a perspective many channels haven't highlighted. I still disagree w any hands on anyone while doing his/her job. Nowhere in marital vows does one promise to punch or slap a person when the spouse is insulted. Not expected from spouse let alone an actor people look up to. I no longer include myself in that.
I totally disagree with her,Will had no right to hit Chris. Ok so what would you say if Will knocked Chris out to the point where he fell on the floor and was unconscious.Or let's say he hit a white comedian would the situation be treated the same .Comedians tell jokes and GI Jane in the movie was beautiful! You can't just go on stage and hit someone because you don't like what they say. Hold your tongue until the right time and then approach that person in a nonviolent way. Remember you are a roll model. This was  supposed  to be Will's night to shine as a winner.
It's sad to see how many & how fast people defend #CriminalAssault over literal Words.
This flightless bird Tiffany
Look at the positive side of the Will slap Chris story.  Chris is about to blow up at the box office.  Chris has new material for his routine.  I hope he don’t forget the rule, “I can talk about my mama, but you better not.”  If Will would have not slapped Chris or even if he went up and explain what alopecia is, as many people would not know about alopecia now, as they do, because of the slap. It’s never okay to hit someone for saying something, but I’m talking about making lemonade out of lemons.  If Chris and Will make a movie together with all the attention going on, they’ll be next year’s Oscar winners.  Lastly, it was a learning experience for people who don’t know when something is politically incorrect.  If you say something and somebody slaps you, it was politically incorrect.  Let Go, Let God!
I really thought something different would have came out of her mouth ,,,,, Damn ass comment
"Hi. I'm not as well known as the Smith's or Chris Rock, but I just wanted to respond to the oscar event so my face will appear in the media. I'm told it will help my image."
As a lesbian, I take major offence to Tiffany's comments here ... being gay shouldn't be considered an insult. I came to the comments assuming someone else would have commented on this but see that no one has :( This is homophobic.
Tiffany Haddish, comedian: I think it's okay to assault comedians if you find a joke offensive, or think that it was offensive 20 years ago. I think being called non-heterosexual is very offensive.
She don’t like Chris, I’m sure there’s comedic beef she has with him. Probably didn’t want to take her on some tour or some shit. She ain’t a real comic after this. She’s just some funny lady now smh 🤦🏻‍♂️
wow what the fuck? How are people defending the slap? I mean yeah, the joke criticism is legitimate. I didnt even get the joke but if that was crossing a line, sure. Criticize Chris Rock for that. But no way is slapping the guy ok, especially on such a night in front of millions of people watching that stuff
Smith should have been escorted out of the venue by security and immediately remanded into the custody of local law enforcement! How many children will now emulate his actions on the playground thinking that violence was made cool by Will Smith? Epic failure! The committee running the Oscars, the Network, Will Smith should all be held accountable for this! And to every single actor/actress that just sat there and DID NOTHING I call you all out as lacking any aspect of morality, manners, scruples or compassion whatsoever. Hollywood has lost its soul and now EVERYONE in the entire world knows it!!
Tiffany is wrong.  GI Jane was a bad ass, cool woman.  Furthermore, Tiffany condones Will physically assaulting someone over WORDS???  And disrespecting the academy, the audience, the nominees?  I knew I didn’t like her..
She just saying this because she’s friends with Jada. Her opinion is biased cause what if someone did that to her?
When the movie came out, it was an insult. It's 2022 now, and a symbol of a woman's strength and perseverance. I would have taken the compliment.
if youre resorting to violence because of something  someone says then youre sensitive af
she sounds just as dumb !!!  just say you agree with it instead of beating around the bush !!!
Who is this dude?
I also remember when that movie came out and no it was not widely used as an anti gay slur. I'm sure some people did but it was mostly just used ignorantly to make fun of a woman with short hair. This person is full of shit to try to defend an assault on live television because she probably loves will smith and grew up watching him. It was a dumb joke because she had a shaved head. it was more lame than insulting. He had no intention to question her sexuality or shame her for being gay or whatever. The joke sucked but as far as insensitivity goes it was the mildest form of insensitivity. Ricky gervais says far worse things on stage during the globes. You can decide to be upset with Chris if the joke offends you that much but to make that long walk to the stage and not once think nevermind I should just turn back around is outrageous. Then he doubled down by acting like an idiot screaming from his seat. Honestly I had no idea who this person is in the video but she is reaching really far to try to make this seem acceptable. I am not saying there is nothing someone can say to make me shift my moral point of view to favor will smith but it definitely is not anywhere near what was said.
Tinkerbell Haddish should shush. 💚🤮🙄
I’m offended by their weak imitations of Italians. “A rigatoni!!” Why is that okay?
spoke too fast Tif
It was a joke
Why do so many black women equate blonde hair with beauty???
I bet no Italian wants to be in you!
Who is this? And why do we care what she thinks?
I don't talk about peoples' business, but let me weigh in on the situation and who's wrong.  Classy, Tiff.  From Crank Yankers to Dolce & Gabana.  Pretend you still have a soul.
Your taking the joke too far and excluding  Will for his poor behavior!!
She's ratchet as hell.  Her opinion doesn't matter.
Cancelling Will and Tiffany now then?
Of all the discussions out there about the issue no has mentioned the fact the a lot of young people look up to Will Smith because of his career in music and acting.  A young person after witnessing this assault may later be confronted by someone who insults them verbally and the only solution is to smack, punch or even shoot them to death. Will Smith is a grown rich man with a reputation, no need for this nonsense. He should have been kicked out of the theater when he did it.
Who the hell is this idiotic anyway?
So she thinks it’s messed up to call someone a homosexual, but not to slap someone in the face ?? Who is she anyways ?
Will is lost, His soul, is lost, He freaked
she's chatting shit   Chris  Rock  was a legend the way he handled  that like a Gent
Love her but she's wrong here, it's definatelly not okay and it has nothing to do with "discipline". Wth he's not a child?! But she's friends with the Smiths so I'm not surprised she would take Will's defense... 🤷‍♀️
She's a cow
Maybe comedians should stop making fun of appearances and medical conditions? 🤷🏻‍♀️  There are comedians who are funny without bringing other people down
Wow…. I didn’t know that was used to insult women. I thought she was strong and beautiful….that gives another light to Jada’s displeasure BUT….Was still not enough for him to lay hands on anyone. He could yelled for his to stop. It was inappropriate and Will looked like a FOOL!!!
This actress is just as brainwashed as Will
Tiffany is speaking from her own hurt from Common!  She is dead wrong as always!
First of all GI Jane was about a a woman in the military in a position of LEADERSHIP being told that she couldn't leave in troops in war time. You shouldn't speak out of ignorance. She was trying to have Jada's back because they worked together but it was a miss for me. I was in the reserve and my spouse was active duty for 26 years. They weren't in High School...they were at the Oscars!  Will Smith is known for staging stunts so at first that's what I thought was happening.  "GI Jane" was not an insult at all. Demi Moore played the character Even though it was Jada with the short hair. It was no different than Kanye acting out. It's the sense of ENTITLEMENT that doesn't sit well for me. They are all grown! She wasn't ashamed to discuss her affair (entanglement) publicly and he didn't defend Jada then instead he sat back and let the public tear into her so there shouldn't have been an issue of him complimenting her on being able to pull off the haircut and the green dress. It had NOTHING to do with Jada and everything to do with his feelings for Chris. I'm just sick of "US" acting a fool! Alopecia is not a terminal disease and has NEVER caused anyone become domestically violent. She's worn her hair like that for years even before she announced it publicly.   Hell, truth be told Chris Rock could have been speaking something into fruition by saying Jada was the next GI Jane because she'd be the FIRST BLACK GI Jane!  The behavior was inexcusable and unacceptable. Chris knew nothing about her hair condition. Chris has daughters..he'd never do that intentionally! He did "Good Hair" to educate and encourage Black Women to love themselves and their beauty in every form. Is every comedian now going to have to watch what they say for fear of retaliation if someone doesn't like what they say?  He's no better than his abusive father because he has the money to be able to afford the counseling but he's obviously above that! If his father wrote some half-a** apology would that be enough? Does that erase the pain and humility both she and Chris Rock felt in the moment?  Will Smith needs to address the real issues and not take advantage of innocent people who used the information they made public for light hearted humor. Will Smith felt ENTITLED! He wouldn't have done it to anyone else. He's taken digs a Black men and women for decades and no one slapped or punched him!   Will stole the moment for many experiencing their "first" including himself. He overshadowed the entire event. He also robbed many of their night to shine by choosing to behave like a barbaric neanderthal.   IT WAS TACKY, IT WAS COWARDLY AND IT WAS UTTERLY DISRESPECTFUL!  Thank You Chris Rock and Will Packard...In Spite If It All It Was A Beautiful Evening!
Disgusting
No wonder Common got rid of her.
I’ve noticed a theme here,those with below average intelligence believe will Smith was justified in his actions.
Well, BS she don’t know sh*t.
Tiffany haddish is not the one you should be going to for an intelligent thought
T
She is saying assault is ok. Wow!!
Just funny watching Haddish talk all that ghetto jive talk.  Haddish: I ant getten in sumbudyz bizznazz 🤣  Like Haddish is so street ghetto living the Hollywood Elitist life.  That dress looks more ghetto 🤣 looks like someone went shopping at the Salvation Army Store  and found some St Patrick's Day
Also, don't even think I am a hater of her ... in order to hate you have to be jealous...but you know what I am a hater...a hater of LAME people like her...I knew it was something about her...and you know she has been under the radar and knew when to be quiet...thats why she slid between the cracks but you are exposed now Tiff...
I'll take THINGS A BITCH FROM THE GHETTO WOULD SAY for 100 Alex
Hey bald people get made fun of all the time whether it's male or female. Oh but because it's Jada you got to treat her different. Will should have slapped her peanut head for cheating.
Damn straight
Tiffany's wrong
Tiffany Haddish is hilarious 🤣 I have to see what my feet do.
Shes wrong , wow
w o t
Trashy mindset
But you know I feel like it’s Jada fault , IDGAF , learn how to take a joke, if you didn’t like what was said you could have pull Chris to the side after the Oscar’s 🙄 #TeamChrisRock
Tiffany please!
That’s why Common left her a**
Tiffany Haddish is cool with Will smacking Chris? Omg, she is the only person so far that I have heard supporting abuse. Shame on you girl
Tiff interpreted the joke ALL WRONG!
Yeah she said it best
Bye 👋🏾 Tiffany .
why everyone so mad bruh i love tiffany hadish😂😂😂
Alright so keep that in mind when she’s doing crowd work and someone takes offense to what she says and gets slapped
Will Smith is a coward. Lets keep it real.
She's offended cause she is almost bald herself 😂
Take the award away from Will Smith and give it to Chris Rock.
Tiffany Haddish's response was nauseating. How fucking brainwashed is she that violence equals protection or love? Lady, grow up
"Making it sound like something against homosexuals" THATS A FUCKING STRETCH! and shame on all the woman siding with Will saying "You gotta protect your woman." There was literally nothing to protect you soft af people.
Tiffany Haddish  it w lies. HADDISH is BALLIN' w BANK, so she say.  She tells ya in every other sentence...  Money don't buy Class.
Hold the L goofy!!..people gotta keep calling you “beautiful” because no one is choosing you!!..you a goofy
I was hopin for another joke, she's a funny woman. Obviously smart and beautiful too.
Don't care what's in the comments..i love how Tiffany is ALWAYS herself.
Out of all people she should understand that it was just a fucking joke she’s a comedian herself, her mindset is why she’ll never make it close to Chris rock level
Yes 🤗
Tiffany  Haddish ,diarrhea  mouth. Wao I am very upset .I couldn't  even look at the damn assault  anytime it comes on the TV
Tiffany  should shut her mouth. She is a comedian  and some of her jokes far surpassed  what Chris said. So she is saying Christ needs to be punished for his joke! Give me a break. Violence  is never necessary unless you are defending yourself. SAD.
Let's all get our slapping hands ready; there's a lot of naughty comedians out there
No, just no. To bully people period, but by calling them out to be homosexual, just NO, people are BORN that way. That doesn't make what happened right at all. Also: smacking someone who is being paid to make fun of all the attendees, also: NO. How will she like it, if someone who feels offended by her comedy, just gets up on stage and smacks her? It's just WORDS. Get over yourself.
You need to shut up.Because this is not an abuse from Chris. He is a commedia.  They know it . Don't  come an act as if he is being  insulting. Just shut up
Low level women no matther what
She lacks class and is ratchet I don’t approve of her opinion she’s all about chaos drunkenness boisterousness. Nothing funny or talented about her one dimensional view! She even twisted his words and you never have a right to hit someone.
Rebel Wilson : "Will smith's best performance is being okay with his wife's boyfriends" --------- daymnnN!
Ugh. Haddish is very funny but she’s apparently completely warped. What a psycho.
Next time when Tiffany cracks a joke about someone, someone needs to slap her to “administer discipline” too.
Defending his wife after laughing his ass off 🤔 She’s an idiot. Will only did that because he got caught laughing and didn’t want to hear his wife’s 💩at home.
So it's okay to be violent when you're defending someone's honor...but it's toxic any other time. This is why I do not allow women to tell me how to be masculine...
Ignorant people are giving will a pass. He's not special, he should man up and apologize to Chris. He is a coward and it makes black actors look bad.
Jada should get slapped up too, she was making fun of will's menhood and his masculinity in front of millions. Respecc Discipline mus be administered.
Don't see any beauty (baldy)🤮
Meanwhile: Stand up comedians effing the audience's moms and dads and getting away with it cuz we are mere mortals.
What we had at last night's Oscars is a classic case of 2 wrongs that don't make a right. For starters, if Mr. Smiths' wife, Jada, is currently experiencing some health issues causing her to shave her head, then Chris should have left that alone, for the G.I. Jane quip was ill-mannered, rude, insensitive, and out of line. By the same token, Will has a right to stand up for his wife's honor, and like him, I too would have gotten riled by the showing of disrespect and hence embarrassment. Actually, it's the equivalent of shaming someone, or an act of bullying, for directing sarcasm at anyone is mean-spirited and hurtful. But then that's where it should have stopped, at least for the time being that is, for then Will could have made his point with Chris backstage after the Oscar ceremony had concluded, and manhandled him in privacy. But to roll up and bitch slap him in front of a national audience, crossed a line as well, in that it sends a bad message and image out to young people everywhere. Shame on both of them, for acting out like adult children in front of the world, where they both should have their bare bottoms spanked.
I see the industry taught Tiffany to stfu
I think both of them are wrong. Will was wrong , but Chris had it coming imo.
Smith is a fool. If he was smart he could have handled it in a non-violent way that would have made Chris Rock look two inches tall in front of a worldwide audience, and come out of it with all the credit. Instead, he has created a negative aura around himself that will follow him around indefinitely.
AMEN TIFF AAAAAAMEN 🙌🙌
Chris Rock needs to discipline his bank account and Sue the f*** out of him
Tiff was really reaching with her explanation lol
I think the person who should be most insulted is Demi Moore. Why did Jada Pinkett take it as such insult to be compared to a beautiful woman?? It was Chris Rock's most innocent joke of his career.
I’m with Tiff
Ok when I'm at the next Tiffany comedy concert on the front row and she makes a joke about my bald head....I will be like Redman , I will smack the shid outcha, and you can't say anything cause you said it's ok
Well black man don't stand up for your wife allow your woman to be disrespected  its ok now there is a time and place for this but he was not wrong his wife felt some type of way he handle the issue for her she may have used the fact of having a good man playing on his emotional side to get what she want
so when she gets slapped for a joke that offends someone, she will be ok with it.
👏👏👏👏👏👏
Weak take
Ghetto fab..yay....my friends don't think gi Jane equals lesbian...says  more about your  circle...bye Felicia
What the hell is wrong with this woman. Imaging having someone like her in power, we would have torture chambers again everywhere just to discipline people.
The reason why most black people are living under the poverty line in America. People used to call someone “G.I. Jane”, because they wanted to insult somebody ??!! So that is how probably boys insulted black girls when their natural hair didn’t grow up like the hair of the rest of the girls in the world ? Do American parents not raise their children well ???  How cheap is that excuse for a slap on stage while the whole world is watching ???. Although G.I. Jane is supposed to be a character of a strong woman…??? Really i don’t get her point at all and it is totally wrong of what happened that night.
I don't know who this woman is but she is so far from reality it's ridiculous the GI Jane joke had nothing to do with homosexuality. Demi Moore shaves her head in the movie to assimilate herself to the situation she was in. It was a tough thing it was a way to show her toughness and that's what the joke was about.
I thought she was a comedian
1) Saying that Chris Rock’s joke insults a woman’s sexuality is ridiculous at best.   2) The fact that Tiffany Haddish didn’t side with a “fellow” comedian shows how phony Hollywood truly is.   Best of luck to you in the comedy world.
Wow!! Reaching!! 'lesbian', learn how to embellish. But facts, for uneducated. Jada did a video on her questionable??? alopecia. She stated, "i love my bald head! I don't care what people say, "  KAY-O, SHE LIE.  Further, the scar on her supposed bald head, didn't "just appear," it's from plastic surgery, SHE LIE!!!!!!! AND alopecia is circular bald patches of MISSING HAIR!!!!!!!! 1st, look at her mom, you see alopecia. (Bleach blond, what do we know about bleach blond on any hair!!!!! Come on folks, you been had. And who else has been getting her hair bleach blond, come on you know.) So if she has alopecia, and been bleaching blond, question; wouldn't that make it worse? (Just sayin') And don't narcissists create illnesses when they get caught??!? Hello!!  I mean,  didn't she get caught taking advantage of a young guy, who was sick and her son's friend, WHAT!??! And this was in her own house, her families home, 'her husbands'. Who needs paranormal when you have someone like her in your life, talk about house of horrors. And my God, did you see the letter her daughter wrote about HER OWN MOTHER'S FORMER FRIEND, NOT BOYFRIEND OR LOVER. How would her little girl know about him!???! Seriously, someone needs to get those kids away from that toxic crap. Yes, now their young adults, but what has she been pushing them into, encouraging. I can't be the only one seeing this dangerous crap. Shame on Will smith and his family for not protecting those kids.
That lady in green with some crocodile pooh rubbed in her hair must have lost her head. Good God she must have children and wonder if she would advise or encourage any of her children to shoot or hurt someone else because they feel emotionally dented. Damn her opinion stinks loud
She makes those clothes look cheap and she sounds stupid
I expected a more intelligent answer from Tiffany. Perhaps she was liquored up!
Tiffany Haddish would have had a different reaction is a white guy who she wasn't friends with had smacked Chris Rock. She's an F-ing joke. She's condoning violence.
What these comments have told me is that y'all really don't understand the situation at all.
Absolutely classless that he was allowed to get away with assault and battery on national tv. Why did ABC or the Oscars remove him for the building? Spineless is the answer. Our family feels terrible for Chris Rock and his family. He didn’t know what she was suffering from. Why didn’t both Smith and his wife give him the benefit of the doubt and talk to Chris Rock after the show?? I already canceled our families subscription to HBO Max because they have the movie he won for. We won’t put one cent of our hard earned money in Will Smith’s pockets or any business he is part of.
The amount of celebrities there that night that thought will assaulting a great comedian for doing his job is upsetting. Shame on them. Also, She’s just mad cuz she’s bald too
https://youtu.be/w3clOMNxhcQ
Tiffany is no longer a stand up comedian she’s an actress in Hollywood, she cannot piss off the powers that be. Sad.
What in the world was she smoking before coming out?  "Discipline needs to be administered"?  You call assault discipline? Has she lost her mind?
it appears that what she is saying. oh the hypocrisy is strong with this one
If only you could see the dislikes..
Wow, i am shocked, girl from hood sticking up for violence.
Homosexual? That is what you got from that?
I find it interesting that everyone only saw the physical assault and not the emotional or mental assault that came along with that joke! Hair means a lot to most women regardless of their color, but in black culture it goes to a different level! I'm not sure why he felt the need to walk out on the world stage and say that joke to a black woman, knowing that hair  in our culture is a sensitive subject! Why is it okay for black women to always be the but of the jokes or degraded all the time? Would he have said this same joke  if the person was white? It starts with at home! These types of jokes just give permission to others to continually look down upon black women, especially when they see black men doing it! For the record Will was completely out of order for his response!! He handled it all wrong! Both of them should be a shame!! All jokes aren't funny! Healing and blessings to everyone involved 🙏
What a moronic response.
Tinkerbell vibes Tiff!
This THING is low class and disgusting.  Drink more act more stupid.
Who is this woman? Vile
Wtf did she do to her hair lmao
Bad joke, but violence is NEVER OK. I don’t care. Will could have run up to the stage and shouted “Keep my wife’s name out of your mouth” without the punch.
Shesh just sucking up lol what a nonsense
What a ridiculous opinion!
Omg people grow the fuck up, chris is a grown ass man and he should have known better, it wasnt funny it was a straight up INSULT about a delicate subject someone is really struggling with, theres shit you just dont mess with. Will could have reacted better yes, without hitting someone BUT and yes im fucking saying but, he is still human omg you people how many times have you done fucked up things??? Probably MANY times, and maybe not even for good reason.
https://youtu.be/-0wtPLDiK_g
Tiffany Haddish as always, clueless!! 🙄😒
She not ready, she done.
More like someone need to learn self control!
its messed up what he said yes for sure. Jada has been open about what she's going through.  was slapping a good  choice on Wills part? No. but she's clearly still uncomfortable about her struggle. I think Chris should of run the joke by Will or idk Will and family should of been giving a notice. Again yes the slap was uncalled for!
W.e the name of the “condition” 🤣 Jada has, IT AINT LIFE THREATENING...many of you blk female put chemicals and BS in your hair, so apparently MANY of yal are suffering from that shot 😆..now yal medical experts..IT WAS A FUCKING JOKE...niggas swear they have empathy but was just ranking on Jada and will just last week..I hate yal selective double standards, and only used for the name of ignorance 🤦‍♂️
will has completely ruined it for himself now, my mum has always been a Will Smith lover and now she has really gone off him. he won’t be looked at the same way by anyone anymore
SNL Should have Chris Rock perform this Saturday
That crap about GI Jane being a derogatory term is some made up BS.  Everyone during that time was hard for Demi Moore in that movie.
Chick barely finished highschool. Who cares what she thinks.
Another toxic ignorant mind roaming the gutters of hollyweird @tiffanygarbage👈🏽
shutuppp lmaoo
thats poor from raddish . as a comedian she should know better.. she just probablky wanna keep sweet with directors of hollywood
Time to slap her when she makes a joke
How about instead of worrying about this “violence” we worry about the people in Ukraine.
Tiffany Haddish is straight trash in a sparkly dress.
Can’t take the good out of everyone
She was off the 👃 candy
When I thought I couldn't be any less of a fan I was proven wrong
Ofcourse she would say that
Why she sounds like a guy and hiding her Adams apple?
Sometimes discipline needs to be administered?????? She sounds a little off to me. I'm not even going to say what I really want to say smh....
This lady is dressed with expensive clothing though she expresses herself and talks so poorly
The joke was extremely distasteful! It insulted her alopecia, it insulted LGBTQ women, it wasn't a good joke. And if someone joked about my PCOS and two miscarriages, you better believe my man would beat their ass! I stand by Will on this - Chris knew better. If you're going to joke about something, make sure you know what your joking about. He had plenty of time to prepare for this and he could have educated himself first
Well Said Tiffany❤😂
"Ain't none of my bizzness- I don't talk about people unless it's in the bizzness".  Please let me know which school she went to so I don't send my kids there.
Awww hell here come the peanut gallery!!! She's lost and drunk!!!
It was absolutely disrespectful to Chris Rock. If a non famous person would’ve done that? Well we all know….also Chris may not have known about Jadas condition, not everyone does, in fact I’d wager to say, most people don’t. Tiffany stated elsewhere, “how could you not have seen Jadas moving, heartbreaking video she made about her condition?” Um, because, I’m not subscribed to her, nor will smith or anything to do with their family, etc etc. I watch YouTube to laugh, and often learn, be inspired, etc..it NEVER came up in my algorithm, did it come up in yours? Get real, it was wrong, and someone, or something should’ve happened, security, ANYTHING, to help Chris Rock feel less like a scolded child instead of the role of HOST to the Oscars. Not a damn thing was done, no one asked if he was ok, he was left to uncomfortably move thru the situation while people rounded around Will, the perpetrator, to help him out…It was a horrible display of entitlement, and gave a message it’s ok to break the law depending on who you are? Let’s see how many people will refer to this moment when they are arrested for doing the same to another….The Academy hopefully will do the right thing.
So as a comedian herself she ok with someone slapping her for one of her jokes?
Who the Fu** is Tiffany Haddish... Go eat your Italian pasta you nobody.
pure racthnetness and ghetto mentality from haddish.  violence is never the answer.
This woman is off. She's trying to dive too deep. So in her words if she says something that someone doesn't like then they have the right to walk on stage and smack her even sillier than she already is
Kinda makes me want to discipline Tiffany Haddish.
She covered in quality but inside she is trash...She never saw the damn movie GI Jane apparently... OMG. Demi Moore was a sex icon from that movie...
So look now ppl will be slapping the shit out of each other i promise...ppl so dumb they take all celebrity acts as acceptable life
Tiffany is a joke and a half...she got paid for her thoughts
Tiffany Haddish is a hand picked representative of idiots...she is a plant put there to further the deterioration of ignorant sendentary  black women in america...this yall hero...
calling someone a homosexual is an insult??? OK . some people can say anything and get away with it..
It was staged...Will and Chris are friends...It was done to bring attention to Will Smith's show. It was meant to increase viewer numbers ...This feels like a Jussie Smollett stunt as no Police report was filed. They didnt want any police problems..
What a waste of an interview.  Does anyone really care what she has to say?
She look drunk
"Just because you're offended doesn't mean you're right." -Ricky Gervais
No! ... Will should not have hit Chris Rock or anything close to it. BUT! when you disrespect someone - joke or not - (and jokes should never be at someone else's expense) - emotions come into play and sometimes get out of hand ... That's the risk you take when you do something like that ( look at how many people have been killed because of emotions) ... So, both of them were wrong as far as I'm concerned - BUT a whole lot of people need to STOP throwing rocks - because YOU are NOT exempt from bad acts in your life.
Poor Will. I hope he is okay. If not he is worth 350 million. I can’t stop crying I just hope Will is okay.
She’s famous ?
Lady in the green costom  gets  really offensive
That movie was based on the first female Navy Seal ever she should be humbled what is Tiffany on ..
Everyone is getting us ready for a woman take over imagine Hillary Clinton and Kamala as president with these women thinking it's ok to his someone on national tv and let it slide because it's will Smith
She is super high,  I don't think she is ok.
And this explains why she’s single in her 30’s. Let see if someone wife’s her up in the next 10 years.
Hay que ser bien cojuda para opinar de esa manera,se supone que son figuras que dan ejemplo a la gente, no te puedes parar y comenzar a pegar a la gente , eso demuestra lo poco inteligente que eres, yo le diria a esta mujer que , mejor cierre la boca que se va a quedar sin trabajo de por vida.
Tiffany Haddish forgot that she is a comedian and she makes jokes about people . So tomorrow if she makes jokes about anybody and those people are offended then they have a right to slap her or discipline her as she says.
it’s not cool… she doesn’t know what she’s talking about!! 🤢
Her compass is all off!!  I guess it's ok for someone to get out of their seat at one of her shows and slap the sh*t outta her for something they don't like.
So the issue was “ it a way to call a person a homosexual “ that’s messed up!
Notice black women are the only women saluting will but if Chris Rock would have killed will Smith on the spot he wouldn't be wrong wake up that's why a lot of black men in the ground right now 💯
She is just THICK
She is so ignorant she doesn't know what that movie was about
This is very disturbing coming from a comedian who knows they make inappropriate and sometimes insulting and harsh comments about the appearance of other people, racial and gender slurs, politics, etc all in the name of joking all the time and get rich doing it without caring about how those people feel who also may be just as hurt by them! Should all of us who support you guys protest to censor all shows, someone write all your scripts to be politically correct, or just stop supporting you all together in the name of protection and defense of all people? That could be a resolve but wouldn’t be fair to those comedians out there with no I’ll intent and spend their lives trying to  make us feel better in a world full of suffering and pain~luv u Tiff but assault is wrong,PERIOD!!!                Hey
Will Smith didn’t do it out of protection of his wife’s honor , he did that out of humiliation and a damaged ego . 10 Minutes prior to the incident , Regina made a joke about Will being married but single , Jada would approve of Will Joining the single men, a joke relating to Will/Jada issue. Will was triggered but played it off . Chris Rock joke was the straw that  broke the camels back .
When Ratchet Meets Carpet 🤣
Shit look like dookie you can tell she's high
0:49 total BS.
Tiffany  is just ghetto, and not In a good way. Tiffany's is a  comedian  and I  can't believe her response,  I  am waiting on  her show when she said something about someone,  and the right person in her audience,  walks up a slaps the shit out of her. Be careful what you condone Tiffany,  it will find you. You also have lost your credibility for me. I  will not support  ignorance.  Your statement is from a place of ignorance. Shameful  and a disgrace.
Well maybe she’s used to behavior like that. Which means he’s done this before for Jada. She’s probably seen first hand since she’s done movies with Jada.
Why comedians don't stick together
Will made Chris Rock his bitch .And y'all are mad that the nice soft man getting bullied actually showed you he's a man
Nope.
im insulted that she thought that was insulting we should take her right to speech away. not free speech no take them cords out so she's mute.
Um, ok, G.I. Jane shaving her head had absolutely nothing to do with anything Tiffany Haddish cited here. She shaved her head because she's in a brutal contest to pass the most challenging air, land, and sea aquatic program in the armed forces. Hair is in the way and she shaved her head. Not a lesbian message you dullard, it's about dispensing with everything but the fundamental necessities she needed to succeed. Her body was an instrument, period. Tiffany is incredibly misinformed!
So next time you're at Tiffany's standup and feel offended by her joke, you know what to do....
She turnt up
He is luck it’s Chris ROCK not THE ROCK
But she just talked about their business. Wow!  Dumb as a bag of rocks
A homosexual? Wtf is she talking about
Girl please Jada castrated W Smith on red table talk he's been fucked up ever since, he made a weak attempt and trying to regain the favorable look he once got from his wife before she took the long d.... from a singer. red table talk was castration 1.0 tof a man the Oscars was I have my hand up his ass I showed my disapproval and he jumped 2.0 Oscars !Smith needs to be a man and let her go cuz she's already gone life facts
Finally!  The time has come for the lame ass Academy Awards to change its format with comedians spotlighting celebrities to unleash unwanted attention on them. Like Will said, celebrities are expected to just take it regardless of what the context is been said even in a jokingly manner. It's sad and disappointing, that society are taught that if a person speaks out about something that is alarmingly not right that they are suppose to waive it off because it's part of the job. BS! Chris Rock, knew where he was going with his jacked up comedy, very disrespectful to Jada and her health condition. Auto Immune Diseases are not funny and living with it is hell! Not once have I heard any comments regarding the fact that the Academy Awards taking responsibility for some of the rude jokes that comedians  get up on stage trying to deliver their not so funny, tired ass jokes. Year after Year! Will, Denzel was trying to remind you of something  you already knew about being in the entertainment industry. Lessons learned. Wow!  The price of fame will catch up with you and try to destroy you.....if you let them!
Tiffany sounds so ignorant🤬
Wtf is she talking about????smh
Tiffany need to UNDERSTAND as a woman in general ( if she DOESN'T ) it's the RIGHT thing to do for ANY man to protect his woman if he feels she is being PHYSICALLY and, or VERBALLY attacked,  I am in TOTAL agreement with her ( Tiffany ) .HOWEVER in such a place and sitting as THIS, it most CERTAINLY wasn't the TIME or the place for such behavior.  There are THOUSANDS of OTHER places he could have found Chris if he felt the NEED to do what he did. There is a TIME and PLACE for everything. Will was OUT of his character,  which I truly believe is GOOD, but not on THAT day.
She is Naturally 🥴
In NYC and other cities, people are being pushed onto subway tracks, into traffic, down stairs, punched and kicked because their presence on earth gives offense to thugs with Will Smith’s ethics.
I’d give her some Italian Sazits hahaha
The lack of empathy is distasteful. Tired response.
so violence is the right thing to do ?
Of all people you think a "comedian" would come to defend COMEDY. How the mighty have fallen
Her voice is so annoying
Who she
If you can't take a comedian's joke, don't sit in the front row, least of all if coiffed and dressed like Hellraiser's Pinhead.
Wow she wack for excusing that
Tiffany is such a hypocrite. This is what a scorned soul looks and sounds like.
"Will Smith was defending his wife's honor". Exactly WHAT HONOR?!?!? When a your "wife" has men on booty call status (Oh Im sorry, I meant to say ENTANGLEMENT) she has NO HONOR. Especially when she dragged it all out in public and to Will's face from across a table, laughing it off every time Will would remark or something, all proudly recorded for tv consumption.  HORNY and HONOR are two very different things.
Chris Rock should sue Smith for $200 millions dollars
And ironically she's not exactly not lookin GI Jane
It’s a joke, we’ve all heard worse things. But Will is a clown because he was laughing at first and had to show off for a woman that never misses a chance to humiliate or disrespect him on TV. But eh
She kisses there ass …
What she really means is that there is a little Putin beneath the surface of Will Smith's big smile. Send him to Russia where he belongs.
Why Tiffany stay looking like she had 1 too many
I totally agree! Love you Tif
Green for the money?  What happened to god once you got up there?  Lord.  And to condone violence, imagine the Cuban boys protecting their girls.  Lol
TIF "FANNY" AINT FUNNY ANY WHO!! WHAT SHE TALKING ABOUT!!?? DONT TRY AND SWITCH THIS BITCH.
Oh Tiffany… all about women empowerment… then needs a man to ‘protect’ her. Nothing excuses violence! And even if he called him gay… as you claim - he should be laughing it off anyway. So again did he insult both of them? What a bunch of bs! Nothing excuses violence! Nothing at all!
So was OJ entitled Tiffany. Didn’t Ron Goldman insult him.
Haddish: "I hope to get some Italian in me tonight". So classy!!!! and then she proceeds to do a racist impersonation of an Italian.
i lost all my respect for Tiffany after this interview. i was one of her biggest fans.
Firstly this foolish woman (Tifanny) is not a comedian.
🙄 A womans "Take" ...
Even her VOICE is annoying. condoning violence, while walking around looking a giant booger. you just can't fix stupid.
Tiffany ain’t got no man in the way she teaches me that statement she never will this is wild when black men get famous they marry white women everybody except Clarence Thomas it worked out for
Isn't she ment to be a comedian? lol
I disagree with her take
WAS a fan of Tiffany Hadish. Not anymore.
So she condones violence then. Nice 👍
She sounds dumb
She walking thin line in black community better avoid all talk shows for awhile😑
Her drunk ass can’t even stay in a relationship.  We don’t hear you Tiffany.
She is ok with someone assaulting a “fellow brother”. Hypocrite
friendship over!
She is annoying asf!! 😭😭😭🤢🤢🤢
Hadish broke up and got on and broke up again with her violent ex. This girl is the epitome of Stockholm Syndrome. And now that Chris made a the mildest joke ever written, Hadish had to agree with one of the most powerful black men in Hollywood. It’s as if she forgets she makes fun of people for a living like Chris Rock and remembered to how to have a positive connection with her abuser.
Girls like this get dudes killed everyday
No excuses what will did was not acceptable I don't care what celebrity is vomiting up whatever bullshit euphemistic crap they want to justify it if anybody else had done that they'd be in jail. The academy is disgusting and all of these celebrities making excuses are disgusting as well. I didn't think my opinion of them could go any lower but people always surprise you
isn't walking on a stage considered Trespassing? Like running on a ballfield ?
clearly on drugs
If that is how you define success then keep it. Everything will eventually end up in the garbage. The showy display of one’s means doesn’t give us value. Pride comes before a fall. Men of substance that care about themselves and others will take their discussion of stage. Teach him to keep his integrity. He did not teach Chris anything because that is what discipline means to tutor.  Teach something that benefits the person. The gala, carnival is decaying.
THANK YOU TIFFANY. STOP RIGHT THERE! TO PUBLICLY MOCK A FEMALE HAVING NO HAIR IS A FORM OF DEGRADING FEMALES. WHAT WILL SMITH DID WAS PRECISELY WHAT HE SHOULD HAVE DID IF HE LOVED HIS WIFE, WOMAN, WHATEVER JADEN IS TO HIM. SINCE THIS WORLD SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY ON THE SIDE OF PERVERSION, PLEASE TAKE A LESSON FROM WILL SMITH'S ACTIONS. DO NOT TALK ABOUT A MAN'S WOMAN WIFE MOTHER ETC LIKE THAT IN PUBLIC AND THINK THAT IT'S FUNNY. WILL SMITH CORRECTED A A WRONG THAT WAS DONE TO HIS LOVED ONE. FOR ALL OF THE PERVERTS OUT THERE WHO PROMOTE GAY MALE AGENDAS, "WATCH YOUR MOUTH". WELL DONE WILL. THANKS FOR STANDING UP FOR YOUR WOMAN.
It’s called a JOKE! I have a prosthetic leg and I take absolutely no offense to any jokes about amputee’s. Comedy is an art form just like acting is! You don’t think anyone has ever been offended by a line will smith has said in a movie or an interview? Does that mean that anyone who is offended should be allowed to walk up and slap him? What Chris did was his job, what Will did was a crime!
If this is success then you can keep it because in the end it all ends up in the garbage dump. We need to learn self control and not promote bad actions especially when on a stage. Real men can take their disagreements off stage. They do not become a spectacle.
Tiffany 2 damn pretty 2 have that masculine attitude/energy🤣😂😭but them b the 1z🤦🏽‍♂️ she can relate 2 Jada cuz she like simps as well. They all attract weak Men with that attitude. Jezebel Activity
None wrong wit standin up 4 ya Lady but itz the way you do it. Was it by choice or force. If itz forced she will never respect you anyway cuz it should be an automatic choice but that wasn’t a reason to do that.
Sleeping ya way to the top, that's ya  cookie  own it
Why am I not surprised at what this woman says, will smith was way, way out of line and she condones this??  I can’t wait for Dave Chapelle to weigh in on this.
So is Tiffany saying, the next time she says something that others find offensive, it’s ok to discipline her??? There is a difference between discipline and assault. Consequences need to follow Will Smith’s assault. He cannot just walk away from this like he was not dead wrong.
Brain dead never thought I can say that about my peoples and Will is a coward
Is she high? Unreal the way some people think these days. I used to admire her.
Can this woman just be quiet she talks too much.
I'm sorry Tiffany haddish should be the last person talking about discipline before saying a joke. Like don't get me wrong I love Tiffany haddish in all of her movies, but this is nothing but fangirl excuses.
Chris Rock behavior was very distasteful and disrespectful to Jada. He tried to publicly humiliate her at a time when she is at her most vulnerable. This is a time in her life when her self-esteem is being challenged due to a condition that she has no control over. I do not promote violence that I do promote a man protecting his wife. Chris Rock has targeted Jada Pinkett Smith more than once publicly and he finally got what he deserved. Will Smith is only human and he did what any man who loves his wife would do when someone disrespectfully targets his wife. Chris Rock need to learn how to differentiate what is funny and what is not funny and stop targeting women about their hair. I will never support anything concerning Chris Rock due to his disrespectful views against African American women.
2 minute noodle head don't have a dam clue what's she talking about
I love Tiffany she keeps it real.
She looks like a pint of Guinness..😂😂
What Smith did was very wrong and he did not cover himself with glory the way he talked. These celebrities are just rich pricks. This lady is wrong.
Love Chris more than ever now - Go Chris  - you ROCK!!!!!
she's going way to overboard with it all he did was make a joke that was pertaining to her hairstyle which the girl in GI Jane has the same!, if you can't take the heat then he shouldn't have been in the kitchen with his emotional ass remember this is showbiz Chris was doing his job 💯💯💯💯
Tiffany is best friends with will and Jada so of course she would defend the worst moment in his life.
Haddishbis sexist.
Better she never say a word..
SHES TALKING CRAP! NEXT PLEASE!
SOMEBODY TRYING TO STAY ON THE SMITHS GOOD SIDE SHE SOUNDS RIDICULOUS. SHE SHOULD BE EMBARRASSED!
Don’t worry Tiffany . You’re a comedian right ? Alright , you’ve opened up yourself to ……….. lol 😂 Better begin writing about the birds and the bees because you call out anyone live or you goin get it lol 😂
Another ass heard from here.
It was an inexusable assault. I love Will but this was not ok and Tiffany's reaction is ridiculous especially since she is a comic.
This is straight up nonsense  You can protect your wife in so many other ways . Has jada been protecting her marriage herself or will smith .  The joke wasn’t even vile or demeaning . It was a joke
I did not take the joke as highlighting her sexuality. I took it as Jada's haircut and equating her with the movie G.I. Jane since the character shaved her head. Tiffany is reaching.
Chris didn’t know about her condition. Obviously it’s wrong, but he didn’t know. The joke was not said maliciously with the intent to hurt. Will smith on the other hand purposely acted out to hurt Chris. Two wrongs don’t make a right
Lol.
Sucking up to that Smith money.
LOVE YOU WILL SMITH . ROCK YOUR A PUNK .
first part of the statement is okay, second part facepalm. In no way this was appropriate.
Yeh, He "Sonned him" . East Coast West PHILLY ILLY style. 😆
She’s a comedian a terrible one but how can she not take Chris side…
BAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!! STUPID!!
Will would not dare slap a white guy on stage.  After laughing at that joke, he should just cover himself in shame.
Unbelievable, these people are insane. Assaults someone on stage and this is their reaction… slapped in the face for a mild joke… wow
This woman's a clown.
They hired a clown this year. 🤡
i love Tiffany but this is WRONG! it was a JOKE if he wanted to defend his wife he could have done it another way instead of putting his hands on Chris! lshe basically said that’s what he deserves, that’s bullshit bro
This woman is out of line with her comments, phrasing what Will the thug did to Chris. Horrendous. Please, sit down lady.
This be@ch got some nerve!. This is a grown ass man you talking about.  Displine! Nah he violated Chris.  He assaulted him.  You'll understand when somebody slap the shit outta your ass for doing your job.
Lol what did I just watch? Did this person not get the memo? Chris Rock is a comedian, and his joke was so mild i missed it, until he got slapped and everyone was talking about it.
I dont know who or care who this person is but she is a just a child who never grew up. "Remembering" how KIDS used a GI Jane line to insult someone does not excuse a supposed grown ass man for acting violently towards another. Let alone on a world broadcast program.
Looks like a costume to me!
So according to Tiffany Haddish, Chris Rock was actually calling Jada a homosexual? Damn, Tiffany Haddish should of been a detective instead of a comedian. She must some Sherlock Holmes levels of deductive reasoning to connect those two ideas together.  To Tiffany Haddish, there is no way that Chris Rock's joke about G.I. Jane was a homophobic slur. Sometimes not talking works better than talking.
She obviously doesnt have a clue what shes talking about
Violence is ok if it is Will Smith ?
Silly creature. How can she condone violence so publicly? She's  not doing herself any favours.
Your telling me not one of these people who is sticking up for Will has ever laughed at dark joke. Exactly, doesn't mean anything until its directed at you and f*ck will smith aswell.
Whatever GI Jane 3. Your the perfect women for the role
I use to like Tiffany but lost a ton of respect for her. It's not ok to assault someone. An the way she craps on this reporter for a "costume change" it's just sad... fame has gotten to her head.
Damn Tiffany Haddish officially an op guys
Haddish, it is never okay to assult someone over an insult or joke. Use your words! If you’re in physical danger then all licence to you but Smith has 10-12cm of height & at least 40pounds on Rock. Haddish, your assesment of Gi Jane is complete BS, the movie was about womens equality and the right serve & compete alongside men.
Had nothing to do with sexuality.
Tiff is a comedian, and thinks that Chris’s joke was messed up? Jada gave Tiff her 1st movie role, that’s what that comment is about (politics). It what it is I guess.
Our race love bufunery!!! Get ready get set gooooooo!
Will Smith patetico
Condoning violence for words is placing you in the same camp as those Jihadists that massacred Charlie Hebdo journalists for CARTOONS. Truth hurts, so sorry, gonna send Will to slap ME? I live in a Stand Your Ground state, so good luck with that.
Tiffany is full of shit. She can still support Jada and Will without condoning illegal behavior. I'm done with Will crazy ass. Chris should have retaliated kicking that nigga in his back and made Will fall on poor Liza Minneli and her wheel chair.
You see Chris you should have slept with his wife because thats ok and you wouldn't have got slapped.
You will always be that “actress/comedian/aspiring everything person” who NEEDS OTHER CELEBS support to even remain relevant. May God help you start standing in “your truth” that you so claim to support —- you’re a joke “Tiffany” - pathetic. What he did was WRONG. That’s it. Wake up lady.
Tiffany Haddish just insulted the LGBT community by claiming that a hetero being compared to or called a homosexual is an insult.
So it’s ok to hit her when she makes a joke about someone?
Tiffany Haddish was absolutely wrong. First thing. I'm not surprised how she viewed it. This was a comedian telling jokes. Also Tiffany...G I Jane was a tribute to strong women who are put up against extremely tough odds and over coming those odds. I've always said it...celebrities are spineless. They think they are above other people.
What a fool this woman is. Discipline? That’s a response by a low functioning person in response to a cave man act.
Tiffany has clearly never seen G.I. Jane. How is a comparison to G.I. Jane an insult to a woman’s sexuality and physique? Demi Moore wasn’t gay in that film, and even if she was, what is the issue? And also if someone compares your physique to Demi Moore in G.I. Jane, that’s such a compliment. G.I. Jane is one of the most underrated girl power films to ever exist and there are so many men that would give to be as in shape as what Demi was for that film.
Trash actors.
Haddish is not the smartest person in the room
Runs in their culture
I wanna see G.I Jane 2 starring alopecia the queen of the fresh prince.
Consider the source, and maybe the grammar👀
Was she drunk?
Doesn't she mean she wishes she had a women who would slap someone for her?
“With a single petulant blow, [Will Smith] advocated violence, diminished women, insulted the entertainment industry, and perpetuated stereotypes about the Black community.” Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
Stay away from women with warped ideologies like this at all costs
The worst part is that she's a comedian condoning this. Wtf is wrong with people.
She doesn't know what she is talking about
Has anyone ever heard of G.I Jane being used as a derogatory term for a lesbian? This lady has NO idea WTF she is talking about or just straight up lying. Trying to make Chris look like a homophobe?  Seriously?  Why?  Demi was beautiful in that movie and the "joke" was an absolute compliment.
WHAT a complete SHAME smith is
Smith Tarnished forever
Agreed wholeheartedly
Tiffany is just biased. I mean everybody knows that Will is her friend. Wtf is she talking about? Did she see GI Jane, cause it kinda sounds like she's bluffing here.
Another toxic woman
I like TH, but I don’t agree with her on this. First, it’s not insulting to be called a homosexual. So who cares if someone insinuates that you’re gay (I don’t even know what she’s talking about on this anyway—no one used references to the film as a way to call others gay). Second, Demi Moore, a gorgeous actress who remained gorgeous with zero hair, was G. I. Jane. Gorgeous and empowering character. Am I the only one who took Chris’ comments as almost… sweet? idk. Out of place, yes, but kind of sweet? I really don’t think Chris meant to hurt Jada. Anyway, Jada looked badass. Not that she needs our approval anyway!
Nothing to do with GI Jane...this is a castrated man acting to please his moter-like figure....shame on Haddish for beign a spineless celebrity
I am old remember when Tiffany used to be a comic. Ahh the good old days
Her IQ was too low to respond
She was lame for that one. Notice she’s acting different now too. And what does she mean it’s a way to call someone homosexual? Like that is a bad thing?
So the next time Tiffany is on stage and makes fun of someone it's ok if she gets smacked or punched?
Typical liberal response. It’s ok to use violence against people that hurt your feelings
Boycott Will Smith... Lame... Lack of self control ... he can act!
Learn to de-escalate
This is disgusting. There is no excuse for physical violence, particularly at an award show on live television. Wtf is wrong with people.
Tiffany is a lame.
Tiffany Haddish response in defending Will Smith was that of a person who also has a fragile ego,, I guess she can relate, and being called G.I. Jane is not an insult questioning a woman's femininity.
Wow! Coming from a comedian at that, I’ve lost all respect
She’s a joke . Money doesn’t buy class ..
Girl bye! Go sit down!
Tiffany is just damn biased with her statement... Does she have a beef with Chris? cos it looks like it!   She's just talking trash with regards to her "Discipline" talk
Tiffany is just damn biased with her statement... Does she have a beef with Chris? cos it looks like it!   She's just talking trash with regards to her "Discipline" talk
WTF ??
Shut up Tiffany  Chris Rock the victim not will U would of been pissed if another race hit Chris instead of will...bull shit
🐂💩
Agree Blexy
So to be homosexual is insulting??? She’s racists and NOT politically correct! Wow wee PUT FOOT IN MOUTH ☠️🤡☠️
Repent Jada, Will, Tiffany. Leviticus 20:13. Tiffany you need a time out. BLACK on Black crime is NEVER ok. Repent and get that stupid blonde hair out of your head Leviticus 13 30
Tiffany who. Learn to speak proper 😂
Really Tiffany???  "Discipline needs to be administered..repercussions for your actions"?? Is that the disclaimer and permission you annouce to your audience before your stand-up acts? SMH. . . .
God loves you,  Jesus Christ saves, Give Him a chance.
Next joke she makes, she’s getting it
Thank you Queen Tif for bein honest and true. You gotta take consequences for ya actions. Ya all who think that joking around insulting someone on live tv is appropriate? Ain't ya all just support bullying then? Ain't that schmidt the same? If yaall or ya wife got insult in real life I bet ya ass ain't gonna do nothing. Trust me... CR could've talk to Smith about what he's up to before goin' on stage and be askin him if it's okay for him to do his materials, I mean, roastin' and jokin' about someone else's life, ain't that just tragic moral lost?... be it in everyday life or on live tv it ain't do any good...
Will smith might be the worst human being. He assaults someone, gets an award, cries about it and gives excuses. Now we have people praising him. Wooow.
Chris must sue Oscar and will smith . Otherwise no performer is safe .
This whole thing is so messed up. I've always liked Will Smith, but after that night, I lost all respect for him and gained new respect for Chris for handling it like a professional. I was confused why he wasn't immediately escorted away...Oscar privilege I guess... smh
Tiffany just trynna get some Will dick. Her opinions are based on feelings not logic & reasoning.
GI Jane was a way to call women a homosexual?  Say what!?  I dont know a single dude that didnt think Demi Moore wasnt hot, even with a shaved head.  Maybe that’s what women thought, coz it sure as hell not what men thought.  And I cant think of a single comedian that dont roast people.  She giving an ok to slap comedians if you get all sensitive?  What, she gonna give a pass because Will Smith is her friend?
Tiffany sounds very GHETTO....CLEAN IT UP GIRL.  She sounds LOW CLASS.. NO EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE AT ALL. Also Jada HAS admitted to having experiences with WOMEN TO in their " open" marriage...BOTH Jada and WILL are a HOT MESS and Tiffany is basically CHEERING WILL ON saying that Chris deserved it...Tiffany YOU are GHETTO GIRL , GET SOME THERAPY AND SOME CLASS....
the joke by Chris is terrible, the display of violence by Will is terrible, and Tiffany Hadish has a fragile ego.
She right
WHY DO PEOPLE THINK CHRIS KNEW ABOUT HER HAIR? I NEVER HEARD OF IT UNTIL WILL SLAPPED CHRIS. WHO THE HELL SAID CHRIS HAS BEEN SITTING AROUND KEEPING TRACK WITH EVERY LITTLE BIT OF JADA OR WILL LIFE REVELATIONS? WHO THE HELL CARES? I HEARD MANY STARS AND OTHERS SAY THEY DIDNOT KNOW EITHER. HELL, WHAT IS THIS, JADA SPEAKS AND THE WHOLE WORLD STANDS AT ATTENTION!!!! I KEEP HEARING THAT SHE SPOKE ON IT OFTEN. SO WHAT? WE ALL HAVE LIVES LESS BUSY THAN CHRIS AN MANY OF US NEVER HEARD. OH, BY THE WAY THE CONDITION JADA SAYS SHE HAS DOES NOT CAUSE SCARRING IN ANY FORM. READ UP ON IT. THAT LOOKS LIKE A SCAR FROM A BROW LIFT. HAIR HARDLY EVER GROWS IN SCAR TISSUE.
Black Lives Matter! Unless you get Slapped by Will on the Oscar set!
Nothing turns on black women more than a black man physically dominating another man. I’ll say that much
I like Tiffany Haddish but she's got it all wrong being ok with Will Smith's actions of attack.  She's assuming that Chris Rock knew about Jada's alopecia and gave a direct intentional insult toward her and I don't believe  that is the case at all that Chris Rock would intentionally say something to anyone to hurt anyone that way as the comedian he is known for.  I don't believe for one second Will Smith's horrible action and disgusting outburst were done and said to defend his wife.  I do  believe his action of attack came out more from the FEAR of once seeing Jada's unfavorable reaction was what  spurred him to suddenly take unthought out action against Chris Rock.  This man is afraid of his wife who plays him like a puppet in their marriage.  She is the one who's caused him deep pain and humiliated him down to nothing due in her desire of an open marriage and to her publicized affair with a kid named August.  I have no respect for her as a woman but do have compassion for Will in what he has openly dealt with  by her. In no way at all should any of us condone his attack on Chris Rock at all.  I hope Will's true friends reach in to see the truth behind all this and get him to seek professional help as I feel it's seriously needed seeing he's hurting deep inside and needs immediate counsel.  This whole family needs serious counsel to much and in seeing now the very concerning and very unhealthy response from Will's son-Jaden to his father's physical attack including language on Chris Rock.  The academy should never have over looked Will Smith's assault or behavior at all for one second and had him taken off the floor with no privilege to not to accept his award!   This whole thing was disgraceful in it's handling!!  A new found admiration and respect to Chris Rock for handling himself so professionally and with such grace under such an attack!
She’s so ignorant listening to her bullshit about G.I. Jane and this story. So insignificant to the situation. Don’t insult us Italians with your clothing and your unfortunate take on this story. How disappointing.
I always new this one to be dumb so I'm not surprised.
Tough words from Baldo here.
No way should he have hit Chris Rock! He was actually laughing at the joke. I think his wife is driving him crazy! she just spoiled a great night for him
You can take a lady out the streets. But you can’t take the streets out the lady
how many of you can tell she's just a punk… Holly weird is a place were too many rotten people can put on designer clothes pretend they have class when they're nothing but crap always work always will be
Chris Rocks✊🏿
What the hell is she talking about
She did not get the joke. That's not true - what she said
Key word's "HOMOSEXUAL" spoken of in the BIBLE. If your filling's got hurt, the truth hurt's.
So her logic is  Jokes = bad Assault = Good
You can take gal out the streets. But u can’t take the streets out the girl
she has a mouth 👄 on her 😂
I think too much hair bleach is affecting her brain. Discipline? Please this woman's way of thinking disgusts me 🤢
Disappointed Tiffany thought the slap was "discipline". You can hurt people physically over a joke...so what's the hoo haa over Charlie Hepdo? So you can diss some people others you can't? Where is the line? Careful Tiffany your line of thought could boomerang back, you never know who will be offended by your comedy and God forbid they think you needed "discipline".
Ofcourse Tiffany Haddish won't defend comedy or comedians, atleast she's not associating her "stand up" to comedy anymore as hers is garbage.
That’s the perfect response! “I don’t talk about people business unless I’m in the business”
That project chick is Ghetto herself. Like her opinion matters.. she comes from a background of drugs and violence to her it was justified...
I thought this B was a comedian, but guess not. Never thought she was really funny n we all know she owes Jada her careers of course she ain't gonna say sh*t
I guess Hadish doesn't remember the movie either.  G.I. Jane was definitely not a lesbian.
Tiffany better not be drinking after that DUI.
Tiffany haddish is a single miserable woman who gets drunk and sleeps in her car. Her opinion on relationships should be ignored. I hope she keeps that same energy if attacked on stage during a stand up
"So called", Black on Black Crime is REAL. If he had of been 6'4, etc you know the Rest. No Shalawam for the Wicked 🖤.
What I want to know is after the slap if he had repeated G.I. Jane 2 can’t wait to see it does Will then  have the greenlight to pick up the chair and break it over his head and after that had he repeat the phrase does he then have the Greenlight to grab a steak knife and stab him if he didn’t repeated G.I. Jane 2 can’t wait to see it  does that then give him the greenlight to take out a gun and execute him 🤷‍♂️
Maybe Will should be more worried about his bald wife sleeping with August Alsina than what a comedian has to say about her Sinead O'Connor look.
I would say she better not be making any jokes about anyone's husband next time she does stand-up, but then again, she didn't make any jokes last time she did stand-up
She should be scared the next time she makes a joke on stage especially being a comedian...someone gonna slap her...the industry has changed after this
LOWLIFE
My goodness she is so ignorant.
Will telling a bald joke: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7u9_z7ZSnk
What a shame celebs supporting that kind of behaviour, and giving him a sanding ovation? Will Smith should give the oscar back.
Girl, you not even funny but even YOU are a comedian should be ashamed for what you said. Girls trip was god awful
Shes the epitome of ratchet.
Lucky it was Mike Lowrey instead of Del Spooner robotic arm or Hancock
I'LL SAY IT ON EVERY WILL SMITH VIDEO I COME ACROSS MOVING FORWARD - YOU LIL BOY ARE A DOUCHE!  CHRIS ROCK YOU ARE A CLASS ACT!
I guess your life was about....love make you do crazy things... trash
PEOPLE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT HOW CHRIS ROCK ACTED WITH DIGNITY, CLASS, AND SELF CONTROL!!!!! CHRIS ROCK SHOULD HAVE HAD THE STANDING OVATION!!!!! FOR THE COMPLETE PROFESSIONALISM AND THE SELF RESTRAINT HE SHOWED FOR HIMSELF AND THE AUDIENCE. CHRIS ROCK WAS A PILLAR OF STRENGTH AND A REAL GENTLEMEN!!!!! TO WILL AND JADA SMITH THE FAME HAS GONE TO YOUR HEADS….YOU ARE DELUSIONAL IF YOU THINK THAT WHOLE SCENE MADE YOU LOOK IN ANYWAY BUT THE IGNORANT FOOLS THAT YOU’VE BECOME!!!! SOMEONE NEEDS TO EXPLAIN TO WILL SMITH HE IS NOT THE ROLES YOU PLAY!!!!! YOU ARE NOT KING RICHARD!!!! A REAL MAN WOULD HAVE STOOD UP AND USED HIS WORDS TO RESPECT AND CHERISH HIS WIFE AND FAMILY BY STANDING UP ASKING TO USE THE MIC AND EXPLAIN IN A POLITELY AND DIGNIFIED MANNER THAT YOU UNDERSTOOD IT WAS A JOKE AND YOU ARE DOING YOUR JOB……BUT YOUR WIFE JADA HAS AN AUTOIMMUNE DISORDER THAT SHE IS STRUGGLING WITH…SO PLEASE UNDERSTAND HOW THAT JOKE CAN EFFECT ‘US’ AT THIS TIME IN OUR LIVES. YOU ARE DOING YOUR JOB, BUT AS A MAN, A HUSBAND AND A FATHER I CANOT STAND BY AND LET MY WIFE BE HARMED WITH WORDS….AS INNOCENT AS THE WORDS MIGHT BE!!!!! NOW WILL AND JADA SMITH THAT IS HOW A REAL MAN HANDLES HIS BUSINESS!!!! I AM EMBARRASSED FOR YOU!!!! SHAME SHAME ON YOU FOR YOUR ARROGANCE AND STUPIDITY!!! YOUR APOLOGY CAME TOOOO LATE!!! CHRIS ROCK! I APPLAUD YOU FOR BEING THE MAN YOU ARE AND STAND FOR!!!!
Trish you ain't nothing I remember when you started... Oh I'm the victim and I had a bad life... your sorry.
I used to like you...but you not right. Daddy issues. You make no sense. You been hurt by men. Cause you suck. You came from the gutter now you got something. Wow. Money really makes you sell out.
If Will was white might Tiffany say the slap was racist?
Why the hell jada didn’t say nothing
And this is why Tiffany has no man.  By the way, wouldn’t G I Jane be considered some sort of female empowerment nowadays.  She wouldn’t be talking like that if she wasn’t BFF with Jada
All of this is going to go away and people are going to start talking about something else
I’m black and I’m tired of seeing Tiffany haddish, I miss Monique.
She don’t know how to have money with humility.  Not wifey material…  #goofynarcissistdevillikeherbaldhomegirl
This blond haired black woman, is a comedian, defending a raging cuckold husband, who was defending his adulterous wife’s honor, who assaulted a comedian…I can’t make that up.
damn snowflake
Can we slap Tiffany to show her some discipline?
She has no talent
She’s homophobic
You can tell Tiffany is thrash
DISGUESTING Culture, Deplorable. How many time W.Smith, every comedian made actual 10 times worst jokes..?? MILLIONS OF TIMES. I just saw a W.Smith making jokes on a balled man years ago, it's on YOUTUBE. I will lose respect for C.Rock if he doesn't file charges. Not filing charges is enabling this culture in that community, and that's the reason of JAIL REVOLVING DOOR...
So the next time she makes a joke that offends someone they get to walk up on stage and smack her? She knows better
I mean, did we really expect her to say anything else? It would've been career suicide for her
What nonsense. Will can’t just act like he’s at home. The comedian was just doing his thing
If there is anybody on this planet that knows about unfunny jokes, it's this woman right here.
Defending her?? Thats not defending her that's assault
Just the other day in my city, a woman got upset with a guy for standing too close to her in line at a donut shop and decided to call her boyfriend who wound up shooting the guy. The man never touched or threatened her, she just felt he was standing too close and decided to use her bf as a threat and her bf entered the scene thinking it was his job to defend his woman’s honor from someone invading her personal space. This is toxic masculinity and Tiffany Haddish is just like that woman; they think that is romantic because they have a toxic view of relationships. He was not “defending” his wife. He was embarrassed by his own initial amusement and had to save face. She needs to go away. No wonder Common dumped her.
So if I just walked up to you and slapped you you be cool with that
G I Jane didnt mean that shit Tiffany stop it!
Raggedy
I think it was wrong...also I think Chris rock knew her condition and still he made that joke..
Will should have taken Chris to the back room and had a man to man talk. Non of this bullshit that took place,it was childish and disrespectful to everyone around the world. “ The slap heard round the world “!
If it was anyone else but WIll Smith and Chris Rock she would have a different opinion I feel
People MAKE MISTAKES, Everyone commenting on here I WISH they had a camera on them their whole lives to be scrutinized the way Will is. No ones saying it is ok, but he also is human and having a man insulting you wife in front of millions of people at an event that to them one of the most prestigious and spectacular of there accomplishments and careers. Next to people they respect and admire, let me tell you I bet more then half would have acted the same if not worse. I'm tired of seeing everyone annihilating someone (a celebrity) you guys act like they are perfect and not human. Just lets move on and let them sort this out in private. This cancel culture is disgusting like let people BE HUMAN.
She has the wrong way of seeing discipline
Damn surprised that she didn't standby her fellow comedian.  While he was on the job.  I dunno.  Maybe I'm not sensitive enough to see how no one sees this was apart of the Oscar show.  I feel like Tiffany is bringing up personal ish from the fact Common broke up with her.
coward once for not having the balls to kick this woman out knowing she screw his son 19 yr old best friend coward twice for unlished all his resentment to a small inoffensive man (bet he wouldn't do it to Dwyne Johnson) Coward for 3erd time by looking for excuses and playing victimhoodband have the guts to receive the Oscar and give speech.. Now everyone knows who you really are: Coward, resentfull and abusive
She knows dame well as a comedian that Chris did nothing wrong . She knows that’s his job but she is best friends with jada and is always wanting to secure her pay check she does the same with Ellen! Pathetic woman!
Love you Tiffany!
it shocks me the number of people who defend chris rock. you can't call verbal abuse a joke and just say it's okay. because the "joke" chris rock made was just another in a long line of verbal abuse toward Black women. i'm not surprised will slapped him. honestly i don't blame him.
Tiffany I hope you never get assaulted by a man & then have everyone congratulate the person who knocked you unconscious!
Hey Haddish - "Love Makes You Do Crazy Things" said Will Smith & every man or woman who has murdered or maimed their intimate partner.
Thought this woman was meant to be a comedian smh
He apologized to the organization for his actions, but not to Chris "for the same actions" which makes the whole apology statement disingenuous🤔. Take the King Richard award back and give him one for being the best apologetic actor - in the shape of a✋🏼
Unbelievable, defending Will Smith after slapping someone on live TV, that's no worse than the audience pretending it never happened and the cops allowing and assault seen around the world to go unchecked. The world knows this place is a joke.
Yikes Haddish!  IF Smith was so offended for HIS wife he ought to have talked privately to Rock. As a female I have had my femininity questioned, we have many messed up movies & TV shows portraying the bad treatment of women 24/7. I wonder why Haddish found the GI Jane movie particularly homophobic by featuring a female shaved head? Somehow I doubt she did especially sporting her current short short hairdo - not that there is any thing wrong with it, I have done the same. So much for releasing gender stereotypes, eh? Will Smith was emotionally out of control, reaffirming how easy violence is condoned & perpetrated in the U$A, especially for a person with immense privilege.
I expected this disgusting female to say something like this!
She just stupid!   Demi Moore was a badass in GI Jane!   Shaved head and got in outstanding shape!
Ummm.....no Tiffany👎
Tiffany Haddish sounds so immature!! And stupid!! Being a kiss up chic! gets u nowhere.. separate your personal crap..from this situation..I did like her until now...
Don't know who she is... Seems like she's just another one that believes their bigger than life.
At the end of the day will handled that the way a HUSBAND is supposed to his WIFE has a medical condition weather or not you knew does not make it ok 💯it’s his wife and he defended her 🤷🏽‍♂️💯simple… don’t say dumb shit if uon want dumb reactions
I would hate to be the person to date her can't stand that attitude
Cool wait till she does stand up and someone slaps her for something that they found offensive then we will see
I will not support Tiffany ever
It was a joke that Will, Jada and this woman took too seriously. No body ever set up a roast of these 3 or people will straight up disappear from existence.
What a reach in my opinion.
So it's ok if your husband comited a blunder and made a bad joke and get slapped by Will Smith exactly in the same situation? And how about your kids do you think it's ok with them to see their father being slapped?
This woman is either intoxicated or deranged.
People joke everyday, And people snap everyday. That's understandable. I just thought that an Academy is an INSTITUTION... Now I know that Oscar is a JOKE.. It's just a shitty people having a party. Sleeping and Slapping one another...
What?
First thought--what a twit.  Second thought--anyone who uses the word "homosexual" in casual conversation theses days...  Third thought--looks she like she backed off her earlier statement "I wish I had a man to stand up for me like that." Fourth thought--your supposedly a strong, modern woman, don't compare yourself to Jada in the situation--compare yourself to Chris Rock! How would you have liked it if WS did that to you?
I love her
Hers is not the opinion of an objective woman. This is the opinion of someone who has her head stuck so far up Will and Jada's asses that she can't see right from wrong.
If it's a white man slapping chris rock she would stand with chris and say violence is not the answer two face mofos
Naw that’s fucked up you don’t smack a man on stage.  That’s what you call trash…. Will smith to me I thought was a better man then that, I’m hoping the man was ddddumb drunk
No no. No
Tiffany looks like a marvel comics cartoon.
So Will Smith doesn't mind men having his wife's body parts in their mouths, but not her name.🤭
Well but is she a homossexual? I think if a joke gets you in a way that you feel compelled to commit an act of violence, it's time to start some therapy.
This is why we treat them like we do. Just like cops, the bad ones make a name for all of them.
You come up to me promoting violence and you will get disciplined ...Tiff is LAmE...
She’s not funny it’s giving Kevin hart
While Men getting bald, feeling bad, no women and getting bullied jeeeez.✌️😭 At least give me a wife like Will🙏🙏
Ebonics?
Listening to Tiffany talk is like listening to a 5 yr old tell you why they couldn't get ice cream... she's immature and unprofessional, always has been, always will be.  I wonder why she dresses as if she's a lady.   Everyone's forgotten that Chris is a comedian! That's what he gets paid to do... Jokes!! He's up there to keep the mood goin' keep people laughing. This is going to follow Chris for a very long time.  Not cool what Will did,  the joke was harmless, Will could have spoke to him in the back,  & give Chris a chance to apologize if needed.
Wise words from Miss Haddish.
Tiffany is DUNCE!
So many saints and so few men!  I thought that the bitch slap was a hell of a lot funnier than the joke.
This woman's also bald, let's just pretend she's wasn't offended by Chris jokes
This woman is typical of the mindless celebrity genre. She talks complete bollox.
GI Jane to be what... When that happened. WTF.
“I don’t talk about other peoples business unless I’m in the business”, except for when I just gave my biased opinion about someone else’s business. Next time Tiffany Haddish does something outrageous, someone remember to slap her.
What a female k9.
Must be nice partying and wearing thousand dollar clothes while others suffer.
I like and agree with Tiffany's comment and I don't even like Tiffany for the record. But she said  " it was a man standing up for his wife. And that I do I like. I also don't like Will but I like the fact that he stood up for his wife. I love Chris Rock but the joke was in poor taste.
Horrible take
Tiffany completely sold out, as a fellow comedian and actress THERE IN THE SAME BUSINESS so it's ok if tiffany hurts someone's feelings they can go on stage and slap the dog shit out of her?
Please come on.
That was an awful take and I expected more from her as a comedian. She let old feelings from her childhood and her stance as a woman overtake her responsibility as a comedian. You cannot assault someone for making a joke, especially not for a joke as tame the one Chris made.
Retards commenting on Retards.  I've learned soooo much.....
She seems like the gangster type of chick
This was a despicable act and will probably cost him dearly in regards to loss of money and fans. I have lost respect for Will Smith and have vowed to never watch anything he does in the future or in the past. “It’s amazing on one of the greatest evenings of your life you act a complete moron.” Big up to Chris Rock for standing up like a man and keeping it professional and for apologizing for something he knew nothing about. I am not sure I could have acted so valiantly and with such class and character as he did after such a disrespectful act by Smith.
Ya know everybody acting like Chris Rock didn’t eat that slap😂 tbh getting slapped and still goin on with the show like nothing happened for the most part is commendable
I don't know who this woman is, but she is about as pathetic as they come. Obviously she condones violence. that usually tells me that she's been around the block quite a few times. And to be quite honest, I think that this was staged propaganda by the Hollywood academy. Will Smith is not going to tarnish his image for a wifey that put him through marital blockades and committing infidelity. Jada is not that insecure about her bald head because she plainly stated it in one of her videos on tiktok. They might have most of the world fooled but not me..
How trashy
Can't wait to see Tiffany get slapped from a joke too!
Ho, unfaithful swine destroyed my boy wills smith mental health , will smith is lost
Yeah because that’s what well thought homosexual are you fucking kidding me.
As always!! Sooooo articulate!!
He is just a street thug.  If you have to tell a man how to carry himself on Oscar night.  it is kind of game over.  Can you imagine you are his son and you see you dad assault someone on Oscar night with the world watching and you get to hear the tone of his voice and the sheer anger in it.  Not a picture you want to see.  It is criminal and honestly he should have been arrested.  A man  who can't hold his frustrations in place is kinda pathetic.  Black kids everywhere saw it.
Nobody gets to smack him for teaching our kids poor values. For example, speaking about keeping a harem. I’d be very peeved if a married man says he would love to have me in his harem of 25 women. I wouldn’t feel honoured. I’d feel grossed out coz he is cheapening all female kind with that kind of talk. Also, for example, enabling narcissistic abuse by not having the guts to walk away from a toxic marriage. Or, for example, making it seem ok to use violence, smirking about it, not apologise sincerely and signing off what a publicist probably wrote for him and receiving no repercussion.   I liked the Fresh Prince but not this shell of a man. He is broken and seriously needs help. AND we seriously need him to just dial down many notches and stop trying to put his foot in his mouth.
When you play neutral while witnessing violence, you are siding with the aggressor.   She is very good friends with the Smiths, but a true friend would know when to call a friend on their bullshit. Seriously? Is she really saying Chris Rock deserved to be slapped because his joke called Jada a lesbian? Is it open season to assaulting comedians now, Tiffany?   You know, Sommore had a very appropriate term for this kind of … shit.
Tifffany does not have morals and damn near just as disgusting as smith of she supports this type of act.   People like her and smith make the world a evil and senseless place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7G6mu-S0eY   Chris Rock Vs Will Smith A la Valentin Elizalde Norteno Band
Her views are perfect where I come from but she will highly likely get a taste of her own medicine if she talks and walks like that over there 😕
Unbelievable and I bet she didn’t watch GI Jane by the way. If she did, she would have known GI Jane was a badass female empowerment movie about a woman who shaved her head on her own terms and stared down her challenges like a boss. She’s just trying to respond in a safe way to seem nice since Will wasn’t escorted out. If he had been escorted out, she would have swung her answer the other way.
What has GI Jane got to do with homosexuality Tiffany? You need to stay of whatever street drug you are taking.
Ternyata masyarakat luar negeri itu cmn bocil alay yg pengecut. Will Smith keren banget gila.. i called him tampan dan pemberani 👍
The joke on Jada was not about her sexuality. It was an on the spot improv joke based on her look(haircut). Chris could have said “Wakanda Forever, see you in BlackPanther 2”. Chris is an old head and he associates the haircut to GiJane. He could have compared her to any other movie or character, it was the first thing that came to his mind. Its on the spot crowd work. Thats what comedians do.
Who is this idiot?  Her trying to justify Will Smith assaulting Chris Rock on live tv over a nothing joke is beyond moronic.
2022 + doing an accent = cancelled, right ?
" basically " she said to call a woman a homosexual is degrading ??? Wtf ...
Honestly you can’t take what Tiffany Haddish says about Will Smith seriously. She’s justifying this appalling behavior because she’s personal friends of Jada and will. What happened was not okay, it pains to see that even someone as outspoken as her is scared to go against the Smith dynasty. Hollywood is a nasty place. Bullies deserve to be treated as such. Wish chris would have pressed charges on that Narcissist.
Who is this woman? These Hollywood stars are nobody’s, with outlandish opinions they create to make their bogan behaviour classier than the rest of society. The joke wasn’t anything but the reaction by Smith was unhinged. Suffering around the world, war in Ukraine 🇺🇦, Hollywood crickets. Will Smith’s reaction to a joke and Jada whom has a common af hair loss and is Rick at beautiful and privileged made out a joke was higher on the table of tragedies in that moment 🤦‍♀️. I have alopecia from medication I need to stay alive, the joke was funny, the war, homelessness, suffering is worth tears. Hollywood is a fkin joke and it’s about time the world stopped idolising these people. Idolise Ukraines president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, his worthy
Tiffany sounds dumb bro
is she drunk? weird things she is saying
So Tiffany Haddish thinks calling someone a lesbian is an insult?  Wow.  Way to reveal your homophobia, Tiffany.
Discipline and consequences yes press charges again will smith that’s lack of professionalism…fucking pathetic
Tiffany shush it!  If someone compared me to GI Jane, I wouldn’t be offended or think that I’m being called a homosexual!  I would love to look that good like Demi Moore and or Jada Pinket sporting their bald heads!!!
This slap Gives women hope that real men are still out there. But what is a women. Who the fuck knows.
I don't know who this woman is but she seems to have no class what so ever!! That's a load of rubbish her saying that it was a joke they new they would have the piss taken out of them! Dissaplin that's not discipline  that's straight up assault on a guy paid to do a job takin mick out of people they know this!!!! Geting paid God knows what for it!!....Ricky G was way harsh... How the hell can anyone justify this behaviour never mind getting a standing ovation... Its a messed up world!!
Going all black sure is fun. What next?? Green for the money tells it all. 🤔
Did she even watch the movie?😂😂😂😂
This lady is garbage for defending him… Will Smith saying “love will make you do crazy things” after assaulting someone on live television is pretty much straight out of the domestic abuser handbook.
Thank You Tiffany, for not even feeding into that bs.. that’s rich legends business.. Will Smith is on my tv every morning..so 🤷🏽‍♀️
What a horrible take. And from a fellow comedian? Really? Jesus these people have no self awarness whatsoever. Did she never roast anybody in her sets? Or is it only ok when she does it? Especially to men. I hope next time she gets some discipline administered to her...
SHE is despicable
Will smith - smack that men in black song https://youtu.be/insrU-p07_0
I get it now!!! Tiffany Haddish is staring in G I Jane 2. Glad to clear that up. I was so confused.
Tiffany is embarrassing! Violence is not the answer - very pathetic perspective on her part.
So GROSS hearing th say these things!  Ah NO SISTER,  THAT AINT OK!!!
oh tiffany. your time will come. putting hands is not acceptable. it's infantile and sickly considering.
The movie isn't about g a y  Tf is she talking about
Lessons learned you can take a mans wife's mouth and in bed but don't say she looks like g.i jane got it will
Trash humanity at its finest
White People asking black celebrities what they think about the beef lmao they so shocked ooooww and aaahhh like Tiffany said it ain’t my business meaning they’ll get over that shit in a week or less and be at the bar partying 💯
G.I Jane was a movie about a Special Forces female??? tf she talking about
Why is this dumbass news spreading like wildfire, SMDH....World War 3 might start, both north and poles are melting away, and covid is still dropping bodies. This is dumb
Oh hush Tiffany!
What is so offensive about homosexuals.?
I’ve always hated Tiffany Haddish
I don’t think that homosexuality is an insult 🧐🧐🧐
Tiffany Hashish has been on too much Coke. Jada is a garden tool and Wilhelmina Smith is well...
That's nonsense she said..
Tiffany showing how ignorant she really is…
She remembers it from school? She is 42 years old, same age as me, I graduated high school in 1997 and 1997 is when G I Jane came out. Liar
Chris Rock didn’t learn anything from his own documentary #GoodHair  *But this is a good way to start the conversation on Alopecia.
She one of them broads that go out with her man and get him shot...lol Notice no dude on her arm.
Special Will Smith Operation.  Not a slap
Assault & Battery is a crime.
Tiffany looks drunk as fuck🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂
What the shit.
I don't even know who this woman is!!  But she be crazy!!! Oh, yikes...am I gonna get slapped?  Tell ya one thing - I wouldn't be as forgiving as Chris!!  You'd be in jail and your millions would be mine!!!
not sure who this is. But wtf is wrong with her voice? Think she needs to go to a doctor with that. that doesnt sound right.
What is she talking about? GI Jane was never a way to call a woman anything other than bad ass.
I think she shouldn’t have said that I disagree Will Smith should not done that no thank you
weird stance for a stand up to have.
Maybe Chris should've said Black Panter 2. Since apparently being called GI Jane is an insult
CHRIS HAD ENOUGH DISCIPLINE TO CONTINUE DOING HIS JOB. Will was the one without self control. This idiot Tiffany needs a lesson learned in what discipline is herself...
Will Smith did nothin except show the rest of us just how bad he needs his asa whipped, he's a clown who simps for his wife, a woman who told the world she was bangin a 20yr old on her YouTube channel and didn't give a damn how Will felt...
It was a joke, and what part of the joke was being homophobic or making fun of gay people, it was a hair loss joke and not even that bad of one, Tiffany Haddish is the definition of a 1 dimensional Hollywood Clown that tries to speak on social justice but her definition of it is completely wrong. We are in a day in age now where everyone makes jokes even offensive ones and even if you don't like it doesn't give you the right to slap a person even knowing a actual COMEDIAN is gonna make some jokes about you, Tiffany Haddish is so out of touch that is even bothers me how she is even a celebrity. Also This is JADA we are talking about, the same person who was LITERALLY Open about cheating on Will.
*All these fellow celebs of Will confronting him, please don't say him that he did the right thing and support his actions just to pump him, rather tell him where he went wrong cause I think he still might be thinking he's right even after giving apologies*
lol now chris didnt just only make fun of her hair but he called her a homosexual. i guess in this day and age everything is way more than just a scandal for some people. not saying his joke was any funny though ....
0:55 if the joke was about being gay why would she be so offended by it to the point of asking husband to punch the comedian in the face.  The excuses she has given only show her homophobic way of thinking
*Leave everything aside, How was this relevant to sexuality ? I mean she's a comedian herself how can she interpret so wrong meanings of casual jokes, I love her for a diff side of her but for this, It's really shameful and as a public fig she has the role to be on right side rather than supporting ur fellows in even wrong decisions whether it's Will or anyone*
Shes meant to be a comedian, she should know better
Lost all comedic respect for horse raddish . Damn ? Shes a comic ,  I thought you back your own ?
So much money and so little culture. GI Jane was a film that showed a strong woman who faced a military culture made by men and shows the strength and resistance of a woman against the system. I don't remember anything that suggested she was a lesbian. The school you went to must have been very good. Sometimes discipline has to be administered? Nice!
extra tv is the best you can do?  Tiffany Haddish is a LOSER!  Who condones violence?!?!?
No one deserves "the vessel of love" that Will Smith declares himself to be by assaulting Chris Rock.  The sheep that gave the attacker a standing ovation should be ashamed of themselves.
Only the low class types defend Will Smith. You know.
This is for you tiff👎👎👎
Unacceptable. F Will Smith. Jada has NO HONOR TO DEFEND. Out Cucking him. F her too.
Disappointing, that coming from a stand up comedian. Smdh
she is really annoying
She is completely wrong. If I get offended, do I have the right to take justice and administer it out as I see fit?
I’m happy Haddish talked about how deeply ingrained culturally that insult was that Chris Rock made. Without that context, other people don’t understand what that joke really means and how it hits a woman. In a different video, I learned Chris Rock is known for bullying black women.
Ramen hair top is in style
saw GI Jane, didn't think she ( Demi Moore) was butch or trying to be as some implied online.  Jane/ She was empowering herself in front of men by shaving her head as she felt looked at her as incapable and weak. She proved them wrong. It was funny in context to me. I have had alopecia myself..so I'm not out of pocket
No Tiffany, no.
Wow What a dumb response  It was a JOKE
So why are you talking ? Your a comedian all you do is talk bout people Buisness..
SHAT UP..
Will was laughing but his wife wasn't... definitely not suspicious 🤨
So why you talking ?
The awards needed this publicity. People who never watch no know it exists.
It's a way to call a women a homosexual.   Lol all the gays out there, how you feel about her saying that? 😂🤣
Wtf is Tiffany smoking?? Its a joke. If you can't handle the heat in the kitchen then gtfo
shes ghetto you cant buy class honey you have to be born with it!
Demi Moore wasnt a homosexual in G.I. Jane, wtf is she talking about ???
https://youtube.com/shorts/biyNYkwhrbM?feature=share
Tiffany Haddish is 42 years old. The movie “G.I. Jane” starring Demi Moore was released August 22, 1997.  Miss Haddish was still in high school when this movie came out.  Something tells me she isn’t recalling the criticisms of adults regarding this particular piece of art.
The last time I hit someone, I got LOCKED UP!
Tiffany needs to take a seat, she has no idea what she's talking about. She is as bland as her comedy

It would be interesting to see her reaction when someone slaps her for a joke she made in her standup show.  Condoning violence is wrong. Period. And worst of all a comedian not understanding that it was a joke and  was not meant to be taken so seriously.
Since she is a comedian, you would think she would be on the side of CR. Chris never showed up at WS job and smacked him. VERY unprofessional of WS.
Chris ROCKS!!! thanks will $$$$
Tiffany Haddish is saying all this this because she is kissing ass.She sound like she too will book her man a fight without him knowing.She just proved that she isnt the smartest comic out there.Sad.
She's a comic. How can she justify attacking someone over a joke?!
That interview felt hella awkward.
Good on you for being REAL
“For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16‬ ‭NIV‬‬.
What’s she talking about?? GI Jane was hot 🔥
Apparently this woman is a hypocrite. But people felt to realize that they can defend. Will Smith. I get it, the joke was towards his wife and we should protect our wives even maybe perhaps if we have to use violence. Well, I'm being a little sarcastic there, but the point is that let's assume that we all can say that our kid is a comic , our own very loving son is a comic and cracks a joke and then Will Smith comes up and slaps him. Let's assume this. Would we still be backing up with Smith. Let's ask ourselves that question
I hope someone disciplines her harshly for telling jokes. Jokes are NOT funny
Just lost all respect for Tiffany haddish she used to put the microphone up to her vagina and queef into it that was her comedy skit when she was a little younger so I don't even want to hear her talk
I thought she was in the movie nobody's fool but tonight she's Will Smith's fool
another feminists for the rescue  for vilonets this is worng !!!
many guys are now in the cemetery for administering "discipline", her comments were stupid, you run into the wrong person one day and is game over
Haddish is spineless, another one that will do anything to go inside the belly of the beast. "Discipline"??? she is exactly was wrong with Hollywood and our society today.
A horrible display of hypocrisy by the Hollywood bubble. It was sickening to witness the standing ovation to an entitled, arrogant and violent person.
In the movie G.I Jane was not a lesbian so don’t make excuses for Will’s actions. It’s crazy how she can say discipline girl bye. So disappointed in these people.
This the funniest 😂 one ☝️ I’ve seen yet 💀 https://youtu.be/QN9lbY7aHZc
Chris is a comedian it's not uncommon for the host of the Oscars to pick fun at some of the celebrities there. She took the joke well out of Context as most did. But let's not justify wills actions. I understand defending your wife's honor but there is a better way to do that. I'm sure you could have slapped the hell out of Chris later after the Oscars. Will Smith is a coward for putting his hands on a much smaller guy anyway. But if it had to be done it didn't need to be done in that way on love tv. On a side note who is he defending? The woman that absolutely destroyed him on live tv? Boasting about the amount of times she cheated on him in their marriage? What honor is there to defend? Another note if any regular civilian would have done that we would be immediately arrested. But not the cherished celebrity.
Chris Rock once said that ''There are black people and there are niggas.''' clearly Will and Tiffany are the n-words
So let's say he said she was gay.  So what?  Just a shitty joke at worst.
Aite Tiff, when someone smacks you in the fucking face for a joke they don’t like. You better take it.
Jesus is Lord
Her not real blonde hair must be covering her not real brain.
But if it was that serious, then why did Will Smith laugh in the beginning then? No longer a fan of Tiffany Haddish.
She seemed off in this interview and very unlikable. Pretentious af
I really don’t care all he did was slap the dude everybody acting like he just out right beat his ass up
Well your honor, I assaulted him cus sometimes discipline needs to be administered….
He never technically said anything about her hair....she has had that cut 4 a minute and she was wearing all green....if she can take multiple pipes...then she can take a joke!!
All of a sudden everyone gots attitude...listen if nobody watches...these people act like someone they are not...then they don't get paid.....discipline is needed huh......aight bet...remember that
What does the Bible say
She thinks that a comedian deserves to be slapped in the face just for making a mild joke about a woman hair. Yes that is all we need. More uncivilized, vulgar women from getto. We need their ignorance.
take the oscar away from that crook
When she get slapped for making a joke let's see how she feels then
Being insulted doesn't give anyone the right to act like a wild animal. She is ignorant enough to think that kind of a punishment in Oscars stage is fair just for a joke about a woman's hair.
This little girl is always drunk and get DUI. I don't even know what joke she said that I can remember of. She's stoled Vanessa fraction style of jokes as a comedian. Just because she was in a movie with Jada she think she can defend her. 👎👎👎👎👎👎
Tiffany Hadish is trash everyone is aware.
Will Smith is a hypocrite, he takes the piss out of a man with no hair https://youtu.be/KxVv_94txu0,
His still upset that Jada was banging August so his taking it out on everyone else ....
No class... what can you expect.
Strawman argument tbh
Tiffany is a classless bore just like the majority of hollywood
Will Smith is now and forever in The Oscar movei awards ceremony History books for all times to come now . Indelibly a part of American history now forever more . ( " The Slap Heard and Seen Round - The World " ) on Sunday the 27th of March 2022  .  🙄 🙄 🤔
Ghetto reaction
I havent seen the GI Jane but i thought its kinda like being strong, being a fighter. Didn't realize Jada will roll her eyes on that one.
I was laughing cause I thought she was joking and then I realized she's serious but then I started laughing again. lol
I bet she has been on the receiving end of one those slaps a few times
Makes absolute no sense why she would say that. She is a comedian doesn't matter how bad the joke, she knows you can't assault a comedian for their jokes. She sold out clearly.
She feeling good 🍷
Damn he is mentally ill walking up & hitting someone in popular award show. He thinks he is in some MIB movie
Such an ignorant statement from Tiffany...how can you be with a man that is so small minded, to not consider the bigger picture, and act out like Will did? he embarrassed himself, his family, the Williams family, Chris, the  black community and everyone that attended and watched the show. So your emotions as a woman is more important than all other major factors and your man has to destroy his reputation to prove he loves you??? TOXIC...Stay away from women like this. I'm praying for my son and men all over the world that they do not end up with women like Jada and Tiffany
She only talking shit cuz she bald too 😂
I didn't like her comment. I think Chris should have DISCIPLINED WILL TF SOMEONE NEEDS TO
I like Tiffany when she first came out I feel she's starting to change.
She's talking so much shit. About discipline. Who the hell gave Will the right to ASSAULT someone because of a joke? Feel like I'm in the twilight zone or something.... shit is messed up and backwards.
What a load is shit. It was a mild joke and will Smith is clearly on the edge and should never have got on stage. Tell Chris to ‘Shut the fuck up’ don’t assault him. Crazy
You can move out of the hood, but the hood never leaves some people.
Tiffany over here making shit up in her head "it's basically calling her a homo sexual" get that bullshit outta here it was a bald joke.
Combative!  I am appalled!  Never paid to see anything that has to do with Tiffany and now after seeing this... NEVER WILL.  Black America is angry and it shows.  After watching the celebrities and their actions.  The next race war is nearing.
How tf GI Jane joke is calling her homosexual?
She's probably banging Will 👌 lol
Finally someone who acknowledges the disrespect Chris started. Many black women are embracing their bald hairstyles, some because they’re losing hair like Jada and some because they like it. A black man is always the first person to disrespect a black woman publicly. That room was full of white people and he chose to degrade black women’s bodies. The slap was not okay but so is his insult.
Gosh what a horrible person
Will Smith Reputation: Ruined
Jada cheated on will with her sons friend who was 20 years younger and has a mental illness. Thennn she airs their dirty laundry to the world, embarrasses Will, then plays it off like its just a normal day. let me say this, Jada does not suffer from alopecia, she hides behind it.  She has no problem getting the attention she wants romantically, sexually, or emotionally, and if it backfires she pulls the victim card. Claiming her alopecia makes her insecure, but I bet she wasn't insecure about it while she cheated on her husband.  She was having a great time and claiming whatever she wanted; She is NOT a victim.   Its saddening that so many people defend the immoral actions of those they look up too.  If you aren't in pathologically abusive or misleading in your own life her behavior will stand out as childish and her gaslighting will be easy to see, but if you are in these types of relationships then I guess its harder to notice.  I'm not trying to insult anyone who is a fan of her.  Its just her actions, if emulated, will not lead you to a place you want to go, assuming you're a sane person.   Never forget, She is worth millions of dollars. she isn't like you and I.  Please stop defending those in Privileged positions, they don't need you too even if they want you too.  Stop being a mouthpiece for injustice and lies. stop seeing colour and start seeing actions. listen to what people say, and watch to see if they follow their own words. For god's sake, watch the red table talk and watch how broken Will is.    This is not how normal people act, and I'm willing to bet that if you just met someone with all these same issues happening to them and their family you wouldn't want to be involved with that person you just met. you may even think they have issues with themselves that need work.    Also just wanted to throw in here that if will had an affair with a woman who was 20 years younger everyone would be going crazy and he would have been ostracized from many circles, which Jada is still a part of, by now.  This is not healthy behavior, please don't copy it, for everyone's sake including yours and those who care for you deeply. Actually care for you deeply, not just saying it and then cheating on you, and then saying it again, Jada. Gaslighing, Cheating, not appreciating what she has Skank. There are people who have real problems and who actually suffer.  She has a lot of growing up to do still and after seeing the 2022 Oscars where a "strong woman" couldn't handle a joke at her expense its extremely apparent.  If I ever have a daughter I don't want her looking up to this child in an adult body. Will was laughing at the joke, which was funny, and he didn't get serious until he saw she was unhappy about it. If you're constantly being pressured to act or think a certain way in a relationship that's not love, that's just pressure, fact.   And to those saying that Chris Rock deserved to get smacked by Will Smith, I hope sometime in the next few weeks you tell a joke that is funny to the majority of people in a group but one person finds it distasteful and smacks you open handed. See if the handprint left in your face feels justified.  Probably wouldn't feel justified anymore ya dummy
This incident needs to be investigated  with corrective actions  handed down.  ASAP
How about FREEDOM OF SPEECH? 🤦🏾‍♂️
Tiffany Haddish full of shit. She just sticking up for Jada cuz she had her in that wack ass movie and that's her friend
Imagine a white guy stood for him wife honour,  then this lady ,( how can he slap a poor soul in Oscar)  She redefined the word hypocrisy
If Chris Rock doesn't press charges, I will also have no respect for him because by not doing so, he would have endorse this violent behavior. Will Smythe has since issued an apology with a "but" Chris should not respond to that monster and press charges where he can apologize to the cops then take him to court where he can apologize to a judge.
Wow she is so ignorant.
It's because of fools like her that people take heed to Borat's words  "Women have brain of squirrel"   We've certainly propagated the worst women and held back the best ones.
I never liked her . She sound dumb  drunk and plain stupid . Girl so, you promote violence . It was a joke and it was took out of content . And it’s the Oscar’s and millions of people are watching . What Will should have done it took Chris to the side and talk about it or say Chris chill out now . Not going up on stage and put your hands on someone. My mom always someone hit me knock the shiit out of them . But, he didn’t physically put he hands on her. To be honest people talk both of them and their kids all damn day  on social media . It was wrong and Will seems like he got anger issues.
Her hair is not cute
"paint my hair like a Greek god"  Uh that's not culturally appropriate.. That's a white person's thing
🦁🌹🌹🦁. What would you do if someone makes fun of your wife's ill health?? I will definitely give a sweet chin music and no apologies. All hail Will Smith.
Nobody cares.... .
so she condones assault!  I'll remember that next time a hear a woman complains about being hit....suck it up b#tch.
Ofc she supports Jada & Will cus of that Girls Trip Fame & Money. Same thing goes for Jabari Banks (Fresh Prince Reboot). Ask someone who isn't a blood relative or in Will & Jada's pockets.
Will Smith behave like a hooligan... 😡😡😡
dreadful take
Disgraceful women
-- Did either one of them finish 1st grade?
Black men in the USA have a problem with violence and a culture of “respect” that encourages violence in response to perceived “disrespect.” This isn’t an opinion, it’s fact backed up by FBI crime statistics and disciplinary actions at schools. Will Smith, icon and role model, not only helped solidify the stereotype, but he gave permission to young black boys everywhere that this kind of violence is okay. Shame on him.
He has Saturn in Aries like many soldiers
Funny Will wife is the H of Hollywood, and Tiffany has nobody .
Wow guys get ripped right into for being bald every single day but it happens to a woman and you're all pissed you fought for equality you got it
Wrong.Accosting someone is unethical and illeagal! Not to mention his classless street thug profanity afterwards. Then again, you probably loved that.
I wonder if Tiffany changes her mind when she tell a joke someone perceives it as disrespectful and smacks her across her face  No grown folk should put hands on anyone over a joke if you can’t take the heat stay out of the kitchen plus we know Jada is her girl WTH is she going to say
Jada does not have alopecia. She has a scar from repeated face-lifts that she thought would always be covered by hair, wigs, or head coverings. She later decided to use it as a self-promotional tool  for her little show. She concedes her doctors "don't know" what is causing her "hair loss." This is all common knowledge but completely ignored by everyone.
She’s unclassy as hell for saying it’s ok to smack anyone who says something displeasing
Is that Billy Bush?😂😂😂🤣🤣
So , if someone disliked your joke , they can do the same. Why  most celebrities are OK with this 🤔
She's had dysfunctional relationships all her life that's why she thinks this way
#WILLBITCH
Another crappy take of the situation. Sensitive culture is going to destroy comedy in America!
Bruh this is ridiculous. So basically, she should be allowed to get slapped if she ever says an offensive joke in any of her shows from now on. You know, "take some repercussions of your actions"? Like bruh, a comedian's role is to roast and make you laugh. Nowadays even comedians have to worry about their own safety just because this world has turned into a bunch of soft hearted pussies that take offense to just about anything nowadays. Support for Chris all the way you keep jokin the way YOU want home boy 💯
If Chris and will are both smart… they will take full advantage of their next projects. Regardless if it’s good or bad, plenty will pay to see.
So your statement is being called a homosexual or being called gaze and insult while underwatching you either
I used to love watching Will Smith's movies.  I live in Texas and I know people who never liked Will or his wife witch i always defend Will Smith as matter of fact a few years ago Will made a few YouTube video explaining problems between him and his wife and by all  Accounts bill was much more harsh and mean on what he said than Chris Rock was.  1st and foremost I have a problem defending anything or even one to watch Will he's does after what he did at the oscars. I alone ain't very important and it's not my personal opinion of faults that should be looked at but maybe he should think about what he does before he does it. or who he tries to show boat to. before it does it. because all those organizations all those things you fight for you are hurt when you do behavior like that. I don't care what race I don't care what sex I don't care what sexuality a person is I don't care who you are you get up and do that in front of everybody you're hurting everything you've ever said you stand for. And you don't deserve to be An actor or an actress if that's your behavior in this day and age we are not in the 1950s were all publicity is good publicity  we are in a time where people should be held accountable for their actions. Unless Will Smith can explain honestly what he did there like what do you do there and I don't  Care if it sounds bad I want the honest answer of why he was laughing at the joke and then got up there slapped Chris Rock. I don't want this lame weird excuses he keeps coming up with I want the truth or I am done with Will Smith. Done witching him and defending him unless Will  Smith can explain why he went from  Laughing at a joke.  The looks like his wife didn't find funny to getting up and punching someone.  1st when I was young I was made fun of a lot I have always been told to take the higher ground. So I believe my maturity my delete my skill being but I handle stress and be able to take a joke because I didn't react to everything of what everybody said to me to 2nd. I'm not defending any behavior somebody else has done in their life but but we want to teach our kids right from wrong we can not have the example of what Will Smith did on that when across the world sthe world stage and until he explained to honestly I'm not trying to make excuses for it at hurts. 2nd there was no excuse for no matter what excuse you're trying to use there's no excuse for let me go from both sides of this let me do this a little political there was no excuse  If when Seth Myers and president Obama was roasting trump if trump were to walk up and slap them and slap them what were we upset and that was worse than the GI changed yeah I change joke people stop trying to defend independence will behave. I will understanding if maybe we'll was going through something but the behavior  Itself was indefensible. No more excuses no more stories we need to take responsibility for our actions in this country we need to come together and not come beating each other for something we disagree with it's time we start acting like adults and not children and this isn't just about will this is about damn you or everybody in this fucking country. We are acting like children now and defending childlike behavior we are it behavior we all need to stop
Will Smith was wrong, he didnt beat the shit out of rock Will didnt hit rock hard enough rock is a mouthy wanker
Chris rock didn’t know about jada’s alopecia.  It wasn’t the slam people think it was. Even so there is no excuse for hitting someone
I was gonna say "thats coming from a comedian" but can't remember when she was ever funny
Stretch Armstrong
He’s a fucking comedian come on people he just got in his feelings !
You'd think a comedian would defend a fellow comedian for getting backlash over a joke, a literal lash at that. instead she went for the feminist argument
Tiffany the next time you roast someone you will allow then to hit you in the face?
Tiffany. G.i Jane aka (Demi Moore) was about strength of a woman who could complete physically with men. In the end she won the respect of her fellow men and the drill Sergent.
right or wrong. it happene. way more important stuff going on. you know. like. the war.
Bro, Demi Moore is the hottest woman on the planet.  Wtf up talking abt?
Will smith is a legend, if that was my wife I’d like to think I’d do the exact same thing.  Chris rock should be thankful it wasn’t her ex Tupac up there or we’d be seeing a whole different headline
Chris Rock earned people's respect? The same man who openly mocks his own people? Uses the N word? Is homophobic xenophobic and sexist? How does a nasty person earn your respect?? Will Smith was defending his wife's integrity and honor. Suppose that Rock said "Hey Will F you and your ugly wife!" would that warrant a similar response? Are comedians free to mock people? yes. Will there be consequences? yes
Chris didn't know about Jada's alopecia. Tiffany needs to ease off the liquor and weed. Her comment about Chris was off.
I never understood the way will smith smashed chris rock ...he was laughing by the jock wtf!
So basically she is giving everyone permission to slap her when they don’t like her jokes.
Let’s see if she keeps that same energy if someone slaps her at one of her shows!
i think comedians should be scared rn lmao. make other jokes it's not that hard
Ok get yall saying what will did wasnt good but yall are downplaying what chris did. I think it is so disrespectful even if it was a script or whatever. Ok he slapped him but imagine if a random man would humiliate(even if its a joke) your mom or sister infront of MILLIONS I would have done the same. I bet chris words hurt more then wills slap smh
it was a joke , Will is a clown and Chris should have broke his jaw for assaulting him. but at the end of the day that’s how they act and they get away with it
she's right! i like her in the afterparty!!!
Chris has to be Generous !
Damn them libs really scared of the word women huh. Girl lol
Damn straight....you said it best 👌
Good to know that if I assault someone for insulting me, Tiffany Haddish will have my back
I used to like Tiffany... now? Not so sure.
I cant wait chris rock for his next episodes it's going to lots of laughs 😆
I hate her
Tiffany you are right! Chris was right! Hello!!!!
Disgusting
And if it turned out Rihanna was saying some horrific shit about Chris Brown's loved ones, is Breezy now justified? I mean shit, sometimes discipline needs to be administered..... right Tiffany? Huh? Am I right Tiff?  What a moron this woman sounds like. Assault is assault.
Now I want some Cup Noodles
The most asinine take I’ve heard on this.  First of GI Jane has nothing to do with being gay, or “homosexual” as she put it.  The character herself is straight, which is irrelevant.  She shaves her own head to prove that she is EQUAL to all the navy seals she is training with and is as much of a bad ass as them!!  Second you want to talk about discipline needing to be administered…sure Chris rock could administer some discipline by pressing charges, but he is clearly being the bigger man and not doing so!
Tiffany Haddish is there for other reasons than being funny. That joke was not abt her sexuality nor her medical condition.  Will's apology was also NOT sincere. He's trying to keep an Oscar that should have went to someone else. How you gone laugh at the joke, then get up & punch him???
Empty and fake people
This woman hasn't got any class at all, vulgar from head to toe.
If will would've landed this on his kids ..atleast they wouldn't have ended up being druggies... Some body should mock Jada for her bad parenting too..   ah ah ..that crying certainly didn't justify will...
Another black woman who cut there hair off and thinks a black man should break the law over a joke. This is why black men date white women. We don't have to go through this with white women. Over a joke? Really lol. Our people are screwed! Tiffany is still mad Common left her. Bitter and scorned......🤷🏾‍♂️
Jada could NEVER carry the role of GI Jane or Demi Moore!  So actually it was a compliment to her.
Once again, Tiffany is WRONG!
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates ~🎈
People keep saying a slap, a hit like that with that kind of force, is enough to knock someone down. Pass out as well.
She should be arrested for just being so uneducated
From being a huge fan, I 'Will', no longer watch WS movies ever again.
Shame on you Tiffany, the man just assaulted another on live Tv and you think it’s ok because he’s defending his wife? Come on get real girl, lost huge respect on you👎
Why is Will Smith being treated differently? A normal person would have to only touch the stage and would be escorted outside, imagine someone would slap a celebrity because they don't like what they are saying. Especially Will being a Comedian, how can he react like that? Something else was going on in that man, he changed emotions way too many times within 2 minutes
I'm just impressed by her game with the reporter
Will slapped him like a Gentleman to remind him of his manners and Chris took it like a champ and promptly remembered them.
So.... I can slap people around if I "feel" disrespected. Thank you for the info.
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq   Programmierer  der  Master K. I.
Jada was the joke. Will was the Punchline.
She's a narcissist.!!!she pulled that card.. on open relationship.. and clearly Wills not happy with it. And is taking it out on the rock.. you can tell by the look she gave him... he's under her spell.. clearly a toxic relationship..
You can dress a ghetto person up in fancy clothes, but they’ll still be a ghetto poverty person, as you can witness from this “blonde”.
Tiffany, good 👍.
Yo..I lost respect..and she's a comedian...smh
Shes just horrible for agreeing with what will did! PHYSCIAL ABUSE!!? Shame on you lady. Will did it in rage. But your just a horrible person.
Tiffany is a comedian so she should be ready for being slapped next time anyone feels offended with her jokes
Talks about someone else’s business then says she doesn’t talk about other business.  Keep it rull
I'm on Chris Rock side
Disciplene? criminel
Fake
Tiffany is defending violence! So Sad
Wait did she just say its an insult to call someone a homo ?
#9 ON TRENDING UK
A comedian who smacks another comedian for a joke is just LOW CLASS BUM level no matter what. Mr. Pinkett knows that
What was this the black Oscars?
She's so wrong defending this. Absolute coward
Another child with prejudice views on homosexuality, victimization, and the use of violence.
Really?  I always thought GI Jane was rather empowering to women.  Adversity against all odds, strength of character, perseverance.  I don't understand how it ever became anything else.
physically assaulting a friend (Chris and Jada literally made 3 Madagascar movies together, they know each other) who made a joke about your wife which you originally found funny is not standing up or protecting your wife at all… Will could’ve been acted like an adult and called Chris out in a calm way for making a joke about his wife’s medical condition and maybe got an apology afterwards and make him understand how the joke was too far and Chris would’ve 100% been in the wrong, instead he decided to walk on stage infront of millions of people around the world and decided to smack a defenceless man across the face, that is not love or romantic that is an impulsive grown man who does not know how to control his emotions and acts like a child when faced with something they don’t like, it wasn’t even in the spur of the moment he walked like 10 metres to him slowly, and the way he shouted afterwards infront of a whole auditorium of famous people without a second thought makes me wonder what he’s like behind closed doors…
Someone should administer discipline on her see how she likes it. She me the first one screaming me too.....LMFAO
Tiffany please just keep quiet and DO NOT SUPPORT EVIL. Standing up for wife does not mean disrespecting another woman's Husband and another man's family in public. That joke was not Bad,, Jada playing GI JANE 2 is an honor and compliment,  that was a BAD ASS MOVIE..& Jada look stunning with the hair cut by the way. Will Smith action was wrong PERIOD. Tiffany is a comedian too. and she makes jokes, the next comedian to be slapped on stage will be Tiffany and I will be waiting for her actions and justifications by then. It is simply called KARMA. I WILL BE WAITING.
Only petty people subscribe to violence as a medium to resorting issues
Shame on you Tiffany haddish for justifying that traumatizing violence!
Isn't she a comedian??? Can people come up and slap her in the face if they get offended by her jokes, too?
Will Smith defending his wife is actually very admirable.   Chris Rock publicly stated that he’s not above an ass whooping especially due to the nature of his job…. and so an ass whooping was served on national television. Deal with it.
He said GI Jane. Not u look ugly and bald. He gave her a compliment. I want to see her in GI Jane 2. She is rocking her look. Jada, good luck.
*Jada wasn’t upset because she has alopecia. She was upset because she thinks she’s better than everyone else.*
can't stand that woman.
He mocked someone baldness, that's mean. Listen guys never joke about people baldness it hurts them, they don't deserve that. #Baldfeelingsmatters
Reminds me of watching WWE live from the Oscars
Eritrean black woman.
Fuck YouTube and Google for their censorship.
Believe it was a publicity stunt to jump start Chris Rock's comedy tour. Glad Will Smith apologized tho, real king shit. Luv Tiffany Haddish for supporting Will Smith, she is a real one. 🖤👑🔥🔥🔥🔥
Eritrean black.
She doesn't talk about people's business. 100%
Tiffany is still very much attached to her “hood roots” so this is expected form her.
What a self entitled snob. She just shut her mouth to protect that money.
Comedians tell jokes will is a comedy actor who will never work again and that's no joke.theres no reason for his actions the same way he yelled off stage that would have been enough. Peace love and blessings to you
Get Your head out the  gutter!  She was talkin' bout Spaghettiiiii !!!!!
Who cares about these people? Society needs to ignore them into oblivion.
She is beautiful, but dysfunctional.
We are seeing the results of decades of unchecked decadence in celebrity culture.
I like how she said she doesn’t comment on other peoples business… But yet you just did an entire interview talking about it. Lol. The hypocrisy 😂
SHE'S A THUG JUST LIKE WILL SMITH. BIRDS OF A FEATHER. CHRIS ROCK IS THE MAN!  SMITH SHOULD BE IN PRISON.
I like how she says that she doesn’t talk about anything that’s not her business… But yet she just did an interview talking about it. The hypocrisy of these people is beyond.
Whattt?? That never ever crossed my mind lol Man, this is just one massive sh¡t show, that's for sure lmao🤦🏽‍♀️ She should have kept her mouth shut. So many opportunists trying to leech for some spotlight🔦
Will Smith did so wrong. Why didnt they remove  him from there.
SHE IS CHEAP ..SAVAGE
Don't allow these women to put a battery pack in your back men. What Will did was in no way respectable as a man. Will looked like a simp on the world stage.
'Discipline needs to be administered'.. what a Genius response!.. i wonder if she'd say that if she said a joke and someone administratored some Discipline to her!.. maybe what needs to be administratored is some reason, into your brain!.. we live in a society with rules, and freedom of speech is one of the most important rights in America, thats why the country is so great.. maybe she'd be more comfortable living in Islamabad!!!
Did this woman just condone assault by calling it discipline? Shame on her!
Jesus died for our sins so we will have eternal life
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
Love you Tiffany. Love you Will. 😘
Tiffany should star in G.I Jane 2 with Jada 😂
I'm appalled by her comments regarding this. She was once a physically abused wife so for her to stand there and call the assault on Chris (a fellow comedian) "necessary discipline" and earlier she said it was " a beautiful thing" is despicable. She's supporting the Smiths because Girls Trip 2 is about to go into production so she will be working with Jada, but really she should be willing to back out of the project rather than support violence, and that's really what she's doing. Money will never be more valuable than integrity.
Thanks Tiffany! you're right.
I just think it’s funny how everyone is defending Chris but no one is defending the fact that Chris not only insulted Jadas condition but also every woman with the same condition who also have a hard time accepting the disease. How many women have hurt themselves behind this disease how many children in school are bullied constantly and harm themselves over a “joke” . No matter what they have gone thru as a married couple the whole point is through thick n thin no matter what. Marriage is a commitment and I praise married couples who are committed till death do us part right?
Stay tuned for more Black culture.
What a vacuous celebrity dip. Jenn Lahmers is nice to look at though! -J
Bottom line is that Chris is a comedian and Jada was brought into her career by COMEDY. Remember her first role in the nutty professor? I am sure she can take a joke. Will smith thinks he’s more special than he is. Now get the fuck back in that kitchen and get me my big piece of chicken!
He looked ghetto doing that
What IF Smith was White?
All comedian are in danger of getting slapped and assault including you Tiffany **
Imagine if Amy Schumer was the one with that routine. Do you think Will Smith would hit her? Would Tiffany said the same in that case? That's soo wrong. Smart people have words. Will Smith needs to be check by a psychiatrist for sure
Let's just allow casual violence because celebrities are so numb to it all!
Discipline? How about will laughing his face off.
He committed assault and battery on the shows host because he cant take a joke about his cheating wife's bad hair.  Why was he not arrested? why was he not dragged out?
Everyone in Hollywood is delusional
What a goose. Would it be ok for somone to slap you next if they didn't like a joke you said?
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Tiffany talking ish because she’s friends with Will and Jada … remember her set about inviting them on a riverboat trip ?
THATS WHAT CHRIS ROCKS GETS DONT TALK ABOUT SOME ONES CONDITION THEY CANT CONTROL TEAM WILL SMITH ALL DAY FOR ME 💙
Lol she’s right ! TEAM WILL ALL DAY
That was an Illuminati slap , Chris is at a lower level than Will, but Will lost his head for a minute ! He laughed at his own wife then felt bad and attached another man ! He didn’t attack August !    That slap was meant for August !
Will Trying to get his manhood back by attacking a comedian , attacking Chris Rock was wrong!  Where is Kanye West when we need him to grab a mic ?  Chris Rock’s next special will be off the chain !!!  Will Smith was foolish !!!
"Sometime discipline needs to be administered" Beautiful. 🤣
The WOKE mob is out of control and they will protect their own. Hope Chris sues him for all he’s worth and ruins will smiths career , what a low life coward,
She only saying it cause she a G.I Jane too
Immature "Women" like that get you killed.
When she gets clocked by someone’s husband, we will see what her thoughts are. Violence is never the answer.
I wish that when Will turned around to walk away that CR would have rabbit punched him and stomped his ears together,that was a punk move by a punk.
And that's why I will never listen to celebrities. Most of them are trash, just like this woman. I bet she wouldn't like it if she offended someone and got slapped.
She real as fuck
Tiffany not standing up for comedians is traitorous, and she knows it.
I love Tiffany! Excellent response 💕💯
Chris Rock got to Cocky. He knew exactly what he was saying when he said it. Good on Will, protect your wife.
Yass hunnie facts. Everybody don't mind lil Naz x dancing with his penis out kissing boys but Will Smith slapping Chris Rock is so shocking
Arrest Will. It's not ok to assault men or women.  Equality.
Girl that's a costume u look ridiculous..
This woman is basically saying that Chris Rock called Jada a lesbian and that’s a huge insult….huh?
All these powerful, influential White men are speaking out saying Will Smith is "mentally ill" and "violent/dangerous".  In the meantime, the "Proud Boys" are wreaking havoc all over this country (Jan. 6 Capitol riots, bullying, assaults, public hate speech, terrorist behavior, etc.). QUESTION: Is racism and bigotry a mental illness?🤔GTFOH with that BS.  Black People! Don't go along with that narrative. It's exactly what we saw...Will slapped the piss out of Chris Rock. He open hand slapped him! That's all folks!!😩
That Lady is wrong no amount of words should be answered by violence. It was a criminal act committed on a show that is broadcast around the world, and luck may have it that they were both the same colour, can you imagine the aftermath if one of them had not been black?
Tiffany haddish has to be one of the dumbest human beings I've ever heard speak
I guess I can slap people that I don’t the jokes of. 🤪🤪
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
will Smith is a narcissist
Can't lie these are moments I'm embarrassed to be black... This stupid lady and dumb will actions ... And Jada ignorant ass putting him up to it .. CHRIS ROCK THREW THAT CHICK A Bone.. Ain't she a actress?? I would actually like to see her in GI Jane 2... I did not want to see Jada on screen in a while but a movie like that showing her toughness and.vigor I would like to see. Just like she was doing the slapping when she slapped Queen latifa I'm set it off movie
That's fucked up. Tiff is a stand up. So she's saying it's okay to walk up and smack comedians?   She's legit doing what the cancel culture people do, interpreting a joke through her own personal lens.   And now she's saying talk shit get hit? How the fuck are you going to condone black on black violence at the biggest award show   Will fucked up and now I think tiff is a piece of shit   Damn, like all of Hollywood is bullshit fake ass hypocritical people. ALL of it. Everyone is a piece of shit  The rich just started to look way more appetizing
Going up on stage and punching a comedian is not discipline it’s assault. Chris is no child and Wills an adult. He could of handled the situation with more dignity and maturity.
Tiffany said what she said.
Omg chris rock is a comedian and it was a very tame joke. These people are so thin skinned and pathetic
This is the same Hollywood that called out police brutality in the wake of George Floyd, has called out domestic violence and rape in the past and yet when it comes to being insulted by a joke, it's ok to commit assault.
Even if it was for love, will could have taken that situation way better than he did, he could’ve taken him to the side explained why that joke was wrong and then leave not act like a child slap a man not only a man but a very famous one on live television, you’d think will smith would have more class than to just hit someone when he’s pissed, he had the right to be pissed but he had no right slapping Chris rock, I lost respect for will after he did that, yeah love can make you do crazy things but he’s a grown man who should know not to react the way he did.
I'd say that both were wrong. Smith shouldn't physically attack him, and he should keep calm. At the same time,  Chris Rock's literally using Smith's wife medical conditions as a material. It was very insulting indeed. Idk how would I react to it if my wife was being insulted like that...
people saying that he should have been kicked out and lost his award because he broke academy standards of conduct, if you actually look at the statement of conduct it actually says all these things are not even supposed to happen in public even when not in a professional manner so even day to day if someone does what will smith did they they too should be removed from the academy awards and their awards handed back and yet how many stories are their of actors going on a drunken binge and assaulting people and the academy not doing anything about it. and dont even get me started when 3 white women that i know of slapped someone and got away scott free.
She's ace 😆😍
Tool
Haddish is stoopid asf ! How can will not be offended with jada  having sex with men but he’s offended of a joke ? She should respect herself 1st
animale
And then you wonder why we have pointless violence like with 2pac and Biggie.
amazing how you defend someone who you like ..hmmmmmm.
Smith lost my respect forever
Will Smith’s behavior is not indicative of Black Culture, Blacks on tv commercials tell me that they’re upstanding individuals, pillars of society!
The whole thing was fake and she’s acting now 👁
shut up Tiffany that's not true, it was not a insult
She is sellout for comedy
Until you get slapped on stage..
meh, i still go for CR as the joke is not that bad and even Will laughed as hard as fuck when CR mentioned GI jane
So pathetic!  GI Jane was a warrior. Thats not what Jada is.. she is a bored housewife.. Will Smith and Jada are A rich bored Hollywood couple housewife and puss whipped hubby need attention. They shared too much about their marriage and can't handle the comments. He is trying to get his man card back.. that didn't do it.. What is it Hollywood says ? If they ain't talking about you good or bad you ain't in the elite. Stop feeding their ego. The Oscar's needed attention. They have been sad for a long time. Poor babies. Such a hard life. Their the reason our lives are changing. I hope they all fall to bankruptcy and see how the normal folks live. Have them take down their fences and get rid of their security and humble down to what us common folks have to deal with which is reality and facing our shit!
GI Jane was also a strong character That determination  To keep going was 🔥🔥🔥
Wasn’t G.I Jane a strong female character??
I've lost respect for Will Smith, he is still mad that his wife was chewed
Bullshit tiffany. Bullshit
Chris Rock hardly flinch. Will Smith is fake
I hope all the guys out there condemning this never encounter a situation like this, where someone takes the piss out of your girl's illness in front of her face. Are you just going to stand there and do nothing, in the heat of the moment. I don't condone what Will did for one second, but I do understand why he did it. Celebrity or not, he is a human being with emotions. Really disgusting joke from Chris IMO. You do not take the piss out of someone's health issues.
Tiffany Haddish is a clown. GI Jane had nothing to do at all with calling ppl gay. Any GI Jane jokes told were aimed at calling a woman bald. And Demi was celebrated for cutting her hair and posing such a strong woman in that role. But Tiffany obviously needs to political edge, because she certainly isn't talented enough for her talent in comedy to stand on I'd own.
But Boo Boo Jeffries said "Nothing good comes from violence". Was that all fake Boo Boo ?
Bruh She stupid talking about chris called her that to say she is a homosexual. It was strictly to point out the fact she is bald that's why I cant stand her.
Violence is not the answer…
Just imagine if it been Mel Gibson doing the slapping. Lord almighty.
Some people dont know how to take a joke. There is jokes about cancer and worst things now somone gets offended just because she dosent even have a Dificult desease.
I dont hold tifiny haddish up there , with the rest celebrities, i dont even like her acting , she only plays that nasty character n that what all them gyals like , her comment on them legends is irrelevant
So a comedian makes fun of a cripple in his crowd and it's cool. But when a comedian makes fun of a rich spoiled person's hair condition it's not ok
Her dress is awful, designer and stylist did her so wrong
This woman is insufferable. 'I'm not in costume, this is dolce and gabbana' costume change just means changing your clothes jesus christ. Snooty af
Get'em Tiffany I LOVE YOUR RESPONSES ---- PROTECT BLACK WOMEN!!
It's all a drama show, will Smith is an illuminati Dog, they told him to do that to get people talking about this BS rather than what's really going on in the world
Chris should press charges, violence is not ok, physical assault is not ok. The Oscar award made him a volient man. . .    But Will Smith is laughing hard at Chris joke though, if he's offended he  should just stop laughing to make his point.   The saddest thing was nobody ask if Chris is ok 😢
I remember growing when my brothers picked on me and I reacted with violence,  I ended up being the bad guy even when I was just defending myself. Now I understand why I ended up getting in trouble instead.
This was all orchestrated by Jada
And that's why you're single.
Everybody stands up and applause for Will Smith when he won an oscar? WTF ?? He just slapped a guy!!
The accent feels like watching andrea botez LOL
He only did that to Chris because he is small. If some Jason or Terry mother fucker would of been up there he would of just kept laughing.
Let's not pretend Will wasn't having the joke, he was laughing until Jada gave him the look. Will's out here looking like a puppet, she actually got him to act for her, with just one look!  For me this was an unmeasured and unjustified reaction.
that lady didnt even get the joke ^^ and is now covering for will...
Is this b confused af, isnt she a comedian?
This is bull shit!
Chris went too far with this one  Since when makin jokes on sick people  Became It's okay and it's just a fucking joke  You make a fun of my sick woman  Boy I will have a very serious word with you  Hell with that so called ( gentleman) shit never make a joke about family member
Holy shit this woman (yes?) gives off extremely weird vibes.
The crime Will Smith committed is BATTERY. Assault is the threat of physical violence and battery is the carrying out of physical violence. Smith should have used words, not physical violence.   Smith has no excuse to justify his use of physical violence against words, use words to attack words, use physical violence to defend yourself against  physical attack. Will Smith needs to be criminally charged for battery.  So now does that mean we can kick Rick Gervais' or Whoopi Goldberg's, ass when they says the many offensive things which deserve a wallop?   Too, it was not for "emotions" or "love" as Smith claimed it was self-ENTITLEMENT, the fact that he thinks he is above the law and can submit to physical violence.
Will Smith cowardly apologized to the Academy, the people who can take away his Oscar. Smith didn't man up and apologize to the right person Chris Rock who had more class than Smith. I hope they do the right thing. Smith was not that good to deserve an Oscar anyhow in comparison to who he was up against. The Academy gave Smith what amounts to a 'participation trophy.'
Homosexuality in a woman? Wtf is she on about, that dress too tight for her, think it’s restricting blood circulation to her brain…
I just don't think she's funny. Am I the only one that feels like she hasn't done anything good since girls trip?!
Tiffany you is a class at I love you
Will Smith and Jada should be jailed.
These celebs sre so dissolutioned to what's right, if I walk up to a man in the street and smack him im gonna be in some trouble, what will did was unjustified assault in front of millions of witnesses but he got a standing ovation and im a big will Smith fan since the early 90's but that was wrong
Wrong answer Tiffany … Can take the girl out of the ghetto but the ghetto still in the girl. Designers need to rethink that dress
Looks like Tiffany was over the interview earlier than expected lol
I stand with Chris ! ✊
I know common glad he cut bait.
If Jada Smith doesn't like jokes about alopecia, that's hair loss.
Look at the media always tryna catch someone lacking
I was shocked that a comedian would justify physical assault over an "offensive or bad joke"
Remember when Tiffany Haddish was okay in that one movie that one time?  Not sure if Hollywierd has gone to her head, or if she was always full of bs.
I fear for the comedians all over the world now.  Especially this disaster at the Oscars. It's a comedians job to go after the rich and famous because it's part and parcel of Hollywood stars to be in the public eye  for TV. But to allow and condone violence ?? Then be let off just just because he acted out a speech with tears . He's an ACTOR. I PERSONALLY DONT BELIEVE HIS APOLOGY WAS REAL. DO YOU?
As if anyone gave a f
ws should go to jail
That was an assault, but since Its fucking small willy smith no one did anything. So are celebs free to do whatever they want?
Im glad tiffany mentioned the historical context of the G.I jane joke , it is not a compliment, its used to insult women who are seen as "masculine" or to call them butch lesbians.  Before G.I Jane, it was calamity jane,   I remember I dressed up as a cow boy in school and one of the teachers laughed at me and said I looked like calamity jane and it hurt my feelings because I felt like she was saying I looked like a lesbian, which I wasn't
It's had to forgive. Not sure what was going through Smith's mind.  I believe he was at the dark place.  Discipline needs to be administered so that others will take precautions.  Didn't say to take the Oscar away.
Still can't believe Chris got assaulted and Will got an oscar, standing ovations, and the longest acceptance speech... what is wrong with these celebrities???? It's not like Chris compared her to Homer Simpson or Gollum!! And it's not like Jada got cancer...
If someone makes a joke about a bald dude, NO ONE would even dare to justify a public assault and humiliation on live television!!!!  What is the difference? Her medical issue is that she looses her hair and now rocks a hair style that she had rocked before! It's not a "medical" condition that affects her health. Seeing yourself like you have cancer, while there's nothing wrong with your health is actually condemning!!! Sorry how all those celebrities giving a violent assailant standing ovations! #DoubleStandards
Lol, I hope she don't get slapped when someone didn't like what she said.  I enjoy both Chris' and Will's work, but Will was clearly in the wrong here.
What actions? Making a joke that wasn't even that offensive? If the ricky gervais golden globes would have been this year...would they have lynched him? What a fucked up world is this? All comedians should boycott the oscars...i'm sure ratings will get even lower than ever...
Tiffany can't make an issue out of it because both Will and Chris are BLACK. If one of them is white. Then it's Game of Thrones for him.
I'm supirsed by her comments especially the fact that she calls herself a comedian...
They could both make a bundle if they took it to the ring. Smith vs Rock pay per view. $$$. We’ll get Chris on the juice, with the best boxing coach, just to even things up. Hell yeah.
What a load of crap this person sprouts. Will smith is the massive looser here, to slap other people due to what they say is the worst example to set anyone. It’s their choice to sleep with others and set this as the new debauched standard we should admire, but attacking someone for a joke sets a standard that will only lead to trouble. Next time someone accuses a white person of being racist expect a slap- how would that go- badly and would be wrong. Or maybe it’s made up by Hollywood to create interest in Oscar’s and desperately maintain the celebrity strangle hold on society. Discuss & debate instead of cancel and vilify. The last two being what Hollywood supports.
Ask tiffany of it would be beautiful if she got hot full force next time she's on stage because somebody faked offence on somebody's else's behalf.
Just shows that celebrities can be common ignorant folks..... she speaking how some dumb women can get their man killed bc they feel insulted..... i lost alot of respect for will after looking up to him most of my life.... chris made a joke that your wife is a baldie.... he aint prolly knows she sick and its not like its life threatening..... he planned and premeditated to do that shit the way he walked back and sat down....  just madi wasnt there and chris wasnt my homie ... jada was never a big deal.... she looks for attention thays why she can embarrass his stupid ass live on her talk show.... screw her sons friends in their home.....  them rappers be clowning him and he takes it out on a man almost half his size and near 60 years old bc of a bald joke..... wtf her bald ass doing in front row..... when we got so many other women way more famous than her and with a whole head of hair.....i never saw a movie with her in my life.... my mom had to told me about set it off and thats it.... hardly memorable in the matrix....  her claim to fame is being married to will and being tupacs groupie.... get the f outta ere. Chris is a gentleman and took a big man to act the way he did and keep everything calm and he doesnt need to fucking press charges... millions of fucking ppl saw that man get assaulted on the job being a comedian.... thats bs.....
she knows who has more power for over her job. thats sad very sad.
Tiffany Haddish just reinforced the stereotype of black people as violent and aggressive. Black on black crime is no joke!
Will Smith is the real one. I could never defend someone else’s girl like that.
WtF Homosexuality got to do with... Nvm
Yea sure ... will would have not done it to the real ROCK. Will got caught laughing and Jada would have beat his ass because she is the real man who wears the pants. Will should be beat down. NO ONE touches anyone.
So we condoning violence now! At least she was honest!
This is why Tiffany haddish will be alone. She should be ashamed of herself for defending will Smith.
I will do the same but not in the crowd stage event but outside that building when the event is over
That comment had nothing to do with homosexuality, it was about Jada's hair style, regardless of how distasteful anyone thinks the joke was.
This woman is ghetto! Try being a lady sometime.
So discipline is violence ??? like Russia on Ukraine huh?
I completely agree with every word Tiffany Haddish said on this matter.
Well said!
Hahaha all these actors are fucking looney toons I tell you!!!
What a clueless airhead. Homosexuality? Really?
He would of never did that to Dave Chappell. Never!!
As a fellow comedian I'm shocked by Tiffany Hadish. Kiss ass much Tiff?
The Academy does not condone violent behavior. Unless you're Will Smith. Here is your Best actor award and standing ovation. Now Will Smith, let's hear your hypocritical, bull shit speech. Thanks Academy for looking out for Chris Rock. I guess you all made it OK to assult comedians for telling jokes now. Good job ABC and the Academy for handling the situation the way you did. Yet, you dont condone violence. I Gotcha..
They come up with the most incredible BS!!!!
😳😳😳
The village idiot ended up issuing an apology to Chris Rock.....just by way.
Sorry Tiffany. GI Jane was about a woman entering into military fighting against adversity. An empowered woman. So Tiffany Haddish clearly never saw the movie.
Chris missed the opportunity to say "shame she didn't want you in her mouth either"
That’s good. “I don’t talk people business, unless I am in business”
Before will smith slapped Chris rock he was surprisingly laughing at his jokes
She should be arrested too, for encouraging will to hit.
I’d like to ask this woman what’s wrong with homosexuality?
These people are trash lol
Ok let me be clear I don't know why they even bother to ask her ! She's a female Kevin heart and they'er BOTH NOT FUNNY 💢‼️ And while we're on the topic of being funny isn't Tiffany supposedly 🙄 a comedian !?  She should of known that CHRIS ROCK was only joking and didn't deserve what that simp will did !! (you know doing his job) doing what she does so poorly !! Why didn't will keep that same energy when Jada was getting her back blown out having Tupac flashbacks 💥⁉️
I heard a lot about Jada sleeping around, but knew nothing about why she is bald.
Sometimes self control has to be administered……..
I like her and funny 😆 hahaha
She’s a puppet
Jada looks different here
So the next time one of Tiffany's jokes on stage offends an audience membe, that member is entitled to go slap her upside the head? Because that is in fact what she is implying with her praise for Will's actions against a fellow comic.
Whatever the situation ... Thats not the way to show your discomfort
Rock sholdve went off and roast them especially jada a bit more after that slap. He know he isnt going to be called ever again to host the oscars ever again. So shouldve just went hard. Shouldve brought august nd shit and called her a hoe at the end. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Jada Pinkett Smith gives her a new high dollar purse every time they hang out. That's the truth. Shes not goning to bite the had that feeds.
A dude in a dress.   Funny how toxic masculinity is ok when it fills a woman’s insecurity
Like Chris Rock always says, theres black people and Nigga's, last night Will Smith was the typical street NIGGA!
No women has ever slapped anyone or comedian or at a joke at a man facing Androgenic Alopecia
Isn’t Tiffany a comic? I hope somebody goes on stage and disciplines her sometime soon….
It's weird that people taking jokes as some kind of subliminal message or like it has hidden meaning. Why don't see it as just a joke? A bad joke maybe, but still a joke, nothing less nothing more. I can't believe these people, they're laughing when other hosts make a satire joke of how racist and sexist all men (they never aknowledge the toxic women among them possess this traits too as if all women are innocent) in the business but as soon as someone joke about physical appearance it's a no no. Do you see how weird hollywood is?
What the hell is she talking about😂😂😂😂😂😂 bullshit
Slijmen 2.0
How did I know she would say something stupid
I don’t know what school she went to where GI Jane was an insult, but she is ignorant as hell for condoning violence.  Maybe she should leave the weed alone and she might get some depth to her acting which is as flat as the color in her hair.  Last time I checked, alopecia never killed anyone like cancer does.
High testosterone low IQ
She ain't worried cause nobody is inviting her onstage anymore
Are you drunk Tiff? Not everyone follows Jada online
Who wouldn’t expect Tiffany Haddish to have a simple minded perspective. Maybe someone needs to slap her the next time she tells one of her corny jokes on stage since she condones what happened.
she sounds like shes been Drinking again!!                        She sounds like shes been Drinking again 😵‍💫
shes not funny
can laugh but not body shaming?? wife is the pride of a husband!!!!!!
Strip... Will Smith from the award
I guess we can just slap Hollywood celebs if we feel offended for whatever reason. Not surprised by this logic, they’re all involved in sex trafficking
This drunken lush would agree with anything rachet
But if that was Dave Chappelle will wouldn't have done that
Smith is weird and a hothead. Obvious their relationship is thrash. Kudos to rock for keeping it together!
Only thing I can say is that Chris Rock is not a comedian...      He's a boxer goddamn that man can take it to the chin!
Comics gonna be goin on stage now with PPI and shields and shit ready for the snowflakes that can't take jokes. This is stand up. If you can't handle it then don't go or sit RIGHT in the back and hope you aint joked on.
Violence is never the answer bro. Ppl are just ignorant
Discipline? I wonder if 50 Cent had said that if Will would have walked up there. And he should have faced consequences for that (too many smug people think it’s ok to put your hands on people).
Forget her, too.
lol what a bunch of weirdos. chris rock is the fucking victim
Sometimes disipline needs to be administered? Fuck any body who feels that way.
drunk driving, ghetto, and classless to boot... didn't even listen to what chris rock said! LOL, wouldn't be surprised if she gets smacked at her next terrible standup!
Well I'm not a fan of Tiffany if that's what she believes
So according to Tiffany, Chris rock was insinuating that Jada Pinkett is a lesbian with that joke.  Or she is just drunk af
So... when His wife cheated on him...did he smack her face too and teach her discipline? I don't think so...and he laughed at that joke before he went to smack Chris Rock's Face...Will Smith should be ashamed and apologize with Chriss Rock...
All the italians should slap her in the face cause she just made fun of italians hahaha whats messed up is shes wearing all these clothes and jewllery thats worth so much but lil kids in africa are straving to death,all these celebs can EAD and a slap
all that awkward complenting at the beginning, they wont need a lifevest when theyre marooned out sea
I hope she has the same attitude when it’s her turn to be ‘disciplined’.
Mess up
Well, I use to think she unfunny as it is. Now I see she is unsmart as well.  Discipline this nuts.
if you attack a person because they threatened you, you go to jail, imagine for slapping a joke
drunk as shit
just lost respect for you.
Raspy!
but with that being said if that is something that Will Smith or Jada would hate to be stereotyped with.. I can see how that would be an issue I mean Sinead O'Connor shaved her head he could have compared her to that Britney Spears shaved her head he could have compared her to that which has no comparison to any like lesbianism situation... in my opinion just the fact that he commented on it knowing that she has a medical condition which none of these other people who have ever shaved their heads had I can see how well got so angry.... but like what's been really going on with him that he would let that explode on National television on his possible win of best actor.... I really do wonder what was going on behind closed doors before this....
can't wait to see the Academy Awards ratings after this....
No Class
Sad! Will basically committed a crime! So what's the repercussions for him?
Wtf? He wasn’t calling her a homosexual, lady. He was referencing when Demi Moore shaved her head for the role and saying Jada’s in the sequel. God people are DUMB 🤦🏻‍♀️
So whoever doesn’t like Tiffany’s jokes you have her permission to go slap the hell out of her. If a white person had slapped Chris , Racism all over the place. This bitch doesn’t know that violence is a crime. Someone should educate her. I hate that people make assholes like her and will rich and they feel they can treat people like crap.
She can keep. A 👨.but she got money.
I hope Chris rock's next stand up going to be roasting will smith
His joke was innocent and funny and no excuse to go violent! They should take back the Oscar from him because he insulted everybody i usee to be huge fan of will since I'm small love all his movies but now!? I feel like he is a douchebag, living a toxic marriage and his insecurity coming out on ppl
Says it ain’t none of her business after talking about it
This people are crazy I swear to god
I always liked Will Smith, and grew up watching him on the Fresh Prince but now he's just a punk ass batch.
I’m reporting this video for condoning violence. Tiffany you’re a disgrace!
She’s wrong.
Of course!! Why should she not support a fellow minstrel? Will Smith is ignorant and what he did is completely unforgivable.
Hypocrisy at it's best...
L take, people way to soft nowadays, especially if they're saying taking a cheap shot (physically) at a comedian making a joke (literally their job) is "administering discipline". Maybe her and Jada can co-star in gi Jane 2..
ghetto mentality
Tiffany has always been a child…one day she will grow up! Will Smith has been canceled in my world. Never again!
Guys Guys. Dont blame Smith without knowing what really happened. !!!!! Chris Rock says that he wants to see Jada in "J.I Jane 2". J.I Jane was originally portraited by Demi Moore and she went bald for the movie because she was a soldier in the movie. Jada Smith has no hair and she is going bald and this is because SHE HAS A MEDICAL CONDITION. She was diagnosed with ALOPECIA in 2018 and this disease make the person go bald. You can see why Will Smith would go crazy over something like this. Chris Rocks joke was not a joke to the Smiths. It was something that they have tried to live through with effort. Will Smith has always been somebody who loves his family.
Time for the industry to say goodbye slim shady to this dumb Felicia
Oh my fricken god. *slaps head*
Tifany you are crazy! https://youtu.be/8cBRfjcY9SQ
Will Smith should have kept his composure and handled himself better. Simpy behaviour as the young ones would say.
Can't wait till Amy Shumer gets knocked out during her next special by some dude who takes offense.  It's "understandable" now, its acceptable.
Another Ratchet Black female condoning Will Smith “Protecting” his Wife. What a shock. Smh
this Oscar Will Smith / Chris Rock issue is gonna get old real fast,  ok it happend, lets all give it its 15 minutes.......ok Done,  lets move on now.
People need to stop comparing stand up comedy to the Oscar's. When you go to a comedy club, you should expect to be offended but at the Oscar's, that's different. Yes its funny and entertaining but don't act like its a comedy club and anything flys.
So she’s okay with violence… this took a dark turn
Ghetto trash 🗑
Tiff just fucked her own career as much as Smith in this carcrash video.  This story isnt going away...and she'll be doing her own apology tour soon enough for some of her comments in support of this televised assauslt.
I didn't know and millions of other people didn't know that  Will Smith's wife was banging other dudes now the whole world knows. Nice move on for Will Smith.🙄
Niggas embarrassing
OJ Simpson is high fiving Will in a big way: love will make you do crazy things
Tiffany Haddish hope in the future when you're doing standup comedy and someone doesn't like your joke or feeling offended and knock yo ass out remember your words discipline must be administered at times.......
Everibody made jokes that nigth involving them  nothing happened .. chris rock makes a joke ohh i fell insulted
Save the punches for real men !!!
GI JANE 3
Things that make white people angry Rich black people, black people backing each other, and black people that know how to put them in their place ... play some of your children and grandchildren are about to have it really bad you better check them on how the new world is about to really work
This is so sad. Tiffany has no idea what she's talking about. She should be talking about the stereotypes women hold on to men. Jada gave Will the "aren't you going to defend my" honor look. Jada has put her husband in jeopardy. Jada did not think or care about what she was doing to her husband. And for Tiffany to applaud violence is just outright sad. But what do you expect from a person that needs to make a crude joke about Italian in her just shows her mentality level.
Treading on dangerous grounds. According to her reasoning, the next time she tells a joke and offend someone, they'll be justified in assaulting her.   Are people just plain stupid?!
She said “it ain’t my business” after she gave her thoughts about the Smith and Rock business Hahaa.
Ewww
This one is about as talented and vicious as her friend Jada. Never liked her before and even less now.
So let me get this straight? She’s cool with black on black violence.
Bull.  G.I. Jane was not about lesbians.  What kind of excuses you are making.  I have lost respect for you.
Homosexual???!!!! 😂😂🤣😂🤣
So apparently there’s no good black men on earth.
Chris Rock has become an icon in the world for standing up against woke culture
With all respect it does look like a costume she was set up
Lol she’s too ghetto for the Oscars lol
I lost all respect for will and tiffany
White people clothes head to toe🤬🤬🤬🤬
Will looked weak asf for doing that
Tiffany got invited to hang with Jada, they’re friends, of course she’s going to honor the friendship. Why upset any rich and famous people? This is the lifestyle Tiffany wants and she doesn’t want to beef or disagree with anyone.
Oh plz , this woman is disgusting that violence and attacking someone is okay. Comparing the attack and abuse is a form of Discipline . You are out of your depth and people like enabling aggression that suited your agenda. who is she anyway????  VIOLENCE IN ANY FORM IS UNACCEPTABLE, PERIOD.
She only agree with the Smiths because there friends!
Chris is gonna get buffed like chapelle now
I guess she condones violence. Probably wants WW3 to happen too. Oh well.
Hypocrite for going after a fellow comedian
Tear her to pieces Chris!
Now we get to bitch slap these celebs for saying shit we don’t like
Can't believe this women is trying to justify physical violence as an appropriate response to a mild joke. I'd say she has a violent streak in her and it's disheartening to listen to her take on it. How will humanity ever evolve when people like her won't condemn physical violence. I'd say she's pretty messed up. Will behaved like a violent thug and needs to be condemned for this assault.
How can anyone think what Will did was ok, I’m glade Chris had enough strength and discipline not to hit his ass back, because if it was anyone else, Will would have been limping off the stage, and if the person was white he would have been in jail. I wish he would have handled the situation a better!
Blacks 🤦‍♀🤦‍♀🤦‍♂🤦‍♂🤡🤡
Being old and single is getting to her.  Arrogance is an awful fragrance!
Fact of the matter is if it was anybody else he would have been arrested and have battery charges so why doesn't he deal with the consequences as and repercussion like a man exactly like she said
What? You think it's  ok to assault someone? Tiffany  you cray cray.
Discipline? Lol Lol did she just say discipline? So the public public has a right to discipline to discipline 2 or just celebrities? Lol. And does it apply to you if you say the wrong thing who gets the discipline you? Though? Another celebrity or library or the general public that watches you?
I don't know who she is but I hope her kids turned out better than her
Tiffany, girl bye
I understand Common more now. Tiffany Haddish, I mean ugh😖
I like her but I don’t agree with her
Tiffany said it right, its an insult asking Tiffany about it. None of our business. Rock got what he deserved and its up to them to resolve or escalate.
Wtf is wrong with people in Hollywood man.. she said it's ok to punch a comedian over a joke!? They all twisted...
Lost a lot of respect for her
Will apologizes to Chris yet no one bothered to insist Chris apologize to Jada the other person he hurt. He should also apologize to Will publicly for that tasteless joke at her expense. Chris tainted Wills night before that slap, but no one seems to get that part.
Bullllllllshittttttt
Make me remember the time Jada was sleeping with another guy and will did NOTHING
She's ignorant.  First, Will Smith laughs at the joke, then looks over at his wife, and then takes action?  I thought when you battery someone you're supposed to go to jail?
I wouldn't expect any less of a crass and ratchet answer from Tiffany. Nothing about her answer had anything to do with Chris' motivation to tell that joke. What point would there be for Chris to even insinuate that Jada, a married woman for 25 years, was a lesbian? This is how rumors start. Dumb comments like this!
Jaden Smith is obviously very vein. I use to like Will Smith but now I think he is classless. I believe 100% that your partner sticking by your partners side when someone disrespects but it was a joke not to take to heart. Shame on the Smiths they should be embarrassed and disgusted by there actions. I've seen more class at children's hospital with teenagers dying of cancer and loosing there hair is there last worry. Give me a break.
we are will smith
be careful Tiffany we will be very well watching you very closely every joke you make, or maybe you will  be quiting comedy right?
who the fuck are these people
This is the dumbest shit I have ever seen
We all know jada isnt gay lol she had will waiting on the.sidelines less then a year ago
So a comedian (an unfunny comedian) thinks it justifiable for a fellow comedian  (a legend) to be smacked on stage for a joke... I never liked Tiffany anyway.
Well, what Will did was the most embarrassing thing i have seen in TV history. The joke was not even that bad. Everyone was laughing at that joke, even Will Smith. This biggest stage in the world is turning into a Ghetto.
Lol these celebs retarted 😂🤣😭 Chris rock in the right
Such a bad take.. Tiffany hadish is literally a comedian and she's saying all this dumb shit..
Why did they ask a drunk driver for their opinion on an assault?
These are the problems faced when kids are sent to acting school rather than getting some real education. The perspective of these older celebrities are shitty af
According to her, who ever is disrespected can come up and slap the host.
Haddish has bad history with Chris Rock
What a pretty girl, it's a shame she had to open her mouth and say such stupid comments  She doesn't mind when the first amendment allows her to make her money by doing interviews such as this one she's doing right here  But when Chris rock uses his first amendment we are allowed to walk up and smack Chris in the face?  Where do we draw the line? Enough is enough!
You're no man if you let a joke make you that upset it was an offensive joke but that was totally uncalled for and shouldn't have happened at all. There is a very bad lack of control there...I've had people say very offensive jokes about me and people I love but I never used violence as an action because it's just WORDS at the end of the day so it's pretty stupid to attack someone over it, FREEDOM OF SPEECH is a beautiful thing...violence should never be encouraged and what will did can influence many young kids, this is a sad world we live in.
What a homophobe, who is she?
Chris Rock was lucky it wasn't Mike Tyson's wife.
Couldn’t been me that’s all I got to say
Will Smith forgave his wife. He's legend!
Wow! I love her response. She’s very wise. I love everything about her. I was so in awe by her in the beginning, I forgot why I was watching the video until the reporter asked about the incident 😭😂😂
Tiffany is crazy meeeeeeeen...
Will Smith my new hero! A man who can forgive his wife and stand up for her.
I thought GI Jane was a badass
I remember when GI Jane came out and if someone made a GI Jane joke or said a woman was like GI Jane, it was because she had short hair or was a badass. I never heard it being used a negative to describe a lesbian.
BTW Chris wasn't the only person who got on stage & made jokes abt them. No one else got slapped.
Please stop giving her a platform!!!
Isn’t it a possibility Chris didn’t not know about her condition and even so the joke itself had zero to do with homosexuality. He referred to her hair being short and to a movie she had already starred in with a sequel being involved cuz of her hair lol. Get over it u have money if it bother u so much what people think jada get a fucking wig
Nah Tiffany assault is never ok. It was a joke and the producers gave the ok to tell the joke it’s not Chris fault that a mf can’t take a joke it’s funny it’s always the older people saying the younger generation is soft lol but 😅
See kids violence is the best answer.
Ignorance has no boundaries. Tiffany,  just took it way out there.
Someone finally slapped that fool. He's an angry bigot
We think differently in the hood
What a dunce
at the end of the day it happened, and you really can't do nothing about it, time is gonna fly by and no one is really gonna worry about it anymore, it's just gonna be a past memorie, Plus there a whole bunch of memes about it and it funny as heck😭 well to me💀
It was not messed up🤦 will acted like a child it was a joke about her being bald 🤦. Will Smith and now Tiffany I lost respect for both of them
Not surprised 1 bit, she sounds the same way she looks and she's black
He’s a stand up comedian known for making jokes and insulting people, not a big deal
MIGHT AS WELL BAN ALL JOKES !!!!!!!
TIFFANY IS STRAIGHT, WH--E THAT GOT LUCKY
The only ones that are mad about Chris Rock getting smacked are the same ones who wanted to get on Twitter and start a cancel him post before Will took matters in his own hands. There's some lines you just don't cross
That Tiffany.. a true class act. 👏🏽 👏🏽 always saying the right thing 👍🏽
NEVER condone violence & F-bombing. Police charge MUST be filed by anyone, Public can't rest.
ganun dapat mentality ng mga pino, it's not her business and she don't care other people's business
Will Smith needed to slap Jada not Chris. Chris was just doing his job, being a comedian.
Tiffany shaved her head and now she went blonde and permed 🤦🏾‍♀️
There’s no way all these people actually think you can go up on stage in front of the entire nation and slap someone, because of a joke about hair loss.   Absolutely no shot
omg I only watched the bare feet interview and can't endure anymore - did she actually make a G.I Jane/Lesbian reference to try and support her batsh**?
Who would put a connection with her sexuality? Lol she obviously sleeps with men with all the ones she was with while being with will😂
Of course it’ll be fine and blow over, it was scripted
Comedy is so boring now. These people aren’t even cool. Listening to this clown make it seem validated is a joke.
Essa mulher deve fumar uns 2 maço de derbi todo dia
Nope GI Jane was more like a super hero that film embodied what women can achieve in a sexist world.  I want someone to break down  the joke because l think it was corny rather than insulting. Also l do not agree with this lady in regard to the slap it was wrong and showed Will in a bad light and set a bad example for his young fans.
I hope I don't get slapped for suggesting her head looks like a Ferrero Rocher 🤣
I'm NO LONGER A FAN at any level of WILL SMITH nor his family!!!   They're all entertainers and excellent at their crafts. Will could have come back with a strong verbal statement to make Chris think, and I'm positive Chris would've apologized. I had no idea Jada was experiencing alopecia. Will, I have always given high praise to his spiritual heighten intelligence but NO More will I follow a person with no self discipline. God, Yahweh, The Most High God, Allah, Source nor any other of the 72 known name will think that action is justifiable. It's ridiculous that people try to make their wrongs right by mentioning God. We are taught as children to think before you speak and react!!!!   Tiffany's response is not even a blank stare to me, it's expected! I feel this way for myriads of reasons without even saying.   This is so hurtful I cannot stop crying :{  I just want to say this in one of the biggest problems today, what people applaud for  and the level of humor which appease us.   Chris I'll continue supporting you with kindness and prayer. It's seemingly funny when Chris talk about anyone else everybody laughs, but a light joke about Jada and he deserve to be physically abused. Will laughed until Jada rolled her eyes. Would he have sone that to "The Rock" had the shoe been on his foot. This is bullying at one of its best in public :{  This could start a domino effect of attacks on comedians.  Now on the other hand I totally understand Jada's embarrassement because it's first hand to me until I found help. My heart goes out to her concerning her hair  and sclp condition. If she contacts me I'll share with her how I received relief from alopecia. Jada has such a pretty face no matter how her hair is style she looks fabulous and trendy, therefore she should have went with that energy and even went with Chris's joke and did a quick GI Jane scene.   The issue in life is we need to keep practicing keeping our MIND, BODY, SOUL, and SPIRIT BALANCE!  Will YOU made our race look AWEFUL in front of all. YOU brought to life just what many categorize us as and why we're not invited to those seats with pride!! THANK YOU WILL for hurting my feelings and our race with your ugly pride THE PUMPED OUT CHEST, PIMP WALK OFF, AND VULGAR LANGUAGE!!! YOU spoiled my spiritual connection with you and everyone elses too!!!! ...tears flowing badly from me
Celebrities are fr insane I can’t believe that people actually look up to them
Gives her opinion in no uncertain teens, then signs off with. I don't get involved I'm other people's business.
She hit different
All these people are liberals
This interviewer is ridiculously bad.
Wills a punk for that and she can shut up. That's why bacc folks are considered animals.
She stooooopid, nooooo readdddyyy, yup every say anything intelligent….ever.
Nothing worse than a woman with no etiquette that speaks poorly! Raunchy behavior has become the order of the day especially amongst us minorities! SAD
Wow really. So if any one says anything someone else doesn't like even if it's a joke we just cosign putting your hands on them. Then the love of many have really waxed cold.
Funny thing is, folks didn't go this hard when their counter parts ransacked the White House! 🤔
The constant complimenting is nauseating....
“That was a way to insult a woman”  Yet Jada’s affairs aren’t a way to insult a man?
agree tiffany!
The Smack - This was just a scripted moment … trying to raise the dying Oscar’s rating …
The Smack - This was just a scripted moment … trying to raise the dying Oscar’s rating …
She's Clueless 😂👌
Who are these people....so corny and stupid
I'm Gonna Have a Chris Rock Movie Marathon With My Wife & Cuddle.. haha
No no woman, big men can't discipline like that, that is for children, will escalate that to lawlessness
"I don't curse on my albums or movies" but then drops f-words for the world to hear along with an angry slap!
It looks like it has become drama fest and a bit ratchet at oscars. Not that I give a damn. I haven’t watched oscars in years. It’s funny how they’re okay with violence over a joke.
soprattutto arigatoni
Was it a stupid joke? Yes. Now one slapped Seth macfarlane would he made a song about people’s boobs. Not on live tv in front of the whole world. Come on he should have saved it for the speech “that wasn’t a cool joke” or something
I love Tiffany great responses and thank you for supporting Will. Don't join the hater wagon.
What a surprise. A black, feminist excusing violence as "administering a lesson"....no wonder we had a year's worth of riots and violence during covid lockdowns. These people are out of control. Violence is the answer when you have no ability to use words. Stupid people fight. Smart people talk.
That is not what the movie GI Jane reflects about women. Tiffany is ignorant. If anything it was a compliment. Ew…. Ppl just talking out the side of their necks.
So she justifies violence...
You really dont look like $$$$
i just lost all respect for her too. 😑
You're so dissappointing Tif. It reflects what kind of a person you are. What you said don't represent us women of color. It's against the law to do that. Assault.
What a mess of a woman 😂😂😂😂
Ahhh, bad ol hellyweird. Full of a bunch of misguided, confused, blood drinking, sexually perverted, pedos! Any actor that still has his marbles and a few brain cells left would be smart and GET OUT!
People defending Smith's reaction honestly make me question what kind of society I live in. No matter how disgraceful the joke was he could react in a manner similar to the joke, cut him and make an insulting joke, cut him and explain why the joke shouldn't have taken place he literally slapped a man on live TV and he was allowed to stay in the room. This literally screams privilege if any of you were in a bar or public space and did the same you would have been thrown out if not worse
TH That small interview is just gross
what an oblivious take by this person.
I don’t know the girl in green but she’s gorgeous from a handsome dude in Ireland ☘️ I look Italian 😂😂😂😇😇✌️🇺🇸✌️🇺🇸✌️
What a load of crap Tiffany, I remember that movie coming out and never once thought what you have said I saw strength. So if a man hits a woman can he use your words ( sometimes discipline needs to be administered )
Ok so assault is discipline?  Wow.
Black people sick of systemic raciesisms
Look at this girl only talking about her money shit. Lost her humanity fr
Hey Chris rock wasn’t calling Will Smith’s wife a homosexual get the hell out of here . She’s just saying that I know because who will smith is in Hollywood ain’t nobody gonna talk against Will Smith get real everybody and will smith went out there and start it was acting he was acting you got to see the real Smith react to Chris rock you got to see it
She’s stoopid.
He should've kept that energy for August 🥱🙄
He called her gay oh no he shall be smited and sent to hell
When a man sucker slaps another man and smurks on the way back to his seat and 30 minutes later is crying like a baby picking up his little trophy, you just lose all respect for him.
She full of shit on this one
“A homosexual”? This girl is out of touch.
Violence. Absolutely disgusting
The oscars heard the backlash over bot being diverse enough and invited a much more diverse group of attendees and nominees. And will smith plays to the angry black man stereotype in front of millions.
Used to like her
Discipline when it comes to handling things with hand because of dirty words? That's just not professional? That's just violence.. this is not kids thing.. please grow up ladies..😴
Silly heaux. Condoning violence
GUYS LISTEN. Not everyone is okay with those kind of messed up dark humor jokes is what she's saying. Not everyone will be cool with it and you have to accept that. The way he dealt with it, was wrong incredibly. He could've just said, "Hey chris nah man I aint comfortable with that shit" really loud. That way it doesn't get out of hand..behaving like a civilized human.
Wtf she say🤷‍♂️
Chris Rock IS NOT FUNNY how long before the world realizes this? Why in the fucking world would he make fun of Jada????? Because she has no hair she is G.I. Jane? It's not funny. Why does he think that is funny? Why is anyone laughing? He deserved the punch and he deserved WS filthy comment. WS was pissed and rightfully so. The Oscars are not a roast. The comedy should be about films, not the people. This isn't difficult to understand. Why make fun of ANY WOMAN about the way she looks? WHO RAISED YOU CHRIS ROCK????? MANNERS?
Is she crazy. This was total disrespectful and I liked the movie Gi Jane but people prospective are all different it did not give Will Smith access to put his hands on other Man. This was angry I feel from 2016 when Will Smith didnt get a Oscar and Jada Smith boycott and Chris Rock dissed Jada Smith do the research. Plus, Why? Now Will want to be a good man him and his wife talk more about their lives than anyone. Chris Rock is just some to blame. This probably why? He shouldn't be back at the Oscar's the world is getting crazy but it is Not ok. This was wrong.
as nice as tiffany is, this is pathetic. Hart helped build her and he absolutely would condemn hitting comedians over joke. haddish herself being a comedian makes this mind-blowingly dumb. what if someone rushes the stage and slaps her because her joke hurt their feelings? is that her getting what she deserves because she hurt someone’s fee fee’s? a cuck hit a nice man who is very strong willed and strong in character. rock’s wife, who he has in line, was in the audience and probably could have slapped Jada for telling will to do that. will thought the joke was funny. jada is trying to ruin his mental health and his legacy. hedonistic feminism is toxic and this is the consequence of it.
She’s a comedian and talking silly , wow everyone kissing will smith simp arse  wtf
Looks like next time tiffany makes a job and justice needs to be served we know what she will be getting and its all good. What stupidity and double standards is this. I dont agree with the job but no one has the right to attack someone like that. Chris had his hands behind his back. God he should have given it right back to will.
It figures she'd say something Ignorant
Really…fack.  Wow
Wow, she actually condoned physical aggression as a response to a JOKE
smiths wife has fucked their sons friend. classy woman, short hair is the least of their problems
the more money you have the less self control you have i guess
I don't think she would like it If someone walk up a slapped her for a Joke on Stage because she is also a comedian.
Will Smith’s marriage is open to everyone unless it’s a joke.
omgggg G.I jane is now going to be turned into some kind of unholy SLUR!!!
Tiff I fucks with u, but stfu
She's insulted to be called a lesbian? Interesting take.
Tiffany, sometimes it's better just to say nothing. I know you've said somethings over your years honey & if you would have gotten slapped in the head for half of them, you'd probably have MUCH MORE NOTICEABLE BRAIN DAMAGE. Hmmmm, I'm some glad Tiffany isn't near me because she might slap the sh*t out of me for my comment, but I know I couldn't be as controlled as Rock was. CAN'T BE TOO SENSITIVE IN THIS WORLD; I don't care what your issue is & most of us haven't arrived to a place of such PRESTIGE that, just because I'm famous, because I'm rich or because I'm in a powerful position, I think people should treat me different from everyone & anyone else in the room. Will, Jada, Rock, I hope all three of you find a way to get pass this; in my OPINION all three of you are GREAT ENTERTAINERS & GOOD PEOPLE. Damn! Damn! Damn!
People need to grow up and lighten up.
Come On, Take A Pill; NO TAKE TWO! If Jada was that offended Will could have handled that in another, BETTER way; nothing warranted that response. I don't wish this on them, but be careful, KARMA can be a b*tch; remember, we've all probably told a joke or said something a little sarcastic that we didn't intend for someone to take it SO DEEPLY & most of us aren't comedians; I'm sure Jada & Will have said things along the way, hmmmm, JUST THINK ABOUT IT! I hope you all find away to make things right. PEACE✌ *The Oscar's have to show they have some teeth to their rules & the consequences have to be the same for EVERYONE.
Two Good Men  I still REALLY like Smith as an actor, but I hate that behavior he unleashed on Rock & that was a bad joke only because, what's supposed to be so funny about Jada playing G.I. Jane? I think Jada would make an EXCELLENT G.I. Jane & if someone wants to do a remake, of that really good movie, she would be PREFECT FOR THAT PART, to me girl could have truly looked at that as a compliment because G.I. Jane (Demi Moore) was beautiful with her bald head & so is Jada & Jane was a BAD A** SOLDIER, one any military would want on their side; Demi played the hell out of that role & "NO DOUBT", Jada would too, she'd just have her own original SSSIZZLE.  Will get your mind right, go workout some of life's stress at the gym & not on other harmless entertainers; and I sure hope you find away to make this right with Rock, maybe you'll let him slap the sh*t out of you of international tv to call it even🤔 it's just a thought.☺️
I can’t wrap my head around what Tiffany is saying. “Sometimes discipline needs to be administered”. The entire night was to bring awareness to the black community in Hollywood. A bunch of black directors and actors were receiving well deserved awards and being honored for their talents. You’re telling me, a joke that a well known comedian made, which wasn’t that serious; he did not refer to her sexuality he was clearly talking about her hair being short, warrants someone to slap this comedian? That’s what you want to showcase on a night like this? That it’s ok for someone to act like an animal during a prestigious awards show? You’re propagating a stereotype that shouldn’t even be there. I’m so disappointed in Tiffany’s response. I loved her, almost as much as I loved Will Smith. This is just beyond disappointing.
Haddish, such a shame. You side with the dude who has more stature than the person who is in the same industry as you.
God I don’t like her
Tiffany, U my girl ! Good one !!!!!!! Agree
All I'm sayin' is that if Smith administered some "discipline" at home, his children wouldn't have grown up to be such utter failures.
Black on black none of my businesses.. white on black … Black Lives Matter
After watching Will Smith's actions at The Oscars i have gone off him and can't be arsed to watch any of his films when they come on TV.
A joke is a joke - Stop beeing snowflakes. Now we are like violence is totally okay just because someone can't handle jokes
Tiffany Haddish has no standards
Will is mad at the wrong person. He should be mad at the academy writers who wrote the joke and the person who approved the joke. Rock is just a teleprompter reader at these things and just asked to follow the script.
Who cares ... really
Oh you Hollywood HYPOCRITES.
Wow…I can’t believe she’s okay with that behavior…
She needs to quit being a comedian. She's pretty much giving a free pass for someone to do the same to her when she's on stage or says something dumb in a movie. No more jokes for you, and fyi everything she mentioned about the GI Jane thing is a HUGE reach.
Chris Rock "saved face" for Will Smith's inability at self control.  Will's actions came across as immature - no respect for his actions whatsoever.
Lol she so real I am like her
Yeah discipline needs to be administered to Will Smith for assaulting someone over a joke. We all know he's really mad that his wife cheated on him with some kid.
Birds of a feather sticking together to ensure Black is the new white and we all have to apologise for it! FK THAT!
His wife is suffering with an autoimmune disease that causes hair loss. As a woman who lost all her hair due to cancer, I don't really blame him. Publicly being humiliated while losing your hair as a woman. I would have been absolutely devastated. Know your audience before you try and be funny.
Will Smith defended his wife She's a survivor cancer that's why she lost her hair
Let us remember “words have an impact” and “appropriate timing is the driving force behind one’s duty to defend those who are hurt and/or suffering”. Speculating about this situation does nothing more than cast a shadow over the raw truths that were on display during the Oscars broadcast.   May the public onlookers make the humane “choice” to use this as an opportunity to calibrate their own perception of how “choice words”, (jokes, comments or otherwise) can be interpreted, and responded to, by others regardless of social and economic status. Hopefully “the fall” won’t overshadow “the push”.  -DIGITAL ADVOCATE
Men with thinning hairlines get roasted all the time and nobody bats an eye. It's perfectly okay to poke fun at them but because Jada's a woman people act like her condition is as serious as cancer. It wouldn't surprise me if most of these people defending Will were also telling the trans community to not take Chappelle's jokes so seriously. All Will did was perpetuate the stereotype that black men can only resort to violence when agitated, while simultaneously making himself look like the biggest pussy-whipped dude in Hollywood.
I think he was just making a comparison not the other stuff but ok😭
So what you saying, black on black crime is ok.
Chris Rock has constantly been degrading Jayda. That woman is bald and sick. All jokes aside I think Will really felt he was defending his helpless wife.
Lets make it a sexist joke, lord help us
Will Smith lost all respect from me
Tiffany must be filming Demolition Man 2
This is my take on it Will Smith has been coming on down for a long time there’s something really going on wrong with that man. That was very undignified what he did
Italian guys:  We’re good, thanks.  Well, maybe!
She not ready for the truth. She trying to stay out of it. She wrong she didn’t understand what Chris was referring to.  She needs to stop the bull crap 💩
So much for a joke from a comedian 👀 or is it insecurities of a beautiful women who is not solid inside. or a man who needs deep healing ❤️‍🩹. Bless you all!
Now we know how "peaceful" leftists are. The best way to deal with a disliked joke is to resort to violence? Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass), a member of "The Squad," in a now deleted tweet rushed to celebrate Will Smith when he slapped Chris Rock on Sunday night, initially cheering Smith for taking action in response to Rock’s wisecrack. “# Alopecia nation stand up! Thank you # WillSmith Shout out to all the husband who defend their wives living with alopecia in the face of daily ignorance & insults. Women with baldies are for real men only. Boys need not apply.”
Im sure many are gonna watch GI Jane after the Oscar's lol
This woman is a dope..she thinks it's "ok" for someone to punch or slap...You're a bullshitter. Chris meant nothing by saying GI Jane
Well that’s a bad joke we know very much so that jada is no homosexual
She justified straight up assaulting a comedian. What a hypocrite. So I can walk on stage and smack her if she made a joke I don’t like? 🤦‍♂️
Bussiness is bussiness but insulting and bullying of sick woman that was unforgiven. Good job Will Smith... I support you and you lovely wife
Wrong drunk to ask.Relating it to being a lesbian  really? in the contexts of this modern reference of G.I Jane? What a stupid stretch.
Was gi jane a lesbian? i cant even remember
That reporter is FINE.
Drunk
in all the controversy we seem to be forgetting that it is f****** illegal to assault a person especially when the assault takes place on live television the state should pick up those charges whether the victim presses charges are not it was on television that is promotion of violence
these people are delusional what do you mean you don't talk about the business if you're not in the business you just talked about the business and you're not in it . Will Smith gives a teary-eyed speech about wanting to be a vessel for love ! right after he physically assaulted a man in public. Jada Pinkett Smith in a recent interview says she doesn't give, and I'm quoting here. " to shits "what anybody thinks about her hairdo yet she has a visibly emotional reaction to a joke these egomaniacal narcissist sure do tend to forget their behavior and their comments very quickly.
It was a joke wow
Look at the "woke" Academy turning a blind eye to live physical assault on their own programming. I knew you were fake in your reviews but didnt know you really had no convictions. If you're not sure how to spin this it doesn't matter. You still suck.
Would he have slapped Amy Schumar or Ricky Gervais for that joke?.. Is slapping comics the knew norm???
If I robot wasn’t a movie, Smith would have blown up his head 😂
imagine we are heading to a world where u cant even make a bad joke, soon every joke that offend somebody will be treated as a crime lmao, the world is going to shit for real. how about im offended that u even speak, maybe a slap would help. lol
"DISCIPLINE  NEED TO BE ADMINISTERED " what the fuck is she talking about, that is public violence against another person. Does that mean that I can start slapping people around to teach them something? Come over here so that I can " DISCIPLINE YOU" doesn't sound that kind, does it ?!
Well there is all the proof I need If I find another unfunny Tiffany Joke. I thought It was illegal but as Tiffany finds it beautiful and lovely I won't mind smacking her on face for all the unfunny bits she does .
Jesus is king spread the gospel ❤️🙏🏾🙏🏾
if u slap me because of a word, dont be surprise if u get beaten to a pulp afterwards. simple as that. in this case chris was the smaller dude, but if it was lebron james or somebody he wouldnt do it.
Long Beach laugh factory I have been there when Tiffany talk so badly about people and everyone just laughs around her why is it not okay that Chris did it but it's okay when she did it?
You call yourself a comedian? Next time you tell a joke someone doesn't like, I guess they should just go up on stage and slap you?
Oh no it wasn't.
She is a psycho
That’s what I’m talking about Tiffany that ain’t my business if it ain’t got nun to do with me I’m not goin talk about nobody business  all 2022-Forever
No!!! NO TIFFANY PLEASE DONT STAND BY HIM!!!! YOU ARE WAY BETTER THAN HIM
oh Tiffany of all people u should now better
maybe someone slaps her next time she makes a joke
My boy Chris ate that smack like a CHAMP! Never even moved to touched/rub his face, put his hands right back behind him and continued like a boss, like nothing happened! Just gained a whole lot more respect for Chris and a lot less for Will…
She should be embarrassed for saying that …When she’s a comedian herself!!!! No respect
😆❤️
Off all the platforms this man decides to speak negatively of a BLACK WOMANS CROWN SMH we get it worse from people who look like us
Disgusting behavior
So violence is the answer?, if that so oscar is a just piece of metal.
Tf is this orange chimney talking about??
Old school chauvinism
Women Tiffany promoting violence... And when administered to a fellow woman 👠 it woul have been Ukraine Russia situation what a shame....
So I guess we as adults can just smack anyone if our feelings are hurt or we feel disrespected, we might as well just not talk to each other💀😂btw Chris gon be feeling that smack til August what an entanglement
who wrote the joke? the academy?
Yayks what is this level.
Will Smith the man of the hour. Lol
All of a sudden the black community wanna act like Will Smith hasn’t ALWAYS catered to a white audience. Basically made his entire career off being “Not so black.”
Yeah  . I was a young adult woman when G.U. Jane came out. Not once did I hear that reference to mean being a lesbian. I had a crew cut with bangs (yeah, I know).   Also, do we even know if Chris knew she had alopecia- which is NOT a disease. It's  a temporary disorder, usually lasting 6 mo ths (source: CDC). It's treated with steroids. Other forms of alopecia are cause by weaves, braids, etc.   A man who reacts with physical violence is one who is not only weak by being reactionary, but is one who doesn't have the ability to use words.
Will Smith has nothing apologize for.   Maybe if Chris Rock is handing out apologies then maybe will Smith giving an apology may be accepted. But I don't think will needs to apologize for anything.   The problem is society is fucked up and takes pleasure in others misfortune. As Chris Rock and the other actors at the Oscars clearly do. The video proves more than just Chris Rock are to blame for bad behavior, but Don't act like what will did in response was inappropriate. Cause it wasn't.
Yesssss👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
GI Jane is a COMPLIMENT
Jesus… she’s PRO assault over jokes? Yeesh, my respect for Tiffany Haddish is lost, not that there was much there to begin with.
Thought Tiffany was arrested…   Oh wait, she’s a fucking celeb
extra sucks
You think nobody can slap Dwayne Johnson just because he got muscles. But I think even Dwayne Johnson has more class and wouldn't do anything that low down if he was the Mc at an award show.
Where are the Black Lives Matter people now?
He should be in jail. Will Smith should be arrested. He broke the law on TV.
https://youtu.be/kqhVNZgZGqQ  Rock begins his rant on the Smith's at 2:40 several years ago. There is more going on than meets the eye.
This Dang story is everything 🤦‍♀️ . We are so hypocritical,so selective on what’s right, and wrong that’s 1 of society many flaws . He still assaulted the man , he hits him PERIOD! Quiet frankly Chris Rock walked aways THE HERO , not too many would be able to respond like him 💯💯💯
Will Smith hits like a straight up b*tch
Have a white woman come up and slap her for her horrible comedy then see what happens,  BS
Somebody out there raised her right
What no it's not fucking woke bs
Did she really just say 'sometimes discipline needs to be administered'?. Criss rock is a professional and Will smith is now officially a lunatic!!!
😍😍😘😘💕💕💕
Scratches head at her response. Are these people sane?
G.I Jane was about being a strong woman. Quit making excuses. If any other normal layman did that, arrested and escorted out the building, not handed an award!!!!
I hope  Will and Chris  apologizes to each other and make  friends... Both were in the wrong.. A joke can be hurtfu.l but everyone was laughing including Will Smith But  also it  hurts more being   slap in the face.. Chris handle it like a man being slap by Will Smith.
Just shows what kind of classless women she is..
Homosexual? It was a BALD joke. Where does sexuality come into play?
“Here’s a tip you should never forget: If your woman is mad at you, leave her at home. Cause a mad woman will do anything” - Chris Rock
Tiffany is a SELL OUT. It was a regular joke against a shitty person. Will acted like a loser, because that’s what he is.
That blonde hair looks so natural atop her black head. I’m glad she’s doing her part to make the oscars decreasingly white,.
It's an interesting precedent to set. So if I attend an Amy Schumer show and she says something about men that offends me I should walk on stage and discipline her.
She think she looks Italian she looks like she’s from Nigeria😂
She  cringe as fuck bruhh😂
They all deserve each other
Is this person even famous? Who cares what she thinks?
So..Tiffany just slammed LGBTQ when she suggest Chris Rocks comment is consistent with insulting a woman like she is a homosexual. Slamming a womans sexuality like calling her a homo. Like Biden saying poor black kids can be smart.. Let that sink in..
Doesn't warrant assault though
It was an ugly joke. Don’t think it’s funny to tease a woman about her hair fell out in clumps. Alopecia isn’t really that funny. It was a bit beyond rude.
Ooohhhh so tiffany should understand why nicki checked her at the mtv awards then👀🍿😂
Look at this fool
She’s a 🤡🤡🤡
I fill like Im in the hood
No way. That’s stretching it .
Tiffany Is so fake nice. That’s why I can’t stand her humor.
Knock knock Who’s there? Amy Fisher  Amy F…. BLAM!!!  -Will Smith , Fresh Prince of Bel air I can’t remember what episode but it was Will Smith making a joke about Amy Fisher shooting  Mary Jo Buttafuoco in the face. I guess its ok to make fun of the attempted murder of someone’s wife    but the hair is off limits.
He slapped him with an open hand to me that would be more humiliating then a punch. His lucky. And any man that loved his wife were have done the same. It was inappropriate for Chris rock to say that.  maybe he needs to change his script.  just so he can get a laugh on somebody else.
No , there are other ways. Or from now on the lesson is to smack everyone??
Tiffany you need to get your ass out of the clouds.
No one can be this stupid.
She don't talk about people's business???!!! That's rich. Tiffany is always spilling the tea 😂
Legend has it that if you say Jada Pinkett Smith in the mirror three times, Will Smith’s arm reaches out of it and slaps you
I just unfollowed her on Insta after the appalling remark on the assault of Chris Rock.. these people think they need the A list celebrities to make more money and get in the scene and that’s exactly what Tiffany done here. How can u turn your back on a feeliw comedian ? This now open the gates for anyone to walk on stage and slap a comedian because they have some condition that they have made a joke about. I hope everyone boycotts any of your shows and you get slapped next time you make a joke
Tiffany Haddish is unfunny. Not sure why she's even famous
These rich devil's materialistic. Superficial idiot's.
Wow what a bitch comment on the beginning. People get cheaper and cheaper these days.
Drugs
A Fight done broke out at the Cookout...Cousin  Will and  Cousin  Chris....Big Mama break the  Belt out.
I do not know why people care about celebrities. Will and his wife are both grown adults. This ain't middle school. Her honour has been long gone. Will just made a fool out of himself. People act like she has cancer. She has a hairloss disorder. Most people suffer from hairloss. She still has hair on her head. It was her choice to cut it like that. Grown ass women mad over being bald. Will Smith a pussy. Can even hit a man who had his hands down.
I unstand Will Smith's point and all but when you behaving like a savage, you are a savage too.
"Discipline needs to be administered"...Hollywood is now encouraging assault.
Sad shit, how these obnoxious people's supporting Will...alot worst have been Said about his wife...I can assure you if that was Mike tyson, 50cents or late Tupac, Will Smith wouldn't have balls to confront them, he would listen like a bitch ass bitch. Lough and do nothing about  it...it shows how bully this
If someone referred to you as a GI JANE in 1996 that meant you were a badazz not a lesbian. What is Tiffany Hadish talking about?
Fuck Hollywood
His wife has been publicly humiliating him for years. I guess he has some built up frustration.
Tiffany Haddish you disgust 😒 me. You're the same woman who was flirting with Stephen Curry at the all star game, and you know  he's married. I see why you have mental issues. Also, what makes this incident so bad, blacks has finally gotten their opportunity to shine at the Oscars. I'm sure they're saying, see how they act.
Boycott King Richard   #CancelWillSmith
I didn't even get the joke, but can somebody explain how making fun of someone being bald is sexist and homophobic?
How deluded can you be to condone assault. Smith should be arrested.
Yes!
I’m loving the blonde short doo on Tiff ♥️
That slap by Will was completely unacceptable. Óscar should have been retracted from Will. What a doosh
Wish wish uncle Phil would have slapped Smith for those bald jokes.
If Wills initial reaction would have been "appalled" I would see where it all makes sense. But the fact that he was laughing until he looked over at his husband Jada's face? Makes him look pathetic and like he has the vagina.
Calling someone a homosexual is not an insult. I hate Tiffany Haddish. Byeeeee
How is calling a woman a homosexual INSULTING HER!? Get it together Haddish... Common dodged that bullet fo sho!
Condoning Will Smith *physically assaulting* Chris Rock on live TV because he told a joke. Also coming from the women who publicly stated she wanted a guy to f*ck her. Reverse the roles and any guy would be called a sexist and cancelled for sexualizing a women. Not surprised tho, Grammys is like a convention for the most delusional woke people on earth.
He wouldn’t have slapped the rock tho…
look at me i am a walking billboard...i got money up my asshole
Tiffany Harris need to stop
Taking a woman's hair stands for all that meanwhile your rocking the G.I Jane I'm not confused I just don't get the logic.
She's a crappy comedian
Discipline for your actions? She wasn’t say that when she was locked the fuck up.
No apology needed!
I don’t talk about peoples business but yet I talked about there business
She should know that in comedy everything goes she didn't sound like a comidian with that reply so people should attack comidians oh ok.
Jada’s wig is made out of pubic hair shaved from Muslims in Chinese concentration camps
Discipline has to be administered, she's way more nuts than Will Smith
Jayda like aight alpha will, you can get a piece tonight now instead of someone else
So if she spoke out of line to her husband and he slapped her, it would be necessary discipline? People say hurtful things all the time, it's all good to assault them as a "consequence"? Sounds like how someone ends up in prison because they don't know how to communicate using their words. Sounds like a destructive culture lacking self control.
Will can you explain white privileged with no violence
Ca detto?
Get your money back.  No it was a gi Jane joke.
OscarsNOTsowhite
Chris Rock is way more of a man for taking that slap and holding his composure than Will Smith is for throwing it.
Will Smith was just demonstrating to Venus and Serena on how good his Tennis arm still is….he’s gone full method
Next time someone insults me just know my hands are now rated E for everyone
Tiffany is so woke!
So chris rock didn't know about Jada situation and smith should have clear the situation after words, And  then chris rock would have publicly apologized. Someone got  neuter and who holding the leash telling him what todo. Will just destroyed his career and boost chris rock.lol
Will Smith was completely out of line. He wouldn't have did to someone he saw as a threat.  That was a bih ass move. Then he apologized to the academy and not to Chris Rock. Bad behavior should not be rewarded  , take his Oscar.
Horrible this one should not be talkin
A jokes a joke.
One man's discipline is another man putting a bullet in the back of his head.
That's a man
Ghetto ghetto ghetto. Even at the oscars
Who is she?
August was roasting Jada and Will never done shit about that
Tiff dis ain't it
This is how some ignorant people think...She called it discipline when a man(Will Smith) is full of feminine energy decides to react physically due to his uncontrolled emotions.
Las time she was in an event she started talking about everyone’s business and they called her out on it. Good she knows to keep her mouth shut now!!! She is grown now and another thing will and jada and her friends
It seems she hasn't matured since leaving school.
This is what woke ideology does to people’s moral compass. You can assault people for making a joke.
What a unfunny Harlot
Will Smith is a fool. I don't even know who this broad is bragging about her expensive clothes.
Tiffany  clearly understood what that joke meant.  Is he saying she looks like a man?  This is the one time somebody didn't find his joke funny.
Wow see this is it the hood al over no class you can dress a garvich can whit Italian expensive clothes but inside still a garvich can
Why didn’t will react this way…when a dude slept with his wife?  I guess it’s ok to sleep with someone just not tell a joke
That joke made him feel like G.I. Joe 😂😂 will you lost all respect ✊🏾 from me bro she got you out looking bad bro 🤦‍♂️.
Will Smith *“Single-Handedly”* stole the whole show.
Is this white privilege I'm confused ?? 🤔
Wow this is pathetic.
A rare pro will smith interview very interesting
Doesn’t his wife cheat on him why don’t he slap her like that
Chris Rock is a comedian it's what he does , i don't he was out of pocket , he basically said he went easy on the joke before he got the life smacked out of him .
Why would you ask a girl like that
My respect is gone for this bish
Girl bye....dont drink and drive
I thought G.I. Jane was empowering to woman when it came out. Guess I was wrong. Thinking a slap on live TV is a disgrace. No wonder this world going to sh@t if people think that's okay
whatever happened to class in hollywood.  its in places but not here.  talkin about getting some italian in her and condoning violence.... Will Smith acted improperly, violent, and unacceptable.
Her manager looked over like girl you betta be quiet and keep it moving ...talking about Will won't get us paid
As a stand up comic. Haddish knows she's a hypocrite. No wonder your ex bolted on your stupid a**. Seems like he's the only one who had common sense
Blacks will always be ghetto. This will always be they're culture.
Women always trying to take everything as  "" against women"" thingv
her voice annoys me
💯
Damn y'all so pressed over a slap. Like dude freedom of speech does not mean freedom from somebody slapping you if you talk about their spouse.
So now the joke was woman bashing? 😂 this is both ridiculous and hilarious, because no one spoke of her predatory way of taking advantage of her son's ill friend. Cut the bs, pls...absolutely no one is exempt from jokes
It’s interesting how people perceived the joke based on their perception and experiences. It totally went over my head because I never associated G.I. Jane with those negative things and had no idea about Jada’s medical condition.
Silly mare
Dislike
I guess she's  okay with getting smacked for her jokes. Or maybe everyone should  just go around and  assault people people  because  they're  having an emotional melt down. Smh will deserves  an ass whooping for that
Tiff you wrong for this one. I am Team Chris✊🏽
Weak , very weak reaction
What a brain dead woman.  A paid comedian gets slapped on stage by Will  "I'm gonna take offence on my wife's behalf, but not before laughing at her as well" Smith and its ok? No. Absolutely not. Don't care! Absolutely not. Words do not equal violence. It's CR who didn't do anything wrong.  Here's a controversial opinion...who cares if she is losing her hair? Who cares if she is bold?  I don't. So many people have/are losing their hair all over the world. So congratulations to her for being just like everyone else. Hell I lost my hair at 19 and did everything I could to get it back. Then I got over it.  Will "I'm gonna let my wife sleep around because I have no self respect or balls to up and leave, but get offended by a harmless joke" Smith should have his Oscar taken away and banned from ever coming back.  To all the individuals patting WS on the back and giving encouragement etc...please get help
Will owes Chris an apology and a thank you for not pressing charges, Chris is a real professional.
No no No O it's never right to be violent. 😣 That was not disciplining..  Bad joke ext aside. Will Smith  did not carry himself well
Violence is never the response to words.  “Discipline” needs to be administered to a joke? Um, no..  maybe take your 100,000,000 dollar pay check and your stupid statue and just suck it up buttercup.
don't make a joke because you just said its ok to hit someone
Tiffany trying to justify will smith childish as behavior she’s sick in the mind those people need God but I forgot they worship money is their God
She cap
Will Smith's wife is ill.
This is fucking disgusting, if Chris rock had a malicious intent it would be different of course, and Woman who co-sign this bullshit wouldn’t say so if Will slapped another woman, let alone a black woman.
Who would have thought that this idiot would have this opinion. I'm so shocked
Yeah back in the day chris had a joke about how black people wouldn't never be president but we had one he also said theres jokes he cant make anymore like that one but this means theres new jokes that can be made... and g.i. jane now?? Is more of a women empowerment comment just like being gay and proud and being a woman and proud so tiffany's point about back in the day that was a way to make fun of someone in today day its not
Wills mother and father must of never told him to keep his freak’in hands to himself .  You don’t put your hands on anyone for a bad joke.   Regardless if you think it had to do with you balding head.   But not for nothing. That bald Mark jada had on top of her head was a scar, it was from  a facial procedure she had done to herself. It’s not from that balding disease like she clams. Her hair is balding because she is a vain person . Who wanted a face life .  The scar is the result. They go in threw the top of the head like they did.  And pull up.  Which leaves a scar
Lack of education I reckon. Disgusting people.
GI Jane was never the insult she claims it was. That's just not true. -
Some people just don't have any class
I guess it’s okay to just physically assault anyone for make an insulting joke. These people are pathetic
I don't have a clue who this woman is. All I know is I hate her.
Who the f*ck is Tiffany H?
Lol Tiffany Haddish talking about business that she isn't in then ends it with she doesn't get in other people business
Chris Rock was poised & professional.  Will Smith is a ❄️ who needs to go to anger management classes.
physical assault is not discipline. an offensive joke doesn’t justify violence.
If Tiffany got slapped for making fun of someone, I don’t think she would be okay with it.
I hope she gets a taste of that discipline.
Would be nice if an Italian would be stepping to those ladies and smack both of them for insulting the italian language
As a Comedian Tiff you're wrong Morally I understand...But Jada wasn't defending her husband on the Red Table Talk about August busting her up!
Nothing like family and sticking up for them. Chris Rock crossed a line of decency and got the taste slapped out of his mouth!
Makes me wanna puke
👎💩👎💩💩👎
The lady is boring
Tiff you from the hood love how you handled that big ups
True man indeed, who was laughing his ass of in that joke till he saw his wife's face - what an absolute loser, not to mention his wife banged like half of Hollywood while married to Will.
Will really wanted to play it off, I think Jada did too but couldn’t hide anymore that it hurt her feelings. That hurt Will and he couldn’t let it slide.
Tiffany Haddish sux
It’s funny how all the black people side with will and the white people side with Chris
I only just realized her hair loss was due to her disease, not some hipster stylist's idea; a serious condition which she has talked about publicly several times. ...Ok in that light, I get why you'd find a G.I.Joe reference insensitive as a husband (though Chris may not've informed himself about it in advance). Before coming across that info, I just thought Will's radical outlash was completely uncalled for. Now I at least get the disapproval, as unnecessary as physical violence was though! Yet alone since Will himself was laughing at first and only changed his mind when Jada looked offended.
Wow....she’s fine with Physical Assault of someone simply joking.  Is she not aware of the HUGE rise in violence in this country and the world, including domestic violence simply because someone didn’t like what the other person was saying? Amazing and sad how many people think like her.
The man must defend his lady angle makes me despair. Violence is fine if a woman wants revenge for a bad joke. Haddish is full of crap.
Who's this lady again?
What if a woman told that joke
My momma said that all she said was a lie 💀
I wonder if will slapped Jada like that for hoeing around!
Not sure why but I died at 1:47
Talking to the wrong person 👊🏼 This https://youtu.be/DrBIihzjy6E is what happened.........
Why do people kept on saying Chris insulted Wills wife? I don't get it. Chris compared her to G. I. JANE. Isn't GI Jane a kickass heroine? I better watch the movie again.  Are we sure this isn't an act? Since Chris is launching his Ego Death Tour soon?? When one get slapped and didn't do anything just walked away, just like the death of his Ego? Yes the slap is real, but it has to be real to be believable.
Tiffany..  You are full of #&#&#!!  How's about people acknowledge will over reacted with violence!
Horrible take by a ‘comedian’. She’s probably made so many offensive jokes to someone in her crowd. & if they came up and slapped her they’re going to prison for years. and she’s not even as famous as chris rock
Truth is that if it wasnt chris rock uo there yall woulda backed up will. Yall no if it was some weird sctor that said it then yall woulda been fine like shutup
0:31 phew
Hollyweird
Let me break it down this way. A family member got mad at me and literally wanted to attack me.  Now I believe everybody has a right to choose their path, the only thing that bothers me is nobody wants to accept the consequences after the fact. That family member is now cut off from me for life and can't accept it. I don't mind what Will Smith did and you can even let him stay to get his award, but he should be banned from every award show from this day on. This case is going to set a precedent. So, what next?  N.B.A. players now being allowed to punch Refs. over calls. All award shows now have a history changing decision to make in my eyes.  .......................GRIM
Thugs... I guess it's ok to assault people now
he compared her to the appearance of Gi Jane, jokes don't take everything into context like what Gi Jane was used as at the time against women for a short period of time. Discipline? for a joke? gtfo
Smart woman, she don't wanna get messed up in that shit.
Should a small guy been assaulted publicly by someone with power and size without any consequences?
Why wasn't he arrested
Tell em girl🙌🏾
I knew there was a reason I never thought Tiffany Haddish was even a little but funny
Some time comedian shouldnt be slapped by another comedian,  and take a joke as a joke .
I get that she has a sickness that causes hair loss. Nothing serious however and Will could have handled the situation totally different. You gonna go around slapping the shit out of everyone that says a joke you don't like? All I know is anyone of us little people would have been arrested for assault. I like how Chris Rock handled the situation. With class.
Chris never wrote that joke out of all it’s a fucking joke we joke about dead people we joke about slavery n now we can’t joke on a hen with no hair 👩‍🦲
Chris Rock doesn’t have to be disciplined by Will Smith. He is a grown as man.
21 century and still "resolve" problems with fight. fcking hell.
Tiffany Haddish needs to take several seats down.  I'm losing respect for any actor or comedian that backs Will Smith with his actions.  Bye Tiffany 👋
This woman is a joke. In no way Chris rock was talking about her sexuality because of that movie. He was simply talking about her hair loss that’s it! People trying to make it deeper than what it really is. Smh
Rock lives matter!!!!  Lol 😂
The BET awards are off the chain in 2022.
I can expect this comment from Tiffany because she still BITTER that Common tossed her back. She’s been straight vinegar ever since. Based on what happened last night… I think people have forgot that Jada has shaved her head bald several times over the years and has looked gorgeous. This isn’t like Beyoncé losing all her and being forced to shave it and now this is the very first time anyone has ever seen her bald. Jada and Willow shave off their hair ever other year. That’s why Chris felt comfortable to use the joke because she wears it just as well as Demi in GI Jane. I think he meant that she wears the pants in the relationship, as Demi did in the movie, and not about her being bald. Also Will is a comedian how many jokes has he told about people. So should everyone line up and slap him because the line would be very long. You can’t throw a tantrum because you have misplaced anger and assault someone because you’re still salty that August banged your wife. Ridiculous.
It's disgusting how other celebrities defend horrible behavior because they like the person.
Terrible justification that was unwarranted and assault periodt.  Will has been doing a lot of compensation in his life talent aside.  First overcompensating due to his abusive father then overcompensating the other way due to his wife publicly emasculating him.  This man has done tons of therapy and still has issues don’t think that an abusive parent doesn’t f.. you up for life because it most certainly does.  When I think of the comedians back years ago they were terrors compared to what Chris Rock said.  Did he even know she had a medical condition?  Cause I didn’t and she looks incredible.  This is really just sad as hell.
Nope!!
Y’all soft as hell for being mad at will for defending his wife, i have seen men beaten to near death for worse. Men are supposed to stand up for their wives mothers and daughters
Anyone that thinks what will did was oka your the problem with society now😂
Dislike counter is needed
then he makes the biggest self-centered speech in history like not a real apolygie to me then says he want to be an ambasedor for loving etc... omg how stuppid can you make yourself look. next google you can bet your life. probably best friends and it's all for views will hit a billion in a years wanna bet?? By the way he did not apologise to Chris who he punched he apologized to the acadamy that could take back the oscar statue.
“Sometimes discipline has to be administered” lmao
Oh.  Violence is the answer?  Interesting mindset.  BTW who is she?
She chose to be on the wrong side!
This is all Biden or Trump's fault depending on your political affiliation.
If a regular person did this he/she would have been arrested.  Will Smith is trash. Chris Rock deserves all the respect in the world for maintaining his professionalism.
I cannot believe a fellow comedian thought that was cool
I don't know who this lady is but she's right. Your actions have consequences and you got to deal with it Chris Rock.
#OscarsAreSoGhetto
So if a women comedian said it its ok for Will Smith to Smack her to ? >>>>Dill Smith is obviously violent in real life ... No excuse and this women is just gutless and her opinion is ridiculous > "Its of to use violent discipline."
I like Tiffany but she's off mark. If we apply the same logic that means if someone doesn't like a joke she makes about someone they care about, they can walk up to her and slap her too. Dumb. Wonder if they would have the same energy for Ricky Gervais, bet not! Can't wait for Chris Rock's next anything! He did nothing wrong. Will needs therapy.
I can't believe people stupid, Will was not near bought right
If a white guy did this all hell would break lose. The hypocrisy in Hollywood and the west. No wonder Putin is winning.
Yes violence is the answer. Lol
Had dish was wrong.  GI Jane represented a strong independent women who was determined that she could do as good as men, if not greater.
i lost all respect for will smith last night. grow up dude. its not cool to teach the world that they can act like Putin.
Wrong!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Chris Rock is a real man. 👌 my respect to him and his family. What about Will Smith whom on his show and movies body shamed women by making always good looking women on them.
Repercussions for your action ????? He’s a comedian !!!!! Omg what a time to be alive , will Eminem was right about you !!!
Chris rock did not insult her for the bald hair.  He joked cuz the movie sucked
Big man face
Ghetto trash bs
At the Oscars really? Wow!! But like she said "It's gonna be fine" pff. Yah sure okay like its normal to assult ppl esp there but .since there's a new lead, how could anything else be expected Guess  We are bringing gehetto to the Oscars, 2022 No stopping us now!
Who?
La unica con agallas que dijo que Chris se lo merecia. Como la banco!
So if she makes a joke about me I can crack her fucking jaw.. #consequences #equality
Boo fucking whoooo
He insulted a woman with a hair loss disorder on live national television and got his bells rocked on national television. Seems fair to me. You don't joke about something that someone can't prevent.
She’s very close friends to Will & Jada. Also Tiffany got a DUI like a month ago, so she needs to get her ish together too.
🤦🏻‍♀️
Black Family Business, if it don't concern you, stay out of it - certain generations understand this.....
She is ridiculous! Will Smith was wrong and should have immediately apologized to Chris Rock! However, the silver lining is that Chris maintained his professionalism. As educators, we teach scholars to handle similar situations without violence, so it was very disappointing to see Will Smith become violent. Chris Rock is a real man and responded to how an adult should respond to verbal jokes. I am proud to show my scholars Chris's strength because he was the better man. Chris, you rock!! Shame on the Oscars for not protecting or supporting you!!
I hope you'd be getting discipline also
She's friends with Jada. They're costars, she's not gonna defend Chris
Yesss discipline she said it here ladies and gentlemen 😂
I can’t stand how every issue we have is either racist or gay! Some people don’t agree period! Live ur life and move on!
Got to love black on black crime black lives matter lol
lol why am I not surprised. she's not really an example of intelligence. celebrities are so deluded
how is it be good for will? i doubt his marriage will improve after this.
ppl just dont get that she's only saying its ok because will smith is very powerful in hollywood ...
Tiffany is friends with will and jada, of course she wasn't gonna say what we're all thinking (including her) on camera, Will's behaviors was wrong and weird for a grown man to do.
Yea remind me not to bother with anything she has been involved with. Maybe if she was the one being slapped for a tiny joke that was not even insulting she would be crying and pleading that black lives matter. By the way your hair is pretty much a joke as well..
Take wills Oscar for acting like a bully!
So comedians are gonna need body guards now ?  Really ?  I'll never watch will in anything again. Or anyone who thinks that was ok !
Wow, I have lost all respect for Tiffany. Hollywood really does weird things to people. Folks really are on Will's side and are ok with violence.
tiffany saying i dont go into others business , you know what im saying.. to a reporter intervier who only goes into peoples business . . love it.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Will was laughing until he saw his wife's reaction. She been controlling him a long time
This woman calls an assault to a fellow comedian discipline? This woman is sick!!! Tiffany cancelled ❌❌❌
When you can't hit your wife's lover, so you hit a rather unfunny comedian !
Wow she is really really stupid. I would have expected her to defend Chris at least as a comedian.
Word
The academy should take his Oscar back. !
So she says that thats the way to handle business? What does that says about her and Will? Yeah she doesn't talk about anyone but she did commented on the situation.... Hollywood is FAKE AS HELL.
Well, I'm a ..."Homosexual"🤨 & as a Black Lesbian,  Tiffany's assessment of the situation says more about her own anti-lesbian worldview. Translation.. "If you call someone's wife a lesbian, those are fighting words, like in HIGH SCHOOL & you deserve to be slapped". Huh??  the joke wasn't that deep. Will was reacting to pent up rage/insecurity for all the heat his relationship has gotten from him & Jada airing out their own dirty laundry.  EMASCULATED ENTANGLEMENT.  Then to make it worse, will uses " Defending Black women's honor" to shield himself from accountability.  . "Had to protect Black women" is the biggest joke ever (particularly played against Black women). ....& here come Black Women again to the rescue to defend.
Will just wanted a Kanye moment.
Will has no moral values. He never apologized to Chris. Yes the joke may had been a '"little much"" but there was no reason to do that. Will just wanted a Kanye moment.
Anyone that thinks it was ok to hit comedian Chris rock at the Oscars for a joke is mentally sick themselves and needs help.  Will need a mental doctors now. Chickenshit
SHE KEPT IT SO REAL!
Comedians who flip on other comedians for a "offensive" joke are a disgrace. If she ripped on a bald dude and a girl slapped her she would change her tune real quick.
What the hell is this mumu saying…
These celebrities are so toxic Wake up people who continually celebrate their toxic-assed behavior MK mind control
I never heard of G.I Jane being an insult ever. I grew up in the Los Angeles area, I must have missed it.  The whole joke went over my head. I even though maybe Jada was considering G.I. Jane remake or something. I think the train left me, "That train is never Late".
Can’t wait till chappelle gets his hands in this one lol
I'm Always suspicions about blond black people
Who are either one of those women?    ----
With similar hair length, she definitely had the similar feeling.
...So she considers it none of her business yet she's pro-slap?
Yeah this lady opinion don’t matter I watched this for no reason
Chris should file assault charges against Will
Tiffany with an L response
Shes destroying her own profession.. dark time for comedy
We speak what’s in our heart and our actions will be seen in the outcome of our kids.
Damn these celebs really defending will!
Lame response.Where else in the world can you walk on a stage,assault a person and you’re not arrested. only in Hollywood
The way she interprets what has happened is the "road to hell" no one would feel safe.
What??? Call her a homosexual??? Cause she’s in the military?? Cause she has short hair??? I hate to tell you but my wife has short short hair and no one has ever called her a homosexual ..  I’ve had guys hit on my wife right in front of me.... but never ever call her a homosexual cause she has short hair…this whole situation was handled wrong.. not saying I like Will Smith’s wife but short hair on a woman is sexy… she should have played it off better… just goes to show you what kind of person she is.. and what kind of person will smith is… I hope they take back his award…period…
Can't believe people are being so impartial here.  Yes, the joke was tasteless but Will Smith is 100% wrong.  Assault is still assault when done by a celebrity.
1:22 Tiffany haddish said....SumTimes u jus need yo face slapped  Shes rite
it's never ok to hit someone 😒
It is ok???
No brain, stupid woman tell will to discipline his wife
Who gives a shit
FULL UNCENSORED WILL SMITH SMACKS CHRIS ROCK: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT5P92pcVfE&t=10s
Its assault and Will was wrong it was just a light joke if he had made entanglement jokes then i could see an issue thats messed up and both will and Jada are mentally unstable apologise to Chris will he needs to sue your ass..
What a sad situation. Will showed how a narcissistic entanglement  "marrige "will  cause you to do really dum things. Will showed how insecure he is as a man. His actions was not in relation to his wife it was more about him defending his ego. 😐😐😐😐😐😐😐
She’s wrong and so was Will. His Ho ain’t worth no slapping nobody
Will smith is a broken man and a coward. He sucker slapped a man who had his hand behind him. If it was Shaq that made that joke theres no way silly Smith would have got up from his seat. Why didn't he stay after the sucker slap? Why walk away and go and sit down and start yelling trying to be intimidating? Whar a joke! All respect gone out of the window. What a messed up family and to think that children watch that. Disgusting! Rocks joke was out of order but i have heard worse from other comedians.
Let's bring the n word back, enough proof that the word can be used legit.
Chris need to either sue or sick some goons on will fact
“Sometimes discipline needs to be administered”.. Yes, even though Will Smith had valid reasons to be mad, the way Will handled it imo showed lack of self-control, lack of civilized behavior and therefore LACK of DISCIPLINE and was so foolish because millions of people saw the incident and many may think that because Will Smith decided to handle it this way that it somehow means that “violence is the answer”.  And even though slapping someone is a minute form of violence, it STILL makes it appear to millions of people that violence is acceptable, so Will Smith hopefully is held accountable for how he presented himself.  If Will Smith at least just yelled something from the audience (like he did after) instead of getting up on stage and trying to fight, even that would’ve been much more appropriate in my belief since he’s at least “using his words” even if they aren’t well thought-out.  And saying slapping someone across the face is a way to “discipline” someone is just ignorant because what does that teach them? Nothing.   I don’t think slapping someone helps them become more consciously aware..
Tiffany who?
I want to know why this reporter called her dress a costume when typically they ask “Who are you wearing?”, and refer to their outfits as pieces or gowns. A costume seems super micro-aggressive, and I’m so please Tiffany cleared this WW. Don’t come for someone and ask surprised when they show up, and unannounced at that because the reporter was SHOCKED she not only caught the shade, but without missing a beat éthered her without cussing, without violence, and with love.
Shows the "comedian" side of her, don't it...
Well that's a yikes
Period Tiffany
She thought that discipline should be administered but didn't say anything about Will Smith not being escorted out of the venue when his action is worse than Chris. Oscar loves to champion equality and yet they haven't escorted him out and take him to a suite just like what they will do when it was done by a person that isn't as famous/big.
The fact Will was laughing at the joke and went and did that a few seconds later after Jada made that face shows how toxic that women is. It was a shityy joke, Will is an amazing speaker and is funny too, he could've got Chris back on the acceptance speech with something witty and funny of his own.   Instead he walked up and slapped a man for a joke! light joke! Respect for Chris Rock for being a professional
She’s friends with the Smith’s so I’m not surprised
Lmao  Imagine being a whole ass comedian and getting offended over a joke (that wasn’t even all that offensive considering how dark jokes can get it)
her opinion is in favor of Will bc hes higher on the Hollywood ladder
I support Will, he stood up for his Wife. Chris Rock had no right to tell joke about someone’s wife making fun of her health problem, which is why she lost her hair. Anyone against Will must let people talk bad about their wife/girlfriend and don’t defend them or anything. Says a lot about y’all. You don’t sit there and joke about someone’s wife and make fun of her Cancer. And y’all will never know how it is as a black woman and the stuff they have to deal with, making fun of her hair is something that is off limits. And incase yall didn’t know Will & Chris made up after the show, I don’t like the fact that y’all are talking so bad about him when he’s literally defending his wife, Chris rock knew what he did was wrong and made up with Will. It says a lot about y’all that you’re against him protecting and standing up for his wife, makes me think y’all let people talk bad about your women and treat them any kind of way.
Consequences for your actions. What consequences did Will Smith have?
No more Oscars for Will. I’m sure if someone bigger than Chris was making the joke, he would not have slapped him. Remember he’s a scientologist who believes in aliens and not God, which is an abomination to God. Put God first and everything else will be added.
Just lost all my respect for Tiffany.. violence is not a fkin punishment to ensue on someone girl…
I need Google to find out about this woman  But, I won't.
It's funny how she's a comedian and acts like she never made an offensive joke of 5th Harmony before.
reprucations for hes actions,,,, so now when will decided to put hes hand on rock, humiliate him and slap him infront of the whole world, its fine if rock just kills smith right? cuz i mean you just said it, reprucations for your actions,  (im pretty sure all it would take is for will to tell him not to joke about it) and ask him to say sorry shitt would have been good,   but instead he had to go up there and fucking slap him, XD  i hope every famous person takes after this so next time anyone makes a joke someone slapps the shitt out of em every time,
Will, with a sassy slap, trying to prove himself again to his cheating wife. That's a whole emasculated man-child package right there. No wonder she cheats!
All we can say is” SO TYPICAL “…..
Now the damn comedians are too sensitive... Welcome, we have reached the end.
What a daft woman
Who???
Just imagine if that was a WHITE person SLAPPING a BLACK person at the OSCARS or WILL SMITH slapping a FEMALE on live TV?  The LAWS apply to everyone! Yet Will Smith walked away with an award at the end of the night. WHY???
She a hypocrite,she a stand up comedian ,she wouldn’t feel good if she made a joke about “THE ROCK”and he came up on the stage an slapped her..it would’ve been a whoooooooole different situation…she a hypocrite an In some sense a sellout
Absolutely absurd 'sometimes discipline needs to be administered ', would she be comfortable with her man slapping her if she needed disciplined??
Wake up people
G.I  Jane was not about a lesbian at all. Was about women in the military & how they used 2 b looked down upon by the insisted men.
Will smith's such a sensitive female like his son.
Love love..and tiffany put that bitch in her place too
Ok so what’s is sooo bad about being referred to gay!!! I thought I’d was the ‘woke’ Oscars!?! And condoning violence… I am sorry but just NO..
The oscars are full of low quality people nowadays.
Tiffany seems down to earth and brutally honest as hell. Respect
As a comedian, Hadish should be disturbed at a situation of a comedian being assailed while working.  If she had been smacked in her sassy chops on live tv, you can bed she would NOT give a shit about a man sticking up for his woman.   She would be mumbling something like “Bitch need a man to stick up for her.  Bitch need to stick up for herself.”  And anybody who thinks JPS “took care” of her man” that evening has not the slightest idea of how a breaking marriage works.
Hopefully she gets slapped one day for a joke.
Yeah assault. At an award show. Totally professional. Will's a clown.
All jada's boyfriends must be so proud of will for standing up for their woman
discipline every comedian in the world in that case.  guess Will gets to decide....
Anyone who hasn’t been living under a rock for the passed two years knows that Chris Rock could have went a lot harder with jokes about Jada (and Will for that matter), but clearly he chose not to. The general public could have, and has, made much harsher jokes than that G.I. Jane bit. That Joke didn’t warrant a slap. I feel like Ricky Gervais and Dave Chappell (and possibly Bull Burr) would have come up with something much more out of pocket. They probably would have went straight to the “your wife doesn’t even love you” jokes. Chris was being nice.
It is sad that the most beautiful  thing she has seen is an act of violence  with a  suckered punch smh
Too much dumb money 😂
whoa😯  She said, "sometimes discipline needs to be administered" Over hurt feelings?!🤨 And didn't she speak about mental health issues and abuse in her own family?  Sad
it was a joke bruh rock need to sue the acadamy and will not for th money but to send a message
B needs to F off about her feet, like she choose those shoes. We did not come here to talk about her aching feet.
As a Coach I highly recommend that you don't take advice from Tiffany Haddish, just saying. #stayhealthymyfriends
if your ashamed for your bald head, just wear a wig!!! Its just a joke. People with glasses gets bullied to. Its just a joke!
Chris and Will have a beef for years because Chris Rock has made Will and Jada the butt of several joke in bad taste. If Jada had just shaved her head it would be one thing but she has been struggling with a medical condition and now shaves her head for that. It's like making fun of someone going through Chemo.
How hard is it just to say No Comment.
EXACTLY.  Sorry, good on you Will Smith. That's his wife. That's a man.🔥 Chris looked like he wanted to cry: although, so did Will. Jada was the only one that looked like a  Boss. Lol  I know I'm essentially alone on this sentiment based on everyone's responses/reactions lol, but it's a hill I'm willing to die on. It SHOULD have happened and then he should have also explained himself and why, with an apology for losing control in that setting. But sitting there and allowing it to be done while his wife was obviously bothered? Nope. I know for a fact I would have handled it the same way, and I also know my husband would have (and has already) as well.  The fact that his wife meant more to him than his "big night" at the Oscar's,  is honorable, even if he went "a little too far".   (P.S. Denzel is such a Wise Ol' Sage)
bruhh hollywood soft asf
Bad take. See John Leguizamo's response for the correct take.
Wait when was GI Jane become a insulting to women? I miss something?
Ghetto is as ghetto does.
I hope, nobody "disciplines" you, Tiffany.
Why EVERY SINGLE Oscars red carpet journalist has to be SO BAD? Gosh!
I don’t like her now
Tiffany best comment since this whole incident he deserved it thank you for not whitewashing it he deserve the damn slap
Chris Rock put out a whole about Black women and our hair, and our struggles. Chris’ joke was hypocritical and insulting. He deserved that molly whop Chris got on that stage.
Woke Hollywood trash
clown girl
" just a prank bro "
Wise woman
Boo Tiffany, I like her but I don’t agree with her condoning over sensitivity forced on comedians.  I’m surprised her being a comedian feels that way.      She’s probably hedging so she doesn’t piss off the Smith’s and get herself black balled from black movies.  😀In that case she’s smart ; obviously Will Smith has some real approval issues regarding his family and would likely black ball celebrities known not to completely be on board to his way of thinking.  🤯🥺🤨
nigga it was a joke about her hair and her hair alone stop boostin it, Will even laughed until he looked at Jada then he switched up
In a heart beat i think Will just lost many fans.   Thought he was above sinking to that level......sorry will that was a bad move brother and its tainted your very 1st oscar win.
Tiffany is friend with the Smith.Of course she will kiss their asses.
I hope all comedians that are out there will go after Jada now.I truly do hope so.
Is it just me or was the wrong person asked about this? 🤔
Could not have said it better myself!  Sometimes discipline has to be administered!
Insane that she wouldn’t be concerned with the notion of an audience member getting onstage and assaulting a comedian, for a joke they did not like, while they were working. Every comedian should be outraged.
I love her!!!!!!!! ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Violence is always the solution 😂
Calling a woman GI Jane is “a way to call her homosexual” but what’s bad about that? It’s not an insult
Tiffany is confused. GI Jane was a positive movie.  Tiffany do better.
I went to school during that time. I don't remember G.I. Jane being used as a homosexual slur. I remember in the movie it was a moment if empowerment for her to shave her own head. It was a moment of camaraderie to adapt the look of the other trainees. It was a statement to the command that she's not there to cause a spectacle, she's there to train and graduate. Shame on these actors for trying to condone battery on a comedian for making a joke. And shame on Tiffany Haddish for praising Will Smith and trying to paint a homophobic picture of G.I. Jane and the moral of its story.
Nah, She a woman. Obviously she's on GI Jane II side.
Tiffany is so fake
I think she missed the joke, the joke G.I. JANE was made because of the buzz cut jada has due to alopecia, which she’s joked about too before but has nothing to do with her sexuality lol
“Repercussions need to be administered.” Yeah, Chris Rock needs to press charges.
Thats the way the hood works, it ain't no thang in the hood. And thats what the Oscar's are now.
Brand new low
Will smith' tells Rick welcome to earth
What a bs gi for woman is honor she was strong woman in the movie BS
I can’t wait to see SNL this week!
So, we can physically assault comedians now and call it discipline?  Saweet, where is her next gig?
Take it down a notch. That had nothing to do with sexuality. She had short hair. The joke could just as easily been done to Tiffany.
Thank you, Tiffany 🫶 Keep speaking the truth with love.
So she as a comedian never offended anybody??
terrible interview
Smart stay out of it Tiff
Tiffany looks like she just came from the Aqua-man 2 shooting.
Tiffany saying how she won't say anything unless it's her business means she learned from the Who bit Beyoncé incident. Good on you girl.
Coming from a "comedian" bald snatch
Nah nah, the joke wasn’t cool, but Will’s reaction was unacceptable, just like the example she gave of how women with short hair were considered gay, the fact she justifies his reaction shows she nitpicks unacceptable behaviour however it suits her.
Love how she answered so good hahaha
I dont see it like many of you all. That was a poor joke.. out of all the things that Will n Jada have gone through and is going throuh..being their choice or nor... they are taking a lot...mental build up is real.. but this woman losing her hair and it will never grow back... man.. who knows what the conversation are  like at home..defending his Wife regardless of what they been  through is key... but society passes by that...like the saying goes..where you  ACT up is where you gone Get F-up....comedian or Not... people are tired of other people putting their name in their mouth.
GI Jane was a way of calling a woman a STRONG woman.  Not an insult https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHRKZ69leE&t=20s
Who is this nobody … katt Williams
Wow life is a negation...what people complain ...I'm saying it black people are turning into leinin and stroksy ...Russia.. animal farm....the book ...where the communists win and then start a ing just like the tears ...they are turning into what they hated of there oppression ... hypocrisy...
I'm sorry, it's not discipline. It's assault.
Tiffany doesn't have much going on up there, does she?
Celebrities have very very fragile egos & strong sense of entitlement. How can anyone watch these disgusting people?
The unfunny ghetto ratchet is on again - can someone turn of the camera on this loud a woman
NOTHING NOT ONE WORD FROM.CHRIS YET
The reporter about to get smaked
Next time I hear somebody talk about demestical violence against woman i'll give the same dumbass answer.
Come on Tiffany you're a comedian. Do you want people to limit your comedic range?
🤦🏾‍♂️ Tiffany Haddish sound like a damn fool.
People always judging and probably they have a long time fight between them and will smith reacted!! The world is not for faking it all the time!! Sometimes you need to stop faking how you feel about things and express how you really feel. People are so use to fake people smiling and saying everything is good when nothing is good inside them. If you don’t like something say it and that’s all!! They have never like each other. Chris should shut his mouth!!
I didn't understand what all of you did from her interview. "What do you think about when Will came on the stage and offered a mia culpa to the Academy?" Tifanny answered "Sometimes discipline needs to be administered. There are repercussions for your actions". I think she meant that Will will need to pay up for what he did, slapping Chris on the stage of the Oscars on live TV, no matter his appology. She said that Chris's joke was a bit fucked up and that Will will need to pay for his behaviour, at least that's what I understood.
Tiffany….you ready….looking like 🔥……and speaking like a queen! 💯!
I didn’t realize I could slap people for insulting me. This whole time I’ve been practicing self restraint and picking my battles wisely. Oh wait I’m not idolized or wealthy.
Ghetto....
Privliged millionaires can do whatever they wish to whoever they wish anytime they wish. get over it.
Oscars.. a it is a show where jews give awards to black people :)
What on Earth is this lunatic talking about mumbling just another Hollywood lunatic
TIFFANY IS F'D up !!!!!  TARD
Sometimes discipline needs to be administered? Chris is a COMEDIAN and these "roast" type comments have always crossed the line! Had that been Bruce Willis or Jim Carrey, security would have escorted them out!  Black Privilege, that is what that was!
"(the joke) was a way to insult a woman...it way a way to call a woman a homosexual" okay then.
I agree with her. Making fun of someone with health issue they can’t help, is crossing the line. It’s like making fun of someone with Down syndrome, someone who is deaf, someone who can’t walk, and you can say oh “have sense of humor” all you want, until it’s you or your loved one the joke hurt. By Jada doing what she did, she inspired so many women that it’s okay not to be perfect. She should be made fun of for that. Just saying.
Lest we forget how Will Smith became famous...he literally launched to fame because he played the lead in a TV show wherein he fat shamed and insulted his co-stars on a regular basis, every episode. And the jokes weren't written by the shows writers, he came up with them on his own. He was so rude and difficult to work with on Fresh Prince of Belair that the first actress that played the mother quit and was replaced by someone else. Chris Rock was paid to host the Oscar's and he doesn't have control of everthing he has to say. They both should understand that in entertainment you say things that are uncomfortable at times because they are both comedians and have both done it often throughout their careers. If Will would assault a well known comedian and host on live TV, imagine the real person he is behind closed doors. Will turned down the role in Django Unchained because he said "he doesn't condone violence." He's obviously a "do as I say, not as I do" type of person. Of all the ways the situation could've been handled, Will is the one that chose violence...period. Will Smith's hypocrisy apparently knows no bounds.
Comedian goofs on someone in the audience and gets slapped. At least we know Will hits like a bitch 😂
What stupid people did not understand, is that comparing  her with GIJane was actually a compliment for her baldness. In that movie, Demi Moore was just amazing, as a powerfull, strong and beatifull, despite her baldness. That is what Chris wanted to say. But small minds took it in a different way, and that was it. He just made a joke with the wrong person. Chris is a gentleman, sorry Will, you need some education.
"It was a way of calling people homosexual"  But... we know Jada isn't (she definitely likes men, we know that much). It was a joke. Apparently jokes are justification for physical violence now. When did this become acceptable?
Just know Will laughed at the joke before he saw his wife's face expression.
Tiffany look like she was bout repeat will at the end
Miranda priestly voice; "You're fired."
Bro was it fake or not?
Imagine a woman was slapped ....offff woke mob has weird hypocritical standards eh ? He could swear thats fine but physical abuse to someone is never ok, he lost his cool unfortunately even tho he is a very loved actor. On one hand I can see how he might have been dealing with some issues but on the other...no, its not ok that they let him give a speech. If he apologised to Chris Rock and he accepted I think everyone would be ok with it.
And this is why this woman has no man, she is all kinds of ignorant.
who is she?
SO MANY FOOLS BELIEVE THIS FAKE AZZ SLAP
Oh so now Hollywood has moral
Dont know who this women is but clearly not very classy if she condones hitting a comedian
People are so sensitive to any kind of ‘correction’ to someone else’s behaviour. Ooo don’t do it in public! THATS WHERE IT OUGHT TO BE DONE WITH WITNESSES AND EVERYONE CAN LEARN FROM IT. You talk about someone’s wife, use her as a joke to fill a couple seconds of your performance, when she has what is a very emotional illness- I know from experience how hard it is to even go into public with alopecia...Chris Rock himself did a documentary about women and their hair...he should have remembered what he learned when he made that film. No you can’t get away without paying a price sometimes when someone (Will) has the fortitude and fearlessness to feed you ONE slap for your transgression. That was restraint on his part, maybe not the right thing to do, but certainly NOT the wrong thing either. I’m proud of Will Smith.
Criiiiiiiiiiiiinge
Tiffany looked like she wouldnt flinch before slapping ms green. Shes in the business! Lol
Going from throwing punches to crying in no time is sus. Seemed like a manic episode.
The award given to Will Smith should be withdrawn at once for his vile temper and disgraceful behaviour.
Homosexual? I never heard GI Jane exemplifying a woman being a homosexual. Where the hell did Tiffany grow up?
She right!!! Everybody using the word assault or calling him a monster is just ignorant and racist lol y’all don’t know what jada might struggle with behind closed doors. He shouldn’t have hit him but have some more compassion for everyone involved. Chris will be okay and is okay
will smith is a joke chris rock has my respect aswell
Love love Tiffany’s reply!
Tiffany haddish is scared of saying anything about this you will not get nothing on this from her she's funny and all that but you know you got to watch your ass
He should have looked for you . You love violence I see others hurting other people
Tiffany talking bullshit. Nothing gives another man the right to slap another grown man. Two wrongs don’t make right
These ugly fish smelling humans have way WAY overvalued themselves.  They are just emotional fish smelling people who are clueless
Isnt she supposed to be a comedian? I lost all respect for Tiffany Haddish. What a stupid take. Hitting men is not a courageous act of feminism.
So liberals condone black on black violence. Lmao
Tiffany Haddish is a good actor and does some great comedy. She in her own words said, "Will protecting his wife was one of the most beautiful things she's ever seen in her life." I will remind her that she was verbally and physically abused by a former partner of hers and has openly talked about it. No one should support what Will did especially a woman. Women are killed, assaulted, visciously and verbally abused by dudes like what Will just showed he can be. I feel bad for all comics because America is a copy cat society and this is about to turn ugly, nothing will be done until someone actually gets hurt. Again love Tiffany but supporting unprovoked violence is maddening to me especially the stigma we are trying to discard as black men.
#takeoscarback
"It's kind of messed up" So is every joke done by every comedian on stage and even in cartoons, but you don't see people slapping every single one of them. *Edit* Oh my. So many opinions on the SLAP heard around the world. I myself and I'm sure most of the planet as well have an illness or two but to respond in such a way over a joke is at the end of the day not ok. Just be a gentleman and deal with the issue in question after such an event instead of on live TV. Jokes are jokes. Some are good, some are bad, some offensive, some clever. Comedians should know their audience beforehand. I suppose we can break this down in every which way possible atm but it really comes down to those involved. We are simply the spectators. We must therefore wait and see how they handle this.
People really defending that BS
Will Smith needs to get his Oscar’s revoked because at the end of the day this is a huge night and everybody around the world is watching and to do something like that is so out of place. Chris Rock is a comedian and Will knows that he’s been in the business for over 30 years he should know better there’s no reason to react that way especially when you have a open marriage the way they do and they act the way they act sometimes they should know their going to be easy targets for jokes.   Just like Ricky Gervais said a few years ago I don’t know the exact quote he said when he hosted the golden globes five times in the past but it was something along the lines like although there are certain things that are off limits when it comes to certain jokes he said all in all celebrities need to sit down be quiet and keep their mouth shut because they’re just a whole bunch of over paid babies that need to grow thick skin that’s the least they should do.  Also I feel bad for all the international guests that were in attendance who had to witness something like that at our most prestigious film award especially for the Japanese crew of Drive My Car who all about respect and manners. Especially when international countries have already a perception of americans as well as people of color this might just further confirm to the perception they have of americans already.  Side note: there is a code of conduct and the academy is already debating whether to revoke his Oscar or not. Because this it not the behavior that is accepted or tolerated at any award show unless it’s part of the skit or script.
Y esta es mi historia pongan atención,  de como mi vida se transformo.  Cambio de arriba abajo, lo que nunca pensé y llegue a ser príncipe de  todo Bel-Air.
Chris could have continued to roast Will, especially after that moment, and then what would he do next?  Chris is s class act for how he handled the moment and the moments after.
this lady should be smacked on her next stand up because she said comedians deserve it for telling a joke.
Hollyweird of course covering for Will Smith, team Chris Rock all day
why people say assaulting it was a slap lol people is so dramatic
would've been awesome if Jada got up there and smacked Chris.... what man slaps another man?
Comedian telling a comedian to be careful of jokes🤦🏾‍♂️
She look high as hell
Chris handled it very well and much respect!
Nonsense.. people are just becoming too sensitive.. now short hair is shaming?? Disgrace.. celebs really are puppets
Will smith OPEN marriage  but not open jokes.
Yeah. "Punishment needs to be administered". Now, let's get Joe Rogan on that stage and have him say the same jokes. Hell let's have him do worse and see if Will Smith leaves his seat. I would have loved to see that. Will would have had his entire face rearranged and Rogan would have continued on his wife. Gotta pick your battles cuz a real man woulda annihilated Will and kept clowning. That's what comedians do
Love her reaction
Oscar is dead. No more good and epic movies, only woke media and black/gay/alien artists.
The only person that doesn't respect Will Smith's marriage is Jada.
'I don't talk about people business unless I'm in da business'.... literally right after you just got done giving your 2 cents about the  whole ordeal
How about talking to Chris before taking  Drastic measures.🤫
I love Tiffany
Well I doubt Will Smith can keep other men out of his wife's mouth.
thank u
This bih😑
So disgusting. 🙄
Y’all soft that joke was funny 😂
She said it was nine of her business but basically gave 👍 to Smith. Also did an Italian stereotype voice. But if an Italian person did a "black" voice 💩 hits the fan. 🙄
He didn’t care about the joke, he was just defending his wife’s boyfriend’s honour.
She’s also really good friends with the Smith family lol
We are suppose to be classy,respectfull and proper.Not getto that's so on call for Will dam!!!!
Cringe.
So, she supports toxic masculinity? These people are so confused.
Sometimes discipline needs to be administered ??? Ok then everyone can just smash everyone else whenever they feel insulted. Next time one of your jokes offend me imma come find you and discipline you Tiffany
*Only sellouts agree to black on black violence*
Dam right! Watch your dam mouth Chris! Insulting a black queen and king in private or public platform has consequences.
Says Tiffany who happens to be a comedian let's hope she doesn't make a joke about some and gets slapped across the face.
It figures this black thing has to turn it on to Chris Rock..If there were consequences for their actions you ding bat will smith would be banned..OMG ask a black woman this question? Theyt just dont see the world the way real people do.
Will was Wrong
White people seem to be a dying breed
The Affirmative Action Awards prove all the stereotypes about the black community are right, they ruin everything they touch.
This is what happens when side's get picked. All logic and sense goes out the window
I don't know where to start. First she says she wants to have sex with an italian guy to get peoples attention....then she says Chris Rock embarrassed Jada by implying that she's gay because of her haircut....seriously think about it....her thought process is "Ugh, how could Chris make people think Jada Smith is gay...thats wrong...its not ok to be gay why would you call someone that..." Is it that bad to be gay? That's her perspective. HOW DARE YOU CALL JADA GAY THATS THE WORST THING YOU COULD CALL A PERSON. I'm not gay but if I were I'd be pretty pissed off that she thinks calling someone gay is crossing the line when THAT WASN'T EVEN THE CONTEXT OF THE JOKE IN THE FIRST PLACE. IT WAS A BALD JOKE NOT A GAY JOKE. And this idiot....dang he called her gay he should be slapped....jesus christ does anyone like this woman?
I hate black people defending black people when it CLEARLY was assault
Yes 👏🏽 Tiffany. Thank you.
Ohh Tiffany she's getto  anyway
How is this chick famous. Katt Williams was right.
Oscars is a joke if they don't take back the award
She said it the best
Facts
I don’t understand the idea of protecting somebody that cheated on you.just look like a SIMP 🤣😂🤣🤦🏻‍♂️.she literally just had a rappers private in her 👄.
00:47 - BS. it wasn’t an assumption that she’s gay. Jada’s affairs with multiple men only point toward heterosexuality. the joke was about her looking like an Army Recruit in Basic Training. either way, it didn’t warrant a physical assault…it’s not like Rock brought up the Fresh Prince’s confirmed public Cuckolded existence.
Her voice changed alot
Alopecia isn’t that serious… joke about it. It’s hair loss. I have a far more serious illness and I can joke about it. Acting like he made a joke about her having cancer or something. It’s not that deep. He’s a comedian and Will has made some jokes that are worse over the years. I think it was an overreaction and they both should have shrugged it off, it wasn’t that serious.
Sad you can see in Will's behavior and Tiffany's answer that a lot of adults haven't learned to grow up.  This idiot mentality about "Discipline" and resorting to violence.. hitting people, hitting back.. it's really sad and childish.  There are a lot of people that end up DEAD and in jail because violence escalates.  On the streets, what do you think would happen if one man made a joke and the other hit him?  I live in Philly.. and people here end up getting shot over these kind of beefs.  Hell, a delivery driver hit someone over a parking spot, and the guy shot him three times.  Violence is NOT how you deal with these kinds of problems.. and stars like these should know better.    GROW UP and be better role models.  I hope Chris Rock presses charges.  I really do.  Sad and embarrassing.
FJB
She’s an after thought
Ghetto
Who would have thought, that a woman named Tiffany, was okay with such a regressive notion, as administering discipline through violence. Absolute shocker! /Sarcasm. Take the mans award and let him feel some discipline, he attacked a comedian on LIVE tv for f sake, got an award and went dancing.
So, Haddish thinks she should get slapped for poor or offensive jokes. Chris is big not to press charges.
I didnt even know the Oscars was going on. If it wasnt for this event i never would have thought about the Oscars. It could have been staged to get attention.
Will smith slaps someone and then gets embraced by all the celebrities…how disgusting
All a farce. So called actors who cannot even pull off pretending to take a joke.
Smfh. Ppl justifying violence. Unbelievable
The joke was insensitive and unnecessary but responding with violence is never the solution and in front of everyone! so embarrassing  I don't particularly like Chris Rock, but I admire how immediately after the slap he made a joke about it. If Will Smith had kept quiet about 'get my wife's name out of your fucking mouth' then things would have been less awkward for everyone. Especially for the nominees and the winners of that category. It would have been a lovely and beautiful night if it hadn't been for that moment. What a pity...
Will Smith is a jerk. Jada Smith is a liar. (She doesn't have alopecia, her hair and scalp suffered effects of too many weaves and extensions. Her perfectly straight line that she calls a "bald patch" is exactly where a weave is sewn on) Violence is never the answer.
Slow the slap video down Chris Rock puts his hands behind his back and leans slightly forward in anticipation. Staged at an actors event. Go figure.
People who think violence is the answer needs to get their heads examined.
You can bang my wife but please dont make fun of her ever so mild skin condition that she thinks is equivalent to terminal cancer.
She literally just talked about their business. Limousine liberals are so cringe
ALL THE WORLD IS A STAGE...BIG DISTRACTION FOR SURE
Soon there will be no such thing as stand up comedy we live in a world of sensitive snowflakes. there was no malice in what Chris said it's just his job as a comedian to push jokes to the limit.
I think we need more diversity at the Oscars 😀
i love her so much
Now Jada is what everyone is talking about... Will ruined a beautiful moment for questlove, for King Richard... nobody cares he won at the end of the day.
Oh brother. She is sooooooo wrong! Of course she’s on Wills side!  VIOLENCE IS NOT THE ANSWER!
If you dish it, gotta be willing to take it.
allready drinking the koolaid, brainwashed hollyweird
So the next time she tells a joke that offends someone, then that person walks on stage and assaults her…interview her then and see what she thinks.
My black people sad 😢
I disagree with her 1000%. She’s a comedian so she better not make jokes about anyone ever or according to her, they have the right to slap the hell out of her!!! Hypocritical!
Chris is the champ
Will right up there with Kanye now
She does too much at times. You’re taking about it, but it’s not your business. FOH!
# Chris Rock  Lives Matter
She’s 💯 correct
Tiffany ain’t gonna be working with Chris anytime soon .
If Will and Jada had walked away, people would side with them. But Will acting like a child with a tantrum made himself look like an incredible fool.
"Everytime black people want to have a good time, ignorant-ass niggas fuck it up!" - Chris Rock
Will Smith was laughing until he saw his wife mad, All because a joke about her Mange.
No you know how many people get talked about and laughed at on that stage and for will to think he can just walk up on stage like that and do that is something different if will and jada were white they’d be cancelled right now
Lmaoo
What did the police find when they dusted Chris Rock's face?   Fresh prints.
Remember folks, as long as yours or your wife’s feelings are hurt, physical violence is justified. THE MORE YOU KNOW.
All I heard is when she’s up then doing her lame standup and makes fun of someone it’s fine for someone to go up on stage and slap her! Repercussions right
Shameeeee
Will smith needed to realize sometimes doing nothing is how u be the bigger man
Good Answers Tiffany
@0:52 That joke that Chris did had nothing to insult a woman, or anyone homosexual.  If Tiffany Haddish was sitting in the audience, and Chris Rock said 'love you Tiffany, I see the rest of the outfit but where's the green lattern ring' .   It's a comment to the look you brought tying it to the film industry you both work in.   Nothing humiliating about what he said to her.  As he's initially saying it, you're thinking wow, is she going to be playing the role of a female soldier pretty soon.  It's not condescending or hard to believe Jada is the lead role in G.I Jane 2.  Jada had little to no hair in the Matrix franchise, where she plays an underground militant.  However it made little sense to reference the Matrix 4 because she's plays the role of a much older character with a full head of hair who's risen to the pinnacle of leadership.
Will smith smacked Chris Rock harder than the 8ball jacket guy on the NY subway
"Sometimes discipline needs to be administered"🤣🤣....... "it ain't none of my business" lol Love her!!! She's hilarious
What Chris said was way less insulting than what Jada has done to Will. She's absolutely evil and I don't feel bad for Will because he just let's her do whatever she wants with other men and is still a dumb simp who can't just do what he should have done a long time ago. Kick her ass to the curb.
That reporter made a mistake and try to recover from it. There is no need for her to take it that far she looked ridiculous acting so much like a bully. People make mistakes including reporters who are having a long night not there to be glorified in their fancy dress of what money looks like
Where was all this outrage the last 3 decades when constant jokes were made about Michael Jackson's auto immune disease vitiligo?
I don't care for her overreacting defensiveness and drilling that reporter who had a long night or her train into a fully either. It's rest might have been beautiful for her attitude was not
Will need to handle his business at home I’m just saying
Her comments are ignorant..and that dress is GAUDY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Chris's comment about G I Jane was to point out the shaved  head...nothing more...
she just sounded very ignorant ....as a fellow comedian
I GiVe ChRiS ReSpEcT CuZ I WoUlD HaVe BeAt WiLLs Ass On StAgE DaMn It MaDe Me MaD I WaS GoNNa JuMp In.... JaDa NeeDs To StOp LiViNg In ThE MaTrIx....SMH GuEss ShE WoNt Be In GI JaNe 2...
What the hell is she talking about? I was also alive when GI Jane came out and butch lesbians weren't being called GI Jane. Demi Moore has an absolutely insane body in that movie, and looked amazing.
She’s talking shite. Disgraceful.
wow my take on GI Jane totally different that Tiffany..... I thought GI Jane indicated a strong women.
Chris is doing his job, to roast celebrities as a host.
They pulled a ajussie
0:55 This almost sounded homophobic, yet the media didn't call her out because she is black.
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
FEMALE COMEDIANS ...
I just don’t think it’s really worth it to punch/slap someone over some narcissistic cheater that couldn’t give 2 fucks about you. But do you I guess🤷🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️
In school??? You only went through 3rd grade then on to ho ville
Chris Rock just earned my respect, he took all that with a smile, what a man he is. Will Smith may be going through a lot, but it could be argued that he brought that upon himself, and there is no justification for that shameful act. The fact that he did not apologize to Chris in that speech speaks less of his moral character.
We should stop calling people who are woke Karens. We should call them Will from now on. Here is why,  #1 all time Comedian vs Karens is Steve Hofstetter vs Hecklers   Now what Will did take #1 spot. So let’s call people who are woke Will from now on.
If that was somebody else they would have been tossed out of the Oscars. What a bunch of classless hacks Hollywood is becoming. It’s never Ok to attack someone physically because you didn’t like what they said. NEVER! Or at least that’s what us civilized people in society are taught! He assaulted someone on TV in front of the world and it’s looked over? Why? And what message does that send to others and what kind of society will we live in if every time someone says something you don’t like, you are allowed to assault them! Comedians can be tough if your the topic of their attention. It’s always been that way! We used to laugh about it!
Jada has ruined Will Smith
Yeah that's  a chicken head opinion
Tiffany had it looks lovely. And I agree with her.
Another horrid example of Black on Black Crime.... Where is BLM when you need them????
bint
This is pretty simple to avoid, tell the joke either laugh it off or just smile. Talk behind the scenes with each other and work it out, if you fight oh well as long as its away from millions to see. Will was wrong easily, chris rock jokes about everyone and pretty much everything. Example Peyton manning joked about Kevin durant being a snake instead of beating others he joins them, he didnt laugh at it but he did not slap Peyton manning either. Take a joke if it stings or hurts talk to the person behind the scenes if you can and either fight or talk it out. Dont care for the Oscars just care for the wellbeing of others. Hopefully will Smiths wife isnt being toxic behind the scenes causing stress from will Smith I dunno.
Chris make proper joke not ugly one, will must be punished niggaaaaaa
So if chris rock brother goes and beats the shit out of will, he should get that same respect right?  We talking about Family right, I mean actions do have consequences do they not.  Yeah that GI Jane joke was known to call women homesexuals not adulterers.  Big difference!
Chris Rock is a comedian. I cracks jokes, regardless of one's religion, medical state, mental state, w/e. If you can't handle it, then fuck off.
People - the Academy gave an Oscar to a convicted child raping fugitive. I think it’s pretty safe that Big Willy will keep his Oscar.
She's not beautiful.
Why does Chris Rock have to press charges for Will Smith to be charged for a crime committed in front of millions of people? That makes absolutely zero sense at all. There should be a criminal trial and a civil trial, and Chris Rock should not have to file anything.
Chris should really just tell arent funny instead. Thats what Amy schumer does and she still cohosted.
Wtf is she talking about
Tiffany Haddish: "Sometimes discipline needs to be administered"   Derek Chauvin: **nods from jail cell**
this b tryna bang Will Simp on the side
I love that Tiffany says, "It's none of my business" when the interviewer asks her to report back with more info. She seems very respectful.
Tiffany could not be more wrong in regards to dicipline needing to be administered.  There should be repercusions to WILL's actions if anything.
What a stupid statement.
UNCALLED FOR!
Real men do real things. Joking about a man’s wife health ain’t funny. Get slapped
Will Smith Is a real man :).
Chris needs to know where to draw the line, bet it won't happen again tho!
Wow. Are these people for real? They don’t want to insult will because he is a big star. Piss off, the man is 53 years old and assaulted someone for a joke
Tiffany is so adorable.
Loving how the left eats itself. Apparently assault is ok in this instance.
April fool's is coming up. it was a joke....😉
THESE PEOPLE ALWAYS BACK EACH OTHER UP SAD
People really think he slap over the joke alone but I think Will already had a lot of anger built up on the Jada topic that a silly joke like what Chris Rock did just set him off.
I lost a lot of respect for Will Smith. Not so much for the slap. Which could've easily been done off camera. But then he ran his mouth afterwards. And ten minutes later that same mouth was using God's name. Hypocrite plain & simple!
Bullshit stop the cap.
I see a lot of actors that are condoning will smith behavior. Just shows you how messed up most of these actors are.  Sad insecure people
#Adultery vs. #GIJane
Tiffany..a stand up... With no empathy for a fellow comedian... Only difference, she ain't as funny as she thinks she is
Repressed I would say 😂
Tiffany Haddish is ignorant
As a comedian I’m actually disappointed in Tiffany’s response
What a fine time to say you don’t talk about people’s business—AFTER you just talked about people’s business. Go sit down Tiffany.
Very disappointed response given that Tiffany is a "comedian"
I agree with Tiff
So, when is G.I. Jane 2 coming out?
There is a petition going to get will and jada out of all movies and television. They are a disgrace to us all, if that was a normal person and not a celebrity they would be sitting in jail right now but because hes a celebrity it's ok right? This family is a joke, they all need to take a plane ride in hurricane.
So according to her being called gay ( which wasnt what happened btw ) is such an insult youd be right to punch a person for even suggesting it ?
Damn a lot of dumb celebrities are losing my respect   I stand with chris 👋
Well will should did give Chris some more material to work with. “I got the shit slapped outta me by will smith”
Well next time Tiffany's doing stand up and tells a joke that somebody takes offense to and they slap the s*** out of her she can't say or do anything about it now because they are just applying discipline and if she reacts negatively to it then she's a hypocrite. Have fun setting that president.
I agree, Chris crossed a line. However, as a survivor of domestic violence (slapped like that before), I was triggered watching this live. Will should give the Oscar back. He ruined the show.
It’s funny how all the reporters are only asking the black celebrities about the slap.  Lolll
More power to Chris Rock for composing himself like a civilized human being 👍🏻 Anyone thinking that Will Smith was just "keeping it real" can kiss my a** 🤣 Plenty of people in prison or the graveyard could claim they were just "keeping it real" ... Meanwhile, assault and battery is still assault and battery and if you are that weak-willed/simple-minded that you can't handle something without violence, then you are a piece of sh*t at best ☝🏻Yet the Oscars and all those attending condone a criminal act apparently 🤔 Pathetic, unscrupulous invertebrates ... Security should have grabbed Will and escorted him outside to be cuffed ☝🏻 He also should be banned from the Oscars ceremony.
No chill will.
Birds of a feather flock together:  The racist bigotry of double standards discrimination of corrupt Hollywood, the sick USA Democrats mouthpieces are unacceptable on all levels.   Glad I didn’t watch the trash the Oscar’s have become and support. They are out of touch with reality the same as the entire Democrat Party Leadership they support.   Sad on all levels.
How is GI Jane even an insult? I would take it as a compliment..  its just a strong, physically fit  independent woman isnt it?
They need to stop interviewing these airhead
Will lame
Let tht would have been the rock will wouldn’t did nun
Don’t infer that Chris Rock was making a homosexual joke. It was a shaved head, Army joke. Period.
Shame on Tiffany! Calling someone GI Jane isn’t a reason to be physically assaulted. Calling someone lesbian isn’t a reason to be physically assaulted. There is no excuse for Will’s behavior. Period.
Will smith done messed up ⬆️
Anybody else notice that all the "women" clapping for Will Smith's actions are not the type of women you would bring home to mother or fight for?
Wow this is typical Hollywood sticking by the loser.
Stop joking about other people's privacy...especially in public...this is the point.
She’s cool in my book.  It ain’t my business unless I’m in the business. 😂
Stupid take. So anytime a joke is said that isn't liked, discipline needs to be administered? These are 50 year old men....
No longer a fan of this female comedian she's clearly one sided ..... Typical 💯🤣🤣
I'm gonna slap the shit of Tiffany if she makes a joke that offends me. In the name of love of course.
Look what happens when black people attend the Oscar's.
Its words it s joke like wtf if you cant handle othere people word dont log In the internet or out your house  Words are not action
I heard Chris Rock is Right Ear-ed.   🤔 😂🤣😅😂🤣😅
Love this woman so much!!!
Who is the reporter
Yes, Will could've handled the situation off camera but lets not completely dismiss the disrespectful joke by Chris either. Both parties were in the wrong and both need to be held accountable for their actions. Regardless man, you don't make that specific joke towards a health condition to publicly humiliate a person.
Naw Tiffany you out of line that's not how you act y'all are some immature little kids.
How can a comedian agree with this lmao comedians will remember this Tiffany
Thank you it was stupid on chris and he got slapped good job will
maybe Will felt like he needed to prove his masculinity after all the garbage Jada talked at the red table! However I think  she's taken advantage of his feelings for her because she knows he really loves her! But much respect to Chris Rock he handle the situation very well and made us laugh anyway! SMH
Of course she’s going to agree with ghetto behavior. 🙄
Thank you
Omg discipline you mean trash.
Oh Screw Yall! That's a man. Whose WIFE WAS INSULTED WORLD WIDE! I THINK HE DID RIGHT ! And CHRIS ROCK UNDERSTANDS, "HE WAS OUT OF ORDER! He did it openly, WILL SETTLED IT OPENLY! ONE, never know what a person is dealing with! Unlike the Whores and Pimps of Hollywood , THESE PEOPLE HAVE A LONG TERM MARRIAGE! It's called TRUE LOVE!! In a BLACK WAY! "BLACK JUICE"!
Ooooo I guesee america is not a free spech country
Discipline? Who is Will Smith to think he can discipline anyone with violence? If it were me in Chris' place, Will would be facing court time for assault. Will Smith needs to be taken down a notch from his self imposed pedestal.
Crack the rock he’a didn’t haven’t respect women
She straight up hood. that's raw hood mentality right there. i don't agree but she knows the streets.
Is anyone gonna talk about Venus Williams’ nipple slip?
If that’s how she feels about assaulting someone over a joke Maybe she needs to be in a third world society where that’s acceptable
Chris Rock should've responded with a punch.  Tiffany, is a moron, hopefully celebrities don't start rushing the stage to hit comedians.   Will Smith screwed up and he needs to man up for his BS antics. Such an embarrassment.  He should've just stood up and yelled at him.
I wonder if Will hit the man his wife was sleeping with like that
Damn🤦🏾I love will smith but he wasn’t in the right this time. Only person he should be mad at is jada or maybe august too but not Chris rock. Where was all that energy when she sat and disrespected you on live tv and had an “entanglement” with someone almost half her age. Tho at the same time I could look In his eyes and see that he’s going through it right now and probably isn’t acting as logical as normal. Big props to Chris btw for keeping the ball rolling despite the awkwardness that this incident created💯
Lol I noticed a difference between how black people viewed this and white people viewed this.
First of all, that joke clearly went over her head.. Second of all, of course she would condone it, she wants black men to do her bidding  on command as well, even over a stupid joke about her hair which will was laughing at until she glanced at him.
Solid Gold ✨🪙
What's crazy is that Will is probably the first black man to get a Oscar gor a good role   Not corrupted gangster, hoe, prostitute, house slave etc
She a comedian
What a strange entanglement
I just love her and the facial expressions!
What an assehole. You can’t hit people. It’s called assault and battery
I get totally his position but in the his professional field you have be and handle things professionally. Other wise everyone will be slapping people on stage in front of other professionals. Just doesn’t look good
Just another example of how much of these so-called Hollywood elites (which is a joke) have no sense of right vs wrong. Will Smith made a phsyical assault on Chris Rock. He could and should be arrested for it! So, next time someone calls me a name or makes fun of a family member, I reserve the right to punch them??? Is that it works? Get a clue Hollywood! You guys are a disgrace and should all be ashamed of yourselves! Every. Single. One of you.
Insecurity that’s what this is  On mr Smiths part  Others things seem to be bothering him  He needs negative attention  Wow !!!!
Awful way of handling your emotions by Will. Chris played it off so well on stage and I hate that that slap was seen as discipline, chris is a comedian and made a joke that people laughed at 🤷‍♂️
#GiJane2
Discipline!?🤣 Sheesh.
Will Smith just told America that violence is the answer. Award shows weren't like this before progressives changed the color of the show.
I feel like she needs to get slapped and get "disciplined" by a woman who stands up for her man. What a ratchet piece of work
Violence is OK if the rich and powerful do it
And she is supposed to be a comedian...
Tiffany Haddish is Wack!!
That’s right Miss Tiffany!💞🌸
violence doesnt justify the response though.
wtf fuck is tiffany saying. he was not even trying to call her gay. it was all about the hair.
What bullshit is she talking about
Tiffany if you know who you are you don't shit serious.  Discipline like physical violence is not how you want to show children is the way to handle comments you don't like.
I notice black women & everyone respond to this situation differently. All the black encourage assault, everyone says Will was wrong.
Will doesn't like the joke and now he will become a joke for all the comedian's punchlines. Oscar's next year will just be a boxing match. Whoever win will get an Oscar!
SMH lost all respect for will
Chris Rock got what he deserved. He probably needed a little more.
Chris Rock got what he deserved. He should have kept his mouth shut, Will Smith doesn't need to apologize to Chris Rock ,Chris Rock needs to apologize to Will Smith for making jokes like that
It’s a JOKE!!
God.. hollywood reporters are annoying.
Wrong.  He was laughing at the joke .  He has changed. Lost me as a fan. I have no respect for that behavior. Just think how many children are getting that same slap by someone. Not cool. He’s a bully.
*Chris Rock said he's not suing Will Smith for slapping him on stage at the Oscars. Shoot... I'd be cashing in on that sneaky assault.* 💰  *Someone tell these fellas that MIB are supposed to act better than that in private & especially during public appearances.*  *Will Smith: Now this is a story, all about how, my life got flipped, turned upside down & I'd like to take a minute just sit right there, I'll tell you why I felt compelled to slap Chris right there.* 👋🏿  *Chris Rock: Perhaps he would've preferred "How's yo baby Will"? 🤪 To fresh for a wasn't my poke that got Jada pregnant joke is what I was thinking but apparently they're not open to jokes PERIOD & only open when it comes to their relationship.* 🤷🏿‍♂️  *Well if you ask me I think BOTH should apologize that things got a little hairy at the Oscars this year. Plenty of opportunity for both to grow.* ✊🏿
She hurt by that joke to she should be asking why she was with another man lol
Hollywood in its entirety needs some "discipline".  Degenerate heathens.
How dumb is that comment! ... Back then woman had to cut their hair in the army.  Jesus would he be doing the same if it was someone white or  same size or with certain credentials [we understand what it means].  The simple answer is NO!
But if she was slapped it would be different tho
she is so classless and ghetto.
I wanted to do this to Kathy Griffin.
Aka violence is ok.
“Take responsibility for you actions” is a double edged sword, suppose Chris wanted Will to take responsibility by shooting and killing him? Would it be all cool then?
# WILL HAS THE RIGHT TO DEFEND HER HUSBAND lol
Smith didn't get arrested because there were no witnesses. No one watched the show.
# JADA GAVE WILL HER TUPAC PILLS BEFORE THE SHOW lol
Ghetto supports ghetto. Our finest, always on display.
# RAMBO  WILL there is war raging in europe they are looking for fighters
Chris is a comedian and came out a champ. Will just came across like a man who has issues.
People defending Will over a joke as if Ricky Gervais never ripped celebs for years !! Puny minds
I will never ever be convinced she's not gay!
Good for Will defending his wife🙌🏽🙏🏾
100% GHETTO
She couldn't had said it any better...
I don’t get into people business 🤦🏽‍♂️😂 practice what u preach
Fair game! Guess I can hurl water bottles at Tiffany Haddish's face on stage now when I deem fit her jokes offensive!
When are the media going to ask why Will laughed in the first place.
Welp... I hope she gets disciplined some day too since it's ok and completely normal🤷‍♀️🤦‍♀️
Tiffany talking like she isn’t a comedian and have never offended anyone with her jokes. The world has become too sensitive, it’s really hard to be right and funny  nowadays.
I heard you ..in school..and he was not attacking. It was a joke from a paid professionally rented for the night comedian and approved by the academy, but smacking someone is never approved and in that should be disciplined as well cause you know😏2 wrongs still will never make a right.
Will Smith is just pathetic
So you wouldn’t mind if someone you joked about came up and slapped you Tiffany ?
Jenn was getting nervous, she was like oh dang am I next.
She has a low mind if the words said meant retaliate with violence......after there was laughter might i add.   Low mind.
Gross.  Will Smith was a bitch for hitting Chris.  Period.
Will Smith is a fraud. Jada Pinkett Smith is a fraud. He's gay, she's gay. And their MO is promoting themselves as the 'enlightened' man, the 'enlightened' woman in an 'enlightened' heterosexual marriage BESIDES being BLACK! Puh! The Hollywood press has been wanting to call these two phonies out for years but can't for accusations of being discriminating because they are BLACK! Right? Now. Me thinks Will Smith, foreseeing an Oscar win could prompt the press to finally reveal the truth about he and his fraudulent 'enlightened' selves, JUMPS at the opportunity to forever dispel rumours that he is GAY by clocking Chris Rock over a tasteless joke about his wife. He goes into Straight, Angry Black Man Mode to defend the honour, the name of HIS woman before a live, international audience. The Academy Awards! I mean. Will Smith may have won an Academy Award for acting but what a loser for utilizing the ceremony as a shameless, marketing tool for his phoney self. Then again, in the context of this being the Age of Kardashian, Bravo Mr. Macho Black Man Will Smith! Aim LOW for the crowd and count the money. Note. During 93 years of the Oscars, you never saw a white man jump the stage to slug a comedian over a tasteless joke about his wife. Just sayin'.
Chris Rock could have owned Will Smith if he would have responded to Smith’s statement of keeping his wife’s name out of his mouth, by simply saying that he(Rock) thought that because of their open marriage, that if his wife could enjoy other men’s things in her mouth, that maybe she would appreciate the verbal aspects of other men as well!    Democrats will do anything to distract from the failure of the BIDEN CRIME FAMILY.
She tripping... GI Jane was about "female empowerment." Wish they'd make up their minds... the sequel will be GI Kane...
Haddish is beautiful!!!!!
And only animals resort to violence...
Ohhh So now men can be toxic lol. Chris is a comedian and ofc Will is such a huge act most of Hollywood will side with him. He wouldn’t have just slapped anyone either. All jokes should be allowed
Will Smith is not in good mental health. He's probably dealing with something inside him that we don't know. Although, props to Chris Rock for taking it like a man and professionalism.
Yes discipline needs to be administered, Tiffany you’re right, but not on stage honey.
Mark my words most people from the hood are going to validate his actions.
Now I'm not saying he should have slapped him... BUT I UNDERSTAND!  (upvote if you get the reference)
*some times disabling is nedded* hung Dat wasn't disabling fat was throwing a tantrum lol
Ya kna wa am sayin
Will is the puppet "Jada is the Puppeteer... Will Smith was laughing as you can tell in the beginning! Jada shrugs her shoulders & Rolls her Eyez! Will had to Impress Jada 👌 Who Wears The Pants 👖👖👖 "Jada" & 'will 👗👗👗 Pitiful Bitch Move, all for a Deceitful Woman "Low & Sad; I know if Jada wasn't happy about it because of cancer endorsements it most definitely should have been handled differently & in private...Kilo
Will Smith has turned him and his family into a bunch of clowns!!! good job Jada.
That guy in the green dress is hideous
Tiffany Haddish so if you offend someone you should expect to get slapped?  What is wrong with you?  Being offended especially if you are offended for someone else isn't a reason to assault someone, grow up.
imagine woman make a joke about man and then get slap.. world will collapse.. double standard
Sometimes a slap in the face is what you need to not do jokes about someone else’s health
Imagine if Chris said,  I make a joke about that and you slap me Man? What did you do to your wife after you found out? Sorry if that joke hurt but I hope you feel better about what your wife did.
No one asked her who she was wearing lol
Well then Will Smith need to face consequences of his actions. She is in the comedy business, she wouldn’t like someone taking offense of her jokes to come and assault her.
And she's absolutely correct
Yo
Will should’ve hit chris with one of his horns.. lol 😂
If a white slapped a black over that joke shed be calling for their hanging.
U would not be shit if it wasn’t for Kevin Heart ur not funny or a good actor.
Beyoncé told her to stop talking too much 😩
Its still not ok to Assault someone
“Discipline”? Making Chris sound like he’s  his son or a child, and even if he was, not ever okay. It’s straight up abuse. He did not have any right to put his hands on Chris. Period.
Black males being shitting all around.. one black male insulting a black female and another black male being violent ... It's amazing
I wish all comedians the best of luck….
Really. So it's ok to slap people around? Ok, then.
.
Commenting to break the 666 CV comments
I seen this had 666 comments so I'm adding 1
People are actually supporting will? Wtf
Will Smith is the biggest simp of all time. He thinks he's Pac with this fake thug bs but he will never be Pac. You're telling me that this clown is mad because Chris Rock made a joke about Jada, but he didn't have that energy for August Alsina when he made a whole song about sleeping with Jada.   He knew Chris Rock wasn't gonna do anything that's why he got up out of that seat, went up on that stage, and slapped Chris. I wonder if 50 Cent hosted the Oscars, and he would've said that about Jada; would he have gotten up out of that seat and gone up on that stage? The answer is NO!!  You witnessed premeditated assault last night. I believe he was waiting for Chris to crack a joke about Jada. Lost all respect for Will Smith after last night. He did some minstrelsy shit last night. I wouldn't be surprised if this was the last time you'll see Will Smith at the Oscars. Black Lives Matter ain't nowhere to be found with this one.
Queen!!!!!
"keep my wife's name out of your mouth" Meanwhile she had trouble keeping other dudes out of her mouth
Give me a break 🙄 Will could’ve talked to Chris back stage or spoke up and told him that the joke wasn’t cool. But to ASSAULT him like that? Ridiculous/uncalled for.
666th comment nobody fuck it up.
Tiffany is blonde now. She must be ready to level up and take out a Family member. #BloodBlondes
So she thinks violence is the solution in some cases. I imagine she is OK, for example, with Russia killing ukranians.
Tiffany is a Will and Jada minion.
State of her outfit she should get a slap too
What Will Smith did was very unprofessional I am against what he did and what Tiffany said.
Liberals are all over this one. Bout to take another Cultural L from across the aisle
Bro that’s so soft Chris’s job is to poke at things for a living. It’s fuckn hair get over it man we’re so shallow now
If i was Chris rock i would’ve beat the living dog 💩Out Of Will
Will did NOT Apologize to Chris Rock who he slapped. He apologize to the organization that could take back the Oscar statue. SAD.
Nope. Will was out of line. Hollywood is always roasting each other. There are many that said that Chris may not have realized that Jada has alopecia and made the choice to keep her head shaved.
Didnt slap the man who was sleeping Wid her though 🤦🏾‍♂️But Slap A comedian cus he made a joke about her
Funny, that movie was not about ANYTHING Homosexual.... it was a hair joke, and a bad one considering it's a medical condition why she is bald.  That women need to watch GI Jane again,  it's about women in the military having to complete the same PT req as a man... and the world that comes with it.  (BTW they did lowered the req so more women can join=equality now weaker military "PT req wise")
Proving she aint a comedian by her actions as well as her act.
Blah blah blah... wrong. He should have been arrested.
ridiculous! will smith so disappointing, well, no matter ur wife can wear a wig. or having hair plant surgery.. all the women wears wig anyways. those case u should not laugh at first. protecting family after ur laughing? hmmm.. still a question if that is protecting how u call. well will shit!
He mad him the joke
If Will Smith had slapped Tiffany Haddish for the same joke he would be in hand cuffs. I wish Mike Tyson had told that joke, instead of Chris Rock.
That was one of the stupidest things I ever heard cone out of someones mouth. Im also old enough to remember Gi Jane and no one was using that movie as a gay insult...hell no one even cared about it.
Don’t worry, her slap will come 👋 only then will she realise right from wrong
Will Smith is Violent Toxic Male.  Woke feminists and the media need to show that Toxic Masculinity is not appropriate today and they need to cancel this Violent Toxic Male !!!!!!
Such vapid dross, opioids for the masses
"Discipline needs to be administered."  Then rock should press charges againt wiil, or will should give a formal apology.
You just talked about their business tho? Lmao she just dumb
Ok, so Chris Rock got slapped cuz he called Will's wife a homosexual, got it.
Ricky Gervais *roasted* Hollywood to their faces at the 2020 Golden Globes. In a room full of snowflakes, no one got up and punched Ricky in the face. Chris Rock tells a silly little joke and Will Smith reacts that way. It says a lot by comparison. Smh.
I was the 1000 like just because I saw it was at 999 but I unliked it after hearing her talk. Someone else can feel special and be number 1000 now
I agree with Tiffany. She kept it real. Chris didn't have to go there. He new exactly what he was saying. People need to stop excusing comedians for making tasteless jokes. If Chris were to joke about babies with cancer, would that be okay too...just because he's a comedian?   Anyone can be a comic. So should we all make stupid jokes to hurt people - just because we can? I wished Will would've handled things differently. But he didn't. I'm not mad at him though. It is what it is.
As far as I can tell it was just a joke about her looking like the person from GI Jane. It wasn't a joke about her looking like a lesbian. And you shouldn't be insulted being compared to a lesbian anyway, So what if you have a hairstyle that is favored by many lesbians
Obviously Chris Rock Didn't See The Movie KING WILLIAM... Richard was Defending his Family the Entire Movie..  Public Disrespect.. Public Discipline..  Will Handled It Properly.. 👍🏿👍🏿
I LOVED GI Jane. The joke was soft. And Hollywood is a hypocrite for exusing assault when they feel IT'S NECESSARY.   Talking about Itallians with a fake accent over their food? Maybe she needed to get HER ass snatched.   Everyone needs to grow a set or shut the hell up all together.
Yup Tiffany speak it she's dope shebknows what to say don't try and play with her and get shit out of her nahhhh...love it!!!
Iaint u a comedian
Amazingly she approves of violence.. would she approves if Will Smith was a white male?
Wish it was me up there I'd start singing entanglement and shout out August Alsina 😂😂😂
Being a comedian doesn't make someone a special right to say whatever they want to say. How a human being makes such a joke towards someone who has been suffering a disease and is sensitive about it. Also, it is not right Will to slap Chris. But, he did it for wife. Will was smiling at first. But, probably saw his wife uneasy about the situation.
IT WAS A JOKE!
Jada got Will in some panties 🤣
Yeah let's defend a clearly unhinged person for assaulting a host at a television event because if you read between the lines he was calling her a homosexual and that's just not right.
Ghetto remark from a ghetto personally please!
👏👏👏
Hi Tiffany your a dope.
REAL BITCHES PLEASE STAND UP
IT WAS A FUCKING JOKE TAKE THAT SHIT
These are the Academy Award you wanted, these are the Academy Awards you got.
Very bad take.
She’s reading way too much into it. CR wasn’t insinuating anything about gay at all. I’ve heard worse a lot of times. Steve Harvey’s joke about Rae Carruth for sure.  Will probably called Rock later like “my bad bro u know I’m tryna save my marriage.” 😂
Comedians often exempt themselves beyond reproach because they lack  tangible boundaries and have lenient fans. Times have changed and although people are hypersensitive to issues in life, it doesn't give precedence for comedians to behave "Willy-nilly" on certain topics, especially if the issue has already been addressed.
Aight Tiffany. Next "disrespectful joke" u say, get ready for someone to slapaho! 😂
It’s all a distraction from coming food shortages people!
Is she drunk lol
https://youtu.be/JWkkvhnYrQw Chris knows the taboo! I felt that slap though!
Will smith should have been removed no has the right to put their hands on another
Discipline was administered 'God love her' ❤️
Tiffany 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
She's whack.
Free speech way I see it if ya dont like it change it dont play it shit come back with a roast thats why we in America not Russia dummies
Well, you’re a comedian so brace yourself for being slapped on stage if you offend someone!
COME ON GET HIM LIKE YOU TRYNA GET KANYE NO SLIPS IN THE COVERAGE NOW; WILL SMITH IS DANGEROUS AND UNHINGED AND OUT FOR BLOOD AND DID SOMETHING BAD AND SAID SOMETHING BAD LETS CANCEL HIS WHOLE CAREER!!! LETS END ALL THE GOATS OVER PETTY STUFF WHOS NEXT AFTER WILL? OH WAIT WILL GETS A PASS FOR BEING ACTUALLY VIOLENT AND COMMITTING ASSAULT ON STAGE AND GETS A REWARD HANDED TO HIM AFTERWARD BUT KANYE IS THE WORST AND MOST DANGEROUS FATHER FOR SPEAKING HIS MIND 🤣🤣🤡 KIM FANS AND PETE FANS AND TAYLOR FANS BURN EVERY WILL SMITH MOVIE YALL GOT AND STALK HIS PAGE WITH HATE COMMENTS COME ON THIS IS WHAT YOU DO YOU SHOULD BE EXCITED HURRY BEFORE THE WILL FANS SHOW UP AND RATIO YOUR FALSE NARRATIVE!!! CONTROL OF THE METAVERSE PERSPECTIVE IS AT STAKE, YOU PSYCHOPATHS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HURRY TO THE COMMENTS!!!!!!!!!!!
I love how she said repercussions for your actions... what about Will's actions? Bitch ass should be in jail for that. I'm not saying Chris' joke was tasteful or appropriate, it wasn't, but you don't lay hands on someone. Will Smith is a child and he proved it last night
Notice the interviewer was carful if she accidentally said the wrong thing she could be attacked cuz she thinks u should go straight to violence & yelling before talking. Chris was solid as a Rock, smith was a cold cocking crybaby B*tch at his speech
By that logic anyone who is offended has the right to smack you one. Well okay then, can't wait to watch someone smack her over..
Will Smith can't control his outrage over a joke but is OK with his wife cheating on him. What a loser.
No excuse for violence!!!
Well you wanted diversity, you got it. This birthing person is ok with violence and I'm sure these liberal white elites wouldn't do that but everyone is acting like this is ok.  Bringing the hood to woke Hollywood.  Props to my man Chris for keeping the hood out this and being the real man.
Girl, she did not just vouch for assault over a joke?? 💀 Tiffany Hadish you’re a comedian yourself girl. So how many punches to the face do people owe you then for making all those jokes? Apparently Tiffany Hadish supports physical assault, yall, y’all know what to do next time she’s on stage
She calls it discipline. Oh wow
The joke went over everybody’s head lol including wills
Blacks would've been banded for life if Chris rock would've hit Will back
Its funny how black women reacts vs white women. Black women: discipline approves violence, white women, intelligence respond non violence. It gets me thinking did this ever occur on the Oscars with two white men. If so they would talk it out.
No, its what real life is all about! Some things in life are NOT a joke! Keep poking the Lion but then stunned when your arm gets bitten off!! This just like when a Karen is being a Karen all day long but then that one person slaps the shit outta her!! You can not go through life thinking that words can not cut as deep as a sword!!!! In Real Life some people don’t play!   I would’ve smacked him myself, as Men he did what he had to do. It might be a joke to you but not to others. Before you judge Will Smith first judge your own relationships.
I m agree with her
Both jada and will clapping other men cheeks
Men roast eachother, soon as a woman get roasted men get all butthurt, Will a bitch.pl
Ok. Hopefully somebody smacks the dog shit out of YOU when you say something they don’t like. What? GI Jane was an insult? What? Wow. Woke kooks. Will Smiff should be arrested for ASSAULT. Period.
Of all people  of color  and so-called xomedian to interview. WOW!
There are very few decent people in the entertainment industry (movies, TV, music, sports).  This woman is not one of them.
Hold up, so calling someone homosexual is an insult now? Tiffanny you need updated PR training!! 🤣
She is really fake like if Chris Rock really wanted to disrespect you he would have said it straight not in a form of a joke he's a comedian your husband is also a comedian grow up
Love how real she is💖
If that were Eddie Murphy instead of Chris, what do you think would have happened? Popcorn , get your popcorn.
What in the hell is she even talking about? And no, he had no right to jump on stage.
Wow not a great response 👎👎👎
I just love her.
2022 top unforgettable moment 💥
Hollywood so mess up.  Some take Will Smith side on this.  So much dysfunction in Hollywood.
They're taking wills side? Good lord
She is 100% wrong.
A stand up comedian being okay with someone jumping on stage and assaulting someone. Well she better keep her mouth shut if that ever happens to her while doing stand up.
She should know it’s a fucking joke thought she did stand up
Code of Conduct: Take Wills Oscar and give it to Denzel. How many years have Jada worn her hair short or cut off like her daughter? Chris most likely didn't know about her condition. All of our efforts for inclusion goes up in smoke! Dude those people  watch these shows with their children. How are they going to explain your language and violent behavior to their children? Where do we as African Americans go from here? You didn't slap anyone on the other end of her entanglement(s) (Tupac, J. Lo's ex-husband Mark Anghony, August and others) but you slap a Comedian. Really Will? I'm angry by your behavior. You could have handled it later.  THE OSCARS WAS ABOUT MORE THAN YOU & JADA!
This is the best Hollywood has to offer. Man that’s terrible
Stupid chick she obviously is part of the cancel culture crowd.
People got opinions but I bet nobody make another Jada joke in Will's presence.
FREEMASON PUBLIC HUMILIATION CEREMONY. WILL IS NOW A WORSHIPFUL MASTER MASON, HOORAY FOR ALL THE IDOL WORSHIPPERS OF THESE REPTILIAN ACTORS.
Tiffany Haddish clearly doesn't understand the definition of the word "costume".  A costume is literally just a "particular set of clothing".  What a childish response
It's not fine. It's assault. And  its at the Oscars not high school dance
More black on black crime and the assailant doesn't get charged.
Tiffany should have been defending Chris as a fellow Comedian...
Learn to take a joke you snowflakes
I think the response is exactly what you’d get from a black woman. And that’s not a negative thing just that they tend to be headstrong, a man supporting her woman, and keeping out of beef between two men.
Will Smith is human garbage. he seems to think that violence against people who don't agree with him is okay.
Chris Rock should press charges and take that Oscar away from Smith. He is undeserving. Slap him him back where it hurts.
I hate will for doing that. Chris didn’t deserve that
That was the craziest thing I’ve ever saw they gave the fresh prince of Belair an Oscar
Never take advice from Tiffany, Chris wasn’t trying to offend her the way Tiffany was describing it.
Jada suffers from alopecia a condition that causes permanent hair loss. Chris was out of line.
This is fucking lame lmaoo
0:31  Tiffany wants ziti, not spaghetti.
Violence is very condoned and accepted by these people. Go figure.
All right answers Tiffany!! Especially that last one!!! 💥
I agree with her, will should have consequences like no longer being to work with bel air since it’s a show about consequences and it seems like will has none because he’s famous
Rock pick the wrong time
That shit ain’t the BET awards for real if Tiffany thought wills action was okay that shits not true & don’t pull the sex card damn I liked her too 🤦‍♂️
She looks so good omg
Go away
Tiffany Hollis have no problem breaking the law as she just got a DUI. Of course she doesn't care about assault and battery
Black with blonde hair??????? Not even the white girl has blonde hair.
Will Smith did more than tarnish his career nd humiliate another man. There is a faction of the country that portrays black folks as being violent and unable to control their violent natures. Will Smith gave them fodder to use against the black community. It was a cowardly despicable act.
What in tf is she talking about....not only is she ungodly cringeworthy but she shows why Katt Williams was right all along
What happened to all that toxic masculinity? Now it's ok to slap people over words.
Leave it to the ratchet 304 to excuse this kind of thing. This made Will look like an even bigger kitty cat by putting hands on a man that didn’t want to fight him..over a joke.
Tiffany has made so many jokes about people possibly being gay but the line is strong if Chris Rock says it. I wonder how she would like to be slept for some of the jokes she has made.
I love Tiffany my God❤️
No Will Smith wife was not in any physical danger. Violence was not necessary at all.   Will behaved more like an attack dog on his wife’s leash than he did a husband who is the head of his home. He was protecting her and his own very small ego.  Nobody want to hear all these feminist apologetics and revisionist  Anybody who thought that was ok is a Neanderthal. Comedians been ripping and running since the beginning.   I could never defend the honor of a woman who vehemently and shamelessly dishonors me and my family. Will is simp megaton
Imagine if one of us peasants slapped a presenter , just Imagine what would happen to one of us .....celebrity privilege?
She is messed up
Wtf isn't she also a comedian ?
Will, u need to quit Scientology. It's made u crazy!🤣🤣🤣🤣
Tiffany just made that up. GI Jane was a compliment of strong women breaking barriers. The I served with were empowered by GI Jane. Tiffany stop the 🧢
I love how complimentary Tiffany is right back. Whenever she's given a compliment, she sends it right back to the other side. That's how we all need to be! EDIT: I was just seeing a positive moment, not reading into it at all. Didn't mean for an argument to break out!
Why is it okay for blacks to have white people blonde hair but anyone wearing braids must be black?  Goes both ways.  They started it.  Will Smith is an idiot and seems Chris should have told the joke about her vagina redo then when Willy said keep her name out of his mouth it would have been funnier than it was.  Poor Will, breaking down after trying to make everyone think he's a nice guy.  Ha.
I couldn’t believe they all gave Will Smith a standing ovation after this. But I guess none of them want to burn any bridges with the big star. Kind of like how everyone looked the other way with Weinstein
What? It was just a joke. Didn’t have a bigger meaning . Chris rock did nothing wrong
In the end it's about Jada, we all know she would have been with 2pac had he not past. Now she's tainted innocent fun loving Will Smith who never cussed in his raps to sell records, always positive and turned him into 2pac. #FreeWillSmith
Next time you’re on stage Tiffany I’m sure the audience will be just as kind.
Will smith should have slapped august first if he felt the need to slap chris rock for making a JOKE because august didn’t joke when he fucked his wife & ima leave it at that.
Imagine if that was Kevin hart he woulda gotten thrown. “he got in ☝️ Lil fight cuz his wife’s hair, now he’s moving w. His aunt & uncle in bel air” Chris played that perfectly,of course he isn’t gonna file charges, 🤦‍♂️ will went from 0 to a 💯 real quick, that was open palm..I thought that was scripted honestly why wouldn’t they put a delay on that. Is this why white ppl r always running the oscars not a racial comment just gives white ppl & academy more fuel to not let black people host, win produce etc. dam I still can’t believe that was real. Chris has got a tough jaw tho
I talk about the business of SHOW biz. This became EVERYONE’S business when it was broadcast across the globe. These celebs are all liars. Pay attention: they’re always showing you exactly who they are…in plain sight and who they present/posture/pretend to be? Not who they really are.
Tiffany was fucked up 😆
She’s crazy.
Who is this?  Never heard of her.
She might be the only celebrity that respect that. Damn the smith family got her too.
Her statement is ridiculous!!
I like what Tiffany had to say. I'm glad she didn't play respectability politics, to make. Racists and bigots are happy. Chris deserved to be slapped but off stage.
Tiffany is full of it she's just covering for Will cause he African American cause if it was a Caucasian or Latino shed be all over it condemning it...
I’d like to congratulate Will for propagating black on black crime, that amazing acting on the fake apology, and for being so rich that laws don’t apply to you
It's called watch your mouth when in person. You never know what you say might have a reaction that is very common in the real world
There won’t be anymore humiliating wife jokes.
😭😆😂she’s so funny
Will Smith lost my respect 💯 you feel proud for slapping someone and blame ur career to pretend to be someone ur not. you're fake bro
Please...Will has been emasculated by Jada for decades.  That slap was about that, not about a silly GI Jane joke.  Kudos to Chris Rock for his restraint and professionalism.  There need to be some sort of consequence  for committing a crime on international television.  Will needs to either be banned from the Oscars going forward, or he needs to lose his award or BOTH!
This was both chivalry (for Jada) AND assault…against Chris Rock. Either way? Will finally dropped his goofy guy mask…even for a moment. And somewhere: Kanye breathed a sigh of relief in bed next to a Kim lookalike half his age. “Somebody else’s turn.” In literally any other scenario, Will would’ve been immediately escorted from the bldg & arrested on the spot. In Hollywood…we give awards to abusers. Ok.  It’s been building for a long time. Will needs real help. Anger management & early retirement. He just became his dad & he needs to fix it now.  He’s been out of control for years. Yet we put him on Oprah, the NYT bestseller list and now an Oscar. That’s the most messed up part. How this planet “rewards” abusers.  Also… he’s an Oprah darling and she has a history of cringe relationships with high level sexual abusers. Weinstein, John of God, sexual scandals at her school in Africa, Anyone she highlights is VERY suspect. Plus Will has supposedly always lived a lie. Alexis Duquette was allegedly going to release a tell all book “outing” many celebs. According to her, Will’s first marriage ended when his then wife found him in bed with a man. Jada has always been basically a beard for him. Hence the strain & affairs. Who cares who you love? But why lie about it? He’s not what he has seemed and now we just ALL saw him without the “life advice” giving BS. His real self broke his façade.
Will Smith hits Like a girl, but his mouth hits  harder
In all fairness to Smith, he knew nobody would be watching…
"I got in one little fight about my wife's lost hair" She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"
Amen
Smith should worry more about what is in his wife's mouth than her name in Chris'
*You Wanna Go To Jail Or You Wanna Go Home?*
She has now just become as low as street trash as Will Smith.  And hey she says justice should be prescribed.Time to put all the felons out in bond in prison.  Time for accountability or is she like blacktwitter saying okay for black violence one on one.  If true there should no more millions spent in black communities ..they are saying theirselves that our crime is okay.
Im confused this girl be roasting everyone , so it would be okay  if someone goes on stage slap her just for doing her job .
Chris was a hero of the night…….for rarely respect people while hosting. It’s not a first time
She is actually defending Will Smith lol she has no backbone.
I don't know who Tiffany Haddish is, but she looks like a classy mermaid and I love her class and positivity, at least for the three seconds I've seen her.
Chris rock can crush will so bad he be in a closet crying😂🤣
I'm all in with Chris.  Will should have never - never put his hand on Chris.  There is no justification on assaulting someone and that's what Will did.  Tiffany is talking rubbish - plain rubbish.  This is not funny at all.  Kudos to Chris for his professionalism.
DISGUSTING AND DISGRACE  WILL SMITH LEGACY BROKEN  CHRIS ROCK WAS AWESOME
Smith is a bully
TIFFANY THIS AINT THE HOOD -----   So is like that time when Sammy Davis punched James Earl Jones... wait... that didn't happen. Because they understood that Black Hollywood need to stick together and show the BEST of Black Americans. Screw WILL and SCREW his PEACE. This about every BLACK parent today, what do we say? Swing on Will or do the right thing like Chris??? WE NEVER HAD TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION BEFORE BECAUSE JAMES EARL JONES WOULD NEVER PUT BLACK AMERICA IN THIS SITUATION.
I see shiny heads are sticking together. I hope Joe Rogan doesnt agree with this stupid shit. Chris Rock is a comedian and is telling jokes on stage (its his job), if Chris Rock fucked Jada it wouldve been ok in Wills pov. Smh
😒😒😒
Oh….. boy……. A way to call her “homosexual “?……
This was EMBARASSING FOR BLACK PEOPLE. This was not about Will or Jada. Some of you do not understand the HISTORY of black people in Hollywood. This is about Hattie McDaniel, the first Black PERSON to win an academy award, this is about Sidney Poitier and all the STRUGGLES. All the HELL they took to make SURE THAT SOMEONE LIKE WILL SMITH EXISTS. Without them there IS NO WILL SMITH. And what WILL did, just took a GIANT Crap on their legacy. That is the legacy of Black People on film, the legacy of Black People in America even having the opportunities that Will enjoys.
Tiffany DO not fuck wit y’all 😂😂 she knew she was targeted for that question
What trash! Should never normalize violence especially over a bad joke!
Haddish, keep that same energy when a person slap you for a joke, oh I forgot none of your shit is funny.
Defend Us!!
No joke deserves that reaction.  Will Smith is a man child.
"Consequences for your actions. Discipline administered"... OK so if Rock had hit him back it would've been OK then?
Sexuality? He was making a joke in reference to her bald head, WTF is Haddish talking about.
Tiffany Haddish:  I don't talk about People's business unless I'm In that Business....But just finished giving her entire opinion about Will Smith and Chris Rock deserving the Slap. Respect lost.....not that she didn't already lose it long ago.
So Tiffany is not a comedian's comedian because no comedian would ever condone violence for a comedian doing their job. You don't like the joke? Fine. You don't get to stop people's act, let alone violently punch them.
Of course she thinks violence is the solution. Look at her. Listen to her.
Isn't Tiffany ... a comedian?
His wife is for the streets so  bro damn near  just embarrassed himself on bro
yo shout out to Chris Rock and fuck a Will Smith simpin for Jada (he initially thought it was funny). Also, Tiffany sounding like Keenan Thompsons brother forreal.
This is another comedian saying this people. I hope she get slapped at Her next show. Watch how quick her tone changes.
Tiffany Hadish is a "comedian" and she thinks you can get on stage to assault a comedian for making a joke about a bald head. That's just nuts. Disgrace.
why is it when a grown man does it is called comedy but if children doing in school it’s called bullying and yall on here will defend your family the same way.... SOMETIMES ITS BEST TO WATCH WHAT YOU SAY ABOUT ANYBODY
Disagree
When do they start doing drive by shootings lol
That's her opinion!
idk who this bitch is, But saying Chris deserved it, is not right! First it was a joke, second Jada isnt even really loosing hair thats some fake shit her daughter is bald too, Plus you can see the hair follicles on Jadas head, people going bald have a smooth scalp!
Tiffany has 2 brain cells left . Everything she says is so delusional and out of touch
wait so its okay for Will Smith to physically assault Chris Rock over a lewd joke about his wife? And this woman who is openly mocking a religion (Kali Ma is a Hindu Goddess) and we are just supposed to take it in good humor? Fucked up!
Everyone is giving an opinion but do we dare consult the law?!   No!   Law is for dummies! Yay rainbows!  🌈
It’s a joke, and Tiffany should understand that being a comedian. She’s a LAME now
So many black “elites” perpetuating the foolishness that constantly gets our people shot …in prison then blame the system…never taking responsibility…always someone else’s fault
Ricky Gervais left the room😆
Next time she makes a joke, and if people dont like it.  Just slap her face.  Tiff does sound like a man though.
I never thought I’d here Tiffany Haddish saying something so soft.
Horrible response. She's a stand up comedian and so is Chris Rock. When. You sit in the front row you will get roasted. Worse things about this couple have been said especially when they publicly air their drama and sins. The joke was mild. Will was laughing till he saw his devil wife give the devil face. Disappointed in Will Smith. He either was still playing King Richards role or was having a mental break down.
Wonder if it was the Rock he would have done the same ...
Will is weak for this, grow the fuck up. Taking out your frustration with your wife on another person is so wrong. Then they let him stay smh. Can we expect more host and comedians get hit when they offend people?
Chris Rock did nothing but make a joke, people think they're woke defending Will Smith but they sound dumb.
its white folks fault😂😂😂😂
Jada isn’t embarrassed by having alopecia. If she was embarrassed, there would’ve been a wig on that head of hers. WHAT Will Smith did wasn’t cool, he’s a ignorant bully..Will Smith suck. Letting his wife have sex with their SON best friend. Jada is a devil on his shoulder. Stop listening.  Love ya, CHRIS ROCK
People have been making fun of will smith for not lashing out on his wife for cheating. Called him weak. Made fun of the fact that he continued to be respectful of his wife no matter what happened. No one knows what goes on behind closed doors. He has been pushed to the edge and to watch a man make fun of his wife on the biggest night of his life (again) was enough. He had enough of everyone laughing at their expense. His expense. You can’t keep pushing someone and expect them to never react. He has been a fantastic father and husband and roll model and at the very least deserves forgiveness for this.
I have no idea what she is talking about. I don’t remember women being called GI Jane as a way to call them homosexual.
Haddish is such trash.  She just equated GI Jane with calling someone gay, and feels that it’s acceptable to assault someone who calls another gay.  She’s an incredibly tacky, trashy woman… why was she even at the Oscar’s this year?
So much for tolerance. No one can take a joke anymore. Chivalry is dead, and now is comedy.
Kanye is probably overjoyed by this slap.
Can't believe she defending that
HUGE pay day for Mr Rock.
Jada has Will's head a mess....Will has deep hurt steaming from Jada....He still trying to get love and respect from his woman that is what caused him to lash out.....Kudos to Chris Rock for taking it on the chin and not coming undone.....
0:32 But is it racist.
Chris Rock got exactly what he deserved.. You gotta watch what comes out of your mouth and be prepared for the repercussions when u don’t. He a bitch for not hitting Will back though 💯
Thank you finally someone said it. Consequences y'all
She's drunk or just dumb....that movie was not about gay women wtf ?
First off GI JANE was a strong woman that was showing why women and how strong woman are to even be in the military it was a battle among the sexes. Stuff like that has happened to women in the army! I feel women are strong   Granted jada has a hair health  issue the joke wasn’t about her health it was just the hair style GI JANE IS BOMB PERIOD!   will wanna get mad at a measly ass joke MY NIGGAH YOUR WIFE DID INFIDELITY AND HAD AFFAIRS ALL OVER U WHY U AIN SLAP THEM NIGGAS BETTER YET SHE NEEDS TO get slapped YOUR THR DUM ASS THAT CHOOSE TO STAY…that’s coo! Work it out! Niggas done rannnnnn allll threw your little jada!  I’m totally against men hitting women but shit u ain do nun to her to each is own when it comes to cheating and married but u mad a the wrong man’s bruh sit down u mad yourself look weak asf and stupid asf
She’s a thug to!
Yeah...ghetto person...ghetto actress. VIOLENCE IS NOT AND SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED. Maybe in her ghetto neighborhhod is ok...in civilized world is not
this lady is morally bankrupt just like the rest of Hollywood
THAT WAS PETTY A.F!!!!!
Someone should nuke one of these award shows
Wtf you crying for shi. hell you just got a way with Assault and battery and the World seen it. You mad but she made you the joke
That mole on your face needs discipline, or a hot knife or something!!!!
Tiff as a comedian I don’t know bout this stance
Smacked the mess out of him......talking brazy got him slapped........
There was no excuse for what Will Smith did and anyone defending him is dead wrong. I have alopecia induced by lupus and as much as Jada sat at that red table talking about how she's embraced being bald, she sure got stank face. If my husband EVER hit someone over a bald joke aimed at me we would be getting seperated and I'd consider divorce cause there's so many red flags with this guy coming totally unhinged.
She tipsy af🤣
The guy in the back after she said Italian 🍕 🤣
So nobody caught when Chris was like: “i could…” like saying there’s so much I could say right now to crush you when Will was yelling keep my wife’s name out your mouth.. but he stopped himself bc he saw the pain in Wills eyes and it wasn’t worth it. I have newfound respect for Chris and feel truly sorry for Wills state of being. He is def going through it but that could have been handled without slapping him
Didn't she just had a DUI. All negatives think alike
So, Will apologizes publicly to everyone but Chris? Loss respect for Will, even more. He and his wife are the source of their own problems
Sad.
Tiffany Cat Williams is 💯 % right you ain’t funny , you don’t even know what a comedian does …loool you will offend many people during your stand ups well you probably did offend someone already ,grow up .
⚠️That’s Fucking Assault!!! Hollywood elites gets away with violence! No matter what, you can’t assault anyone or lose control. If Chris used words to make fun of your wife, then use words as well to defend her just like what you did when you are sitting down yelling at Chris. Violence is not the answer.🙏🙏☮️
Why is she still relevant ???
The fuck is she going on about?
Of course she would agree with his actions...😏
We support Will Smith
So… sometimes it’s ok to kill a cop?  📝 noted thank you madam
Damn that slap was incredible! I thought it was scripted until Chris got flustered. We will see if he ever mentions Jada’s name ever again
If you're a dude and all it takes is one stinky eye from your woman to commit assault you're not going to get far in the Man game.
Chris was wrong. Will was wrong. Both are now suffering the consequences of their actions. The end.
She has no idea what she’s talking about. Show me one person who’s in the army that doesn’t have a mostly shaved head. Jada Pinkett Smith could wear a wig if she needed to if she was that sensitive. Or maybe don’t sit in the front row if you don’t want that kind of attention
Why will ain't slap August 🤣🤣🤣
Guess Tiffany finds homosexuality and calling someone gay an insult.
Jada is still getting pounded by some other dude and Jada is still bald. Congrats Will.
DISGRACEFUL BEHAVIOR.....HE SHOULD  BE PUNISHED BY THE LAW....or else the NEW GENERATION OF THUGS WILL THINK THIS BEHAVIOR  IS ACCEPTABLE 😪😪😪😪😪
Everybody sayin poor Chris, but I felt Will was in the right
When an institution comedian is asked to comment on a real comedian. This was much more than just an assault. It was the progression of “you don’t have to take a joke”. Tiffany is just as trash as will.
Lmfao so basically she shouldn't have a job then right? Or is it just your comedy that's okay?
Jada Pinkett isn't a homosexual and you are talking about peopels business.
corny as hell
Will's behavior was low class. Too many people defending it.
I agree with her. And everyone that doesn’t is a sensitive little snowflake who thinks that words have no consequences. Chris made a joke about a medical condition jada has. It’s not like she chose to lose her hair. And Chris rock knows damn well what that family has been going through, still chose to say what he said. And he paid the price. Good on will smith. More people need to realize that you can’t just go run your mouth and then cry victim when the consequences come. He’s lucky it was a slap and that’s all 👍🏼
Will didn't slap Chris for joke against Jada,but for a reason to validate himself.  Like, when Pac defended Jada's honor against him.
GI Jane 3 over here
This ain't my business so who cares.
Nah slapping someone over a joke. Especially when the guy that made the joke is a comedian. Guess all the embarrassment of Jadas unfaithfulness and Will being mocked for it finally got to him. Which is sad on Wills part. Be an adult my guy.
G.I. Jane was dope!!! More of a compliment 🔥🔥
It was a joke. She's a comedian,  come on yall. Will showed his worth when he smacked Chris. He's stressed, that smack was meant for himself. He allowed his family to do whatever and now he wants to be a man about it. That picture perfect image has fallen.
No no no. It was not right to hit another person. This is not appropriate. Chris was wrong but Will was more wrong. This is not how we deal with things.
Tiffany is as masculine just as jada and probably would have had Will as a pet also , that’s why she gave that answer
Thank goodness it wasn't a white person to smack Chris Rock that would have done it
She's a fool. period.
TRASH
Violence is violence. Why wasn’t Smith asked to leave or escorted out?
Lmaoooo it’s crazy that people think you can just say whatever you want and beconsequences free, Joke or no joke. Was what will did the right thing to do? No! But if you think you can play with someone’s loved ones then hide behind the “I was joking card” is nuts. Before anyone brings up any what about this guy or that guy being able to do xyz, we don’t know what will’s reaction was to those situations. The man’s a mega celebrity, there’s no telling what has occurred in private. There’s clearly more than what the couple is willing to share going on. *This isn’t the first time will has smacked someone publicly btw*
Yes, thank you! GI Jane was an insult for years and he knew that.
She is wearing that green!
I think the joke was distasteful to say the least now will didn’t have to slap that man like that on national tv I think he should have showed some restraint but I also think he’s been thru a lot and sometimes u just gotta stand up and this was his stand up or slap the hell outta mf moment to bad Chris was on the receiving in and for those that say he should slap august well jada did that he should have slapped jada lol not the dude ! I say watch ya damn mouth u can’t joke about everything and everyone .. but u also can’t slap me like that either we would have been to mf’s rolling cross the Oscar stage fuck tv at that moment !! Lol
The world is so used to black women being disrespected they are shocked when a black man defends his lady. The way some of y’all are talking  a man could call your mama out her name and you’d curl like a baby.
Chris Rock next special is going to be epic !!!
Oke now  " Every bald man, should also slap anyone that jokes insults them about their hair loss.
No it wasn't this girl is completely ignorant
Will Smith had the typical response of black people in general... which is violence! Black on black crime is out of control.
This is an embarrassing take
Wow, Tiffany😔
I thought Haddish was about to punch out Jenn too
i go crazy
I think Jada airing the affair so publicly and Will being incessantly mocked and emasculated from the public has really gotten to him. And you might not have heard, but several months back, Jada went on Red Table Talk and spoke about how Will "wasn't good in bed..." which was also led to a lot of mockery from the public against Will.  To me, this had less to do with this GI Jane joke and more to do with all of the public pressure and internalized trauma Will's gone through from the public and his own wife up to this point.   I don't judge her for her addictions but I do wish she could have handled her healing without describing very personal and private matters to millions of people.   Unfortunately, I think it just really got to be too much for him and he sort of snapped. My mom also has a theory that Jada whispered for Will to defend her based on her reaction to the joke so perhaps that has something to do with it...
Lol chris rock called will smith’s wife a dyke? Reaching at its finest
It was a joke! A scripted joke. Will Smith was wrong. I will never watch another movie by him. Is this how black people want to be treated. Call each other the “n” word, assault someone on live TV. Oh, and lest not forget Kanye and his threats. Black lives don’t matter to the black people. They disrespect each other!
Tiffany is full woke 😳
first of all this was a long coming slap, Will was still annoyed by his shenanigans from years ago. Look it up. Chris rock is a token...
Who is she?  That movie was not a way to insult women!  That movie was a woman wanting to be something she can't be.
Chris Rock made it personal, this is the second time he has targeted Jada at the Oscar's.  Enough is enough.  And making fun of her hair loss caused by alopecia was uncalled for.
Your calling someone a homosexual and discipline needs to be administered? I'm sorry, but what she just said was so wrong.
Hmmm…makes a living off jokes people…is offended by a joke.
Dislike
I love her!
Fuuck that..it was a joke. Will didn't slap August like that.
Wooooow. Haha isn't she supposed to be a "comedian"
Celebrity’s are literally cancer
She is Wana be who most likely will never be
No talent
Chris Rock should’ve said after Will slapped him that he should be slapping the guys that smashed your wife. Will Smith is an emotionally drained petty man
Anything for ratings.
I totally disagree , will should be sued and banned from the oscars
She yes shaved it bcs of her alopecia but she also shaved her head because like a lot of black women are breaking down barriers of the stereotype that in order to look soft and feminine and beautiful that you have to have long hair in a weave or in braids or a wig black women are tired of having to live up to that stereotype of being associated with femininity and being beautiful in and having long hairstyles black women are beautiful and soft and feminine and yet strong with short hair with a bald head so the fact that she also has alopecia yes is another thing that definitely shouldn’t have been made fun of that and associated with she is suiting up for war or to go into the Armed Forces so that’s one point as well as Chris rock has repeatedly attacked Jada Pinkett and Will Smith‘s acting careers as that they are not that good actors six years ago he roasted Will Smith acting as well as Jayda at the Oscars jokes at the Oscars are to be light hearted and funny but not at the expense of your peers it’s disgraceful and it’s unprofessional and he needs to find light hearted type jokes that everybody will be comfortable and feel happy and you know not insulting people the fact that he is also a black man he should understand what it’s like for a black woman to wear her hair short and freely walkabout and feel beautiful and confident it doesn’t matter if she has alopecia or not a black woman should feel beautiful and soft and feminine and yet strong all at the same time and be confidently unapologetically black bold and beautiful with her hair short or bald Chris rock should’ve known better do I think Will Smith should have slapped him no! do I think Will Smith should have cursed at him no! do I think Will Smith should have yes set the record straight and firmly say keep my wife’s name out of your mouth absolutely but even though I don’t support violence I definitely think that Chris rock had it coming to him because he had repeatedly attacked the couple.
When was calling a girl GI Jane an insult like that??? At worst, at least for me as a kid, it was when a girl was a tomboy n tough as hell. Just sayin.
Tiffany is ratchet!! That will never change. Will was wrong and needs to apologize to Chris and the world for his actions. I don’t feel sorry for him or Jada. We all have problems with a lot less millions. If I walked up and slapped someone my a$$  would be in jail. Period.
Sometimes it ain't a man's fucking place to discipline another grown ass man on a worldwide television event. Chris Rock was assaulted and they didn't do shit to intervene and the asshole walked away with an award when he should've been escorted out. Will Smith has all the right to be angry, but he needs to channel that shit to his open relationship Propecia having bald ass cheating unfaithful headfuck of a wife.
Typical black woman … always forgive the perpetrators
Exactly
I'm not saying that she's in the right for saying this, but I don't know why these dudes in the comments keep calling her "ghetto", "ratchet", and "trash". Just because she has an "extra" tv persona? I'm just confused.
Wow, no respect shown to her fellow comedian. Since when did a GI Jane joke turn into such a devastation.
This is personal with Tiffany she is mad because Chris Rock made a joke about her.
If Chris Rock shaved his head, that would be the end of this story.
Will was out of line for doing this at at place like this
I be like, damn he got dogged
Ignorant
So she's playing the trash characters so much she's turned into trash??
Of course the ratchet one thinks it’s ok. She always plays the same role, THAT friend. Let’s not forget Jada gave her the movie that catapulted her.
Tiffany is full of it. I wish I could've been Rock in that moment.
Wait...Will Smith doesn't get mad when other men are in his wife's mouth but gets mad when his wife is in other men's mouth?
Seriously….Tiffany…what Will did was SO wrong!!!! JI Jane was also a STRONG WOMEN!
😩🤣🤣🤣 she's a fool!
Tiffany's son funny!!!! I feel like me & her should be friends lol
Everything Tiffany said👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾💯
She went full ghetto.
