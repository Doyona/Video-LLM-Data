Goddamnit Daniel was 5 minutes away from my house and I didn’t even feel his radiating positive energy
Hey Daniel Krafft I want you to make your own 50 mill play button when you get 50 million subscribers and that is a change
Now that I think about it, this channel is mostly about pain
the only words i haft to say are: "dude that's perfect"
Wyoming,s not real
This guy gives the YouTubers that deserve 50 million subs, their own custom play button
Does anyone know the specific video from dude perfect that features the 50 mill play button
Me like ur hair Daniel
Please make a 50 Million play Button For Mark Rober
Dislike because there was a sponsored segment
Yooooooooooooooooooooooo😂😂😂😂 I 😂😂😂😂
As a fellow Gem State resident, big respects!  You got a new sub
Idho let’s go
Can I get mine premade
What if they did a trick shot with it lol
You’ve convinced me         +1 subscriber
@YouTube have to hire this guy
Every member in Dude Perfect see it in OverTime 34 in the Cool not cool segment

You need a bigger team to get all of the 50M+ and 100M+ channels because they deserve it and that's a lot of work for just one. Great content btw.
I live in Idaho.                                                                                                                                                              I see you 👀

Imagine spending 9 months on A 50 million subscriber play button. Just to get less than  2 million views. That's a rough buddy.
How come I never get so many likes on my comments
Where was all their reactions to it
If Pandora's box had a YouTube channel
Wait did you fixed the Box or not?
srry mate but you`re not free..
Outro Song?
I get theyre busy but why did the main guy have such an issue with being recorded? Like yall spent 9 months building an award for them, and other than i believe coby (dont remember his name) actually seems happy to recieve it and meet the people who made it.
From England to Poland, it takes us 49 hours
hey why dont u make a mod out of the designs u made
Why didn’t dude perfect make a video about this
mrbeast 50 million 17million views dude perfect 50 million 1.5 million views bruh

Yah
I bet you can’t create a art so physically impossible to create that even the most genius of the genius would be confused how it even works
This video has everything go wrong I feel like it might be scripted
I made MR.Beast his Favorite thing IN THE WORLD I just don’t know how to get into contact with him. I spent months creating it. If anyone knows how please message me.
You look like that dude from cartoon about taming the dragon.
Did any of u Guys realize that Ty was trying to hide his face even though he is always on camera what a bastard

No one Dan Ask for more time or pick up the entire deck
Worth it
So uh, i guess you are gonna have to spend another while making a 100 mil for mr beast
The techno reference at the end was so perfect ( even if it wasnt intentional )
You're actually not free. Go back to your dungeon and get Mr.Beast that 100M Playbutton.
5:02 rip floppa

Ah yes i am free. “For now” :)
Great work guys. Amazing design.
Your videos are super understandable and your presentation excellent. Most resources give vague instructions without making the newbie understand how things really work. Retired and I have a couple dividend stocks, I am going to sit back and observe how this all plays out, adding more at a time.
Where's cocomelon's???
Me realizing that he is from idaho: finally another idahoin!

When I was listening to this to go to sleep I heard the Ronaldo dragon I snag that tablet
Mr beast is getting close to 100 million just saying
4:05 Wyoming looks different, I didn't know that a civilization could build up in such a short time!

Mrbeast is close to 100M subs make him a 100M sub trophy

the amount of stress this dude has gone through must be astronomical
You should make for MrBeast 100 mil playbutton
I know he doesn’t have 50 million subs but markiplier deserves a play button or Maybe at least when he gets there
That hair doesn’t suit you
I’m German and I don’t know desert

"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!  "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus <3
The dedication that you two put in making this playbutton is inspiring. And on top of that the playbutton looks so cool!
If Daniel doesn't live in Idaho, I have no idea where he is
Next up is Pewdiepie, Jacksepticeye and literately every other youtuber in existence

T
Video property of Ernie gang.
Just so you know (you probably wont see this) your thumbnails are really good and are perfect eye catchers ( they make me stop scrolling every time) so idk why you only getting around 300k in the first 24h but you can trust me( dont focus on your thumbnails focus on other parts of the video(story, pacing, music, content...))
7:26 muda?
enjoy freedom for the three days left until mr beast gets to a 100M
Daniel was nervous af
oooooooh my that is Beautiful good job
I love it

7:58 Not gonna lie, Tristen looks like Tom Holland
We got to get 100 mil for mrbeast I will be depressed if I don’t get it
Daniel is coming for Societyawards job
Maybe show it?
Why did Tom Holland with you on the overtime set
I can imagine this man as next play button designer for YouTubers over 50 mil
Your video's always manage to vicariously stress me out. Thats... that's a complement.
So ur telling me the box was harder to make then the actual playbutton  ok
I feel like daniel needs to be at 50 million since he has tooken the job of giving youtubers 50 million awards and has done it better
"Follow me if you want to see more" There's a reason they call me ED-
ur a legend
Free till MrBeast hits 100 million
You should make mr beast a 100 million play button
Make me a 10 subscriber play button
Few days ago or a month ago

Good job

"Walmart, also know as the SCP Foundation" what happens in American Walmarts?
Can you make a beyblade burst
Next task to do :  mrbeast 100 million play button
freedom!
Man this was incredible! Your ability to power through even when everything goes wrong is what I respect about you the most. Not to mention the perfect execution of any idea you get. Super high quality stuff, can't wait to see what you come up with in the future x)
I love this guy's dry humor, its one of a kind.
This guy is SUPER funny🤣🤣🤣 (PERIOD)
yo
Plot twist:hes actually from youtube
Still waiting for his man to be the 50 million subscriber play button creator for YouTube
What about a Mr. Beast 100 Million!?
Their reaction is pure gold! This must've made both their and your day!
This is really intense!
You keep uploading the same video
Mr beast 100m playbutton coming soon
I may just be stupid, but what does the JP stand for. I feel so dumb rn
You know, mr. beast is almost at 100 mil subs…
Thank  you for the inspiration! I'm a youtuber from Philippines and I follow your cotnent idea, And iwas manage to hunt down the number 1 youtuber here in philippines amd made him a Custom 10M playbutton as well. He liked it so much and soon, I hope my channel could blow up by his appearance on my vid with the emotional reaction he gave.  Thanks again for this masterpiece content. I hope I can meet you someday, and who knows.. maybe I can make you a philippine version of your custom Playbutton too 😊🙂 nothing is impossible afterall ryt? 😊👊
Looks great, can’t wait to see the final edit of their video!
Holy fucking SHIT.
Dobby is free now
In a few years this man is going to be making his own 50 million play button. Keep up the good videos. 😀
Finally got it delivered....it’s beautiful 🥶🥶💯
Where’s the Justin Bieber 50 mil award?
My mans has a new job
When Mr Beast gets too 100 million subs you have to make him a even bigger play button. I challenge you
Can’t wait until it comes out
what's the song at the end?
This video was so epic! You are a great YouTuber 🤩🤩🤩 I bet dude perfect will love the play button forever.
Has anybody else noticed Daniel looks like The Winter Soldier if he was anorexic?
not me living right next to their headquarters UwU
Ayy...yo what's the name of that outro song...?
nice
Colorado person here! Did you enjoy the *LACK OF GREEN GRASS IN OUR COUNTRY, HMMM?????* Srsly tho, great job on doing this box even though you had so many problems! :D
You are insane bro. This is goat stuff
Bro imagine if they had the box for that shoot instead of the black thing
I think it's disgusting that Youtube stopped making custom playbuttons for their 50M sub channels. The amount of money these channels would've earned for YouTube would've been enormous, and yet they won't even make the time to say thanks in this special way. You guys are really doing something great, and you really deserve so much recognition for stepping up to the challenge.
scp 5:56
Pog vid
Daniel ,, you are unbelievable
Wait... *GASP* YOU LIVE IN LAND OF POTATO!!!
Yey
At last... The ending this series deserved!!
It’s okay my family drives to Nebraska each year during winter and it is usually 16 HR not counting traffic
Daniel always seems sad in his videos. Like other people would be excited and all but even in his most popular videos he is like moody
Your just the play button man now
wow
You should just start a business by this point, where you make high quality custom awards for a fair price.
Pin!
i guess your not free yet until you make mrbeast a new 100m sub one😉
Better get started on mrbeasts 100 million play button…
I had no idea dragon city was even still a thing. I thought it died and burned down along side Facebook.
I’ve done a cross country drive Ohio to Texas both ways it sucks so respect to you
You should make a custom katana and give it to me :)  (not a joking)
He should make a play button for JackSucksAtLife
Love your work mate, happy to see you got it done!
A
lol I feel like at this point it wasn't a "surprise," but...
does someone knows the name of the outro song?
he did it les go
I definitely chose the WRONG day to release lol…. Great video. Bondo… who knew?  Sounds like Brawndo… what plants crave…
THIS IS WHAT WEVE BEEN WAITING FOR!!!
FreeeeEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
Wow
Please make more irl making videos
wow
"DUDE"!! That play button is "PERFECT"!!
Imagine when techno hits 50 mil
im sorry daniel but i think you might have to make mr beast a 100 million subscriber play button soon
Outro sauce???
IKR! I used to live in CA and I had to this trip back and forth around 17 times!
that is so cool
I hope you guys earn enough revenue from these videos to make up for all the inconveniences
Today is my two papers english and hindi but still watching your video after revison
A cocomelon playbutton??
I cant tell you how much I respect you for pushing through every single video even though hard and frustrating.
dude, perfect. that was hilarious 😂😂
I just got braces and it kind of hurts so thank you for making me laugh today. I love your channel and all of the jokes that you make.
LETS GOOO
Do Lego next
E oop- Mazeing, love the way u make stuff
WOOOOO!!! Dude Perfect is one of my favorite youtubers! It's good to see them get it!

What is the outro music name??
Make sml something bc they got robbed of their hard work
nice
You are free, but not for long :)
What's outro song?
The BEST. Underrated!
Cn8jxoe   That's what I typed when I coughed.
WHO'S NEXT????
man spent 1000 for a box and then broke it in a trunk. damn.
It was at this moment that he realized he did it.  well done Daniel
We all should watch his ads just for the effort he went through
About time you made Mr. Beast a 100 million play button
How much money do you spend making these?
“55 million dollar play button.”  💀
I will now officially refer to Daniel as God.
This man deserves a play button for him self too
Your free until dream hits 50 million subscribers next where you have his mask and a sword for his play button
One day Daniel Krafft is gonna reach 50M subscribers and then he's gonna make an entire elaborate and dedicated video about making a custom play button for himself and painstakingly delivering it across the globe back to himself just for the memes I swear to god-
This is the show where everything goes wrong.
Deserved
Subed saw the mr beast video about u
:]]
ngl this ending reminded me of one of  technoblade's,  not sute if it was intended but its so similar
So cool! Thank you for sharing. Great video as always! If your reading this I hope you have a great day and know. “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16‬ ‭NIV
Can't wait until I made my self a custom 50million play button and Mr beast gave me 1billion dollars to make it out of full gold
Tristan Stan’s where you at
bro wyoming is dope
Zamn, just watched one of their videos for some reason, now I know why
I went throw 13 stashes wen I left texes and I druve
I haven’t even finished the ad yet and I’m already like bruh… that’s insane…
Lol
You're doing them right! The award is incredible and they absolutely deserve it!  Thank you and your friends for putting sweat and tears for almost a year to make this a reality!
Finally the king is back
Dude don’t stop making stuff like this cus it’s epic and your still so funny!!! Way to go man!
Cool
name of the song at 0:50?
gotta acknowledge the Technoblade reference in the end very cool 👍
That techno blade quote at the end was perfect
Hi
Well... free until someone else hits 50 million... heh.

Me at 1:30am: I should go to sleep there is school tomorrow  Daniel: Ayo btw I finally gave them the playbutton which is a video you have been waiting for 10 months

Bondo looks like chocolate paste ngl
Doing whatever it takes. Love it man!
You tube should pay you for doing there job

Noice
Wyoming being the end dimension from Minecraft made me genuinely laugh out loud
Hi
Daniel has now been given the obligation to make 50 M Playbuttons
You have made Mr beast a 50 mil play button but now you have to make him a 100 mil play button.
Wow. This video was a rollercoaster. Great job!
I've been waiting for this for months
i just remebered about this and came to check if you did it yet only to find that you did in 20 minutes ago, very cool
why do you look like the definition of lofi
When you get to videos early and don't know what to say-
pretty epic gamer moment
NEW MEXICO
yas new award video. you should make one for jacksucksatlife. he collects playbuttons. He has almost all of them.
Bucky Barnes?
You should design your own dragon next time your sponsored by dragon city
Omg! I love your persistence man! You are an inspiration!
wat about mrbeast 100m? yes he have just 96,666,666 but..........
After 10 months of pain you finally delivered good job 👏 🙂
A random YouTuber is making better awards for YouTube Creators than YouTube themselves, and I’m lovin it!
This is sick
Diamond: “I can withstand the most pressure!”  Daniel: “Hold my play buttons”
My god that segway to the sponsorship **chef’s kiss**
wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
At this point if you keep designing play buttons YouTube is to just gonna hire you to do their job
i feel v early
E I'm here
Make Mrbeast 100M playbutton
Dude Perfect is well-deserving of this award. The play button looks sick aswell.
If only u could make a reward like my profile picture
Can u turn me into a playbutton
Love your videos so much please never stop
Yooo that’s awesome
GAMING
And I really thought to myself part way through the video, "oh, how many subscribers does dude perfect have again?"
Here before dude perfect
Sicko mode
A bit disappointed but how they took it but I guess that's how they work. Amazing Job man can't wait to see more!
Dude the awesome
now make someone a 50 subscriber playbutton
Can you make me a playbutton?
w
7:24 3D Printer: "Jotaro-kunn" Daniel: "..." 3D Printer "LEROLEROLEROLEROLERO"
FINALLY!
it finally happened. Lets gooooo
I think this proves one thing. Daniel should Never design a play button for a big YouTuber XD
Dude Perfect definitely deserved this award. He and his team work SOO hard to produce quality content. You also deserve a 50 million playbutton. You work SOO hard to make these videos, you deserve at least 10 mil subs.
Amazing job guys.  Who's next on the 50 mill play button list?
That long and agonizing journey at the start though aha, glad you were able to make it in the end! 👏👏
so whos gonna come crying for their playbutton next?
When he said "I'm free"... I felt that
More LEGO!  I was never a big fan of Minecraft YouTubers like Dream, but a Lego manhunt set would be really cool.  Like with dream, George, and sapnap, and some sort of iconic play feature like the Ghast clutch or something with ended pearls and fishing rods.  Idk
ok now you gotta do Marshmello's 50 Mil play button or Eminem's
Make more stuff for MrBeast and only deliver it for a fee. This way, you can earn millions as MrBeast's slave! :D
Earth: *not today biatch*
Respect
WOOOOO :)
Here before Dude Perfect
Daniel Krafft is one of the most hard working YouTubers out there
sick
E
Congratulations!
Smoothest transition of all time
9:45 I realized you try to copy technoblade ending (Potato War 3 FINALE)
Dude this is EPIC
Goats got their playbutton
More LEGO!  I was never a big fan of Minecraft YouTubers like Dream, but a Lego manhunt set would be really cool.  Like with dream, George, and sapnap, and some sort of iconic play feature like the Ghast clutch or something with ended pearls and fishing rods.  Idk
"Walmart also known as the scp foundation" that is way to accurate.
It was worth it Daniel it was worth it
Sneak peak of OT episode

The line “I’m a 3D artist” is now Daniels trademark
