3:14…that really reminds me of Simon Pegg telling on Benedict in an interview for Startrek and impersonating Benedict’s “was that any good?” =))))…I didn’t buy Simon at first, but now seeing him doing that, it does bear a striking resemblance 😂😂

I cannot forget his Sherlock role.
All I can say is: SCOOBY DOO THIS SH!T
🌚🤍🌸
When I looked into his background it's not surprising he got famous  He comes from a wealthy family with many connections Cumberbatch went to Harrow School which is were the Royal Family and other types go to school   It makes me look at him differently knowing that he comes from money and connections
The next Dr must be Humberbatch
Spoiler:  The movie is unwatchably bad.

My English teacher in high school played the first Doctor Strange film. I wasn't interested then because I wanted to watch Endgame instead. I didn't know Doctor Strange was important in the MCU. I still got to learn who did Doctor Strange. I miss that day. PS, this was before the coronavirus happened.
Benedict hosted SNL the day after both Doctor Strange films released.
I heart him. Lol
Benedict is so funny. I totally loved the last bit. 😀
he is the besttt
Love Benedict  Cumberbatch's interviews! ❤ He always manages to make everyone laugh. 😂😂😂
Benedict Cumberbatch is amazing as Doctor Strange and he was born to play that role 🙂. Doctor Strange is one of the coolest and badass Marvel superheroes 🙂
is it me or is he losing his normal accent?
Night.
This is my husband in my head

Benedict Cumberbatch owns every character he played. Sherlock and Strange my favourite.
Mexico
hold on pause tom cruise was a big contender into becoming iron man, and there was one chair empty from the illuminati.. so.. :’)
But you knew all along that House M.D was a better doctor and actor. Sorry Tinker tailor, no power in your dog.

I was so sure the person he was hoing to hint to was gonna be himself😂😂😂
He Is a fantastic actor,he and Tom Hiddleston with Robert Downey jr,Oscar isaac aré muy favorite actores,they are amazing actors, love it the the character of dr strange and i hope Benedict play For More Time this Is amazing character,i love it the movies and series that he Made,specially Sherlock because i know For this BBC serie because my mom Is bigger fan of Sherlock Holmes
he does have a deep voice, but he's also very soft spoken as well

The way these actors can just change accents so easily like the flip of a switch Will always never be amazing to me. I speak in an English accent and it’s hard to Do an American accent for me specifically 😂
Putin follows the US and wants to change the government in Ukraine - Is it successful?  https://youtu.be/uZhShW7GWLs
why does jimmy fallon keep speaking over him, so annoying
Yessssssss❤❤

I like imitatation game
Cumberbatch is such a cool chilll brilliant person....one of brilliant actor outthere
Can't wait to watch it for a second time. The first time I didn't enjoy it as much as I could have because the people in front of me were vaping and there were 8 year old boys talking the whole time
4:34
Benedict has the rarest qualities. He deserves all the awards ❤
Multiverse of madness was terrible
cool
worst talk show host I've ever seen. keeps on interrupting and loves to talk more than the guest. cringe!
Is it just me or are most british actors humble?
the fact that this nice, sweet, bristish guy plays such serious, condescending, uptight, evil characters is MIND BOGGLING. benedict is SO damn talented.
Is it just me or does Benedict look and sound like James Bond in this video
ooooo, he is cute when singing that song
Well… he wasn’t lying about Tom Cruise
He’s looking less possum like with age.
Oh here is my favorite 😍❤️❤️❤️i will watch anything with Benedict
Just 2 guys with no upper  lip, enjoying. This is as good as it gets :)
Ah, yes.  The clip with the extra who magically reset himself.  Purposeful? Mayhaps.
So happy to share a birthday with Benedict!
It's difficult to understand Benjamin with that aggressive South-Boston accent! But, he's still a fantastic actor! Even if he yells all the time.
i love how articulate he is in his words, and now i just learned about Pathos and Elation just by listening to him talk!
I wish I could act in Marvel to but i don't think its possible
Benedict as the condescending and obnoxious Sherlock is my favorite portrayal of the character
WHAT THE HEEEEEK IT LOOKS INSANE
It’s so annoying how jimmy interrupts his guests as they are trying to get their thoughts out. No producers say anything?
4:50 top gun 2. he was talking about the rumor of Tom cruise iron man. Which he basically confirmed to be fake.
Why can’t they talk about the movie?
The first two notes in the tune he hummed are also applicable to another show. Just sayin.
How did i never realize how funny and hilarious Benedict Cumberbatch actually is 😂😂😂
He is not a typical handsome guy, but HE IS SO CHARM!!
Just saw the movie now .. it was amazing just love it 💯🎉🎉
Jacob, Z and Tom 😂 love it
What a man he is
Dr. Strange Multiverse of Wokeness.  Total woke garbage.
just seen it. it was great.
He's English. How the hell does he put on a American accent??? 🤔
I followed him from Sherlock To Dr Strange :) What a journey
The Top Gun theme was the 1st thing I ever learned on the guitar. It was also the last because that's all I wanted to learn. Mission accomplished.
Wow he’s English
jimmy interrupts way too often
I was really hoping a clip of Mac and Me played when they introduced the clip.
What theme song it was
It's is not doctor strange movie it is wanda multiverse of family
It's is not doctor strange movie it is wanda multiverse of family
nobody can be dr strange he is dr strange
Top gum ✈️✈️✈️
When was this interview aired in the US?
Doctor strange got nerfed in his own goddam movie. First humiliation agains maw the nwh now his own movie... Thats why russos are best directors... They know some peoples go to watch movie for their fav character.
♥️♥️♥️
it's just director things.....the director was just making wanda 2 not strange's movie
I hope he comes back as sherlock soon in a new season 4.
You are an annoying "host" Jimmy gosh cringing so hard
I love the movie
I can hear him talk all day.
The movie was not good, man. I like you man, but the movie...not so much. Just an average to mediocre superhero movie. A lot of baseless CGI fights.
When does Benedict sleep?
I love him but I think I'll give Power of the Dog a pass 🤷🏽‍♂️.
He is just the best.
I love funny time... greatest 🤣🤣🤣
I have big problem..i could to speak with you about my music ...and ..or however...and long.. better i will write  soon 🥳😁🙏❤️💙💜💛💚💛💕💋
So if dr strange can make a saw to cut the bus in half, he could have made a saw in the first 5 seconds to kill the monster..  Or to spread the bus apart, he could just split the monster into 100 pieces? Cinema logic!
The best Dr Strange ever 👏👏
K10.J9,
wtf jimmy let the dude finish a sentence, we see you every night and know your opinions and background well enough. It why he’s the worst host and podcasts are so much better
In Myanmar we call him Mr.Cucumber which obviously of course what his name appears to us but we love him so much that whenever he shows up in movies, we use to post on social media like ‘ ohh Cucumber has done it again’
Aren't we all living in our own universal, our view of the reality thru contents in the web, which can lead us to each unique view of thew world. Self is illusion, so does the realities.
He deserves all the oscars
❤️✨🔥✨❤️JF
I am seeing the movie tomorrow! Soooooo excited!!!
His role was definitely amazing but that movie was a letdown
In 0:37 what does that mean ‘walk through the door’?
I want to marry you if I have not got married yet. 🤩 wow
Haven’t seen the movie but as a comic nerd I now know that Rom Cruise plays superior iron man
Today we watched the movie and actors and actresses are excellent. Thanks!
ABSOLUTELY hilarious !!! Love them both!
are people still believing Fallons  Guest Reaktion and wannabe interest?!    so  much fake always
Jimmy Fallon is so fake and cringy
Nice.haha
He was warning us not to overexpect The tom cruise thing Or he was in that 30 min part that they chopped off
Benedict Cumberbatch talks Dr midness in the multiverse of mid sadly :(
BOOORING!!!
I swear the clip shows the man with suitcase running again everytime they show doctor Strange 🤣
We all really thought Tom Cruise was going to be Superior Iron Man
Smaug, Sherlock Holmes, and Doctor Strange. The sheer range of this man is insane. I don't like BBC's Sherlock, but I would be lying if he wasn't the best actor in the series.
3:47 he sounded so pissed wen jimmy said that lol😂💀
This guy could be the next 007???
Damn Jimmy Fallon talks over all his guests it's super cringey 😬
Would be much better if Jimmy doesn’t interrupt too much. Please let your guests do more of the talking. Sometimes you talk over them while they’re telling their stories. 😔
Check out Mike Wazowski doing big films. 👁
Jimmy Fallon can you make eye contact with the guests you have on your show? Thanks.
Benedict is really cool, I first saw him in Sherlock when it aired in uk, He really is a great actor. Also I liked him in Star Trek but the dr strange movies are by far the best
Comment 667
For anyone wondering, the only time I saw anything Top Gun related in the theatre was when they showed a trailer of it before Multiverse of Madness started. Lol.
His summation of Spiderman was perfect.
He called her Z :)
A mentally unstable mother kills a temple full of  sorcerers to find imaginary children,  who then later rejects said mother , the movie is entertaining but with a shit premise
The illuminate show up the line up is BlackBolt played by the guy who from the inhuman tv show , Captain Carter, Maria Rambeau as Captain Marvel, John krasinski as Mr, Fantastic and Professor X.  Wanda Kills all of the Illuminate, she is on the hun for America for her dimensional powers. Kills her self after realizing she went to far and her alternative self telling her her kids are loved.  Clea shows up at the mid credits played by Charlize Theron.  End credit is just bruce campbell
He’s good but I want my $12 back for into the multiverse of madness.. the worst Marvel movie yet
For those who are searching what he said about Tom Cruise in THIS interview 5:01
My name is KAN!
That one extra running past Strange in the clip really outshined the other extras xD They gave my bro like 4 different cuts in 10 seconds
he didn't lie about tom cruise tho.  spoiler: they showed a clip of top gun before MoM starts.
Benedict had me at "My Name Is Khan!" Dang the man is so captivating
what ben and jimmy at the end is indeed a spoiler 😂😂
First the power of the dog has been nominated for oscar, now positive critics for the multiverse of madness movie!  Love you Benedict!!!
Amazing how they smash that cgi in there, and make it look so epic!
It freaking sucked that he died in the multiverse of madness. I just finished watching the movie
MY FAVORITE HUMAN YAAAAAYYY.
every time i see him i just see that scene where he's actually whipping a horse and castrating a scared bull.. too bad, cause he's really talented but i wish he wouldn't have gone to those lengths for a role.
He’s a genuine good person. He’s letting a family from Ukraine move in with him.
I’ve never been more excited for a film
This has a creepy face
Okay but honestly the hands were hilarious
Great actor
Dude Jimmy Fallon is such a terrible interviewer. Uhh uhh uhh uhh uhh and then you uhhh uhh uhh
I’m so glad Japan was one of the countries who got to see it 2 days earlier. I was dying when we had to wait a month for the Spider-Man movie. It was a pretty good movie! So much madness indeed.
And now if you do want it spoiled...     The central plot revolves around Ms. America, America Chavez, learning to control her powers that allow her to travel through the Multiverse. Dr. Strange is not responsible for the crossover through the multiverse as he was in Spiderman. It's Ms. America, and to a lesser extent, Scarlet Witch, causing the crossovers.  Scarlet Witch is definitely the bad guy in this movie after being corrupted by the darkhold after Wandavision.  The movie features the Illuminati with Patrick Stewart as Professor X leading the group. It also has Black Bolt, Mr. Fantastic, a version of Captain Marvel, probably Maria Rambeau, and Peggy Carter as Captain UK.  They all get killed by the Scarlet Witch, although Captain Marvel could have conceivably survived.  Mordo is also with the Illuminati, but he fights with Strange instead.  These are all versions of the characters from Earth 838, which is an undefined Earth in the comics, and they reference our Earth as 616, which is the normal Marvel Universe, which is odd because the MCU is supposed to be Earth 199999.  Mysterio also called our earth 616 in Far From Home, but it was questionable if he knew what he was talking about, since he's a master bullshitter, and frankly there was no reason to think he knew anything about the multiverse.
👍
Bring back sherlock
Benedict is a legeng
8:02 Benedict‘s smile is a total mood, where he is so proud to be one of the mcu’s most badass character ever 7:17 and here’s a most dopest best clip of doctor strange as a badass.
2:13 Benedict’s way of non spoiling the major thing of no way home.
Tom cruise will be iron man
I was here!!! I love Benedict Cumberbatch ❤️
this is so serious and so silly at the same time lmao
Goooshhh!!! I love Benedict so much!!! 😍
So he's gonna fight a character from Monsters, Inc. !
I wish I could go watch it at the cinema... 😭
베네딕트 너무 좋아… 한국에 또 언제 와주려나 ㅠㅠ
He seems to be a good fit for the sorcerer of supreme the one and only Dr Strange.
The way jimmy speaks slight British accent for Benedict is just wow
They’ve all really got the recycled cue card for what no way home was like down pat. They must of all learned it off book for when they get asked about it for the 70th time that day.
Omg I just realized how tall jimmy is. I though he was short
We love you Benediiictt❤️❤️❤️
Now I feel weird hearing him talking in british accent 💀
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Deadpool is in MoM🤯
John krasinski is finally Reeds richards
Just saw part 2… for only 2 hours long the film is literally non stop!! Cameos were cool. It was a very good sequel. Go see it yall
Mr. Doctor Strange , you're such a loveable character in the multiverse of madness, wishing for more Doctor Strange variants though, i am wishing for Doctor Strange 3 !! Please ? it's a cliffhanger like a kdrama cliffhanger factor and it's heartbreaking like a super crushed hearts 😭 !
This is film gonna be interesting.
Tom Cruise as Iron Man well evil Iron Man is sooooooooooooooooo Sam Raimi putting people in certain roles that would never be their if it wasn’t for him absolutely amazing  #IronManEvilDamn!
At the last second Doctor Strange come out next is Sherlock hopefully
How benedict Cumberbatch met Madonna(short) - https://youtube.com/shorts/Yo6yK8pb5S8?feature=share
she sacrifice her self at the end she's the main villain btw, and also no tom ironman, only black captain marvel, the members of Illuminati, which is bolt, Richard reed as John krasinski, captain Carter, and profx which all died btw thanks to scarlet witch which kinda op and by the end doctor stranger will get a 3rd 👁️ enjoy the movie though but I must prefer the first one than what Sam raimi did to these movie 💯👍
Who ?
Brilliant actor and intelligent, charming man.  I fell in love with him when he said in a past interview that his last name sounds like a "fart in the bathtub". 😳😄😆🤣💛🧡❤️💯💋  I would like for Mr. Cumberpatch to do BuzzFeed's "Thirst Tweets".😜
Doctor strange 🤲🌍🤟
Tom Cruise is an A Lister guys with a lot of ego he won't come just for a cameo and I don't think Marvel can afford his  paycheque of 20 million just for a cameo so don't except to see him in the movie unless and until he comes by himself that he wants to be in the movie..
im so jealous of jimmy i wish benedict was behind me 🥵😩
Just watching it first timeslot Day One here... Absolutely Madness 😱
In US they will air it on Friday? I just watched it here in Indonesia this noon (Thursday). Why is it different?  Oh and Ben is so fine in Multiverse of Madness. Gotta love him again and again.
I love him so much
Saw it yesterday.. It was AWESOME!!!
Always the bomb
Battlefield Overwatch, my favourite actor
Such a good movie planning to watch it again so many things going on wanna be sure I don’t miss out on anything!!
In multiverse of madness, Nicole Kidman can be Jimmys  wife, wanda can be iron mans  Secretary😄😄
I live in Iceland so I've seen it already yesterday. I cannot wait for the rest of the world to see it so I can talk about it. Hhahaha.
Who doesn’t love Detective Mad Libs
He looks younger than 45 years old
“Sorry to disappoint the ppl that bought tickets wanting to see 2 Tom Cruise movies this month”  Ouch…just ouch
I love him 🥺💗✨
This dude is amazing actor…but Dr.Strange 2 is awful movie.
Scarlet Witch tries to steal America's power and then dies in the end.
They basically revealed everything. Don’t get your hopes up going in
Now Tom Cruise is definitely in the movie
Far better actor than Robert Downey Jr 😂
Why does he look like tom cruise
Benedict is Such an amazing actor and human being!!! 🤩🙌🙌🙌
💯💯💯🥰🥰🥰
I want to see Benedict and Jimmy on Whose Line now
Tom Holland and Benedict have really perfected the American accents that you forget that they are English actors
DR STRANGE. FOR PRESIDENT.   1
GREAT GUEST.  JIMMY I KNEW YOU WAS COMING THATS WHY I PUT A SPELL ON MY CHAINS.  UURRAA.   1
👍 The sh18 story  Books stories channel for kids
I find it so weird I find him attractive but I do….
I'm guessing the girl that he saves is America Chavez. I wonder if that's how they meet or they're fighting together
Talking over Benedict too much
Oh wow! Two of the vainest most self-congratulatary personalities ever to walk the planet in the SAME studio!  How they avoided "personality clash meltdown" will sadly never be known.
Benedict’s hair reminds me of the 00’s
Why do interviewers even ask these questions, at this point when they know they won't be answered? Is it for the funnies?
Saw it today came out in The Netherlands today 😍 in 4DX was the best👌🏽
Can’t believe my bulldog actually did this!!….🥹  https://youtu.be/KHHTT_X3_p8
TE AMO BENEDIC CUMBERBATCH 💕😍
Film was awesome luved it:)))((

He's a *&^#$*&#^$ing legend
I just wished he stepped into movies/shows a bit earlier in his life. Whatever he touches turns into gold man
MY NAME, IS KHAN.
Benedict Cumberbatch is a good actor. Can't wait for Doctor Strange. He nailed it as that twisted in Power of the Dog.
He gives his best in every movie !!!
❤️❤️❤️awesome 😍 👌
He deserves more than an Oscar
4:30 he should've said " It's a talkie" 😂
Jimmy shut tf up bro jeez
My favourite man is the man who runs past strange 3 separate times
LET PEOPLE TALK JIMMY
You know someone is an upmost expert in their craft (acting, construction, teaching, medical, etc)....is when they can do it with such confident ease that they make it look easy.  In acting Cumberbatch is such a person.
Benedict seems like a genuine person overall. We definitely need more people like him. He's very talented and very successful in what he does.
Favorite marvel character and favorite actor ❤️❤️
I think it's a mistake to call the team Illuminati and not include some version of Tony Stark in it.
I've booked my tickets in IMAX So excited for cameos and movie ofcourse!! TOM CRUISE IS IN THE DOCTOR STRANGE.... HELL YEAH!!
Jimmy Fallon needs gene therapy to finish effort he’s already put forward in losing/destroying his man card (birthright).
Benadryl Cabbagepatch
Tom cruise ironman variant??
He is so amazing.
Tom cruise is the new iron man. Placing my bets now
So now I know Tom cruise will play Ironman supreme
The power of the dog, it's a movie about Bianca Del Rio
Benedict is such a  great actor, and he genuinely seems to enjoy all his roles. Which I think makes them better
Imma watch it tomorrow guiseeeee....so eggcitedddddddddd
"The movie is coming out on Friday"  Italian people listening to this interview while they are in a theater on May 4th watching MoM: 😏
Why does he keep talking over Benedict?
Such a humble man
Jimmy , let him talk! Lol
well-done at the end🤣👌
Well that all but confirms Tom Cruise is not in the film
He deserved Best Actor not Will f’ing Smith
Dude as soon as Mordor said Illuminati in one of the trailers, I think 75% of the population knows what cameos will be showing up, the other 25% don't know and are just casual movie fans. As to which actors will be playing those cameos, well... that's the real surprise (aside from Patrick Stewart).
I can't wait.
He's the kinda guy for whom everyone would die to hangout but he'd show like who gives a f , I'll just talk in Brit accent exquisitely 😗
gonna see it in less than 3 hours. cant wait anymore
I want Benedict to hug me from the back too.
nil, he lowkey looks like a turtle
My man dressed like a coffee bean 🤣🤣
I wish I can watch the full video of this
How has no one mentioned he has no eyebrows
We can all agree that he's a really great actor, he can portray any roles of any genre but my favorite is Sherlock.
I still can't move on from that slap in the oscar.
Wish Jimmy lets the guests speak more. Please stop with the long-winding questions!
great one Jimmy
I could listen to Benedict forever.  He does do audiobooks.
technically inhuman blackbolt was there so not all humans
It's coming out on the 5th on Mexico but I got tickets for the pre-release so I'm watching it tonight! So excited...
Love him….
6:31 Sus part 😆💀
The way he describes No Way Home is astounding, "compound excellence", "Pathos" like wtf this guy is amazing.
Will smith applauder
Captain Carter dies
why Charlize theron become as CLEA STRANGE thats really not fit with the role and really really not fit with Benedict as well... she's not interesting woman...thats the fact of dr strange 3 in the future!!! i hope Kevin fiege read this!!!CAUSE I HATE CHARLIZE THERON AS CLEA SHE JUST PERFECT IN DC!!! CAUSE SHE IS VERY DARK AND BORED LIKE DC...AND IT WILL BE SUPER ANNOYING LIKE BRIE LARSSONS as CAPTAIN MARVEL!!!! dr strange Will never be replaced by boring woman called Charlize theron who play as Clea Strange! i hate her!!! i always prefer EMILIA CLARKE TO PLAY CLEA STRANGE!! AND IT WOULD BE A MILIONS BETTER THAN CHARLIZE!
I just watched it and its soooo good.
An hour ago watched the  movie🍿
IM SEEING IT IN 1 HOUR, SO EXCITED
i screamed when he starts singing the top gun tune, Benedict is such a charismatic and down to earth man and i would love to see him on a movie with Tom Cruise that will be epic
Singing the Top Gun theme is the perfect clue to allude to Tony Stark
pft. yall have to wait till Friday to watch it? I've already watched it twice today.
He must been feeling stretched and zombified everytime a talk show host keep probing his mind for spoilers, but he's a marvelous actor and I guess he can do this all day.
I was at school today and I had computer science in my second lesson. Of course, the first thing I did was I searched "Benedict Cumberbatch" on youtube and saw this interviev, but at our school computers are not connected to the speakers and I couldn't hear anything. I just finished my lessons and the first thing I did was watch this video.
5:20 He literally confirmed he is NOT in the movie... Lol.. i want to see the reaction of people going to watch the movie just to see Tom cruise.. 🤣
I can sell my soul for MoM
It's so weird , I'm so used to hearing him in his Dr. Strange Voice ( American Accent) I dont know who is talking right now .  WHO IS THAT IMPOSTOR ? 😂😂😂
Genius
Love
i saw the movie while ago its really good!!! hope jimmy gonna interview elizabeth olsen!!!
I always love to see him talking. Because he is really well spoken and so humble.
😅 I didn't say, he said. Keanu looks after with that works. But why not? And I wasn't confused.
Talking about a movie he can't talk about
5:00 top gun theme song
Singing Top Gun gave me chills, lol. I can't wait for friday
One and only strange
I’m 😊 seeing it tomorrow 🍿🍿 aka Thursday?
The hand gestures bit gave me strong "Whose Line" vibes. 😂🤣🤣🤣
💜💙benedictttttttttttt😌
That little secret😅🙄
This man🙂😍💚
Tom Cruise as Tony Stark. Just watch.
Love me some BC
Top Gun!!!!!! Tom Cruise!!!!
It's already in the theater in my country, so I watched it already today. I can tell that it is really really fun to watch, not a single minute you will get bored. And Benedict is the best!!!
"Tom Cruise is NOT in the movie." — Benedict Plumbersnatch
Power of the Dog was a total SJW woke turd. And Dr Strange 2 will suck as well. Anything made during the pandemic has turned into fecal matter just like our society
So he's saying Tom Cruise is in it!?
That Top Gun theme got us excited even more
Benedict is the most charming person I’ve ever known before 💖💖💖
Jimmy Fallon should get an Oscar for 'The Most Interrupting Host in Interviews, Ever!'
Whenever I look at his real face, without 'tache and beard all that, I don't see him. I see the classic Sherlock Holmes 😂😂 He should play it again. I never liked modern Sherlock's hairstyle.
Remember God loves you♥️.. John 3:16  For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. Please repent, change your life around and live for Him🙏. He is coming back soon🥳.......
Jimmy kiss as fallon
Finally!!!!
can’t wait to see it!
for those who are hyped too much, lower your expectations guys, MJ has a simple philosophy: “If you expect disappointment, then you can never really be disappointed.”
Omg even Benedicts hand gestures are incredibly well done ahahaha
AHHH Im so excited for MoM, I'll see it today!
The cutest face of Benedict @4:28  - trust me, youll have to watch in x0.25
"Biggest movie of all time" El-ow-El
Two tom cruise's films in a month he better not tease me!!!
The bit with the hands was funny! 😃😎🤪👍
I could hardly wait to see this movie! BC is just so cool! 👍😃🤪👏😎
Dr strange sucks. Why is it getting so much media attention? It blows.
Mmm drugs! The host is so freaking high as an intoxicated over served driver. Shame on him. In the public spotlight and higher than the LEGAL LIMIT. Shame. Bring back Johnnie Carson.

Hi guys,I created first audio-series in the world ;) https://youtu.be/y3t3nVjIKGg   Starring:Johnny Depp,Al Pacino,Robert De Niro,Bobby Cannavale,Peter Stormare,Danny Trejo,Colin Farrell.
Jack : Benedict cucumberack 😆
iam going to breakdown this movie in literal tears when i see it
Benedict cumberbatch my G.O.A.T .......the perfect actor ...SO versatile and whatever he does is remarkable...BBC's SHERLOCK HOLMES Still guy is simple and down to earth 🌎 guy
Love the way he says “head space”… if you know, you know. 🙌🏻😅
i’ve gotta hunch/feeling that Iron Man is going to show up in this film but 🤷🏾‍♂️
Still waiting for Sherlock on BBC thou...We need another season of Sherlock
He deserves multiple Oscars. He can nail any genre and any role.
Benedict cumberbatch has to be the most british actor alive
I can't believe Disney/Marvel would allow Mordo to pull a Bill Cosby on America Chavez and Strange...
NOW I KNOW THAT JIMMY'S MUG REALLY HAS SOMETHING IN IT. THANKS DR. STANGE!
Gosh I look up to this man so much. What a good guy and brilliant actor.  Him sitting next to Jimmy is just so much decency in one space.
Looks like Benedict left his eyebrows in his home and came here
Damn you tube!!! I don't want parts!!  I want the START !  At the begining!
It always fun when Benedict Cumberbatch is on.
7:16
I love marvel movies ❤️✨✨❤️
Octopus too big. The doctor will die.
We're no strangers to love You know the rules and so do I (do I) A full commitment's what I'm thinking of You wouldn't get this from any other guy I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling Gotta make you understand Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Top Gun 😳😳😳😳😳😳
Damn it! I wanted to see Tom Cruise in this!!!
Just got home from the cinema it was a great film! Cameos were really really great
That clapping at 1:45 is so incredibly cringe. Shouldn’t have been edited in.
I just watched MoM. It's a mess but a good mess.

He's super handsome all the time OMG😍😭❤
Damn Jimmy, let him finish answering....
Fallon is such a goose man
I’m going to watch it. TODAYYYYY
What makes him charming is the fact that despite all of his success he's still such a down to earth guy
Creepy 😆
Got tickets for tonight. Can't wait!!
Bendystraw Humptydance (I apologize for that, except I don't) on "Who's Line is It, Anyway?"
to anyone wondering what the song is, here you go.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
So cool to see the living tribunal for 1 secs. 😂
Jimmy Fallon: we will project it Me who can't get a damn ticket for doctor strange MOM for the next 4 weeks: jimmy is a hero. I just couldn't see it.
6:25 oh my god can Benedict do that to me please im gonna faint😂
At this point The Pentagon is taking notes from Marvel on how to keep UFO's and aliens a secret.
Most of the British celebrities are very intellectual!!!! Really really smart and he is just absolutely brilliant! 😄 Love him so much!
Shuma gorath
Jeez Jimmy Fallon is so fucking annoying, just let the man finish his sentences!
Jimmy Fallon, the only talk show host with a reputation of interrupting all his guest while they're talking
This is hilarious 😂 Will Smith vs The Prodigy https://youtu.be/rCGmqRWRxk0
Jimmy's the only talk show host that manages to get in more words than his guests. Enough with the worshipping Jimmy - let them speak!
meanwhile im friends with john watts’s niece…
Intelligent, articulate, talented, charming and British. Well, I'm one of those things as well and so I suppose I'm like Benedict Cumberbatch. Can't wait to start my rounds of the major chat shows.
🙏
Send my       for me🙏
Benedict’s sarcasm level is literally 9999🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can’t wait to see it too - Benedict is such a great actor 🙌🏻👏🏻
Going to see it today! Don't worry, I won't tell you anything. Maybe I will come in and hum a theme af a cameo character tho ;)
I don’t know about you but I heard the theme to “The Office”
his was so fun 😂
My G!! 😻😻 so proud of this guy.👏🏻
Clue:- 5:00
Well it’s May the 4th (Star Wars day) and in 1.5 hours I’m going to see Dr Strange. SO EXCITED!!!
OMG, that is so cool that movie will be in a few days. Waiting all this time, watching teasers and trailers to see more, to think about something unbelievable. I'm so glad and happy and at the same time actually a little bit sad. Cuz it is already showing up, so much time passed, like almost half of the year. And also me and my friends wouldn't be able to watch it, maybe even in some months, because there is a war in our country. We are still here, worried about all that happened and might happen. Maybe it's not right to think about movie when nightmare like this happening, but we really need to think about something else, about some good, fun and positive.  And I'm sure for 1000% this this movie would be something unbelievably great and awesome.  So Everyone who is going to watch it - "Have a good movie!!" 😘🎉
Tom Cruise ISNT in it..... so pmuch confirms Tom Cruise as multiversal Tony Stark.
He singed top gun song very good.
Dr. Stainge will be out only on Friday in US? I'm going to watch it today in Switzerland. I can't wait!😎❤️
Far From Home did so well. It took TOO long to go to DVD  Fortunately, I succeeded at avoiding spoilers. It insanely easy. Crybaby’s that cry about about spoilers just don’t make the effort to avoid them.
Honestly this is a cute monster he just threw the bus out of fear
Sometimes Jimmy is ankward
He called zendaya "z", love that
Benedict is such a sweetheart!
🙌
Lol people wanted Tom Cruise as Iron Man so bad
Have my high school exams coming up, and then I have SAT like exam too upcoming. I'm pack for next 2-3 months with hardwork and would definitely miss Madness + Love & Thunder. I've already missed MoonKnight :(
I watched it for Tobey 💁🏽‍♀️
Somehow the creature reminds me of one monster from Monster Inc 😅
5:10 did he just tease Tom Cruise is in the movie possibly as superior Iron Man
The tune, it’s Top Gun. TOM CRUISE IRON MAN???🥰
I like how he called Zendaya 'Z', 1:58
All is all to all. Kaww! Kaww!
I just watched. Wanda kills Professor X, Captain Marvel(Maria Lambeau vers), Captain Carter, Captain Fantastic.
Why is jimmy cutting Ben off so much? Maybe it’s just me. I’m sure they are pressed for time and have a lot of topics to hit.
Benny C might have spent half a year on press tours for the last year.
I’m surprised he didn’t do the BBC Sherlock theme, meaning that he was going to be in DS MoM.
There should be time stamps on fallon videos where you can click to skip jimmys stuttering, jimmys pandering and ass-licking and jimmy in-general.
Didnt knew Dr. Strange likes music 😂😂😂
Jimmy interrupting Benedict throughout the whole interview kind of bugged me. Let the man finish a sentence.
Ooh so excited for MOM
wait hang on he said “two tom cruise”?! is that just a reference to the new top gun movie or is that a reference to the rumor that he’s gonna show up as alt iron man
Benedict my love❤️❤️❤️
Already got my ticket for Thursday afternoon! Can't waittt!!
nothin like a little Cumbersnatch
Benedict is sooooo effortlessly funny
Tom cruise probably is in it lol :)
This is funny! 🤣🤣🤣 I love Benedict Cumberbatch! ❤
Where is Elizabeth Olsen.She was the star of this movie for sure.She was the cherry on top.
I like how happy Benedict Cumberbatch looked after that clip, like Yeah I'm a badass in this movie you are all going to love it!
"It'll have sound." Oh, it's a talkie. That's very modern.
A living legend in the making. 😍 Mr  C in the Power of the dog fantastic role. Now Jimmy hopefully you learned all the portal gestures you needed😂🤣😂🤣
I predict that he will not survive the movie.
What's up with Jimmy's finger?
THE SUPERIOR FUCKING IRON MAN!!
This movie was incredible!
tom cruise as iron man confirmed
Benedict as the condescending and obnoxious Sherlock is my favorite portrayal of the character
I love how he confirmed that he wasn’t in the movie straight up 💀
THE MAN WITH A SUITCASE SHOULD WIN AN OSCAR
I just can't ignore that continuity error in the clip 😭😭😭that guy just keeps coming back with his suitcase and newspaper
Power of the Dog as much as it tries to be serious and tell a good story it really really doesn't.  The plot never make sense or satisfies.  Cumberbatch himself in this interview says how defensive he is of his character in the movie tells you that he is insecure about it.  As usual Fallon strokes his guest off in praise no matter how good their work is.  Trust, Power of the Dog has good intentions by the director and writers but it is a C+ movie at best.
Imagine we actually do get to see 2 Tom Cruise movies
I can’t believe he actually teased Tom cruise but I heard he’s not actually in the movie but we’ll see
About to see the movie in an hour!
Got my ticket to see it on Thursday! Can't wait!!!
It's cuck, the movie 45% his movie and 55% Elizabeth Olsen' movie while he was cut from to WandaVision because he was a man. "That doesn't seem fair"
Tom cruise 🥺🥺😍😍
He's also taking in Ukrainian refugees at his home.
Whom was he referring?????
Cumberbatch and Bullock, comedy love story
Anyone else thought he was humming the Jurassic Park theme song? 😂
I swear I thought he was gonna sing the Star Trek music, but singing Top Gun was absolutely genius 😂😂😂😂😂
The way he teased Tom Cruise 😂😂
Wait. He did the top gun theme. Tom cruise was rumored to play superior iron man. Just saying
spiderman no way home isn't the biggest movie of all time
odd that jimmy calls no way home the biggest film of all time when that title belongs to Morbius
This weekend is going to be one of the BEST weekends of my life! SNL AND a new movie YAY! 😃😃😃😃😃😃
Fallon has been in this business for this many years and still don't know how to not interrupt the guests. Have a look at Graham Norton.
Doctor strange 🔥🔥
Without a doubt Doctor Strange Multiverse Of madness will be the best Marvel movie ever made in history.  Total success !  ticket sold out!
Tom cruise top gun theme song 5:00
NAH CUMBERBATCH TROLLING WITH THAT TOP GUN TOM CRUISE IRON MANNNNN LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Funny how Benedict still refers to 3 Spidermen showing up in No Way Home as "the little secret". He still fears to talk about it Damn Disney, cut these guys some slack      *mom imma famous pack your bags we are going to LA!!* (thanks guys hehe)
Tom Cruise
We love you so much Benedict❤ Great to see you grow bigger and bigger with every year passing❤
I saw BEN I just don’t only click but SCREAM!  Ps. His MAD LIP THEATRE is the best in my opinion.
I'm Early
Please, doing subtitles 🙏🏻
"Jacob, Z and Tom" 😂
Already got tickets!
Disney, could you please stop sending celebrities on talk shows to say, "I can't talk about this." It's so corny and overdone. Do you think there's no middle ground between discussing the themes of the film and spoiling it? We've had years of practically no meaningful film discussion in promotion of any of your releases.
What was that musical cue?  I don't recognize it.
Can’t believe Wanda died 😭
Benedict has learned from Tom's spoiling tactics
So excited! I ❤️ Cumberland Bandersnatch!!! 😜  P.S. I don't mean to brag, but I can play that Top Gun theme song on the recorder 😏
It the British actors for me Tom Holland Chris Hemsworth  benedict cumberbatch And much more are killing it in the marvel  movies
Got banned in China cus they have gay characters.... when are we cancelling china like we did Russia? Lol
Wait a week let fckney suffer as they take most of the profits first week.  Put it in the hand of the cinema and Spider-Man was Sony not disney.  #disneysupportsoppression
going to watch the movie later!
Wanna get nuts? Let's get nuts!
Looking forward 😃
Imax 3D back row center tickets! Beat that!
