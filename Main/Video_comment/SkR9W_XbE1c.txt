Where is sharky 14:00 😢
It makes me sad that they seem so nervous when they’re hosting 😢
How do they do thst thing where they sit them aside to comment on each section of the come dine with me experince.at the end or in bettiwine??
Ncoow He looks Cute
oh soo sharky is very late
28:18 Chunks really did take it away 🥺 damn, man  Literal goosebumps  The solemnity 🥹
Tbh Chunkz is the ONLY one who can criticize AJ for his terrible cooking skills because atleast Chunkz cooked his meals in his episode, Kenny and Sharky didn’t even cook smack 🫩✌️ I haven’t watched Nikos episode yet so idk (Don’t take this comment seriously)
where is sharky
I was expecting big things from Aj!
this episode makes me so happy and is so comforting. not only its funny, but its the hobbit inspired! ive been obsessed with the lord of the rings and the hobbiy since i was a kid, and seeing this is so special to me. i literally wish i could be in this episode
Where's sharky?
The song got me crying,,nice job 😢
Him saying he'll turn them into lucozade killed mee 😅

I laughed when niko said did I hear scream and someone die and he saying the show must go on
i feel bad that they didnt like the food that Aj made but if i was there i would give him a 10 personally,poor guy did his best.i love Aj♥
19:25 CHUNKZZZZZ💀
23:46 aj could’ve won this why didn’t he actually try with the food💔 27:30 I feel bad Kenny doesn’t know the lyrics and he’s just sitting there😭 32:43 WERE BOYS AHHHHH😭😭😭
27:33 NIKO’S VOICE CRACKK LOLLL😂😂😂😂
Aj did a great job, is a 9/10 for me definitely 🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼
wheres sharky
Peter being evil was one of the best parts
Chunkz’s singing is just so good
20:34 24:32 25:28 25:50😂
Yoh chunks ate that, no need to make my skin crawl like that dudes 😭
They've used the "honeywood" theme from VLDL, awesome!!!
Fr feel bad tbh if I way AJ I would use the mini burgers as a prank and cooked the normal burgers before they even arrive
8:37 sharky already did that on the 5 star ep kenny edition
not sharky being two hours late 💀
4:41 thats actually scary😂😂😂
25:48 😂😂😂😂
32:48 what does this mean
23:52 niko lied on his life
The fact sharky was 2 hours late and still had something bad to say about aj is insane 🤦🏽‍♂️
Where tf is sharky
28:16 chunkz’s voice just gives me goosebumps ❤😊
When Chunks started to sing 27:11
Kind of an L from Sharky for being late
i feel like niko only gave Aj a 7.5 bc he felt bad for him cs there’s no way he enjoyed the time w his friends better than he did with kennys video they all seemed more serious in this video too lowk felt bad 😭
Chunkz is such a hater so jealous. He had the best episode
Best episode AJ has a genuine person. Feels like they don’t value him in the group
Best episode AJ has a genuine person. Feels like they don’t value him in the group
Sharky always being late pisses me off icl 😂
Chunkz singing Adele had my jaw dropped, picked up and dropped again 😮
im so sorry kenny that u dont like music😭😭😭
Harry's roast on Niko as an "educated zombie" is crazy
The singing bit. I love it!
Where is sharky
Where’s sharky ?? 10:05 !? Future me is he still not here
33:48 HARRY PENIRO 😭😭😭
The breakout into a group Adele cover was actually amazing !!!
Editors are diabolical LMAO having Niko say it wasn't the worst because theres been some 'shambolic' stuff, and then cutting right to Sharky is elite trolling hahahah
- 7:19 Oh WeLl, ThE ShOw MuSt Go oN 💅💅💅💅💅💅💅 the wise words of Nico 😂😂😂
Harry is so funyy😂😂 educate zombie caught me
This is really my fav series from beta squad, i already watched it multiple times
Nah this score is unfair, I can stand giving kenny low scores because he didn't cook, but AJ actually prepared the entertainment, amazing place, SNACKS and MOST IMPORTANT cooked by HIMSELF. There might not have been much food but it defo was tasty and edible. He shouldve gotten at least 30 for all that
The singing 😢❤ 28:15
😂😂😂 I died when I saw the size of those foods
Aj honestly was so creative with this
WHERES SHARKY
Yall shoul've seen my face when i had this running in the background while doing some chores and i was singing to Adele and the next moment they started singing the same song
2nd season please❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Sharks is always Late😂
The menu said Ajs mini beef Aj has a mini beef
Bring this banger back 😢
27:32 lovely🥹❤️‍🩹
I’m sorry.. but doing this job and being 2 hours late is actually disrespectful af 🥴 and this is coming from someone who is often late by 10/20 mins at times and I’m literally disabled and get frazzled af, sick daily from pain, and can literally pass out 💀 I don’t even hold them as excuses for being late 🤣 but 2 hours!?! Wtf???  I don’t really watch anyone’s vids other than Niko, but sometimes AJ’s too, but very new to his vids 🥲 I didn’t know he was nerdy like this and it’s so cute 😭 it’s nice seeing him like this and he’s so sweet for genuinely caring and putting so much effort in 😭 He was so upset people weren’t happy 😭 bro deserved 100000/10
2:32 the top is iconic
27:31-28:45 still in 2025 is one of the best beta squad sing together of all time
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

sharky?
Niko man u cant talk about gandalf's stinky breath.  (Intro) Yo, Niko, man, I gotta say, You’ve been out here stinkin’ up the day. This one’s for you, take a step back, ‘Cause I’m about to drop a breath-check track!  (Verse 1) Yo, Niko, what’s up with that breath, man? Smellin’ like you’ve been chewin’ on a trash can. People see you comin’, they start to flee, Your mouth’s like a dumpster, straight up, no tea.  You say you’re fresh, but that’s a straight-up lie, Got the whole crew gaggin’, and we don’t know why. Breath so foul, it could knock out a skunk, Even your toothbrush said, “Man, I’m done with this funk!”  (Chorus) Niko, Niko, get some mints, please, You’re clearin’ the room, bringin’ us to our knees. Niko, Niko, take a step back, Your breath’s so bad, it’s under attack!  (Verse 2) Yo, Niko, ever heard of mouthwash? Or are you just stickin’ to that garbage sauce? We’re out here tryin’ to chill, have a good time, But your breath, man, it’s practically a crime.  Talkin’ all close like you don’t even know, But we smell that stink from a mile down the road. You’re rockin’ those kicks, thinkin’ you’re all fly, But that breath, bro, it’s makin’ flowers die!  (Chorus) Niko, Niko, get some mints, please, You’re clearin’ the room, bringin’ us to our knees. Niko, Niko, take a step back, Your breath’s so bad, it’s under attack!  (Bridge) Maybe it’s the onions, maybe it’s the cheese, Whatever it is, man, you’re causin’ a breeze. So here’s some advice, take it from me, Pop a mint, chew some gum, set that breath free!  (Outro) So Niko, my dude, don’t take it too hard, Just fix up that breath, and you’ll be the star. But until that day, we’re keepin’ our space, ‘Cause your breath, man, it’s a whole dang case!
Where is sharky?
Naya bring food 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bro Chunkz’s tunes were mad af comment and like if u agree with me
32:52 what he mean
"13 siblings"💀😭
where’s SHARKY 🦈 😢😢😢😢
Chunkz’s singins is angelic 28:37
Sharky got them East African genes for coming THAT late
Where’s sharky
The singing 👌 lovely
cant believe chunkz said 5+5 divided by 2 was = 5 🗿
26:42
What a sweet voice from chunkz I had to download the song thanks man ❤
Lol here watching again
the boys singing ❤
Being fr tho this so wholesome ngl, even if they're joking around we could see Aj making big efforts for this 😭❤️❤️
Bro cooked with the intro💀 (me jst being sarcastic)
30:53 the way sharky waved both of his hands like a girlypop is freakin’ adorable
chunkz is actually good at singing
Aj could have done so well if his food was a good proportion 😭😂
So chunkz was the only one to actually cook everything on his own? 😂😂
The beta squad had been aired the most in this video
I got the chills when Chunkz and Niko were singing together!! ❤ I hope you guys come back soon!!
What did the joke about chunkz mean???
Aj was just having a revenge for last episodes when they served seafood and he couldn’t eat😂
27:45 HWLP NOT AJ DOMING IN
Ok hi guys! Its been 1 year and well I think beta squad has just did every tv/game show in British history and I feel bad gor AJ honestly he tried so hard and like he made a separate dish for certain peolle because he knew what they like and what they don't eat but like the other people knew that AJ didn't eat sea food but still made it gor him anyway and every episode-someting is seafood and I know this might be a but hard for the boys but they should try adding like a vegan option or non seafood option -but obviously they are not like that skilled enough to do that. They should try doing Survivor South America or a part 3 of Family Feud next and I hope they come back for us!
RIP peter he got turned into cheese 😭😭😭
The pain in Ajs eyes 😭 He had done dilly messed up
10:32 10:35 sharky 😅
bro violated niko
Chunkz is hella talented. He's got some unused potential in singing! Got a great, soft, honey like voice❤
The preformance from 27:32 to 28:47 was so good. W Music
This is AJ without the photoshop
WHERES SHARKYY
Idk bout the rest of y’all but Hobbit Peter was definitely a Sith Lord tryna make some extra cash on the side 😂

Messing with chunks food is setting yourself up lol he was hurt after seeing the size of that burger he wasn’t the same for the rest of the video

Sharky complaining when he was 2 hours late and his was the worst thigg ever
I was doing the dishes while I was watching and had to STOP doing the dishes when I heard y’all break out in Adele 😭😂. Fav group hands downnnn
not lying but beta squad of "someone like u" is better than adele's  chunkz vocals killed it
This made my day honestly
WHAT WAS THAT SOUND FROM KENNYS MOUTH AT 25:50
SHARKY
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Jokes aside tho,can someone explain how Gandalf did the newspaper trick??😭😭
Is AJ a real person😭😭😭😂😂😂?
Gandalfs paper trick was the deal breaker for me 😂 that made this the best one hands down
Hobbit peter looked like a budding sith lord.
HELP THEM MAKING JOKES ABT THE HEIGHT😭

niko:“every time he blew i almost died"😂😂😂😂
The funny thing is that Sharks literally came late to every ‘come dine with me’ video
Bro mentioned a Lucozade bottle as i was drinking a lucozade bottle 💀😅
36:08 5+5 divided by 2 is actually 7.5
The way sharky was over one hour late is just crazy 💀
I watched them in order and aj’s is the best so far
I really liked the idea of tiny food actually hahahahaha
What’s the 28:11 song??
26:08 I love how the editor put Sharkey say shocking right after Nico, saying that there has been some shambolic things happening in the series

It was surely better than chunkz
Hobbits being excited at 12:49 is soooo funny and cute 🤣🤣🤣
Where’s sharky???
Ali being a good hobbit 😂
Niko is actually so humble and nice it doesn't bother him from the food like chunkz and he only cares about the atmosphere and the vibes around him.❤
Peter Dinklage was rude🤣
The fact that aj put so much effort and was genuinely taking this serious is a plus for me, he did and amazing job minus the LITTLE food ofc
The dessert part 😂😂😂😭😭😭😂😂😂
27:05
The fact that he thought abt Kenny having a fight coming up n then gave him something he couldn’t eat is funny 😂😂
Chunkz' voice is beautiful 😢❤
He wouldn’t for sure
Bro like imagine chunks drinking alcohol that would crazy
Don't read my comment                                                                                                                Lol imagine scrolling through this 😂

Used to be a sharky lover but after this day. Sharky sucks and I’m team aj.
this ep is so cute, i love the hobbit theme with th emini food and fantasy characters
Chunk has a amazing voice❤
Niko reminds me of young lamppost
Bruh I would have been better ost than all of them, Chuncks did good job tho.
Aj's was the best so far
I don’t like sharky he has no place to even rate after his come dine with me
HARRYYYY
dont know how i should feel scrolling to the bottom of the comment section... i have too much free time
At first I thought Kenny was best with sticking to his character through his episode but… AJ definitely wins and this scene could literally not be beat
where’s sharky

BANGER
Chunks at 14:04 😂💀 I died

Thoose roasts were personal
Aj looks like specs cosplaying aj😂😂
Aj is so underrated!
why was sharks not there???
16:28 HOW
Pretty good stuff, I just realized that Mario updated his favorite way to tackle ED and it's crazy! Although what he previously talked about was pretty decent, it was difficult to follow, I just go'ogled the latest in Mario's Thunderous Erections, it's so much simpler and potent now!
This has to be the funniest thing ive ever seen.  AJ is comic gold.  I laughed the entire episode.
Love how Niko was talking bout everyone but aj
Bros nose

chunkz’ voice is a work of art

30:38

I watched 6hr of beta squad and king Kenny n sharky and niko and chunkz and aj today
big up to hobbit Ali, he did a really amazing job in everything. The acting, the voice and allat. 10/10
The way everyone actually thought AJ would serve actual alcohol made me laugh😂 knowing he don’t even drink himself 😂
Niko is being rude to every host haha can't wait for his turn😂
Chunks can really sing
27:53 the little hobbit looked so cute here🥹😭😭😭
Chunks actually called NAAYA to the princess 19:45 😭
it's a shame he didn't do multiple of the little burgers for each person - but his theme was 'small' so it was funny / good
AJs was lowkey my fav come dine with me
My favorite part of these videos is when they all entertain each other. Especially when they sing together, it’s such a vibe, a memory
Best start to a Come Dine with me video. Absolutely love this
"I could've inhaled it. Fhooop--dunn"

Shame he tried his best😭😭😭
Were is sharky 🐋🐋🐋
Aj says 4:52 min in ,,He looks like the king himself - Jesus'' He couldn't be more right about that
And of course Sharky is fashionably late
Why is Sharky always the last one 😂
AJ is not short; he’s vertically challenged. Everyone else is just extremely tall 😒
bro said 5+5/2=5 when it equals 7.5 lol
Harry saying “I didn’t mean none of that” after his roast 😂
the way aj just came back when chunkz started singing without the entertainment and started banging on the table 😭😭
‘Dorito ahh shaped head hobbit’ I died
32:33
That singing part was elite
28:18 OMG  Chunkzs voice is pretty nice
7:17 * did I just just hear someone scream and die.....well the show must go on*😂😂😂💔
😂😂😂5:10
chunkz focals are 🥶🥶
32:31 😂😂

7:16
Personally i feel like his come dine with me was better than chunkz
"Not as active as kennys parents" STOPPPPP 😭
beta squad now im rewatching your videos just please post tha new australia video
Crazy how one changed feature can completely change someones look
Aj's hospitality💯💯 I'd go to his dinner party
They are so mean like calm down pls.
They were all too harsh on aj this night was good
Why am I not seeing any comments about the singing??? BEAUTIFUL moment between the boys😩ENCORE ENCORE
filly edition plzzzzzzzzzzzzzz🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
Chunks voice Wow

29:49 MOUTH DROPPED☠️

Beta squad do Adele better than Adele
Sharky left the chat
13:57
2:18 aw the hobbits are so cute the one reaching and the other pulling away
Aj's revenge on the fish 😂
Give this man A for effort, this was levels above everyone else!
imagine the scream was actually someone dying tho 💀💀
Educated zombie🤣🤣
KENNY HAS 13 SIBLINGS?!!!
Sharky talking about starving and how hes hungry TO AJ IS WILLDDDDDDD
This is how he did the newspaper trick: He had a copy of it which he had hidden somewhere, and the newspaper is usually used to hide it. Something like a swap of the hand when he’s got it all in a ball or crumpled, and he then unravels the copy. Veeeery sleighty-handy.
You did awesome AJ ✨
Yo king Kenny is no longer king it’s now niko😂
25:50 Kenny’s laugh lmao i replayed it 3 times 😭😂
"he works with the shaitan''- chunkz 😂😂😂😂
The whole tiny things theme made this my favorite episode of all 5, AJ really put great effort, just loved it from start to finish
Chunkz can sing?! 👏🏾
As a LOTR and The Hobbit nerd this is my favourite one
Chunks got them pipes
Please another cooking contest! Maybe the next contest should be a grill contest!
Niko always early or on time lol
25:46 LOL
The subtitles, “come in” x7 😂😂😂
Darkest is hiding
bro invented his own mythology 💀💀💀
I love how the staff that AJ os carrying around of from Amazon ( i used to have one)
19:20
Chunks 🤣🤣😂 is so real for he works with the shaitaan
Ngl but the singing was kinda goodb
Someone like you - Beta Squad Cover… absolute banger man😭
Can we appreciate that aj worked on the work and actually cooked it and they’re like judging and stuff. Like still probs one of best 😅!
chunkz got way too heated over the food dawg
Shark???
you guys are so mean to aj🤣
Their singing is so good wtf, they are so talented
their literally all so good at singing
Aj’s revenge for every time they served him seafood lol
Does AJ even know what a hobbit is lmao
Loved them singing, so wholesome x
This man AJ never makes the banging on beat😂😂
The way AJ freestyled at the end 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
U guys, Beta squad is an addiction!! I keep watching ur videos!! U guys are amazing!!🥰😍😘❤️❤️❤️
Chunks got some
Can we just talk about the beautiful voice of shunkz
My boy Chunkz went too hard for AJ, i know you wasnt sleep enough man but damn, chill wallah, man done nothing bad to you, he's just staying in history, in actor you know
36:12 Actually,if you use PEMDAS which is what youre suppose to use then its 7.5....
This episode made me so hungry because there was no food. I went and cooked in the middle of the night. His heart was in the right place. You tried AJ.
This was the funniest video out of all of them I swear 😂😂😂😂
whys sharky always late tho😭😭😭😭
Niko has definitely been bribed by aj
Immediately at the end of the Adele sing sing, when chunkz said...  "That was the best part of your night" to AJ. I fucking lost it
Chunkz vocals once again are insane
each episode u get a free song sesssion from the boys
I feel so bad for aj, he looked so sad when they didn’t like the food then chunks started to be mean😭
Its very cute how serious AJ was taking it tho😂
Sharky is always late
Chunks needs to do an offical cover of someone like you!! 😫😫
😂said they kill kings here
HARRY!
PETER DINKLAGE OH MY DAYS
yk they should start an acappella group, they actually have a good voice together 🙌
chunkz has the voice of a angel when he sings
"Educated zombie" was spot on ngl
Educated zombie 😭😭😭😭😭
Chunkzz saying shaitaannn thatt isss hella funny
AJ is the nicest one ❤
Oh he’s here nevermind
Where is sharky???
that whole adele segment? best part of the video, hands down
3 6 9 13 20 24 30 34 37 Master of the water
i was certain that AJ would win until i saw that joke of a burger he made and those deserts
them all singing someone like you, absolute vibes 😮‍💨
I died when Chunkz took that stuff from poor hobbit guy lol
I love it how the person behind the scene was roasting them each episode :)
I’ve stayed there before it in Oxford
Chunkz vocals are crazy man could be a soul/RnB singer
26:51 Chunkz voice bruhv
They did aj dirty
I love how niko was really wanted aj to do his best he had no complaints except for the food. Not sharky talking about low effort when he literally cook 😂 in his turn. I think all the hosts should've gotten more time to actually cook since they start cooking just when the guests come it is not really possible to make something good and keep the guests entertained.
7:14 nah the scream caught me off
AJ has been the most considerate host so far
Sharky ?
these guys could make it on Brittan's got latent if they keep lessons up. chunks singing someone like u is amazing
nah i wanna cry nooo, poor aj no i wish i can give him a hug :( u can tell he tried his best awwwww
I have watched this on repeat and I can't figure out what he says / means when he roasts chunkz. Does anyone know
AJJJ I WISH I COULD ATTEND THIS
this is def my fave come dine w me gj aj <3
Hobbit Peter RIP
This was such a fun watch 🥹🥹 the theme was amazing, and so playful. So much effort went into this too, i would've let him win just for the house 🙏🏾
Nah Peter was creepy but hilarious…how can he threaten Niko with death 2 min into the night? 😂
27:40 wholesome 🥹
Ayo where Tf is sharky
Im sorry but how did gandalf do the newspaper trick
5:53 🤣I can't unsee it
How about you guys make a cover 😂😂❤
"yk know I didn't mean nun of that" *looks straight at the camera*🤣🤣
He someone looks less ugly, in that ugly ass costume 😂
7:00
#getthebadgein
chunkz can lowkey sing no cjap
🇬🇧🍔🍅🥬🤣🤣💞
Okay but Chunkz nailed ittt
26:45
Would love to hear chunks recite the Qur'an
29:38 not Harry looking like dude from Get Out 🤣🤣
I have the same staff from my maleficent costume off Amazon 😂 just realized it
Why can they all sing mad impressive 😭 28:22
where is sharky?
28:33 niko and chunks harmony was actually unreal
Chunkz voice tho omg and the way the others joined in  at 28:30 its actually  incredible they all have amazing voices 10/10
The singing omggggg 😍
The way they always find ways to make fun of AJ’s height💀
16:25 oh nahhh
The nose though 😂
That magic is incredible
Bro the hobbits giggling here and there was so cute 😂😂
i love how aj made kenny a seperate dessert because of his upcoming fight yet when everyone knew he didn’t like seafood they didn’t make a separate dish for him. no hate though, love the beta squad! 💪🏼💪🏼
Peter had me laughing so hard when he started laughing when saying “they kill princes here”.
them singing adele oml🥹😹
the kanye and adele singalong, the vibes, gandalf, the opener, aj had the hold world in the palm of their hands and he fumbled it with trash ass food😭
Bro Peter be wilding 😂
Niko is always on timeee 😂
30:56 that handshake 😭😭😭
Is Kenny Muslim
Niki is always early its mad
Criminal that this is the least viewed in the series
OMG I LOVED THERE SINGING AND THE WAY CHUNKZ SANG WAS LIKE A HEAVENLY ANGEL
Leave my Chunkz alone, babes looks good 😂😂
0:55 - 1:18 37:22 - 37:47
Aj was so sad bc his homies weren't happy the feeling when he said it went probably terrible 😔 but we all can see he tried his best with the dessert
Where is sharky
21:08 "small chunks"
I respect the effort with the hobbits and treehouse from AJ
“VICTORIA SPONGE CAKE” 😭😭😭😭 25:10
OH
I love how Chunkz always says wallahi 😂😂
AJ talking about Harry Potter then brings out Gandalf hahaha
Educated zombie ☠️😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
He views the school that is called stillness junior school
His. Name is calldofe
The guy that visited you was in my school for Garry potter night same guy whalahe
Aj is a W
30:37 what’s that face in the background…😥
Niko said the food is not enough AJ yet alone a fully grown human😂😂😂
AJ : "i got sticky chicken skewers made from the famous Okowaymi meat..  they were a creature that we actually made extinct a couple days ago.  Me: so is it chicken or not ? 😂😂😂😂
Peter and Ali are so cute and welcoming, they deserve specials props ❤
No ways he said Educated zombie😭😹😹😹😹
Minute 34:28 let me see it😂😂😂
28:13 chunkz singing ❤
hearing chunkz sing "through the wire" is something i never knew i needed
that harmony gave me goosebumps
*Someone screams* Niko: Oh well, the show must go on
Where the hell is Philly
The hobbits were geeking in the back during the roast 😂
7:10-7:22 OMG WATCH THAT 😂
The song was so cute
I come back the this vodka to hear adelle
theses dine with me videos shows how much they really are friends and it so amazing to see
Excellent series
I remember when the sidemen did this
Are we all just gonna ignore the beautiful harmonization at 28:30 by Chunkz and Niko
Adele 👀 cringe 🤣
Ok but it was so wholesome when they all sang together
chunkz vocals are crazy
This felt like a fever dream
That’s not mini that’s micro. I would have given him zero
Why was the joke ab chunkz  dark can sb explain pleaase
I felt sorry for Aj he did everything seriously 😭
Why guys you locked the button download Because you know very well the ad/advertiser are interrupting us while we are watching
CHUCKS ATE THAT SONGG
“did i just hear someone scream and die?” “oh well the show must go on”😭🤣
surprising the rat had the best one
AJ became my new favorite beta squad!
The staff that the wizard had was Maleficent staff played by Angelina Jolie
chunkz is so greedy bro he was crying over a burger
"nice nose it shrunk a bit" lol Niko's sense of humour is ELITE
sharky was the worst in tha series and was late so whys he chatting soooo much lol
I think we can all agree this was the funniest series Beta has done!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 please make this a yearly occurrence
I respect AJ for putting in so much effort I could see the disappointment on his face in the end when they didn't like the burghers maybe if they liked them he  would've tried harder for the dessert ...good job AJ only ur best is good enough!
aww aj is sweet😭
32:30 talk like an educated zombie 😭😭😭
kanye is a nazi btw
Man chunkz has a beautiful singing voice
Are you guys Muslims
Hands down the most entertaining come dine with me 😂 I can’t believe he scored so low.
It’s Chunks singing for me 😍😍
AJ is mental 😂. The main course is hilarious
Who is the women she is the same in Kennys video
Educated Zombie Was Ridiculous LOL UISH. More HP Roasts.
I love aj n he was robbed.
Chunks said naya to the white lady 😭
The intro music is the best out of all intros 🤣🤣
Sharky in clickbait but not invited because  of that fish.......
nahh this has to be the funniest episode 😂😂😂😂😂
Chunkz should of sang under the influence 😂😂 27:37
nahh kenny what was that noise at 25:51 ☠️☠️
Niko is always so early. Love it.😂
27:09.. when they start singing.. amazing ❤️
26:50 chunkz is nice at singing
They sing Adele in literally every video this is amazing
You  can easily tell Chunkz is friends with Drake by how often he wears OVO
Singing Adele was the best thing of the entire series
Where sharky
can we niko for always being on time#
beta squad singing Adele>>>
The hobbits made it 10x better
2:11 the lil hobbits in the back 😂
Where is sharky?
Got a deliveroo ad 💀
HAPPY BIRTHDAY NIKO!!!
Had to like the video for the Adele singing alone
CHUNKZ VOICE 😍
Best concept so far 😁
chunkz got absolute vocals
banger
It’s the hobbit bopping along to their singing for me 😂 wholesome funny shit
All was good until the Food was brought on the table 😂 but for the Ambient it was very cool and interesting 👏🙂 Bravooo AJ
27:00 Best part 😂
Where's sharky though?
Aj deserved more 😭
5+5 divided by 2= 7.5???
Some 20 year old female in student debt looking at Gandolf like he’s Grandgilf
Let’s appreciate Chunkz’s singing
Best part of this video was the Adele concert
Chunkz said i could inhale it😭😂
The first time a saw this I forgot to clap as well😂😂😂😂
Sharky needs to be replaced. Please, and thank you
what happened to his nose
Chunkz singing is always the best part but niko we heard that harmony too
well, what's embarrassing is that chunks said the line where his rate was 5 but he said 'So if you do that, that's five plus five divided by 2. What's that? Five. but it's wrong. it's actually 7.5. This is the scene in which he says it at 36:05.
Educated zombie is the most accurate way of describing niko… i never knew i needed a quote this much
i literally went to that place last chrstmas. RAHHH🤭
27:20
Chunkz always late
Such a nice friendship u guys have. May Allah protect you and your friendship and let u be friends in paradise💚
Sheesh hit Niko with the educated zombie 😂👏🏾noice
Does anyone know what collection Chunkz’s OVO hoodie is from? 🔥
Idk why the singing made me so happy
Chunkz saying he saw the magic was fake and then it cutting to Kenny saying it was the best magic he’s ever seen, was so funny 😭
I spit out my cherries when Niko said "Peter Dinklage" 😂
This was defo revenge for leaving him hungry 😩😩
give hobbit ali a raise😭
I need chunks to serenade me
Thank you beta squad, love your videos :)
I dont recall Tolkien making hobbits with wands.
Amazing content love you guys. I acc watch you religiously but I would just like to say please stop wearing durags in all your videos, it’s really giving lazy get a trim or thug it out you will look nice regardless. Chunkz please put on proper shoes not everyday slides. Even Filly is starting with the durag and that’s very sad because he usually looks clean
everyone but Niko is a hater. this was the best so far
seeing them sing was so perfect
the bit where they start singing adele is by far the most wholesome moment. just their pure friendship on display.
AJ’s main course was killing me😂
I love AJ his and Nikos were my fave
"An educated zombie" spot on
20:05 CHUNKS 😭😭 💀
My favorites went last 🥳🥳 Love AJ and Niko so much
Where is sharky
I love how niko insults aj without one ounce of simile he be going off left and right 😂😂
can we appreciate chunkz with the dragon ball reference
I have criticised AJ and Niko for not taking mafia content seriously, and ruining the vibe, but this time Sharky was the culprit. HUGE props to AJ and Niko, definitely the most entertaining 👏🏾 . Niko scored the best. Loved the dine with me series.
25:44 AJ full of it 😭😭😭
THE SINGING 😍

AJ was robbed

Where’s sharky? 😂

GODDAMN THAT SINGING TOGETHER WAS SOOO GOOOD
I hope niko goes late when he hosts since he was always on time  For the  Boys as a guest 😭💀
Oh my god, this is so beautiful to watch. The best 1 hour of my life. Absolutely a masterpiece, so heartwarming. This should be worth more than any masterpiece on the world. It has a extra touch of nostalgia with that beautiful music on the background. It even reminds me of how potatoes are harvested. So beautiful of a story. This spinning chip almost tells us its history. This is a great thing. Look at the stunning maneuvers it performed at 37:57 and at 58:36. That is so much talent into one single thing. It‘s unbelievable how a chip can do so many stunning maneuvers. It‘s great to see that there still exist some chips who can do stunning maneuvers like that one. This may sound like nonsense but I cried when I saw what the chip did at 29:56. It‘s so beautiful. Oh god, this chip made me restore my faith in humanity. I‘m proud to see that there are people who post this kind of content. It‘s legendary. But it‘s heartbreaking to see that sometimes advertisements interrupt this amazing experience. Those advertisements absolutely ruin my experience seeing those stunning maneuvers this chip can perform. This chip reminds me of love. So stunning. This chip is the cutest thing I‘ve ever seen. It is impossible that there is anything better than watching this chip perform spins for 1 hour. So great. Congratulations to who posted this chip, you restored my faith in humanity. You inspired me. Very beautiful. It was a life changing experience to me. This spinning chip is so informative. I can see all things in a single spot. This chip is very inspiring. I love how it spins at 29:39. It‘s so inspiring and beautiful. I have even learned how to script in LUA because of this chip. This chip is very inspiring. It‘s heartbreaking to know that some people have never seen this kind of masterpiece. You can even see how inspiring this chip turns from 9:54 to 23:41. This chip has told me how to make bombs in 59:59. So Inspiring. I love how stunning it is to see that chip teach kids how to read at 2:38. It made me cry. This chip solved world hunger in 44:39. This chip has found the cure for cancer on 28:30. So inspiring and cheerful to see at the same time. I‘m stunned in this chip‘s knowledge, so inspiring. I love this chip. It‘s very beautiful to watch. I cried. So much. Those awesome lyrics from 11:03:37 are beautiful. So silly chip. It looked like that Barbie cellphone who sings „Aiaiai I‘m your little butterfly“. It even got the attention of nicocado Avocado. That silly chip made him so mad he deleted kracc bacc‘s channel. Silly chip. Nicocado Avocado now wants to eat him as you can see in 9:03:12. Now Nicocado Avocado activates godmother and starts flying and chasing the chip. The chip almost gets eaten as you can see at 10:10:10. But then the chip summons Brazil by saying that the USA invented the airplane. Brazil got so mad it blew up nicocado Avocado, but nicocado Avocado shortly after invocates Ohio at 12:00:00. You can see the historic timeline here: 00:00 It starts. 01:30 Main character introduced. 02:31 Chip starts a new YouTube channel. 20:37 Chip makes a video ranting Nicocado Avocado. 21:31 The video gets viral. 30:21 his channels gets 1 million subscribers. 32:32 Chip‘s channel has 10 million subscribers. 32:32 Nicocado Avocado sees the rant video. 33:34 Nicocado Avocado starts crying like a baby. 41:33 Nicocado Avocado gets mad 41:34 Nicocado Avocado deletes Kracc Bacc‘s channel. 55:55 Nicocado Avocado gets mad 56:10 Nicocado Avocado eats Orlin  57:27 Nicocado Avocado eats tank 58:30 Nicocado Avocado eats entire city 1:00:00 Nicocado Avocado starts flying. 1:03:37 Nicocado Avocado eats Ohio 1:06:40 Nicocado Avocado gets superpowers  1:10:23 Nicocado Starts flying after Chip 1:11:23 Chip gets scared 1:23:11 Chip calls the army 1:24:11 USA army discovered oil inside nicocado avocado 1:24:11 USA invades Nicocado Avocado  1:24:11 USA gets all Avocado‘s oil 1:24:11 USA gets mad 1:24:11 USA blows nicocado Avocado up 1:24:11 Oil starts raining because nicocado blew up 1:24:12 USA gets happy 1:24:13 Nicocado Avocado returns and launches USA to Saudi Arabia because oil. 1:24:14 Nicocado avocado eats chip 1:25:15 Chip blows up 1:25:16 more oil from Nicocado Avocado rains 1:25:16 USA teleports to nicocado Avocado 1:25:16 USA annexed Nicocado Avocado  1:26:00 USA happy 2:10:20 Chip leaves Nicocado Avocado in Sus way 10:10:10 Brazil mentioned  10:10:10 Brazil mad 10:10:10 Brazil annexed world  10:10:10 Chip is dead 10:10:10 World blows up 10:10:10 10:10:10 10:10:10 10:10:10 10:10:11 Universe is Brazil 10:10:12 Universe dies 10:10:12 Soccer 10:10:12 Aiaiai I’m your little butterfly  10:20:23 Everyone wanna be a superstar 12:00:00 End  This history is:   Heartwarming ✅ Inspiring ✅ Cool ✅ Brazil mentioned ✅ Demonetized ✅ Life changing ✅ Beautiful ✅ Oh my god, this is so beautiful to watch. The best 1 hour of my life. Absolutely a masterpiece, so heartwarming. This should be worth more than any masterpiece on the world. It has a extra touch of nostalgia with that beautiful music on the background. It even reminds me of how potatoes are harvested. So beautiful of a story.

I‘m proud to see that there are people who post this kind of content. It‘s legendary. But it‘s heartbreaking to see that sometimes advertisements interrupt this amazing experience. Those advertisements absolutely ruin my experience seeing those stunning maneuvers this chip can perform. This chip reminds me of love. So stunning. This chip is the cutest thing I‘ve ever seen. It is impossible that there is anything better than watching this chip perform spins for 1 hour. So great. Congratulations to who posted this chip, you restored my faith in humanity. You inspired me. Very beautiful. It was a life changing experience to me. This spinning chip is so informative. I can see all things in a single spot. This chip is very inspiring. I love how it spins at 29:39. It‘s so inspiring and beautiful. I have even learned how to script in LUA because of this chip. This chip is very inspiring. It‘s heartbreaking to know that some people have never seen this kind of masterpiece. You can even see how inspiring this chip turns from 9:54 to 23:41. This chip has told me how to make bombs in 59:59. So Inspiring. I love how stunning it is to see that chip teach kids how to read at 2:38. It made me cry. This chip solved world hunger in 44:39. This chip has found the cure for cancer on 28:30. So inspiring and cheerful to see at the same time. I‘m stunned in this chip‘s knowledge, so inspiring. I love this chip. It‘s very beautiful to watch. I cried. So much. Those awesome lyrics from 11:03:37 are beautiful. So silly chip. It looked like that Barbie cellphone who sings „Aiaiai I‘m your little butterfly“. It even got the attention of nicocado Avocado. That silly chip made him so mad he deleted kracc bacc‘s channel. Silly chip. Nicocado Avocado now wants to eat him as you can see in 9:03:12. Now Nicocado Avocado activates godmother and starts flying and chasing the chip. The chip almost gets eaten as you can see at 10:10:10. But then the chip summons Brazil by saying that the USA invented the airplane. Brazil got so mad it blew up nicocado Avocado, but nicocado Avocado shortly after invocates Ohio at 12:00:00. You can see the historic timeline here: 00:00 It starts. 01:30 Main character introduced. 02:31 Chip starts a new YouTube channel. 20:37 Chip makes a video ranting Nicocado Avocado. 21:31 The video gets viral. 30:21 his channels gets 1 million subscribers. 32:32 Chip‘s channel has 10 million subscribers. 32:32 Nicocado Avocado sees the rant video. 33:34 Nicocado Avocado starts crying like a baby. 41:33 Nicocado Avocado gets mad 41:34 Nicocado Avocado deletes Kracc Bacc‘s channel. 55:55 Nicocado Avocado gets mad 56:10 Nicocado Avocado eats Orlin  57:27 Nicocado Avocado eats tank 58:30 Nicocado Avocado eats entire city 1:00:00 Nicocado Avocado starts flying. 1:03:37 Nicocado Avocado eats Ohio 1:06:40 Nicocado Avocado gets superpowers  1:10:23 Nicocado Starts flying after Chip 1:11:23 Chip gets scared 1:23:11 Chip calls the army 1:24:11 USA army discovered oil inside nicocado avocado 1:24:11 USA invades Nicocado Avocado  1:24:11 USA gets all Avocado‘s oil 1:24:11 USA gets mad 1:24:11 USA blows nicocado Avocado up 1:24:11 Oil starts raining because nicocado blew up 1:24:12 USA gets happy 1:24:13 Nicocado Avocado returns and launches USA to Saudi Arabia because oil. 1:24:14 Nicocado avocado eats chip 1:25:15 Chip blows up 1:25:16 more oil from Nicocado Avocado rains 1:25:16 USA teleports to nicocado Avocado 1:25:16 USA annexed Nicocado Avocado  1:26:00 USA happy 2:10:20 Chip leaves Nicocado Avocado in Sus way 10:10:10 Brazil mentioned  10:10:10 Brazil mad 10:10:10 Brazil annexed world  10:10:10 Chip is dead 10:10:10 World blows up 10:10:10 10:10:10 10:10:10 10:10:10 10:10:11 Universe is Brazil 10:10:12 Universe dies 10:10:12 Soccer 10:10:12 Aiaiai I’m your little butterfly  10:20:23 Everyone wanna be a superstar 12:00:00 End  This history is:   Heartwarming ✅ Inspiring ✅ Cool ✅ Brazil mentioned ✅ Demonetized ✅ Life changing ✅ Beautiful ✅ U̶̲̭̾͑́͘̚w̴̢̨͖͈͙̜̟͍̘͛Ŭ̵̬̣̣̟͙̞̣̻͕̃̂̉͒̃̌̓͋͑͛͠͠
AJ does have a dorito head and I'm Somali like him to
They should get stormzy to do a performance
Ok but the picking on kenny jokes is getting sad now lol like we got to give that man his flowers he does very well!!
Please come to south Africa ❤️
I think everyone would love a master chef beta squad edition
Chunkz actually said Naya 😂
He should have brought Bradley 😂
LOVING the mr beast thumbnails
You said Saturday where’s the vid
British humor is so whack. Those roast wouldve gotten him boo'd off the stage in America
The hobbits are killing me 😭
Where is sharky
When is niko going to cook
chunks is a goated singer
bruh five plus five divided by 2 is 7.5
I think AJ did a really good job! If the food wasn’t that small they would have rated higher, but yay AJ
y’all are the best, thanks for all the laughs 🤍
The effort AJ puts into the character should get him high numbers. Dessert was bad. Chunkz got a voice. Tell Sharky to arrive 1.5hrs earlier than everyone else. Great content
Not gonna lie enjoyed all the come dine with me episodes but I think they saved the best till last I have high hopes for the one, the only, the legend Niko!
cant wait for nico videoooo
Not me full singing adel with them drunk 😎
chunkz said naya lol
Niko playing favourites to save himself from being abused in his house
Fuckin love chunky boy singin btw
I know Niko is going to DELIVER MADNESS!!! can’t wait
Bro I love the intro man
I hope Adele sees this, that was such a beautiful moment.💖💯
Nahh why do I see educated zombie 😭😭
These man come to a place for hobbits and the menu says MINI and they expect something else? These man... 🤣🤣🤣🤣
can't wait for niko's
Sharky took the piss with his timing😭
Nikos always on time, I acc rate that
Aj always tries his best!
We need to see a rap battle tournament with all the boys, that video would bang 🔥🔥🔥
Out of the 1.9 million people that watched this 2.6k people commented horendes
They need to keep doing this kind of series, Especially to see if anyone's cooking gets better overtime. Its such a hit! and aww poor AJ his food was better than Kenny's but his friends are greedy giants
i really hope niko prepares a karoke night which will make his score higher in my opinion
💕💓
(27:13) Fr can we have a Chunks full cover of Somone Like You?
that one hobit is so fine.
niko: did I jst hear someone scream and die..oh well the show must go on" hahahah
Chunks def hungover in this one 😂
28:31 the best accidental harmony ever
WAITING FOR NIKOOOO EPISODE
Rubbish video
Beta squad for some reason push the Chunkz and Niko propaganda. Mafia one of em wins and compared to AJs night Chunkz shouldn’t still be leading
It’s so funny he talks sh1t about everyone else and then he gives them that
Sharky is one to talk considering the disastrous episode he had 🤭
BEST ONE YET
That singing gave me chills I was singing along
27:33 best part of the vid nahhhh
wait did he get dwarves or  yutes to play the hobbits?
chunks singing is crazy
Last but not least niko
Seeing Niko impressed you need to know that you doing a very good job😹
On my mum I thought that was Santan not HP when he opened the door
Where was sharky??
Hobbit land? Really? Weird
Take chip off narration 🙏🏽
I laughed so hard
Sharky has a tiktok personality foreal
why is every video with subtitles? just curious
Why his nose so big💀💀😟😟
CHUNKZ VOICE THO!😁
Chunkz singing is like oh my goodness 😳 angels exist 🤧❤️ And the beta squad energy is like 😌❤️ happiness exists.....
Where was sharky
Aj so cute 🥹
Niko has been super critical of everyone so I’m excited to see what he Wil do 😂
Everytime you bring Niko i am dead ...i am dead  by his zombie education intellect He is crazy......10/10
The song they all sang, was beautiful ❤️
Make this downloadable please
28:00 monkeys
I been waiting for aj and niko aah
28:37 Boy Band👀👀😻😻
Trust and believe in God for he cares for you and loves you. Remember to repent of your sins daily as God is coming soon and we don’t the day or hour so be prepared. Be blessed
Niko AKA the educated zombie 😂 I’m dead
Chunkz is still the only one who cooked all of his food by himself 😢
Okay his menu looks delicious
I was waiting for sharky tho
I am just waiting for Nikos to come out cause he is such a hypocrite his better be the best or all his complaining would go to waste
27:27
Five plus five divided by 2 is 7.5 36:10
Ali and peter are so adorable and funny, the whole video gave off such a cozy warm feeling, AJ is so creative with it I loved it
wheres that place?
Chunks “I could of inhaled it SHWOOOP “ killed meeeee😭
I don't really know much about Gandolf and them man there... obviously he just does magic and em tingz😂
Hobbits casting magic
I wait for these episodes :DDDD
Beta Squad singing was my favourite moment of the night.
Bro that magician was ACTUALLY really interesting to watch omds!!!!
Omg chunkz voice Is the best
the melon with chocolate sauce had me dying
Where is sharky
Can’t lie the day chunkz quit music still breaks my heart, every time I get to hear him sing, oh loooooooord 😍😍😍🥰🥹
Harry Pinero roasting them is the best entertainment so far!!!!!!
Niko: “You calling me a king” 😊  Hobbit: “ beware they kill the kings here”😅😂😂😂  Niko: 😐
What happened to sharky?
WAITING FOR NIKOS EPISODE
niko with that tiny glass 😭
Chunkz singing is off the charts
who is that lady?
17:48. 🤣🤣🤣
28:14 the vocals!
I wish more of them actuallycooked the food like chunkzzz
I love niko
I loved this whole episode. The hobbits added so much to it and it all seemed like a very fun time for everyone
This *NEEDS* to be a permanent series! I'm enjoying this so much! 🤣
If AJ had made bigger mains after the small ones I know he would’ve done way better. The night was really good and organised
I could not be around this bunch especially AJ irritating.
Gandalf Bruh! You are an amazing magician wow
I already know nikos episode will blow up
my fave so far 😍😍
Chunks is kinda a dick for no reason. This woulda been a better video of Chunks didn’t have such a Bad Attitude
I actually loved Aj’s dine with me. He went more for the Experience not the food 10/10 from me
Did chunkz really callthe lady/cook “naayaa” or did I hear something else? lol 20:05  where my Somali people ?😂
Aww aj actually went sad when they didnt like his food😭
Niko will be the winner 😂🔥
chunkz is such a good singer
Wheres sharky?
OMG HOW DID AJ GET A HIGHER SCIRE THAN KEENY CUZ KEENYS ENTERTAINMENT IS THE BEST
Tell me how i shazam them singing and it pulled through
Sharky is always late🤣
love it
Ok but why is Sharky so damn cute 🤔🥰
the fact that sharky's always late and his episode was so chaotic is hilarious 😅 can't wait to see how niko does.
It's how sad AJ was that he couldn't make his friends happy and tried to make it up to them, he's a sweet friend, honestly 😂❤️
Their content keeps getting better every time and I love itTheir content keeps getting better every time and I love it
Editing team, thank you for the Subtitles man. I know how much work it can be and i just want you to know someone appreciates your work. Thanks guys
They're really making me wait for Niko's
AJ AND NIKO ALWAYS COME TOGETHER TO EVERYONESCOME DINE WITH ME🤣
Aj’s episode was so far the most entertaining, can’t wait to see what Niko does!
let's talk about how Niko is always punctual
Cant even lie beta squad is one of the best channels, they are all soo funny unlike some groups who are a bit dull on their own all these guys are just genuinely funny
They're really making me wait for Niko's 😂
AJ AND NIKO ALWAYS COME TOGETHER TO EVERYONESCOME DINE WITH ME🤣
aj and niko has got to be the most elite duo in this series 😂
This series is legitimately my favorite thing Beta Squad has ever done. I can't get enough of it they gotta do more episodes series where each week one member is the hosting a challenge and the others are judging.This series is legitimately my favorite thing Beta Squad has ever done. I can't get enough of it they gotta do more episodes series where each week one member is the hosting a challenge and the others are judging.
the way sharky has no time management in every episode is hilarious
Probably the most wholesome moment in Beta Squad, the way everyone is vibing and AJ randomly joins is perfect
Chunkz was the only one to cook the entire menu by himself and he's done the best so far 😂😂
I think there's not a single man in the multiverse that Niko hasn't accused of having bad breath.
These have been one of the best series on Youtube recently, Beta Squad never flops
Who didn’t expect AJ to put in maximum effort into this challenge, this is why is my favourite AJ the goat, poor guy was actually sad when they didn’t like the food
Niko being chaotic throughout the series but at the end saying "all that matters is I had a good time with my friends" is wholesome
Niko's voice being described as an "educated zombie" is mental 😂
can we appreciate niko for always being on time?
I'm more of a come entertain with me type of guy lol
Best series on youtube atm
@ some point i thought chunkz was the second bit of the entertainment 😂😂😂 buh hRry penero came thro
When AJ opened the garage door I thought it was Dave… to tell you I was disappointed sorry HP
Where’s sharky
Harry violated Niko when he said he talks like an educated Zombie 💀😫
Why have ya all got the same do rag on
Why is chunkz so good at singing
aj serving chocolate syrup on honeydew had me dying
Bea Squad are making our 2023 better
27:05 chunkz really saved the night and made my day 🤍
I hope chunkz will win tho. He's the only one who cooked everything 100% by himself, and the food was good too.
😂
BetaSquad>>>Sidemen
Why was Sharky not in the video
Dawg, broskii ain't ever used a knife in his life lol his skills are horrible 😂 😂
Happy 4 year anniversary beta squad so much love ❤️ 🎉
Which song does chunkz sing @ 26:52
Sharky even says “it’s come fine with me” but yet he doesn’t even show up for the starter??
The roasting part where they all had to laugh despite d fact dey felt pained
Oh a least we know niko won congrats 🎉 niko
Its Chunks singing part for me 😊 damn......
CHUNKSSS VOCALSSS THO
https://youtube.com/shorts/NJFImcfXOAg?feature=share cute Puppy sisters!!!
I LOVE THEM EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM THEY ALWAYS MAKE MY DAY THEIR FRIENDSHIP IS WHOLESOME  AND WHEN THEY ALL JUMPED WHEN HP WALKED IN THESE PPL ARE JUST AMAZING
*Chunkz be hitting that notes perfect*

The singing was mental
chunkz singing is so so so beautiful
HEHEEHEHEHE

When they all sang together was so wholesome honestly:’))
Cm

Sharky looks so baked in all these vids
Chunks vocals 🥺🥹
They should do a public Vote out of all of their Come Dine videos and whoever wins gets to enjoy a dinner and service made by the rest of the boys
Not me singing someone like you with them in my house
Niko is always on time ,love that
Why sharky keeps coming late to the videos? He needs some time management.
AJ WAS ROBBED
who is the woman, thats helping them in the kitchen?
The way that the hobbits jumped up and down when they saw the wizard 🤣
W
Chunks sings Adele I hit like, simple .
7:07 this is so funny 💀
I actually have no idea how he’s done that newspaper trick wtf😂
26:43

I just know Niko is going to top this but this one was the most entertaining so far.
i love this, do more?!!!
Because of this video I will not miss a Beta Squad video ever! I only started watching them this week 😂 watched a lot of older videos and I have a lot more to catch up on 😍
Awww this is my fav so far after chunks lol
The special guest..... It's AJ for crying out loud!!, there had to be some form of violence. 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I knew he was being too nice for comfort lol

Where is sharky??
sharky can’t say nothing after his episode and then turning up after the starter 💀
I genuinely don’t understand how people don’t know too cook

27:10
Harry on Niko being a Zombie is spot on. I can't lie 😂😂
So far this is the best one 😊
AJ was done dirty there by everyone except Niko!
Kenny has 0 rhythym😅
AJS WAS BETTER THAN CHUNKZ SCAM
We all know why they’re saving nikos come dine with me for last
"What's the bullsh**t Melon and chocolate you gave us? "💀😭
Big A+ for effort  from AJ honestly! Messed up here and there but he really put his heart into it. Wish the boys were a little bit supportive regardless
Oh shush chunkz! Gandalf ate !😂
Sharky being late 😂
I love sharky but mans always sooo late. Jeez😭
aj really is the sweetest little mouse
Chunks vocals tho ♥️.
32:32 Educated Zombie that’s wilddd 😂😭😭😭😭😭
28:38 vibesss man
I loved how Niko was toxic and tough with everyone except with AJ
Na AJ was actually doing good, shambles 😂😭
Cold
Them all singing Adele was so wholesome I can’t
Really enjoy this series, big ups
Okay chunks with that falsetto! 🔥
Best episode so far! Even Chunk's episode wasn't this golden
its Wednesday u know what that meansss
In my opinion.. beta squad > sidemen 🫡
😭😭
Chunkz singing saved aj’s meal 😂😂
After Niko you guys need to do another mafia top tier entertainment
AJ:..JESUS.."😂😂😂
Nah the singing part made the WHOLE Video, that was just WOW
Kenny and Niko's reactions after their roasts🤣🤣🤣
BETA SQUAD TOP TIER....MENTALLLL
Nah Niko talking like an educated zombie took me out🤣🤣
There’s just no way just no way. I was just watching the hobbit. good video But why didn’t AJ invite you guys to his rat lair 😂😂😂😂😂 💀
I guarantee that nikos come dine with me will be the best
Can we get so mafia?
NIKO DEF GONNA WIN
nahh educated zombie LMFAOOOOOOOOOOO
this falloff is harder than dele allis career
Kenny is so nice and cute!
Chip is so unfunny
i swear am hooked on Beta squad, this series man.

Niko is legendary

Believe in Jesus — the Son of God. Jesus say, "But when the Son of man comes, will there be any faith on earth?"

Chip makes me wanna smash my forehead into a volcano
26:50 that voice from Chunkz ffs i would kill to have that voice. WOW
Bit mad how there's always someone late surly they have this down by now kinda ruins the videos a little
chunkz has actually got some proper vocals you know.
Aj is lowkey a sweetheart. 💕
28:00 whats the name of the song
When Chunkz sings >>>>
Chunkz solo? >>>>>>>>>
Chunkz voice being the soul of this three man boy band
Were abouts is this and how can i rent it , this is sick!
Great series - loving the longer format where each member shines
Chunks singing is so beautiful
Icl the intros goated
Why can't it be downloaded?
Loved this episode❤️❤️
that actually started of really well until they got AJ sized burgers
We love harry❤️❤️😂🥳🥳
So much fun,Thanks Beta Squad just made my night!
Niko is so funny😭😭
Not only did Sharky get the lowest score, he also turned up late to everyone else’s meals. The guy does not care.
That chunkz solo was brilliant 👏
Chunkz saying he could have inhaled the burgers is killing me 🤣🤣🤣
Chunkz ain’t hit the same since he hit darkest 🤡 attitude is tired
The Adele cover was amazing...minus the off beat banging on the table.
Them burgers was the same size as a penny
Lol
AJ defo wins after this
If chunks doesn't win oml
27:31 BAHHAHAHAHAHAHHA
5+5\2=7.5
i love the come dine with me series
AJ calling Jesus ? What ? 4:50 are you Muslim AJ or not ?
Icl when I first saw harry I thought it was dave
i love the effort AJ put into this!! ❤
Love your videos
I feel bad for AJ… he tried so hard with the location and costumes but what was he thinking with the food 🤦🏾‍♀️🤣
Wallah this was the best one ☝️ 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
the intro music never fails to make me laugh 💀
the best ep so far
this one is the best one so far💯 loved it
26:52 & 28:17 bro chunkz voice is so beautiful ❤️❤️
mental how Kenny was complaining about the quality of food when in his video it reeked
THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST ONE🎊🔥 AJ SMASHED IT🦾
This series is absolutely amazing so original and creative I love it I don't want it to end:(  (I have really high hopes for Niko don't let me down)
18:30 where I left ofg
this was the best ep so far, i got a feeling niko's one will be the best since its last
This was the best especially the singing part 😍
nah chunks is hatingggg🤣
they got harry potter and the lord of the rings mixed up lol
Niko: The guest is a lot trailer than AJ. It's Peter Dinklage   😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Violation!
Nikos ep is going to be sick!
AJ fumbling the desserts, I've never laughed so hard in this series
Sharky - so what’s that bull sh - the melon and chocolate  Aj - oh that’s what do u call it to get the flavour out your mouth Kenny - with his drums (laugh)
I actually cannot believe how good that Adele part was
Niko  favouring Aj the other days no remorse today all that matters is enjoying with your friends
Goat squad

https://youtube.com/@siyamcw6.5bviews56
AJ is so creative and a natural entertainer. Gotta give it to Beta Squad, they're smashing it. 💚
Lol
Where is sharkyyyyyyy
chunkz is so fucking talented his voicee omdss
Can't wait to see Niko's episode dude!
Not AJ saying the melon and chocolate was the palate cleanser dfkm🤣
Ali the hobbit is kinda …
My friend said AJ did something to his face, I don’t see a difference, am I right? 😅
I don’t get the roast towards chunks saying he’s taking religious and weight’s seriously
The singing was so funny
bro that HP joke about Chunkz💀💀💀💀💀
cant wait for Niko's come dine with me
i just know this is gunna be an absolute train wreck and i’m so excited.
16:30 start reading ayatul kursi 3 times (CAWDA billlllHhhhh) shaytan is with him lol
I wish Chunkz did music cos I could listen to him sing all day 😭
Subscribe to Technoblade?
Just release the adele cover with boys on backgrounds for xmas! feat. Stormzy on a rap.  do it for chairty...
the song was the best part of this episode
Gendalf the 🐐
Nahhh, AJ deserves to win by FAR
best youtube series of 2023
Controversial take but if you arrive up to 15 minutes late you can't give less than a 3. If you arrive more than 15 min late to 30 min late like Chunkz, you can't give less than a 5. Over an hour like Sharky and you can't give lower than a 7
16:24 How tho you can see the parts that are ripped and a second later its back to normal
Come dine with me is sik
wheres sharky
This is one of the best series the beta squad has ever done this is so funny 😂😂😂
This is interesting
Where is sharks
Bruh Sharky came so late
Aj explaining his dessert was the funniest thing😂😂😂😂
What is the name of the song they play at the start of the video
Lol
Nah this is gold 😭
Kenny doesn't know what he is doing
Is no one gonna talk about how aj cuts the chicken🤣🤣🤣
Aj is easily one of the most creative beta squad members next to niko
Chunckz throwing vocals like it’s normal 😂 big up my man ✊🏽
Educated zombie LMAO.
where is sharky???????
Niko my love❤️ #TeamNiko
Aj's knife cutting technique is atrocious
Best series in the beta squad history 🥹🫶. Would love to see one with filly in it
The roasts were worse than naem's
I love how aj really trying to entertain all of him friends
honestly the song part was amazing it just shows their incredible friendship
He ruined it for himself. Just make bigger stuff and he would gotten a 8 average score.
What happened to yung filly
17:34 the way sharky was 2 hours late💀
how sharky gonna critique that
😂😂😂
28:27 chunks voice is insanly good
Chunkz is the funniest😂
Niko is being bias
Can you guys after niko's come dine with me post a video where there is children vs 1 grown up or something like that because really want to see it???
Such a good show! pls more of these kinds of videos
Coming 2 hours late is wildddd
Niko is going to win
Sharks showing up 2 hrs late 😂
Can we just take a moment to respect that awkward handshake Harry and AJ had, truly remarkable 😔🫡
Sharky saying about the food, the guy was 2 hours late..
AJ started off strong. It all went downhill when he served them those tiny ass burgers 🤣
I LOVE YOU NIKOOOO 🥰 ROOTING FOR YOU!!! 🤭❤️
You're a winner in my eyes bro
How is chunks have higher score than this lol
He should have won wtf
Niko is the bias mf is
Absolutely love this series.  Love to see them do more remakes of British shows.
that adele cover was actually crazy
Sharky complaining when he came late 😂

Peter is the highlight of this vid
Niko sipping from a shot glass at 9:30 😂
Y'all haters, he should have gotten higher grades
Okay I’m officially team AJ Supremacy
Honestly aj was the best so far
I’m thinking being the final person will win. The trailer seems banging so far
Chunkz’ voiceeeeeee🥺
LMAOOOOOOOO RIGATONI 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I didn't finish the last epissode because I was angry and disgusted when I saw white women helping kenny cook jollof such a disgrace -Jollof is Africa Even a nigeria youth would cook it better than any white lady
Hello am from Cameroon found in Africa and i love ur videos
Educated Zombie🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I was singing  along  to Adele tune🥳🥳💯💯
Will watch when I get home but I know niko and aj won’t let me down
19:00
where sharky at still
this series is the best thing i've seen in my life
I know Chunkz can sing like that, But did yall peep sharky?👀
24:44 how can sharky talk about getting a random cake and adding whipped cream and sprinkles when that's essentially what he did with his dessert- cupcakes
awh i feel sorry for aj cause he acc made the stuff and his whole theme was small food and he was ACC trying and gave everyone things in consideration like drinks and snacks and when they didn't like it he tried so sincerely to fix it, he's such a nice guy
Can’t lie that newspaper trick was unreal
That chunkz solo was cold
The love they have for Harry is beautiful
Has anyone ever noticed AJ has 0 sense for rythm (how do u spell that?) 😂
What happened to Sharky ?
harry was dead bro, had a serious chance for suttin funny
eyo chunkz got vocals
1 min and 52 sec in I love the THEME   lol I make AJ plan a party  theme for kids or something man on point with the theme idea lol love it 🥳
where is sharky?
Peter carried this episode 😂😂
Don't know about the food but he smashed the vibes
best series no cap
Chunkz sabotaging everyone else how did he get 5/5 entertainment then a 0 for food when he said it was okay 😭😭😭
14:21   Every time he blew I almost died - Nikolas omilana
BRO AJ IS SO FUNNY 😭😭
Chunkz got top tier vocals
Why does aj makes small food
This should’ve gotten a way higher score!!!
Petition to get the squad, too release a cover of Adele!
Hobbits actually have a huge appetite if you read the books. They eat more than most humans
this vid was so wholesome!! i loved it❤️😭
Bruv the intro song is my fav thing now!
Chunks voice is 🤌
The singing at 28:28
#seehttps://studio.youtube.com/video/rQTyT6cxOpc/edit
wow chunkz can sing
Bless AJ he was really trying x
Sharky 2 hours late looool
30:14 they were so excited to see Harry, that was so wholesome.
4:48 when Hobbit Peter said “be aware they kill the kings here” was so funny 😭😭
Covering adele is my top 5 beta squad moment so sweet and wholsome. Small moments like these show you that they are amazing
Good lord lads, actually got goosebumps from that little symphony 😂 solid effort
Beta squad>>>> sidemen
Why was he confused with the dish name? Did they not set up this whole thing themselves? Producers did this for them?
I love chunkz but him throwing the bowl was disrespectful
this trailer is mental🤣
Them singing Adele 😭🫱🏾‍🫲🏿
"he works for shaitan" im deadd💀💀💀
All aj gave to the beta squad for dessert was wipped cream
HP ON KENNY LOL😂 ...FACT!
Mean while filly’s at home feeling sour he’s not invited 😂
It’s so funny when Chunkz is flaming the tricks and then it cuts to Kenny going “those were the best tricks I seen my whole life” 😭😭😭😭
UK has no culture , their only culture is the "royal family" 😂😂how sad is that😂😂😂
Educated zombie LMAO
im so exited for niko and i feel like he is gonna wi
chunks defo has a temper and was hangry. Poor AJ felt bad, for me, the best night so far in terms of vibes and entertainment.
Was that Digga D under the hobbit costume
what's Claire's IG?
Educated zombie!!!😂😂😂 HARRY YANOE!!😄😃😂
Educated zombie 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The tallest and the shortest guy in the squad, the best duo.
nah but why is EDUCATED ZOMBIE SO ACCURTATEEEE HAHAHAHSHSHDJJF
Lmfaoooooooo 16:48
37:24 NIKOOOOO
Bruh 5+5/2 is 7.5 😂😭😭😭
AJ should of got scored higher
26:56 what song was chunkz singing?
Chunkz would cry so bad if someone said what he said about ajs entertainment about his lol
28:25 LOVE THIS BIT
can we appreciate niko for always being on time?
chunkz has the best voice
lol
JUSTICE FOR PETER
Chunkz voice is so angelic 😭😍😍
This one is the best by far
I guess after looking the trailer of niko he is going to take the dub
Harry Pinero , the boy who lived….too long  😂
This is better then the other ones
Short Hobbit - Kenny is the dbest member man
That was a creature that we made extinct a few days ago 😭🤣😂
aw
i physically cannot wait for niko's episode, best for last
If he actually made great food he would arguably be the one with the highest ratings
Wow, this is one of the best episodes so far entertaiment wise, good job AJ
I genuinely started tearing up when they started singing Adelle, I had never focused on the lyrics of the song, and when I read them it took me back in time 🥲
im sorry but this has to be the funniest one yet LMFAO
Chunkz, lad, please stop saying Wallah so much lol... You're really overdoing it now, and I'm not muslim (not even religious), but aren't you pretty much using Allahs name in vain here? Maybe he doesn't care as much about that as 'god' does, fuck knows aha
Chippos narrating is underrated, you can see the practice on the fellas mysteries has paid off there aha
Straight up. Chunkz seems like a sour guy. Niko is the most genuine guy.
I love how ur pumping these out let’s go ❤
Where was Sharky 😢
This Adele cover is the best I've ever heard. No cap.
Best episode by far
I want to download this video plzz
chunks's voice is smth else bruh its so good
YESSSSSSS
The intro song gets me every time! 🤪🤪
Anyone else eating dinner while watching this? 😂
why did chunkz and nikos voice go perfectly together
Sharky is always late 🤣 we are soulmates 💜
Chucky is the only one who can actually sing 😭 The rest ruin it
AJ Please man😩😂💀😭
Chunkzs singing is incredible😻😻
Chunkz vocals🖌️
Aj is too funny 😭😭
AJ is just too hilarious keeping up with the Hobbit theme 🤣
What the fuck how is chunkz that good at singing
Harsh on the little triangle head. He's little cant weigh more than 55kg but his was the best so far
best  series man
AJ deserved better for this. Man acc tried lmao
Bro those votes were horrendous AJs was definitely better than Chunkz
Their group song was more entertaining
Peter and Ali stole the show.
considering how he tore into everyone, I’d have scored AJ 0.5 for the food and 4 for entertainment cos of HP. The mad man said “Get out!”😂
Ali is so entertaining
Where is sharky
Beta squad and sidemen>>>>any other YouTube groups fr
Sharky saying the food was shit having missed the starter which was good was making me fuming for AJ 😂
I don't get the chunkz roast one
non of these men have ever used a knife in their life lmao
Niko is still the funniest in the group 😂😂 weird and serious clown 🤡
Niko’s Peter Dinklage joke killed me 😂
I don’t think you guys are aware of how many times you casually say the Lord’s name in vein which is considered blasphemous. I strongly urge you to ask for forgiveness and repent of your sins. May Jesus Christ have mercy on your souls and I pray you turn to Him soon. I say this out of love.
Sharky the great late comer 😂😂
Chunkz is so rude
We need this to be a thing they do every 6 months cause this series is my favorite
27:14 such a vibe tbh when they start singing bro it’s incredible
World sexiest man🗿
Who didn’t expect AJ to put in maximum effort into this challenge, this is why is my favourite AJ the goat, poor guy was actually sad when they didn’t like the food
the reactions OMG
Should be a crime to have someone else cooking for you 🤣
I'm LOVING the beta squad 'come dine with me'. Thanks for brightening my day! Looking forward to Niko's night 🙏
Great singing chunkz!
16:26 wtf
Niko giving slops to AJ the whole series is to funny 😭
29:50 got me xDDDDDDDDD
AJ has upped his game when it comes to production. legend
Not us watching ratatouille
Bra didn’t know an Adele rendezvous was going to happen video
I just wanna see Niko 😂😂😂😂
The transition between harry roasting Niko 32:30 to Niko’s interview 32:38 is so accurate 😂🧟‍♂️
can't wait for Nikoooooo!!!
Okay but the singing part got to me I love that they just so chilled and sing together and sound so amazing
Some of my fave parts of this vid:  - when peter said they kill kings here and couldn’t stay in character and started laughing  - how much AJ cares for his friends, making seperate desserts for Kenny, good entertainment, location etc  - Chunkz singing with them all  - the educated zombie roast 😂😭  - the hobbits vibing when chunkz sang  - how Aj completely ignored the menu and freestyled the desserts lmao, serving melon w choc sauce  - Niko’s comments at the end of the night  - how angry they got over the mini burgers lmao  - chunk stealing the magic staff from the hobbit at the end  -chunkz calling the hobbit a long nosed yute 😂  - the whole video ❤
Niko Wins 🔥 Trailer Speaks Man
☢︎petitionn for the editor to stop using the annoying flute intro ☢︎
Nahh niko riding mad d
yall chunkz voice left me with goosebumps😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
am I the only one who hates chip being the host? hr isn't funny and makes it boring in all the eps
LMAO when the hobbit went rogue, and started talking about killing kings 🤣 I can’t breathheeeee 5:00
Aghhh I love AJ so much! Was rooting for him so badly cuz I know he can kinda cook!
sharky is collecting massive Ls this series
This is the best 😂😂😂😂😂 so funny
this aint it
Do one with HP, Darkest and FILLYY
My prediction was right!!! Aj’s score was in between Kenny’s & Chunk’s score. It was going so well but then fell off with food. If only Aj had taken that part more seriously. Niko is always showing up early to everyone’s places so I wouldnt be surprised if he starts his stuff early too lol. I do hope he has good hospitality since he is always mentioning it in the other squad member’s episodes. I predict Chunkz will win overall & Niko will be a close second since the entertainment will be seemingly excellent with Sumo wrestlers but if there’s sea food which is common in Japanese cuisine then Aj might give a lower rating.
27:00 was absolutely amazing🥲🫂
chunks has mad vocals
When beta squad uploads! My mood lightens up😭💗
Nikos episode is just gonna be him trolling his friends 😂😂
Best beta squad moment. When the boys performed Adele.
Chunk just called water "Wats"😭
Sharky acting brazy like he didn’t cook up some frozen fish that he got help with, spilling drinks and throwing straws on guests, and showing up late?  Sharky, you’re my guy but it seems my guy is a joke man 😅
36:50 is the funniest moment  I was expecting that 😂😂😂😂
Stealing NPC man’s music 🤣
Where’s Sharky? 🥺😭😭
Dobby :(
Chunkz voice tho? never disappoint 🔥🔥
The more cowbell guy needs to come in and say this video needs more sharky
I’ve genuinely loved this series, it’s been fun. I would watch a second series of this in the future, ngl
27:12 I know im not the only one who joined along to sing!
We need a Beta Squad cover album
"he works with the shaitan" 😂😂
Beta squad you need to make it longer, we need to see more
Guys you really scored low on this one. AJ you deserve better score man that was fantastic.
30:12 I love their reaction when they saw him😂😂
28:18🙌
whats that theme song i wana know it sooo  badlyyy
this is the best series i have ever watched im going to be sad when it's over IM SO EXCITED FOR NIKOS DOJO OMGGG
I just love how excited they were to see harry pinero 😅🥰.
It was a wonderful episode, well done @AJ and the best part Niko was very fair to his guy🙌
the ratings were more rigged than kennys fights
Chunkz Adele cover was actually beautiful
Them singing at the end was the best moment so far in the series. Chunkz singing and the rest also singing was just a vibe.
Finally I can’t wait for Niko’s turn
27:30 🥰😁
chunkz covering adele will always have my heart omg
chunkz is actually such a good singer
“I could’ve inhaled it” I COULDNT STOP LAUGHING
Beta squad made me cry!
it was the hobbits for me
Did i miss the sumo wrestling?
Aj would have got a 2 from me😅😅horrendous food
The little food was soo funny 😂🤣
this was the shortest video of the series... oh wait u even made fun of him being short by shortening the video length.
Such a good video. Beta squad needs to do more series like this where weekly it’s a challenge and someone host something  every week
I love when Chunkz sings
We need more series like these. Such entertaining content to watch while eating food or etc
20% of the words that come out of Chunks's mouth are currently "wallahi". Surely this has to stop at some point ... no?
I think they were a little hard on AJ man 😂😂
sounds more like dobby than hobbits lol
20:05 “naayaa” 😂😂😂
Idk why I always think sharky looks like teks sinatra
I swear Peter thought he was a vampire not a hobbit 😂
I love it, but why do the beta squad love dressing up so much 😂
Sharky you literally weren't there lmaoooo
Next episode is going to be crazy with Niko
Chunkz singing is crazy 💯💯💯
🔥🔥🔥
The intro is so good🔥
All the boys singing adele and chunkz hitting those notes was beautiful 😢
EDUCATED ZOMBIE🤣🤣🤣I COULD NEVER FIND THE RIGHT WORDS TO DESCRIBE THE WAY NIKO TALKS BUT THIS??? SPOT ON💀💀💀
this shit was so funny omg
That singing part was so good..genuinely made this my favorite beta squad video LOL
This was the best episode!!!
I h
gay
Your spoiling us with all of these videos
just like kenny’s fight ts was rigged
Am I the only one who thought any of them are gonna get Dua Lipa? Coz i saw chunkz on dua lipas story 😭
imma be honest i think AJs has been the best one
AJ the filthy rat 🐀 finally cooked food for his friends
I love harry but that wasn’t funny lol
whenever they break into a song the episode is an instant classic
Chunkz singing gave me chills
Chunks killed it on that singing part 🔥
Brooo Chunkz got that angel voice
Chunkz voice crazy
Aj put 000000 effort in the food wallahi 😂😂😂
Chippppooooo
Brilliant editing at 12:00
Sharky's always last🤣😂😂😂
chunkz ate the singing UPP 28:27
the singing is everything omg 28:07
Naya is CRAZYYY😂
Started feeling bad for the guy
“Educated zombie 🧑‍🎓🧟‍♀️ “ elite for HP 😂
Nice to see🔽organize such a nice diner
That mf acapella bro
Of course chunkz has the best rating since he’s the best cook there, it’s all about the food
I see 6 GOATS IN ONE VIDEO
Niko can actually sing so good proud 🫶🏼
So far, it seems like Chunkz had the best food, AJ had the best entertainment and Sharky was just horrible.
I love you Gandalf! Amazing personality
I  clapped in real life for that performance from the boys. Wow!
Niko punctuality is unmatched. He is first all the time.
Shout out to the hobbits. Extras can really make or break the vibe but they understood
AJ is the best beta squad member. He is the reason beta squad revived due to hide and seek videos on his channel. He never disappoints
Niko obviously won this challenge
Aj got robbed
Why Niko is always early to dinner 😂
no way Chunkz called her naya
You have to rate the entertainment on this one, but those portions couldn't feed a mouse bro 💀
Thank you Chunks I've been looking for that song forever and forgot the name and made my own lyrics hahaha
It's nice to know that Harry backed out of the Sidemen roast to roast his boys instead 😂
i love beta squad dude omg😭
AJ got Tobi nose
I fw chunkz wlh 😂
them being so excited to see HP was so wholesome
i didn't understand chunkz' roast 😭
Come dine with me  Beta squad>>>>>Sidemen. Sidemen didn't really put much effort into that and were busy at that time do it needs a redo
WERE IS SHARKJY"
28:16 chunkz's voice be makin my balls quiver like a cold stray dog this dude is gifted
educated zombie FUCK ARFFFF MAN i laughed at that one for 5 minutes 💀😭😭😭
26:51 was amazing D: chunks voice  <3
Man I wish I was a beta squad member😢
Princess Clairdo ?? NAYA !!!!! 😂😂😂😂
These people really have hilarious things to say about each other especially Niko 🤣🤣 Aj really cook by himself and took this seriously, thought of all member, he will be cheating his way. Good job
the group chemistry when they started singing adele was popping looool peter the hobbit was sick and tired tho
Aj is amazing 😂
ngl chunkz acoustics were FELT, that man can sing!
KENNY HAS 13 SIBLINGS????? DAYUM
by seeing the trailer niko will probably win
When is Beta squad going to come out with a single 🎶
All that effort for that lol waste of time lol
14:04😂😂😂
nah i rate aj’s effort he always pays attention to detail and is thoughtful in little ways. if only he had normal sized portions looool
Can someone tell what Kanye west song chunkz was singing plz
27:14 the best version of adele you will ever hear
chunkz calling for princess clairdo seriously nah i was creasing lmaooo series not even over and this was the best episode overall idc 😭
best series ever 😭😭😭
AJ got done dirty with that scoring
Can anyone tell the violen sound name
The speed of this series coming out is appreciated! Made me check out some other videos
WOO AJ
chunks saying naya can u bring the main course had me dying
Chunkz tries to act miserable like KSI, the guys a fake Muslim as well, we all know he drinks
Chunks vocals are top tier 🔥
30:27 Harry who?💀💀
i love beta squad
It'd be great if someone did a Hibachi themed come dine with me.
Kanye shabil
Emo monkey🖤
Niko is such a wholesome human being.
Beta squad: black people group, eat food, and of course chunkz is here.
not i’ll turn you into a lucozade bottle ffs 😭🤣
Chunkz’s voice is really great
Why can't I download the video
I’m not disappointed today, gonna watch all episodes of come dine with me ❤
Who let this man cook?!? Had em in the first half nigga sold
Where is filly??
Another thing that wasn't incredible is yo breathe NIKO!. Every time you talk, I almost die too.
i appreciate the effort aj put into this. luv it
Niko educated zombie 😂😂😂😂
In AJ’s episode it was mini food. Niko’s episode should be massive food 😂😂
😂 I can not aait for Nikkos episode cos wow he’s beeeen toxic!!!!
BETA SQUAD BANGERS!!!
This was the best episode of Come Dine With Me so far. I WAS IN STITCHES. Sooo funny
Best series out right now
amazing
This was amazing honestly this deserves to be on netflix
AJ’s the only one that cooked everything AND MADE THE MOST EFFORT❤ he seems like such a sweet guy! He gets 10/10 from the city gurls💅🏾
Yeah! you're a KING niko. KINGKONG! lol.
This one was a mix of amazing and shambles
Nah that Adele cover was solid
Chunkz called her “Nayaa” 😂😂🇸🇴
Chunks: he works with the shaaitannnnnnn 😅
Nah but it would of been funnier if he went with a giant theme and made them feel small for once 😂😂
Chips the only reason these videos been bearable. Wtf happened boys?
Absolutely smashed it
Sharky arriving late, having the worst overall performance and having the audacity to give a negative critique 😂😂
At this point , they are taking the piss mocking AJs height 😂😂
How can sharkey complain about the lack of food he didnt even turn up till after the starters... that wouldn't sit well with them Sidemen lot you can tell..
29:46 🤣
Beautiful series, loving every second
Where’s sharky?
Naahh men AJ’s diner was way better then chuckz
Sharky is the worst member no doubt
the Niko Japanese ep is gonna be insane fr
Hii
what song is chunkz singing at 26:51
I feel bad for aj 😭 he did his best but still love this video
Niko is always on time ⌚️
omggg the adele moment was the best !
shoulda beat chunkz
Aj With that 2 feet W
chunks slayed that Adele song
no one's gonna talk about Chunkz's signing?!?
No joke that newspaper trick gandalf did had my hands on my head, wallah this series is top tier
I’m so invested in this series 😂
Chunkz saying naya had me dead 😂
@28:16 Chunk solo was heart warming <3
chunkz solo was heart warming <3
Anyone notice the face in chunks burger on the thumbnail
9:48 I like how the subtitle translated it as satay instead of sate. That's the Malay/Indonesian spelling of it but I realized Americans tend to call it sate, is it commonly referred to as satay in the UK?
I love that they treat their friends like celebrities 🎈😊❤️ the hype around HP’s entrance…just to realize that he’s roasting them🤣🤣🤣
Where was Sharky in this one?
32:33 poor niko😭😭
AJ looked like he wanted to cry after realizing he messed up the food
I really thought AJ was gonna come through then I saw how small the mini burgers were bruh😭🫡🫡
Intro track slaps
The Adele choir is my highlight…because the harmony was 🔥🌟❤️
The way aj looks at Kenny at 28:34 is so fucking funny 😭
These guys still want Yedolf 🙄 get the pointy white hoods on over their faces and he would of turned up
That has to be a yellow card for Sharky, 2 hours late for a main channel video on a banging series. Man needs to be fined lol
the mini cheeseburgers had me dead 💀💀💀
I just love all of them
Bro Sharky is always late
The way they just started singing Adele , sensational.
24.5 inches LOL 😂
I'm sorry but that zombie comment absolutely took me out 😭
Algorithim
I want to see chunkz do the newspaper magic trick ✨
Beta squad with another banger as usual but one thing i want to state is why is sharky always late its like he doesnt care at all honestly pisses me off. 3rd time in a row the last to arrive honestly beta squad is carrying him.
i have always loved this house ever since i saw the video of the owner had a video interview about it
I think location is henlle hall tree house
Where is sharky?
Sharks?
I would say so far chunkz had the best food and AJ the best entertainment
Where is my boi Sharks? U cant leave him man.
When they busted out singing Adele was the best freaking part of this whole series!
Where’s sharkyyyyy??
Better content then sideman
💜
All of them singing Someone Like You was the highlight of this video for me ❤️ God I love betasquad  also Chunkz voice >>>>
Where sharkyyyyyy
13 siblings is sick. Kenny's dad is a legend lol
The fact sharky talking when my man came 1-2 hour late and talking shit about his food when bro didnt even cook 💀🙏
Aj deserves actleast an average of 6.5 to 7 he tried to work with a theme
Kenny complained abt the food but when he made food, AJ couldn’t eat it…
Aj's come dine with me was great!
This was the best full episode by far 🤣🤣AJ is a funny ass rat
Sharky's tiktoks are hella fruity 😂
Thumbnail should’ve been seafood😂
Please do something like this weekly where someone does something and the rest of use judge
Not surprised if Niko will serve everyone with waffles with the amount of waffling he’s done in the first 4 episodes. Looking forward to Niko episode next.
Niko and AJ are snakes🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Nah sharky voting after missing the starters and magician…. Sabotage💀
Man, Adele would be proud of that performance 🤧❤️
Talk like an educated zombie 🤣😭🤣💀 Vio but LMAOO
Hobbits?!? AJ win, he doesn't even gotta cook anything 😂
aj looks better with the nose. he actually looks handsome
where is Sharky?
Let’s all appreciate chips commentating it’s really the cherry on top of a great series👏
this video sponsored by smart water
Chunks signing was probably my favorite part of the video
Chunkz voice always gets me in my feels man🥲angelic🙏🏽
Actually such a good moment seeing all the boys bussing out Adele together 😂 brilliant
W
Harryyyyyyy
my favorite series
When they start singing Adele I lost it 😂
I could literally just watch a beta squad acapella video on god. The vocals are crazy and the boys are vibes
Is it just me but why does AJ look like Cortez from wilding out?
We all know niko is gonna smash it
Unpopular opinion: chunkz ruined this video with his vibes ngl 🙄
Harry pinero 👏 ❤
Saw chip today at my work in Telford 😂
Niko went so hard on chunkz but enjoyed rat food😂😂
I literally am so excited for Niko’s series. AJ smashed it btw, shame the food was minuscule but rate the effort. Already know Niko is gonna go so extra tho and I’m all for it.
Nah no way Niko was that biased and gave AJ a 7,5.
W AJ !! 🔻🔻
26:49 whats the song that chunkz sang here?
Best series seen in a long time 😂
cant wait for nikos turn
Beta squad on fire this series is elite :joy:
aj actualy surprised me you know😂😂
was confused why aj didn’t arrive w niko for a HOT MINUTE
He meant palate cleanser
I cant stop laughing
Hearing Chunkz sing was the highlight of this video for me😌
28:17 fucking smashed it damn chunkz is super talented. 28:30 even elevated that masterpiece damn.
Petition for Chunks to do a full "Someone like You" Cover👇🏽
AJ is so stupid
Honestly, the subtitles on the vids are horror. I expected it to get better with time but it's really bad considering the high production you guys are maintaining these days. I hope Beta Squad see this comment and do something about it because it annoys a lot of people.
I’ve been waiting for AJ one 😂😂😂one thing you are guaranteed with him is entertainment and comedy 😂😂😂
when chunkz was screaming “ Rigatoni “💀💀💀💀 HAD ME DEAD
I love how the extras were in character the whole time. Gotta love them!!
W VID
Sharky was high on here 😂
Icl Chunkz deserves the W
The only guest that could match up to Harry is if Niko brings Filly
chunkz's vocals >>>
AJ looks cutee with that nose 😂
Lmaoooo THIS HAS TO BE JOKE MATE!
the way I actually cried when harry said that niko talks like an educated zombie I couldn't breath for a good 15 seconds
Why is Niko always criticising I can't wait for his episode 😂
It's the singing for me🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Rigatoni! Lol  But nah that’s all of jakes fights!! There’s no way he beat Silva without riggin it!!
Chunkz kinda put on weight again innit. Still looks leng tho.
were's sharky?
Chunkz has been so grumpy these past few (like 10) videos
Chunkz you better sing boy!!
I’ll come back to 27:30 to hear the singing for years to come
nah its actually time bro i get it aj is yous lot guy and tht but hes been the weakest part about beta squad for time...like hes always forcing the ting really not funny ,time to recast or ask a different one of the mandem to participate
*This was super creative!* Wizards and hobbits.. mini foods… and their singing… it’s an entire mooooddd as some say… lol   Oh and HP tooo!! 😁 Haven’t seen neekos yet!! lol Niko ijk!!
Hobbits are actually known to eat ALOT, much more than men lol.
AJ really sabotaged himself. Bro got almost as much as Chunkz with JUST his entertainment. Even if he just let a professional cook for him, he’d be 1st place rn because they’d have atleast given him better food scores than the thing they got.   Wasted opportunity for AJ.
How has he got a wand when he’s in a lord of the rings set🤣bro mixing up Harry Potter and lord of the rings I’m dead
Someone buy my man chunkz some shoes, brudda lives in those sliders
AJ and Kennys off beat drumming had me dead 28:31
Why are the hobbits so adorable 😭😭
Aj is a tyrant lets save the hobbits.
AJ did well, the hobbits are so cute and AJ needs to stop being violated for his height I ACC feel bad now. We love a short king <3
love this group, never a dull moment
26:51 Chunkz's singing is angelic asf
I can't wait for Nikos 😂 Shits gonna be funny asf
i was so disapointed that my prediction from the previous episode was wrong
AJ IS SO FCKIN CUTE MAN
Chunks hanging from night before
mandem said naayaaa lmfaooo which is gyallllllllllll
I can’t help but think that AJ just forced this old man to wait in a tiny shed for over an hour to do magic tricks for his friends.
THE AJ SHABEEL  / NON155 /  HOW ABOUT  NIKO BETA SQUAD / SOON MY CHILD NON155 /  AM NOT YOUR CHILD
I’m just here for intro & outdo music 😂😂🔥🙌
i can’t lie i’ve been waiting for AJ’s one and then Niko arghhh man ❤
There’s kids in Africa who would kill for melon and chocolate you selfish pricks!!!!!!!!
Bro why aj got tobis nose on 😆
The singing actually made me cry, banging video as always
The magic tricks underrated
Nah they shouldn’t have shown the trailer to the Niko come dine with me part😭😭😭
JESUS saves 🙌 JESUS heals JESUS forgives  JESUS loves you  JESUS restores brokenness JESUS is there for those who feel lonely or lost   ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤Jesus is the reason your alive be thankful everyday be appreciative, humble, kind. Try to put a smile on someone's face spread love and positivity because someone may need it because this world have so much hate it does not need any more. 🥰
i have a crush on aj
27:53 the hobbits have two completely different vibes but they been like brothers through this episode - deep bro
I liked the idea of the hobbit and I can't wait for what Niko has to offer
By just seeing the trailer I know Niko won
Why beta squad whyyyyy why can't we download only stream💔 sharky's episode was turned to YouTube premium
Sharky shithouse lmaoooo
"he works with the shaytaan" 🤣🤣🤣
I felt bad for aj I feel like he really tried his hardest and honestly he did really good
This was funny with the mini foods and bad breath Magician 🎩 oh and also the roast! 6 points!  🤣🤣🤣
This was too funny 😂😂😂
5+5/2=7.5. Remember to always divide and multiplicate first. So chunkz. U fr need to get that brain of yours sorted😂
You guys are actually smashing this series man. Wallahi smashed it! Cannot wait got Nikos version, this guy is just naturally funny.
Chunkz has a beautiful voice wlh
aj looked sad in this one
wheres sharky?
“He works with the shaitan” 💀💀💀💀
Since when did hobbits have tobijzl's nose, have wands and wear shoes?
Why has a hobbit got a wand… triggered
“Educated zombie” SENT ME
That video was absolutely beautiful
Nah Aj tripping with them small ahh food portions 😭😭
I loved the hobbits 😂
Uhm, 5+5÷2 is not equal to five
This episode is actually funny af 😂😂
Where’s sharky?
I have a feeling best 2 rating will get a good vs bad holiday🤔🤔
Ok finally where my fellow dwarf bruda has felt tall 😂
12:39 missed opportunity for a Head Master joke
28:16 bro chunkz has the BEST voice i literally I can’t stop watching the part.
Mashallah man chunkz’s voice🤦🏽‍♂️🔥
Hilarious episode, i loved it
Man like HP said Niko talks like an educated zombie 😂
This ”come dine with me” is the best one🤣🤣 Aj killing it again🙌🏼💯
OUT OF ALL SHARKYS EPISODE WAS THE WORST LOL
lmao Aj🤣
Chunkz capping about that news paper brother, that was crazy
AJ and harry together is honestly wholesome
Hairy potter 😂 the dictator reference
Can't lie, that Adele cover by the boys was a banger, chunkz smashed it
The Dessert Part killed me 😭😭😂
Anyone else expecting something ridiculous from Niko like getting Gordon Ramsay to cook the meals
This series has been amazing.
Harry looked like Dave when the door first opened 😂😂😂
Chunkz’s face when Harry mentioned his weight 😭 I can’t deal, harry you went too far there. Leave my Chunkz alone 🥲
Adele in a beta squad vid 😂😂😂 yeah crazyyy 😂😂
Chunks needs to get back to singing god knows his voice is amazing 🤷🏼‍♂️
Sharkee late asff
Nah they shegged him on that score
Niko being chaotic throughout the series but at the end saying "all that matters is I had a good time with my friends" is wholesome
These series are genius !! Im so sad that Niko will be the last episode 😢
My like was for chunkz solo vocals 🙌🙌
He put effort in it, it’s cute and small 🥺
🙏🙏🙏👋👋👋👋👋🙏🙏🙏🙏
Nayaa😂😂
10/10 video
Chunkz just got a beautiful voice
EDUCATED ZOMBIE IS CRAZYYYYYY LMAOOOO
Second time I’ve heard chunks sing someone like you 🤣 and it’s just as good the second time 😍
I am loving these episodes of come dine with me
What in the vocals chunks! 28:23
OVO hoods
Educated zombie 😂
Why is there no download?
this singing got me crying how good it is
He really said educated zombie
My friend called hammza said u met him in Paris is that true and he was with his brother and friend
AJ repping for all us LOTR fans 🙌🏽🔥💯
But tbh, the flute intro beat is fire 🔥
Chunks voice is crazy good haha
Wish theses guys would take it more seriously and try harder and actually try to cook something from scratch themselves rather than going all out on the location and entertainment side of things i think they should do a whole rerun and get some practice in cooking a 3 course meal till its perfected get help off camera but do it all on ya own on the night
"Be aware because they kill the kings here...."  Comedy gold, delivery was perfect.
Chunkz how you calling becky,   nayaaaaa!!!
He had us in the first half
Hi
Oiiii The educated zombie seems he can cook from the trailer
I love how Niko is so judgy in this (not in a bad way) but i cant wait to see how he performs
This series is on par with sidemen among us
i  know aj niko
That group singing into Chunkz solo should be a whole unique clip that was 🔥
funny
Wait…chunkz can kinda sing tho
Love this series so much
Only 2mins in and Ajay is doing well so far
may Allah blesss chunkz voice wallahi so beautifull ma sha Allah
ayoo chunks killed that solo
Peter creeps me out
my favorite part of this video is chunks singing someone like you
whys chunkz so serious
Now im so hyped For Nikos Episode 🎉
Mid week beta squad videos 🔥
Actually Chunks I think you'll find 5+5÷2 = 7.5. Which would put AJ on a level score with Chunks. Score card should be amended
Haven’t laughed in such a while  When they saw the mini burgers
Great effort from Aj. I rate you bro. Chunks needs to get his head out his own ass and relax... stop with the singing too, its cringe AF fat boy.
Niko's voice being described as an "educated zombie" is mental 😂
It was going so well but then the food arrived
are we not going to recognize that they a WHOLE Adele song lol
11:51
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Tah this is the first time I feel bad for this guy😔🫢
the chunkz and niko harmonizing part was pretty shocking.
Chunkz is about to win this whole thing with shambolic entertainment. unless Niko blows us away😂
this is the only thing keeping me entertained from youtube atm
Let’s not beat around the bush aj and chunks come off as proper cunt
The fact that Chunkz randomly starts throwing words in Somali when he's mad is hilarious lol
Can't wait for Niko Okinawa
If those burgers were normal sized he would have definitely won I think.
Yes the starter was the only good thing that was nice -Kenny 2023
5:23 8:06 8:39 8:54 9:01 18:49 19:50 23:49 27:13 watch for like 1 min
28:17 goosebumps‼️❤❤❤❤❤
Damn the singing got me emotional
I know sharky ain't talking abt food after his ep.
if you was italian they'd call you rigatoni💀😂😂
The Adele sing along part was elite
Where sharky
clean vocals chunksy !
5 + 5 / 2 is actually 7.5🤓
The hobbit in the background laughing is so funny to me
Man I love these guys. Just the vibe they had while singing together was so wholesome bro 😭❤
AJ: the consummate business man. He didn't want to spend a lot of $ so he bought small portions and served mini dishes 😂
EDUCATED ZOMBIE HAHAHAH why does it make sense though 😅
their singing is sooo good
Honestly, that singing moment was beautiful!🥺
28:36 the way aj looks at kenny because he is offbest literally is giving me stomach aches been laughing for 15mins
Niko’s is gonna be firrrree!!
the way aj could’ve probably won this series but chose to give shitty and small food 😪
Where's Sharky?
ik frfr chunkz high off dat purple nebula
Where's Sharky
They did sharky so dirty he at least deserved a 16
I love this series! Keep them coming guys.
I’ll never get over chunkz voice man, Jesus!
Why is that fat guy so disrespectful.
Aj did better than i thought in regards to location and entertainment, definitely put the effort but the food was so botched haha  Cant wait for Nikos episode though, he will put in a full effort
Let’s be honest, none of us were expecting this video today.
Time needs to slow down :(
Should have called it iluminatti edition, cause of ajs head
If I ever get a chance to ask burnt chip a question itd going to be why the come dine with me title card is exaclty like river monsters
The way he kicked them hungry, happy and also hungryyyy is crazyy😂
i like AJ hes like me but i am white and a big bigger and taller
Wheres sharkyyy
Harry Pinerooooooooooooo😂😂❤
Chunks has set the bar so high with his cooking, But can Niko can top it. I look forward to the entertainment. From the looks of it Niko was the first to host the come dine with me, his entertainment is the intro for this series, I’m guessing they saved the best for last?😂
What’s the Kanye West song Chunkz was harmonising at 26:47 ?
Niko your jacket 😂😮
AJ's nose doesn't even look that ridiculous on him
35:12  would be starving less if he showed up on time :)
Lolll😭😭
We all know that Niko is going to be the best.
Beta squad > sidemen
Chunks please do music again
Where is sharkyyyyy
Big up Hobbit Ali btw man was just happy the whole day
Chunks has some vocals
NIKOOO I WAS WONDERING WHO WAS THE PERSON THAT WAS DOING THAT 1 TBH TAHTS THE MOST INTRESTING 1 FOR NOW ITS GOOD MASHALLAH YOUR HAVING FUN IDK WHY IM TYPING CAPS BUT YH WALLAH THE FOOD IS TERRIBLE IF I WAITED THAT LONG FOR THAT ID JUST LLEAVE
W series
the missed opportunity to be ratatouille here is astronomical
Alone by the Trailer Nico seems to smash this Aj could have done very well here the food was not good but i like the commitment of the hobbit theme
The singing was beautiful lolll
best series of the year so far i swear, the only downside is chips commentary, i usually love chip but i dont think he matches the beta squad energy well. no hate to beta cuz you lot smash it everytime
can you guys do all the series again, like a version 2 where yall try to do better than last time
Chunks, Kenny, sharky violated that was definitely an 8 experience
Video idea make a new series called come party with me same thing as come dine with me but with party
Beta squad is always 100x better than sidemen..
Spoilers in the comments as usual
AJ is ADORABLE. Loved his vibe.
20:04 naw chunkz calling her naya was so disrespect i cringeddd come on
Lol this series is hilarious need to be a regular thing
I can’t waitttt for Niko’s episode
The theme song cracks me up every time 🤣🤣
I’m getting flashbacks of chunkz singing Adele ing the earning money vid
"They kill the Kings here" 5 minutes in and Niko is already threatened 😂
CHUNKZ SINGING ADELE 😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️
I think AJ is gonna put his foot in it.
Chunkz's middle name is Wallahi  I swear...
We need triangle subtitles for this video
36:09 lol its actually 7.5 bidmas
PT 2 PLS
the way Niko acts with aj compared to everyone else makes me feel like he has a romantic interest for aj
definitely should’ve added gollum as a part of the entertainment but the gandalf was great
14:23 Niko mannn😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I don’t get why Chunkz roast was too dark and everyone went silent?… Can someone explain pls
beta squad>> sidemen
the magic tricks tho
This series is amazing. I'm waiting for niko's version
omg where is sharky omh
Great cooking skills, Tobi :)
Icl beta squad fell off since September 2022
Chunkz’s vocals are crazy tho
With that nose, AJ could pass off as Tobis long lost brother.
“Why was the starter bigger than the main”😂
ThE gObLiNs PeTeRrRrRrR
Yooooooooooooo my channel better😉😉
Chunks singing 😌😫
Best series on yt congrats beta squad
Chunkz: "i could've inhaled it" 😂😂
Wednesday Completed.
kenny's laugh just made the video
chicken satay???????? u mean PINDASAUS broer!!!!
Mr Shabeel
them singing adele was the best part icl
The legend says that Neeko can smell your guts from where you are sitting. YES YOU! Smash the like button or I’ll accuse you of bad breath too.
The part where there just Singing Adele song is priceless 😭👏🏾👏🏾
I was expecting AJ to hop in someone's hair and cook like that french rat Ratatouille 🐀
Where sharky at?
Am I the only person who noticed snarky wasn’t there at the start
Where was sharky lol?
BY FAR my favorite come dine with me so far💀🤣 I love LOTR so this is amazing
Nah someone's getting fired lmao at 30:27 for butchering HP's name spelling.
Tiny meals incoming...
Sharky is always late. That’s bad 😂
Niko talks like an educated zombie plsssssss
Bro why are all these comments copied I was looking for some original jokes 😭
i’m so excited for niko’s edition
That’s my neighbour’s house
Did he cut his hair ?
Best ytbers
AJ’s the winner for me regardless of his score😂that was great😂👌 all of them singing Adele though was just brilliant 😂🤌can’t wait for Niko’s episode 👀🤣
AAAAA
Stormzy was funny you know
ever since sharky’s episode i kept saying it couldn’t get any worse and they keep proving me wrong😂😭 i have faith in niko tho
Cant wait for Niko’s as he has criticized everyone so harshly lol
😭
AJ is so sweet this series has made him top of my list tbh lol he’s so funny and caring
Where is SHARKY ???
The guys singing was just the best part hands down!!
Can't wait for the EDUCATED ZOMBIE episode 😂
To be fair it was quite decent, felt cozy and you could just feel the beta vibes!! Respect AJ, really well done! I was wondering if you could do a "Come dine with mum" where you'd all sit properly and simply behave in front of a beta's mum. 🤣🤣🤣
Melon with chocolate sauce 😭😭😭😭😭😭
WELL DONE AJ LMAO
18:59  sharkys face is hilarious 😂😂
After all this surely niko can pull through with a perfect score
Somalian pirate hobbit
Had to re watch the singing bit 😅😮❤
lmao anyone know what the flute intro tune is called? I need it
They knew to put nikos last lmao
should have gone down to the sauna my dad made... lol
When they started singing was good ❤
25:47 has me 🤣🤣🤣
The guys' singing was angelic 😯
when i tell you i was crying, laughing so hard at the peter hair part because of niko im not lying
They are gonna get copy righted soon
Ngl, Chunks is so freaking good at singing  He banged the song better then adèle bro
13:06. W Gandalf
Hmmmn chunks can sing 😅😅😅
Imagine if AJ cooked fish 🤣
I just love them. I can’t wait to see Nikos one cos of the way he’s been judging everyones😂🤣
I love the fact that Niko is always the first to arrive 😹💕
He outdid himself but honestly no one beats chunkz I love sharky with everything but like daaaang😹🤦🏼‍♀️
I really really thought Aj was leading to win…. Went downhill fast but it didn’t start going downhill until Sharky got there
“So that leaves AJ with a final score of 24.5, which is funny because that’s his exact height in inches”💀💀💀💀💀💀
Day 1 of asking Gandolf to join Beta squad
😂
You’re not about to tell me that ‘Hobbit Peter’ isn’t just Digga D in a costume…
We have to add darkest ones the beta squad
They out of ideas man
Aj is a G for giving Harry that spotlight his really funny 😂😂
Chunkz is still in the ends wallah man said "tell these little yutes to skates"
Fancy that, I was in this episode of Come Dine with me
hobbit Ali looks like @GeogeNotFound
Kenny and chunkz rection to Aj mini bugger was soo funny lol i was rolling on the floor lol
Adele, the Beta Squad summons you 🙏🏻
why I can't download this video?
Kenny's one was so funny ngl Also Chunkz happy late bday btw This was funny too Best part was when they were all singing and Kenny said "I dont know this" Edit:nvm I continued watching it and the best part was when HP came in
Chunkz: “ Oh my god, He works with the shitan” 💀💀💀😭😭
Chunkz didnt deserve such a high score now considering that if half the score is entertainment whereas the rest of the score is food.
"He works with the shaitan" 🤣😭
27:52 Peter cringing has me dead 💀💀💀
Bro after nikod come dine with me wee need a pt.2
How is noone talking about the singing part! I belted out Adele with them! 🤣
I just know Niko's episode will be a banger, even without seeing the trailer
Surprised aj did better than Kenny and Sharky maybe even chunkz
27:38 to 28:45 I need the full version😫
Where is sharky
HP cooking them at the end loooool
This is a fantastic series, great idea boys keep it up! Just wished you guys actually tried cooking the stuff like Chunkz lol

Niko and chunkz singing have my heart icl ❤
Illegal to be this late 😢
I love at the end Aj comes after the terrible desserts thinking he gonna get a high rating🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭😭
For the magic trick, look at the dudes Index finger, he has a fake finger on that's where he put the silk
No one gonna talk about how fire that Adele song was
W vid
The educated zombie was mad innit🤣 shoutout hp❤️
25:50 LMAOOO THIS GOT ME KENNYS REACTION TOO
Chunks can really hold a tone, fam can sing sing, well he ain’t Craig David but man can sing
30:30
MaShaAllah. What a nice cabin.
All of them being so happy seeing HP was the cutest thing
Top tier content
You man are killing it
27:30 song?
Niko is so sweet and pure in every video (I know he's the most critical lol) but his energy radiates love and you can see he'll be an amazing husband and father one day. My favourite member
Best trilogy OAT is Lord of the rings
Josh with a surprise cameo
Im here watching mancity game while watching this good video of aj shabeel my idol love Aj 🖤🖤
goated vid personally for me yh 8/10 but aj 2 short
Can't  wait for Niko 😂
Ok, I didn't think I could be more excited for Niko's, "Come Dine With Me." However after seeing that they will again be singing another Adele song after smashing it in this episode, I can not wait! Calling it now Niko pulls the W.
I don’t get the joke from Harry about the Beta Squad blowing up and Chunkz religion, can someone explain?
where was sharky😭
26:37
AJ seems mad awkward
LETS GOO I LOVE COME DINE WITH ME
Nah, Kenny got violated💀
Niko next
Niko 👀, Saved the best for last 💀
i cant lie i got emotional when they started someone like you 😢😢 what the fawkk
Beta squad needs to get some rat repellant because AJ's managed to get into the kitchen now
My god chunkz what a voice♥️
Hobbits love storing food so this mini portions is ridiculous I think AJ is not a real hobbit
i was sure that was dave ffs
SINCE WHEN COULD NIKO SING???????
educated zombie 😭
AJ is the type what ever you can do, i can do better imo
28:17 🫡
Nah that roast against chunks was insane 😂😂😂
This series is the best so funny Aj finally gets payback
28:00 Chunkz revived It
Not sharky criticizing the prep cake of AJ knowing damn well his whole meal was prep 😭😭😭😭
Educated zombie 💀 😂
AJ was the best host so far 🤷🏽‍♀😂
Sharky?
Omg 🤣🤣🤣🤣 AJ you are hilarious I can't stop laughing 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lol chunk said he seen all the slight of hand when he ripped the paper ..it's not a slight of hand trip... Lolll
They have so much fun together🤣
Nah how can you say Hobbits then save a wand like it's Hogwarts.
Been waiting
Their friendship is so wholesome. Also Chunkz's voice?🥺
"What would you do?" Not this turning into a musical🤣🤣
5:45
This is what I wanted out of Beta Squad. Killing it and getting what they deserve. Massively underrated group. Keep it up boys
Saturday yeah? Not Sunday. Saturday
Chunkz calling Princess Clarido "Naayaahe" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 thats meeeeental
Did you know when honey is cooked something in the honey turn’s poisonous, I learnt this today
Where was sharky
How is AJ so cute as a hobbit?
I think there's not a single man in the multiverse that Niko hasn't accused of having bad breath.
The Beta Squad need to do a cover album of Adele's music
if he had the food, he would've won this whole things\
poor sharky he really was gassed for the starters 😢
20:04 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 “ NAYAA”
yeassss love this ❤❤❤
Wow Chunkz has bombastic voice!
Ngl didn’t notice his fake nose and ears till midway
the fact that sharky's always late and his episode was so chaotic is hilarious 😅 can't wait to see how niko does...
Already from the trailer I can see nikos ep will be the best plus they kept him for last
Waiting for a Betas’ Got Talent because of Kennys come dine with me entertainment
Chunkz is so flippin hilarious
this series wouldn't be the same if sharky wasn't the one always late 😂😂
Ever since the first come done with me i’ve been so hyped whenever a new one comes out this series is just amazing
Can’t wait for them to start their own music videos they are going to be so fire
you guys saving niko for last🥹best for last🥳
Somebody should get adele to notice chunkz
Whats the intro song from? Its a banger even in shitty flute version
Can't wait for Niko
Beta squad just doesn't miss 😂
2 hours late. Sharky actually putting in no effort. In Kennys video he had no input too
Honestly I think he did best of all so far.  Obviously he can't cook, but at least he tried and put in some effort for a great night for his friends.
28:17 love it when Chunkz randomly reminds us he has voice of an angel 😍
Confusing lord of the rings and Harry Potter 😂
You can already tell Niko won this series lol
I almost cried at that beautiful performance by the boys singing Someone Like You. Chunkz carried that signing part.
I actually didn't see the isosceles hobbit when I saw the thumbnail. I thought it was a mystery guest 💀💀
Educated zombie😂
I didn't get the joke about chunkz Harry Pinero said :/  Btw great video 👍
Aj screaming in the mic made my day
Niko said Peter Dinklage 😂😂😂😂😂
chunkz neeeds to go back to music after the Adle
27:42 me and my friends in class making songs
Educated zombie has got to be the most accurate thinggg
AJ being excited about the magic is hilarious
Ayyyyy
AJ WAS DOING SO GOOD
just from the trailer alone i know niko won the come dine with me
Anyone know the song that’s lightly playing in the background?
28:24 Chunkz vocals r top tier
chunkz calling the princess naya is brazzyy
The best thing is how they sang the whole song
ajs ep was so unexpected it was so funny and entertaining oh btw ive never acc got 5 likes lol
25:50 😅😅😅😂😂
its not a beta squad video unless they lads sing adele
AJ is HILARIOUS 😂
what was the song chunks was going to start singing before they started to sing adele?
Very horrendous AJ. Well done.
I died laughing watching this Omgg 🤣🤣
The burgers 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
28:17, Chunks is just blessed with that voice, it is so nice ❤🎶
beta squad singing someone like you was so funny
W
Something about the boys all singing Adele is just so wholesome, love it
Beta squad videos just get better and better!
Aj should get a 10 for effort 1 for size  9 for entertainment
Aj’s episode was so far the most entertaining, can’t wait to see what Niko does!
As a LOTR lover this is actually so cool lmao
Educated zombie is so spot on HAHAHA
Awwww Aj 🫶🏾. I loved this. You get A for effort.
dying for nikos episode
They would make a good boy band.
At this point I have no idea who can cook and who can’t 😂
💥
that was so bad xDD
Niko and aj’s friendship is so nice to see
YES AJ
Niko’s episode looks absolutely hilarious 😂😂
I wish the boys continue posting this often
NOOOOOO AJ MATE IT WAS GOING SO WELL😭
WSGG
Hobbit Ali really putting his entire energy into this performance >>>>>>
I love you guye and i have been watching you guys for over 3 years. I absolutely lov Chunkz and Niko
Why is no one talking about how well they sang together 😂
6:05 / 37:49
27:30 Probably the most wholesome moment in Beta Squad, the way everyone is vibing and AJ randomly joins is perfect
Ajs so funny
should have got chrismd as a hobbit
That singing sequence made me cry
Let’s go❤🎉🎉🎉😂
how did AJ fumble a 10 so bad lmao
melon with chocolate syrup is crazy
can someone please explain the joke at 32:50
BETA SQUAD ON A WEDNESDAY! I LOVE THIS GROUP
Need a “grand designs” beta squad waffling edition next
I've been refreshing for thesehonestly Niko's gonna be best I can feel it
I don't remember there being wands in Lord of the rings, and I don't remember there being Hobbits in Harry Potter if it's the other way round 😂
Looooved it! I just don’t understand why aj made the main course so small, I mean the starter was bigger and they already complained lol
Can we talk about how beautiful chunks sang. My man’s got me tearing up 😢❤
chunkz's singing was the best part i cant lie, hes so talented its unreal

Aj is so creative
The music at the start of every episode is amazing. What a vibe man.
Hobbit Peter needs some help. He’s super depressed. 😢

27:14 was brilliant 🔥
Glad to hear chipo crimes on the voice over

it's always sharky and his lack of time management😂
Where’s sharks? 9:58

Nikos one is going to be the best
AJ looks genuinely sad after the main course
That was actually amazing, my fav is still Kenny tho, but atleast someone cooked it… like actually.

Where’s sharky?
hey
Chunkz was the only one to cook the entire menu by himself and he's done the best so far 😂😂
How yall finished the video when it hasn't evev been 37 minutes yet
This is my favorite beta squad challenge
BEST EPISODE 🤣🤣❤️❤️
sharky is always late
A lucozade bottle lmao. Then proceeds to speak 😂
this is genuinely incredible wowwww
How come Neeko didn’t arrive together with Triangle this time? Oh wait…
Chunkz dialect is so crazy. I’ve learned a lot about uk slang just listening to him
When chunks started getting angry over tiny food 😂
Where is sharkyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Bro put chocolate sauce on melon and called it a day
where is sharky?
Ay respect to beta squad keeping us entertained as time goes by 👏
28:17 chunkz can sing 😮
Early ppl >>>
I was worried for a second that my love❤️ Sharky wasn't gonna show up😂
YES BANGER
Let be honest nobody thought we would be watching this today.
28:15 wasnt expecting that
This series just isn't it for me...
Bro Aj is Pinocchio  😂😂😂😂
bro forgot what to make at the end
I can’t wait to see everyone have a go at Nikos cooking on his turn.
I love the fact these are uploaded fast!!!

This has been my favourite series ever that you guys have done I love it so much 😭
Sharky!?
At least he didn’t buy it from Sainsbury’s 😂
Love that AJ and Niko have been the only ones early every time
I reaaally want chunkz to win 😭😭😭
I honestly think they are deliberately rating each other low to increase their own chances of winning.......thoughts???🤔
chunkz melody is soooooooooooo gooooooooooodd
best one so far aj rlly outdid himself
Hobbit peter is so funny tho
That singing was epic
I’ve been waiting for days
Fucking cook your meals mate, show some class
The little musical they out on was so good 😭😭😭😭
Jooo
The commentary along with Niko's toxicity is hilarious 😂
W upload as usual

Been waiting for thissssss
The amount of effort AJ has put in with this hobbit act is hilarious 😂
Happy 4th birthday ❤

I like how so far they all a mad that someone is cooking for them but they still hire someone (except for chunkz)
Mid week vids like champions league football 😭 I love it
Nah “your marge” had me😭🤣🤣
People that are smaller than aj exist wow didnt know These existed
Hate to say it but AJ looks better with that fake nose…
Anyone else just been waiting every ep for the sumo wrestlers??
Aj's nose came a close second to toby in the worlds largest nose
ratty boy
Lord knows I’ve been waiting on this😅
Niko always acting like he got personally attacked 🤣
Wtf why was there a person in a tree
man took entertaining to an other level
Hi
Sharky is never on time i swear
LES GOOOOO
Remember NATO and America UK are provoking war against Russia. The truth in this situation is with Russia not Ukraine and their nazi regime. Money laundering and war is what these devils love.
Every "Come Dine With Me" episode, I find myself refreshing the BetaSquad channel, these are too funny😭😭
I love this series
Been waiting for them to post all day😭
This series is legitimately my favorite thing Beta Squad has ever done. I can't get enough of it they gotta do more episodes series where each week one member is the hosting a challenge and the others are judging.
BABE HURRY AJS COME DINE WITH ME IS OUT
I honestly feel like AJ's and Nikos Chemistry is the most enjoyable to watch
Early
Hiiiiiiiii
Was hoping sharky wouldn’t make an appearance tbh
Chunkz is so kind when giving the score to them he doesn't want to hurt their feelings.what a man👏
😮
❤️
I love how Niko came alone now☠️💀

KENNY’S AND CHUNKZ REACTION TO AJ’S MINI BURGERS IS HILARIOUS
I love how sharky was so late 😭 Haven’t watched the rest of the vid so I’m gonna do that now
This series has been soo funny!! Definitely keep doing different series because I don’t want this to end 🥹
Where’s sharky
Justice for sharky

I’m insane
Why does everyone always violate AJ
Sharky ????
King of the sewers
