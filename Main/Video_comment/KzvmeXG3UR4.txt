This song sampled Static’s Private number
This got me thinking how mess up the world really is!! Too much hate going on and not a enough love!! Queen you ate this 💖 the visuals are everything!!   I dont care what no body say but she freaking killed this everytime. 💯💯 I fw  with Queen passion and music 🎶 🙌 This is her purpose. Every journey, every struggles, is part of her testimony ✨ she already shining    and glowing. I felt  her pain 💔 i been in a similar  position where I have been treated like crap so I know how it goes 💯 She stuck it out like a G 😻 💜
Love this song
Who still listening to her album a year later .. This album is beyond 🔥 listen to her whole album every day blessings to you Queen thanks for giving us good music 🎶 don’t change who you are ♥️
Pretend too much can turn to playing with your mind using peices of judgment to an edge of a matter that can be handled yet pest tend to run that air others breath apon in myths when other stupidity is thought from dispelled weaker engery of air its felt like an expressed way dont cross this crazy(a song that ryhmes within the words wrote like a secret)
I love Queen … It’s genuine … I miss r&b music … no shade to no other female but the whispering singing and auto tune ain’t it sometimes … mfs wanna feel the music … and with queen I feel the emotions coming from her music 💖
Queenn is so beautiful. Great song 💯💯💯
❤️
Felt this deep on a Spiritual level!
okay I cried. so beautiful ! I go see her in Concert in one week!!
This is my favorite song by her💕
my eyes watering badd i can't💔
The irony of this song when she's got a billion things on her that's not real...lol
Queen i love your songs. Keep it up and put God first..
I love this song so much. Sometimes I be crying and just listening on repeat.

This a beautiful song❤
This Is literally my favorite off the album the word aesthetic everything I need her to get her Grammy 🥴❤️

Queen came hard with this song😍
🙂🤍
This song is so beautiful. I don't think people realize how crazy Queens pen game is. I dig into the lyrics of songs and this one got me thinking of how many people was pretending with me but I still loved them. 🔥🔥❤️
Wow!

I sick off been bodyguard....she mine  know!
my favorite song forever

AMAZING
Your so funny and goofy af like me qe would get along so good everything is a joke thats how it should be
I see why Queen protects Clarence with her Life, its the realest thing shes ever had.
Definitely for me🤦🏽‍♀️😭🤦🏽‍♀️ for us with the big hearts
She's let's everyone I. But her sis and brother relationship
This woman is so strong - and it really shows in this album. She really did that on this album, may God continue to bless you Queen x besos x
You are a perfect women and I love your songs
I love Queen ! listening to this and watching her personality..I can relate to this on so many levels
This song hit different after all the drama that has been going on with her family !🥴
When Chris used to play 'pranks' on her with other woman... Her pain was real. We just didn't know at the time. You deserve it all Queen.
That's What's  happening Now Though 😕
I really love this song Love Language and the first song on the album then my faves overall I love this album this was Queens personal album❤️
This is a beautiful song. The lyrics are so true and fire 🔥.
ThePretendingStop

Lyrics:  Oh, oh, oh, ooh Yeah, ayy, ayy  It gets so hard to tell Who's really here for me Who's really down for me Or who just down for the ride So many issues of switchin' sides I just cannot identify  My, heart has a funny way of lettin' people in I swear it's never my intentions Always missin' all the signs that God be givin' Never find out the truth until the endin'  That they pretend (oh), that they pretend (oh, oh) Please don't pretend with me, yeah (yeah, yeah) Just keep it real with me, just keep it real (oh, ooh-ooh) Don't play pretend (ooh, ooh, ooh, oh) Don't play pretend Please don't pretend with me, yeah (oh, oh, oh) Just keep it real, just keep it real (oh, oh)  They say that I'm weak, they say that I'm way too naive Always tryna see, see the good in everybody (see the good in everybody) You would probably think disappointments would've stopped me Love just keep on bleedin', I know that God still got me The reality hits, and I'm not to expect people to give what I give Or think how I think, all I know my love it could be too much for some of you To love the way I do  Don't play pretend (no, no) Please don't pretend (no, no, oh) Please don't pretend with me, yeah Just keep it real with me, just keep it real (just keep it real with me, yeah) Don't play pretend (don't, no) Don't play pretend (don't, no) Please don't pretend with me, yeah Just keep it real with me, just keep it real  I can't help it that my heart's so big Constantly let people in I love without a motive (love without a motive) I just givin' and I give (oh, ooh whoa, oh, oh) But I need somethin' tangible Somethin' I can hold onto A relationship I can feel Somethin' real (yeah, yeah), somethin' real (yeah), somethin' real  Don't play pretend Don't play pretend (no, no) Please don't pretend with me (no, no, oh) Just keep it real with me, just keep it real Don't play pretend (don't) Please don't pretend (don't play) Please don't pretend with me, yeah (please don't pretend) Just keep it real, just keep it real (woo, ooh, don't play pretend, yeah)  Don't play pretend (no, no) Don't play pretend (no, no) Please don't pretend with me, yeah Just keep it real with me, just keep it real
After what happen with her family, this sound really speaks volumes.

🌟💜🙏🏽🙏🏽
Yesssss QUEEN 🧡🖤
I've never related so much to a song before this😭🔥
I LOVE THIS SONG SO MUCH!
Pretend is just as beautiful as Queen Naija... Charles Ibegwam. Chimix@gmx. de
Queen Naija is beautiful, talented, and awesome... What a beautiful voice... Charles Ibegwam. Chimix@gmx. de
I listen to this song EVERYDAY.
Dear queen , I know you probably won’t read this but it seems like you and Clarence have a fairy tale love . Is he really nothing like Chris? I have trouble trusting after my ex hurt me so bad idk if I should trust my new man or not...
This just made me tear up 🥺🥺🥺 I’ve been watching her since the red couch and she has came so far in life and been through so much. She deserves everything she has now and many many more blessings. God Bless ❤️
Yall omg I just went back to the video Did I Cheat On My Ex In Detroit? and I just realized that the beat that was playing in the background of her talking is the beat of pretend
Personally I think this is the best song on the album.
Please don't play pretend
Beautiful and she has a voice. WOW!!
Start your Acting career u got it boo.... No shade for u oops lbvs
Love it

" I KNOW THAT GOD STIL GOT ME "

I need to hear a gosoel song from her. All praise to the most High God.
Your smile is everything 😩
l
Queen yes you are especially when you sing the words that I try I say to people. Thank you Queen thank you
Your highness I really I really like it when you sing I like that song do you mean on the radio keep on listening to it in the car
orange is your color girl 🤣
So the moral of the story is when you support your girl when she was a security guard, she will leave you as soon as she signs a record deal.
Oh that makes sence
I love her but she needs a better make-up artist. The shadow needed blending and the liner looks faded by the eyeshadow.😭
“Always missing all the signs that God be    giving, never finding out the truth until the ending that they pretend”  Whew child a word 🙏🏾
I'd would have to study this song, its has my attention chose it by title, glad I had an opputuity to tune inn
Hi good morning how much money do you want one day program
this could be like a butterflies pt 3
Queen has one of the most beautiful smiles I have ever seen 😄
Even after they hurt me I see the hood in them 😕😕
Ommmggg this song is so slept onnnnn shits so much deeper listen between the lyricss💞🧚🏽‍♀️
This is your time queen ❤️❤️❤️
Im to good of a woman.  Im honest , truthful.  I love him, but he doesn't keep it real....
I remember when she put a snippet of this on her insta in 2018. girl, we been waiting for this. I love it❤️
This resonate with me! I love this fucking song
She looked like cardi I got scared 😭🌼‼️
❤️❤️❤️
Powerball winning numbers
This is a big message
I understand this bro is a bigger message
Never really been a fan of queen but once I listened to this song she definitely got another subscriber . Something about this song that makes me play it 100x in one day 💔
I wanna hear something that challenges her vocals a little more. This song is a little monotone for my taste.
Man I remember watching her when she was just doing social media. She would look so happy, but in person when I ran into at the mall or some she looked sad. I'm so happy to see her glowing and at peace. 😪🥰
Amen yes these guys pretend with me
Queen u an Chris was realll love sis😘

And she looks stunning in this video
I can’t stop listening to this is stuck in my head😩
This is beautiful...and so real..I feel this to my core.
2:08 Taureans be like
😳🍻🍹👀
I have watched her for a long time back when she wasn’t so famous. You can tell she was shy and not so confident in her talent back then. I use to always say she can sing but I always felt she was timid and not confident in her talent. Now knowing what happened with her and Chris I can definitely see why. She was always amazing but it took the right man loving and encourging her to reach her full potential stardom 🔥 . The right person will make you a better version of yourself not hurt you trust and believe that.
It’s Soo tuff like she telling a story I just get chills 😩

THERE SHOULD BE A PART 2 TO PRETEND 💚
Eesa in Arabic and (Yesua) son of maryam spoke Aramaic and when he called upon the name of the Most High, he said in Aramaic, "Allaha".  Moses said his father was a wandering Aramean. He was talking about Yaqub (Jacob) who is a Aramaic speaker. The Torah was originally in Aramaic but when the children of Israel started following the Canaanites and was worshipping their idol gods and goddesses, this is when they learned the so-called Hebrew language which is none other then a dialect of the Canaanite tongue.   Deuteronomy 26:5 Then you shall declare before the LORD your God: "My father was a wandering Aramean, and he went down into Egypt with a few people and lived there and became a great nation, powerful and numerous.  -------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------  isaiah 42:19 Who is blind but My servant, Or deaf as My messenger whom I send?

But if they turn away, then say, "Bear witness that we are Muslims [submitting to Him]."  Al Qur'an 3:65-66-67 O People of the Scripture, why do you argue about Abraham while the Torah and the Gospel were not revealed until after him? Then will you not reason?  Here you are - those who have argued about that of which you have [some] knowledge, but why do you argue about that of which you have no knowledge? And Allah knows, while you know not.

She’s Gods gift 🎁
This is my favorite ♥️
U SOUND LIKE ARIANA
i fuckn love her

I jus got through a break up were he cheated and I think god wanted me to hear this song to let me know I’m not alone🌚
Cardi b with Ariana s voice
This year this song love u Queen
iii sincerely need a queen in my liiife... III
The rhythm is sticky hehe. All the instruments together with the voice sound great, but I perceive clipping at 1:30 when the drum hits, which attenuates the essence of hearing them. It should be great to let all the instruments, along with the drums kicking in to breathe. So everyone can feel the true pleasure of hearing the melody from this song.
If yiu didn’t kno she was a security guard yiu weren’t here from day one ✨
As we see the whole world can change in 1 month, never say never, NEVER underestimate anyones power to do better, you could be the fuel to that engine to do better... Just saying... This blunt hitting😤😤
MILLY COMING SOON😩🔥

Just came across this song and I am loving it
Queen Naija... The long awaited album is "FIRE"... Love it! Love it!... Keep going Ma. I'm old school so I know solid music. You're like the "Faith Evans" and "Mary J. Blige" for this era. You're an amazing storyteller just like Faith and Mary did for my era in the 90's. Ignore the haters and keep telling stories we all have dealt with women and men. Thank you for your hard work and showing your heart to the world.

Okay but can we talk about the song "Beautiful" 🥺🥺Queen really shocked me with this album ! Good for her ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Dope song Queen 🙌
I started crying at the part where she signed 😭😭😭 I am so happy happy for her! She deserves all of these blessings 😭
Great voice, very beautiful face, shitty taste when putting on makeup and an extremely protruding and unnatural-looking ass.
Physical security is being denied to human beings because human beings are seeking security psychologically, which doesn’t exist. In the search of physical security, psychologically I want to be equally secure or the psychological desire to be secure prevents physical security.
We litterally watch queen grow from the red couch
LOVE IT QUEEN!!!!!!! YESSSSSSSS
I really need support, please give my music a listen and sub only if you like it. I really wanna collaboration with these big artists
This one of my fav song on album

Wow queen ❤️❤️
That voice tho😩  Small YouTuber here-appreciate any support
I just love Queen 🥺🤍 I felt every word...
We have all sinned & fallen short to the glory of God. We have all broken God’s commandments, therefore we deserve hell  , we deserve eternal punishment in hell bc of our sins. But bc God is love & merciful He offered a way for sinners to be saved from the eternal punishment we deserve.   He died on the cross for the punishment that we deserve so that we can be free from hell.   & what we have to do is repent of our sins & turn away from all sin & put faith & trust in the only one who can save us from hell which is Jesus.  Will you accept Him in your heart? He’s our Lord & Savior! He changed my life! I’m so much better now I find peace with Him. Without Him Idk where I would be.   Salvation is a gift from God we are saved by WE ARE SAVED BY GRACE ALONE FAITH ALONE!❤️❤️❤️❤️ Also be careful what you feed your spirit, feed it the word of God!
❤️
I love this video

What an absolutely beautiful song! Love the message behind it!! Your journey has been amazing to watch on YouTube and your album is beyond amazing ❤️
THE GOSPEL IS THIS:   JESUS CHRIST the SON OF GOD came to earth, he lived a life NONE of us can ever live, he never sinned, he was spotless and perfect, he lived to show us an example of how to live. He is the VISIBLE image of the invisible GOD (Colossians 1:15) JESUS CHRIST is GOD ALMIGHTY manifested in the FLESH, GOD took on flesh and bones and dwelt among us (John 1:1-14) ever since the garden when adam and eve sinned, they bought forth sin and death to the world, the world became fallen, and GOD separated himself from humanity. BUT GOD PROMISED A WAY TO RESTORE US TO HIM. he sent his SON to take our sins away, JESUS CHRIST was nailed on a cross and took your punishment upon himself, so that in him, you now can be righteous and acceptable to A HOLY AND PERFECT GOD, the wrath of GOD was poured out onto JESUS CHRIST on the cross and he died for ALL HUMANITY, that includes James charles, kylie Jenner, kim Kardashian, Donald Trump, he was BURIED, and in three days HE ROSE FROM THE DEAD, THATS RIGHT JESUS CHRIST ROSE FROM THE DEAD, proving all his teachings were true, the bible says in ROMANS 10:9 if you confess with your mouth the Lord JESUS, and believe in your heart that GOD RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD, YOU WILL BE SAVED. ( from eternal separation from GOD in HELL) if you choose to not confess with your mouth the LORD JESUS CHRIST, you will one day, the bible says one day EVERY KNEE will bow before him and confess with their mouth that JESUS IS LORD to the glory of the father (Philippians 2:10-11) but it will be too late. Confess NOW and turn to JESUS CHRIST NOW!!!! HE IS WAITING ON YOU!!!! HE WANTS TO GIVE YOU ETERNAL LIFE (JOHN 3:16) BUT YOU SEE FOLKS, IT IS ONLY THROUGH JESUS CHRIST WE CAN ENTER HEAVEN, NOT OUR GOOD WORKS/DEEDS, IT IS ONLY THROUGH JESUS WE CAN ENTER ETERNAL LIFE. DONT BE LIKE THE RICH MAN WHO IGNORED THE VOICE OF LAZARUS, DONT GET TO COMFORTABLE WITH THIS LIFE, BECAUSE THE POOR MAN (LAZARUS) AND THE RICH MAN BOTH DIED, THE POOR MAN WAS CARRIED INTO ETERNAL LIFE IN BLISS, BUT THE RICH MAN OPENED HIS EYES IN HELL!!!!!   1 CORINTHIANS 6:9 Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites.  1 CORINTHIANS 15:1-4 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures

I thought she was signing divorce papers.

She popped off with this album. So beautifully executed.
One of my favorite songs on this Dope Album...Queen did her thang! I love the whole Album & May God continue to Bless You & Your Family 😍🔥
The crazy thing is.. I was just talking to myself about.. how people keeps pretending that they care when they really don't.. I am so tired of being hurt.. and I have never even been In a relationship ... Just keep it real.. and tell me what it is.. and what it ain't.
I liked it until the devilish smile after she signed herself away......maybe I’m in it too deep, maybe not .....😳

The journey has been real 💪🏾 Feels like yesterday when you and C.S. went viral before starting YouTube. No more cold mattresses, no more red couches in a 1-bedroom, no more pretending. You did that!
You will know the truth 📖 and the truth will set you free.

Bible prophecies are happening like never before, we're in the end times. Are you saved by believing in the blood of Jesus Christ? John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life. Christ said, "Come to Me as you are." It's not about not sinning, it's about having faith that Jesus lived the perfect life we couldn't and you're given eternal life. The Blood of Christ IS enough! God wants to give you salvation, all you have to do is have faith in Christ. https://youtu.be/A159GcAffpI (He also has a Spanish version.).
I honestly don’t see no other artist doing this . Queen is so inspiring ❤️
gay af
Beautiful smile 😍😍!!!

One doesn't own emotion, and when one is owned by emotion, it's a reflection of one's belief that one owns them ⭕️Non-Duality
Anybody who dislikes anything of queens is a hater and their life is miserable.

Queen you got ppl out here crying happy tears over your success. The fact that we’ve seen you from the start come to far with everything you’ve done and look where you are now. You’re truly amazing and deserve the world
Check out my book on my channel ty
What are you doing to your lips queen? Everytime a female artist get something done to themselves they get worse and worse. If lil kim isn't the best example, I don't know what is. Queen is already beautiful. Stop the foolishness please. This song is fire 🔥 though

Jesus is the way the truth and the life, No one gets to the Father but by him. Jesus died so that you can have everlasting life. Place your faith on Jesus. Trust Jesus. Jesus saves.   God bless you all

yesssssss Queen
Congratulations 🎊 whole album a vibe .....
Yessss❤️❤️❤️❤️
Just keep it real baby 🥰
Love this song
A favorite already 😩
The evolution is beautiful 😩😍
Security guard Running around chasing Cj Becoming a YouTube Meeting Clare Signing her deal Pregnancy with Legend  Dropping her first album      **GROWTH**
It’s the ending for me that just makes me want to cry my eyes out. The ripple of her past moments 🥺
This video makes me so emotional in two ways. 1. Because on some parts I can relate to her struggle and her pain. And 2. Because she’s literally got so damn far from where she started. Like the song is so much powerful than people think and listen to it as. Queen is just a women who started with nothing and had to figure out how to provide for herself and her baby CJ alone. And now that she did and has someone who values and treasures her and her son speaks volume. And that’s why these people are mad. That’s why their exes are mad. Because they both got it figured out and are happy with a whole family now. I’m so happy for you Queen. I don’t know if you’ll ever see this, but I don’t know you personally but you are a remarkable and beautiful woman. And I wish you nothing but more happiness, success, & health. You deserve all the goodness this universe has to offer you! So proud of you. 🤍✨Keep shining Queen. ✨
This is everything ❤️ i watched this with tears in my eyes! I feel like I’ve watched her grow from the red couch till now . She’s deserves it all . I am truly proud her her ❤️❤️ her first album dropped and I cried tears of joy knowing how much this means to her ❤️ never change baby girl 🙏🏼
My favorite on this album 💜🧡❤️💛💚
I literally love you omg

Congratulations on ALL of your endeavors! 😘🙌🏼🎉🙏🏼🥂 you are so deserving! been here since the red couch and grateful to be a witness to your success in so many ways through what seems like 10+ years! lol (at least it seemed that way to me from empathizing with you and your journey) May your light continue to shine and God continue blessing you and your beautiful little ohana 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦❤💫🙏🏼

@ yvette pinchard according to the article it says they use a skin lightening/bleaching lotion that made them look like  from completely black to light skinned mixed race although they deny it https://matsuiskinlightening.com/products/1-best-seller-extra-strength-orange-peeling-lotion-100-ml evidently this is also the same lotion that black hollyood celebrities use to lighten their skin.Why dont they just admit it? unless they want people to think they are naturally light skinned.Apparently this lotion is strong enough that it changes your color from dark to light.
I’m crying like a baby because we seen it all ❤️💕 such a beautiful story and journey we love u queen I love to see women winning
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 so lit an relatable damn this got me in my thoughts and feelings

This one hits hard
💗💗💗💗💗💗
Beautiful QUEEN
This song proper makes me feel choked up😢
This shii was beautiful🤧🤧💕
I can feel kehlani on this ❤️
Damn..she really told her life by singing and showing us what big 😍accomplishments she did by leaving the past 💕💕🌗       (I mean am I wrong?)😂
If anybody doesn't understand the concept of Queen video: The video is transitions of her life. When she was broke she used to be a security guard and she got fired the next day and her and Chris where struggling that’s why u see the first scene with her in a security outfit. They then tried YouTube out and that’s how Chris and Queen blew up and started making money but she mentioned how Chris use to abuse her in their relationship and she use to put makeup on her bruises in the long run of their channel, but Queen just kept it quiet and continued making videos with him even though she wasn’t happy, which is why you see her crying while holding the vlogging camera to represent her holding back her pain as she’s “PRETENDING” to look happy. After she finally expressed her pain and emotion through her song medicine and let’s everything out and she’s done pretending as you hear in the chorus of her saying “PLEASE DON’T PRETEND” she then blows up with medicine then signs a record label to capitol records then has Legend which you see in the scene then the last transition is her actual album cover to “MISSUNDERSTOOD” which represents her finally coming out with her first debut album and not pretending anymore.
OG’s will know the story line😚👏🏾😎
Sending you a big loving hug
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭❤️❤️ I guess we alike .....  I should be evil by now lol but God kept me how he wanted and may he give all of you discernment to see who real and who fake cause people pretend well ..... never regret be good all over again it’s their loss not yours x
Really Clearance pretending with u Ask urself WHY wont he marry u At least CHRIS did
I LOVE THE WHOLE ALBUM 🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡

I’m so happy and proud of you . You’re at the top now sis 💛🎉
1:34 Queen looks soooooo beautiful wow
Her beautiful voice is so evident in this song! The gift that God gave her is shining through. Queen, when you make HIM your #1 priority and #1 relationship, you don't have to worry about who will pretend. God will give you the discernment to know who's really for you and who's pretending. Take time to get to know YOU through your relationship with God. It's NEVER too late, and it's the ONLY way! What GOD (not people for the wrong reasons) has put together, let NO MAN put asunder. Your husband has to be a servant of God and come from God. Praying for you!! God loves you!!!
Queen is Queen 🔥
she's so goofy her vibe is everything !
Ok ok OK,👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿

Wow Queen...you didn’t have to make me cry like this 😢
This was everything ❤️❤️ I’m in tears! 🥺😢
Hi
I thought it was when she got divorced ❌🧢
It's crazy how this song resonates with me n what I'm going thro rn. I found out that the love of my life  didn't love me the way i loved him, He pretended. I wish if he was honest from the start that would of saved me alot of tears, pain n time.
I love this song and the vibe it gives off! I’m proud of you Queen and Ik that there’s a lot of people out there who are proud of you also!... you came a long way but you always kept your head up and you always kept pushing and that’s one of the things that I admire about you! KEEP SHINING BEAUTIFUL😍♥️
Dope
Queen I love your smile ❤️❤️
Beautiful video 😍... Congratulations on everything God has for you!!♥️
I understand why Queen took her time with picking which songs for her first full album. Because she has enough songs for 3 albums. Said it herself. This album"MissUnderstood" is going to be a hit frfr. Keep up the grind and hard work. Love you sis'

I’m so very proud of you, Queen Naija, you will definitely get a Grammy and many other things will come your way. I can see that you put your heart all over this, and you worked hard for it and no matter how long it takes for you to be prized far more than you have been now. God has been and will continue to be by your side, he will bless you and yours far more than expected!  I’m truly happy for you, I’ve seen all your struggles since the red couch, and I’m here for more! Glow, girl, God is good.

I’m so happy for her🥳🥳❤️❤️

Girl: Do you think i'm pretty? Boy: No Girl: Do you even like me? Boy: No Girl: Would you cry if I walked away? Boy: No She heard enough and she was hurt... she walked away with tears in her eyes  The boy grabbed her arm Boy: Your not pretty... your beautiful Boy: I don't wanna to be with you forever... I need be with you forever Boy: I don't like you... I love you Boy: I wouldn't cry if you walked away... I would die if you walked away Boy whispers: Pls stay with me... Girl: I will... _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Tonight at midnight your true love will realize they love you! Something good will happen to you at 1-4 pm tomorrow, it could be anywhere!!! If you don't post this to five more others video comments, you will have bad luck in relationships for the next decade
Queen’s personality is the true definition of the phrase “less is more” her growth, her confidence, her vocals. It’s amazing to see the growth & the simplicity in this video made it very interesting and personal 👑 🧡
Love love love the concept of this video, her real supporters will get it.💯💯
Love the outfits, all key outfits that speaks her life
YOU BETTER GO HEAD QUEEN !!!!
also, this really put me in tears I hate that people drag her so much when she’s already been through so much of that irl . like y’all have no souls .
Not y’all thinking she pregnant again😂😂😂im weak
I love this
Yep im sold she did it again love it love it love it 🙌🙌🙌🙌 go head queen yaasss please don't pretend just keep it real with me you ain't neva lied lets play that again
You’re killing it boo! So proud of you and your creativity:. Keep spreading them wings ❤️❤️
I wish her and Chris would just make that music they both need to get over it quit going back in 4th sneak dissing on each other lol SMH 🙄 they both sound good though
there is a deep meaning behind her album. it explains her journey from being someone's keeper to left in tears, a youtuber, a woman who signed her contract so she can get her label. eventually, she got pregnant and now with two kids she is one of the sucessful women out in this music industry.
Love the growth throughout your video. I didn’t start watching until towards the ending of Queen and Chris which I’m happy about because I’m so happy I was able to see the beginning of the growth of you. ❤️
So fucking cute😩😍
Dang im mad i was doing work and missed the premiere at 3
Wow🥺🤧
This Song 🔥🔥💫💫⚡️
The amount of strength Queen has is so admirable man, forreal. And at the end of it all, she still has a huge pure heart and wants the best for others. Queen deserves to win, period.
I like this Queen❤❤❤
She sounds amazing
I’m not crying...pssshhh🙂
If you been with Queen from the start you would kno this vibes from when she first hit heartbroken till now 🙂❤️
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
This video ughhh🥺🥺🥺🤩🤩🤩
i’m just cryin😫she’s come such a long long way! men done tried to break her down, social media tried multiple times cancelling her, the industry tried canceling her out bc of where she came from, it’s really her time to SHINE! this really just goes to show, it’s all about that journey God takes u on....so so so proud to be a fan since day 1! i’m gonna forever support this woman & i hope one day i can meet her just so i can tell her how much alike we are & how she inspires me every single day & to hopefully share a real genuine crack head laugh together😂😂.LOVE U QUEEN! ITS UP THERE FOR U MAMAS🥰🙏🏾🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡

Beautiful song girlllllyyy ❤🤍💙🥰
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has broken God’s moral law, the Ten Commandments. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken God’s name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers. James 2 : 10 also states that breaking even just one commandment makes us guilty of breaking them all.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because The Creator is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, EVERY sin will be brought to light, and punished. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved. Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he conquered death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ;  Except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/1432117742/ref=emc_b_5_mob_i

Yesssss bihhhh everything coming together you did so good
On the 30/06/2020 my younger sister Olebea Sinclair (Crissana) died under tragic circumstances. She was only 28 yrs old leaving 3 kids behind. On that day when I came home and saw her life less body on the ground I started crying and from then on I never stop shedding tears. I lost apart of me and I keep praying and hoping that one day I may find the strength I need to heal the continuous pain am feeling inside daily. I have been doing music over 15 yrs so i did this tribute to her life and memories, this has been the easiest and hardest song I've ever did. Take a few minutes to watch this video and listen. Feel free to leave a comment like and share. THANK YOU!!  Produced by K.M.T/ O.N.P Distributed by hapilos21 Video @xavieproduction #cry #ripcrissana #sip  https://youtu.be/fNH2RPTPlHE
omg i love how she put how she started from the bottom as a security guard and incorporated some of the things that broke her, then turned around and put the huge moments in her “new” life to bring her to where she is today. so creative.
This video is everything
She’s so talented
Been here from The start ... so proud 🥰
I have such a new found respect for queen. Seeing how these past three years have culminated in such a master piece. I have never been so happy to witness someone’s come up feel proud like she my own damn sister. Keep rising baby girl 🔥🔥🔥

Love this song and I can relate to this song
🧡🧡🧡🧡
What kind of camera is that tho lol
Love me some queen 😍
I LOVE THIS
Most Heartfelt! 🧡🧡🧡🧡
Ok but like yes
Whoever disliked this video is pure haters! Song 🔥
Love the concept of this video ❤️❤️❤️
Queen this is so good and sentimental !! thank you 🧡🧡👑🥺
Nice message here 👏🏽
I loved it though
The way I’m crying
She put everything into this Album you hear me!!! Well worth the wait! Super proud of the growth in this woman!!!
Is this the "Official Music Video" IF SO you should have put that in the title
After all the commotion going on in their lives, this is a breath of fresh air. Queens talent is truly God sent. <3
She's telling a story of before she was doing YouTube she was working as security then she got fired then started doing YouTube. Then she signed her record deal with capital records after she left chris and got pregnant with legend that's where the pregnant scene comes in! That is genius. Queen has came so far! Since the Red Couch
This video is so simple yet so amazing bc it really shows how far you’ve come. I love you Queen and I’m honestly so proud of you and how far you’ve come. Your strength, your kindness, your transparency, just everything about you is amazing and thank you for sharing even the hardest parts of your life with us through your music and even YouTube videos🙏🏽I’m sure many people can relate to at least one of your songs bc I know I did💯Congratulations on your debut album it’s honestly the best I’ve ever heard and that’s on everything, no skips at all👏🏽👏🏽❤️We only going up from here‼️‼️
I really like this song
this video is everything
awww🧡
Song is nice,Queen is Beautiful.is she trying to tell us she pregnant?
The best video u have ever made ❤️❤️❤️❤️ it shows the real queen
For people who don’t understand what she did I’ll break it down. When she had the security jumpsuit on that’s when she worked as a security guard then her crying on camera is when she broke down after the Chris situation, then the part where she was signing papers that’s when she got signed by capital records, the pregnancy part was when she got pregnant with legend, and finally where she dropped her album after 2 long crazy years.
Please guys  just take a minute to listen to Xander: stay low to a 1000 views he can’t afford studio but he grinding y’all listen to it 💯💯🔥🔥🔥 you won’t be disappointed  and I  will thank u by subscribing to your channel
I miss this kind of RnB a lot.
Queen you shut the HATERS UP!! I am happy for you!🧡🧡🧡
I love how she showing all sides of her 😍😩
I love the video!! ❤️❤️❤️
I completely love this video it shows from the bottom to the top ! From her getting fired from her security job to being signed to having another baby to being a ⭐️ STAR !!!

she’s not pregnant again. she’s showing you guys how she was once a security guard, a youtuber, signed her contract to a label, got pregnant, and where she’s at now and how she keep evolving and going no matter what. i don’t understand every fully but i think that’s along those lines.

Here before a million viiiewwsss!!
Queen i love you so much. I feel so connected to you and enjoy your music. My family always says all you do is listen to queen but I enjoy you and your music and I hope you understand how much you inspire us all. Im you #1 FAN. and don't let people drag u down ur mom named u QUEEN for a reason. live up to it and be happy. I myself go back to my mom and dad's house and it is sad but when Cj gets older he would be proud his mom was stronger enough to walk away because I grew up to see how strong and beautiful my mom is.

🌎 queen
CLASSIC ALBUM! 🔥 I thought this was going to be my favorite song but they all are. It’s very rare that you don’t want to skip any songs on an album. 😭
Queen put her blood, sweat and tears into this album. You can hear it in every song! It was so worth the wait!!  Queen you are an inspiration to a lot of women right now. The things you’ve been through, isn’t unusual, but you used the negativity and turned it into something beautiful. A lot of women can relate to you and we appreciate you using your voice in your music, to express the pain. A lot of songs out there with the same stuff, but yours just hit different 💯 we love you Queen🧡🧡🧡 keep shining ✨🔥🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡
True or correct?...you can't even pretend how glad you are that Queen Naija has FINALLY released her debut album.
Loving the album❤️ WELL DONE QUEEN👏👏
👀✨🔥🙏🏿
