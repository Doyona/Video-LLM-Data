Listen, Man United might not thank me but get the contract out, put it on the table. Let him sign it," said Rio. "Let him write whatever numbers he wants to put on there, given what he's done since he's come in. Ole's at the wheel, man. He's doing it. He's doing his thing. Man United are BACK.
United need a manager with serious backbone. Someone who can handle the big personalies at the club and make the right decisions for the clubs longevity and who can stick to their guns when dealing with people above at the club who may not nessasarily see eye to eye.
Chat replay saying Sack the coaching staff..Ok boys whos gunna coach the team? without a manager in place and financial advisors making decisions on football coaches. Wise up you mugs. When you get a manager then those decisions are made.
The club is run by clowns and parasites!!! Call them out, nothing will change.
This Rio is the same clown who said man united are back ole at the wheel I mean how can football fans take him take him serious
Of course there wasn’t a plan in regards to a new manager because nobody expected it to go so wrong so quickly. That’s not to say that the powers that be at United know what they’re doing. As they don’t.
He made United exciting to watch again after the dull football of LVG and Jose. You can’t deny that. I thought he was making progress but the last couple of months have been awful. I’m not sure what went so wrong and so quickly.
Pirate broadcast vibes with the 2 of you in the car! Come on Stephen, at least put on an eye patch mate.
Might aswell be Celtic
Pogba committed a foul, received a red card and he was criticized as usual instead of the coach. Harry does same silly and the so called old boys are off and the media is mute on that too. Wish this old faces at ManUtd are sacked for new faces.
ola rio meu amigo, É uma pena que Ole tenha partido da forma que fez, mas é o melhor para o clube em geral. Saúde 🥂 para um irmão de nova era!
We need to get rid of Maguire, Shaw, Fred and Wanbissaka. Our defence choices are rubbish and that is the fault of the people in charge of recruitment. Should we keep an inexperienced technical director with Fletcher? I don't think so. We need to have someone who knows what they're doing and this isn't anything against Fletch because he's a good guy.
De Gea also said how they were doing things too basic in training. That potentially sheds light on the players view of Ole and suggests Ole's methods were too basic in the minds of the players. Poch would be good but looking for someone with a proven track record in the PL is sensible but not bold enough. Erik Ten Hag could be the next Guardiola/Tuchel/Klopp in the PL and a good choice for the medium to long term. Poch hasn't won anything despite huge investments but Erik Ten hag has shown his projects deliver success in the form of trophies. Erik doesn't require marquee players...he makes marquee players.
The way forward at United is to stop living in the past and bring in new ideas and influences. I heard Sir Alex is leading the charge for Poch. If this is true then that's bad because we got Moyes and Ole on his recommendation. So Sir Alex needs to be excluded from the next manager decision process. Senior management needs a change too. When Poch and Tuchel were available we didn't go for them and same for certain players that would be strong in certain positions in our squad. It's almost like there's an arrogance and ignorance about the decision makers at the club. Our recruitment team need to be sacked and replaced with good recruiters...Maguire, Shaw, Wanbissaka - these guys are overrated and not worthy of playing for this club. Wanbissaka may be difficult to beat one on one but he's so uncomfortable on the ball when going forward it's ridiculous. In defence we need players who are good on the ball with both feet. Maguire cost more the VD there's something very wrong with the valuations.

Staunton City Council Unanimously Passed Resolution Condemning Forced Organ Harvesting The city council of Staunton unanimously passed a similar resolution on October 14, 2021, two weeks ahead of schedule. Mayor Andrea Oakes thanked local Falun Gong practitioners in her speech for educating the community about the issue. She said she had communicated with Virginia State Delegate John Avoli about the resolution. Mr. Avoli expressed his support for the resolution, as well as Vice Mayor Mark Robinson.  During the council meeting, the sponsor of the resolution, Councilwoman Carolyn Dull, spoke about how local residents should pay attention to forced organ harvesting in China and avoid unknowingly participating in this type of organ transplants. She thanked local practitioners for their effort. She believes that everyone should stand up and oppose China’s state-sponsored forced organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience.
Hello. I'm Ole. I inherited a good Molde team and won the norwegian league a few times. Then I went to Cardiff City after their previous manager was treated appallingly and promptly got them relegated. Then I went back to Molde even though they were doing okay without me. ps.. I'm a really friendly non-confrontational type of guy....  how does that CV hand you a job at Man Utd? Please? Anyone? Nepotism at it's worst.
The season so far: Ole's Mistake was Selling our Real captain (Smalling) in the last day of last year window was criminal, he was our safety net, instead we should have sold that overpriced & overrated two season wonder, Fake captain 'The Joker' Harry 'Potter' Maguire at a loss and recruit two more defenders to cover for Lindelof 'The Ice Cube' as well. Ole must take away the captaincy & drop him ASAP & prepare to sell them in January.   The recruitment of Varane is Maguire's rep!acement so bring Back Chris Smalling 'The Real Captain' there's still 3+ years at the top.+ bring back Tuanzebe from loan in January too. The way we've treated Smalling was 'Criminal' and we are still paying the price up to this day. Ole & Fans owe him an Apology. There's No time for Mediocrity, we must do better, but the season is still retrievable.
Glazers and woodward out..!!!
Ole was turned over by players who downed tools. Wretches.
you know it's important when Rio's gotta pull over on the m25 for some widsom talk! ⚽🎙️
Heard Sam Allardyce coming to hold the fort until summer
Rio ain't you the man that said give Ole the job ?  Pogba  & Fred still at Club!  make a comment on that !
if they are looking for a proven interim manager, lucky for utd fans cuz i got the right guy because ole the 1999 legend is available!
This is like listening to x prize fighters without coliflower ears, Carrick is responsible for coaching and he is going to lead the team out and suddenly he now will make the difference lol You can have my clubs manager gladly, and we'll throw in Maddison aswell cheers.
Harry Maguire was clubbing in Sheffield after the Watford game he’s a joke of a captain
Ferdinand was the joker who got excited after one result, plus calling Carrick a great player...what a chump. 😂😂😂😂😂🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Spoilt all the neutrals fans enjoyment this, although Carrick in charge for as bit will be even funnier. 😂😂😂😂
Explain to me how Solskjaer can get the team to 3rd in PL, then 2nd in PL, amongst numerous semi-finals and Europa League final, then add to the squad with even better players in the summer, win 5-1 at Leeds first game of the season and then fall apart all of a sudden over the last few weeks with the players saying they don't know what to do with the ball!!! How have they achieved everything they achieved the last few years if the players didn't know what to do with the ball? If you ask me, the players, particularly defensively have no been playing anywhere near the level they have played the last 2-3 seasons and that can't be the manager or coaching staffs fault. They have actually started playing with 5 at the back to try help those players out of form. The players need to take much more responsibility
I don’t know why people are going on about Laurent Blanc, he’s having a terrible time in management in Qatar ffs
Im so gutted they let OLE leaving... :(
My feelings are exactly like Rio, I do not know what is going on right now with the club. I think this is going to be one huge rollercoaster of a ride this season.
I just am glad I ve seen United win everything from CL, Leauge F.A cup and anything possible to win..  the Sad thing is I will not see them win the CL or the League  in my lifetime again.  The greatest in English Football,  we have won it all. (please get Ole in your Podcast in the future Rio)
Roy Keane
Congratulations on 800k subs
Carrick shouldn't even be there!! Disgusted!!
Man United should consider hiring an ex-player to help restore the good vibes at the club following Solsjkaer's tenure. Perhaps Roy Keane.
Arsenal gets spanked and he's happy because united get rid of Ole! Arsenal fans are always the most delusional fans in the world
If ole is sack than maguire should be kill fook ta maguire
18:30 Joel was rattled 🤣
Hire Laurent Blanc because he has a CONNECTION WITH THE CLUB??? C'mon Rio you're better than that. What's with this obsession of hiring former players and absolute novices like seriously 😂😂😂 It's getting us nowhere.  We're pretty much the only massive instiution that does that nowadays, whereas the others nab the creme de la creme of managers. Our club is a shambles from top to bottom.
15:00 Harry is definitely skunked
What I've not understood over the past few months is why was the team not falling back into a 4-5-1? It doesn't matter if you play 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3, when a team playing those formations are under pressure in games, the wide men do there defensive work as wingers and 10s or second strikers drop off to become an extra man in midfield. United meanwhile have Luke Shaw playing as a winger, Fred and Maguire push over to the left. That leave the center of the pitch empty and whenever a cross comes in Maguire is in a left back position, not a centre back position and he is the one with a massive slab head, so shouldn't he be the one guy we always want centrally in our box defending crosses?
Turn your indicators off you mugs hahahaa
no defense could stand continuous attack just becoz of midfielder not playing their role to keep ball possession.... 3 midfielder needed...... Cavani maybe....
it's staggering that the board haven't got together 3-4 weeks ago and discussed this happening. At the very least it was clearly a strong possibility that performances wouldn't get better. So where is the planning? I love Carrick but putting him in charge of his first game in what is a monumental, must not lose game Tuesday night, is astonishing. Even Sunday if you're the board, you have a 30 minute chat. you decide who you want next, and you pay the club he's at whatever they want to get him in mid season. If we wait until the summer to appoint a proper guy, keep Carrick and Phealan in, we will fall off a cliff. Pogba, Lingard, Cavani, Ronaldo etc will leave and we will be starting the next season with no CL and that will limit who we can bring in. Honestly, the way we are run is staggering.
Maguire will have to find his club hat because it's going to be cold on the bench this winter.
Ole was the manager who had the power to pinpoint the coaches to do more or sacked them if they were incompetent! So Ole will be the 1st to be blamed...
Roy Keane for interim, just to put some of these players in their place!
Joel actually speaking facts once in a while 😂 it's true though. The board didn't plan on the sacking, hiring Carrick as semi interim is proof of that. That whole coaching staff should have been sacked along with Ole and replaced with new ones immediately.
Joel is a typical arsenal fan, trying to make everything about his club 🤣 so boring
Thanks Ole, you are a legend what ever happend! I thinks players wanted him out as well. I am sorry but they didnt play like they could. Like they dont care what colours are wearing! Most of our loss are on players as well. They didnt fight!
Ryan Giggs as Interim
Roy Keane Manager with Graeme Souness as assistant please , help deal with these prima donna players
The idea of Ragnick as interim till end season transitions to Director of  football and Ten Haag takes over as Head coach is amazing, unfortunatelly the kind of people we have running this club cant make anything like that happen,its Fantasy football am afraid.. I wouldnt want Pochettino anywhere near ManUnited,let him do something with his star studded  squad first...wish him all the best at Psg.
Love how Joel sticks it on these man !! 🤣🤣
Stephen is the weak link on this show, he never has anything interesting or entertaining to say.
The First question that gets thrown at Rio 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
"its tough, he is only gonna have a day to train".!?? Has Rio forgotten that Carrick has been coaching the side for over 3 years!
Striped off Maguire of that captaincy role  and give it ton Ronaldo who has won it all
We need graham potter as manager
Manchester united are the worst run club in the history of premier league
Thank you Watford for firing OGS......but you will pay anytime we meet again for scoring 4 😁
If OGS genuinely loves the club he could have resigned  a long time ago......Zidane did it with real
POSTECOGLOU from Celtic!!!!!!!
Ole's  downfall was playing favourites in the squad of 20 players.
What is the point in having an extremely immature young Arsenal supporter on a show that is striving to be serious and informative.
So much for this being real. Suppose Carrick is his mate not gonna call him out
The hard shoulder wasn’t meant for YouTube interviews Rio!!!
Carrick coaches the players he needs to go as well as mckenna and phelen.
Get hansi as permanent
Thanks and Goodbye Ole': Carra: change captain; GK: Henderson (defence is better organised and less shots on goal + De Gea does not know what to do with the ball); Maguire must never pass the halfway line unless going up for a set piece)
Shame on you Rio for calling out ole...lost respect on you...Keane   Rooney and Gary did better calling out under perform players
Let's put it this way. The players knew exactly what they needed to do/not do in order to get Ole sacked.  I'm just going to leave that there....
Let's go Carrick!
Harry Maguire has made 9 errors in the last 10 games leading to goals? Gets a red card and throws the armband on the floor with disgust? Goes and has a night out last night and posts pictures? Ole only has himself to blame for not dropping this BIG HEADED league one defender.
Laurent Blanc?
My is everyone just using 2 weeks of Jose to say things were bad?  Ole has been very average post paris.....this was always coming amd some of us saw it coming   Clueless
Ole is Legend when playing, but not enough for handle players
MUFC fans we deserve all the misery. We have no concept of what a rebuild/long term project means. Sacking Ole changes nothing
Joel Is clueless at times
Thanks joel
Roony
Stephen will now agree you bought the £80m Chris Smalling who by the way is having a great time in Italy 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Pochetino- he’s living in amazing Paris - he’s got Messi, Mbappe and loads of amazing players in his team - he might win the champions league. And he’s going to move to Sunny Manchester and a laughing stock club. Behave.
No top manager is going to leave their job to become interim manager so it will have to be an unemployed manager.. Utd the gift that keeps giving
Ole > caretaker>interim> full time manager 😂😂😂😂😂 - clueless board
Mcfridge is not united quality.
Whoever the new manager is, they need to install some humility and healthy anger within the club. a manager with a set philosophy needs to come in and start this group of players back to square one. Wether it's stripping the armband off Maguire and giving it to De Gea, or benching Bruno, the new manager needs to make sure the players know that there is no safe spot, and if you aren't performing to your best level, then you can sit on the bench. Players like Jesse Lingard, Elanga, Mengi, Martial, Donny, Tuanzebe, need to be licking their licks because they've got a real opportunity.
Ralf Ragnick Interim until summer, he becomes DoF and hires Erik Ten Hag in the summer on a 5 year deal.
ERIC TEN HAG IN !!!
#ThanksOle #OleAlwaysLegend #OleIsLegend #EricTenHagIn #Respect
How sick would it be if Ferguson came out of retirement to be the interim manager
Rio in 2018: Ole's at the wheel, man united are BACK! Rio in 2021: Im in limbo i dont know whats going on
The three stooges are still there Carrick, Phelan and Mckenna get RID !!!!!!!!!!
Don't chat Rio you and other ex footballers, pundits with a platform this is on you lot. You all been calling for Oles head when i think we all know deep down there is something much darker going on behind the scenes at Man Utd that a new manager won't fix. I'm far from saying i was happy with how things were and are going at United but it is NOT because of 1 man. We have become a shadow of the team that claimed 2nd last season ever since CR7 rolled up again. Last season the team were working for each other now they working to make up for Ronaldos fuckery. He was Not in United plans until his bs with City
Joachim Low? Isn't he available?
Steve is a joke 🤣
If Carrick going to lead United until end of the year maybe come January, he needs to snap out of the old mentality and make it his own and play those lads who were benched. Sancho and Donny are qaulity and could assist in taking the team further, also not to be scared to sub Bruno because we cant afford to have a player becoming a weak link in a team for 90 mins, late substitutions need to be addressed also.
Wonder what odds are to bet rio never lays the blame at Ole's feet
In fairness, for those who didn't know Wenger before he came to Arsenal, that said more about their ignorance than it said anything about the man. He won Le Ligue with Monaco in '88 and the Coupe de France in '91. He was proven to be a winner. Not the most successful but still, he could build a title-winning team.
Big Sam to the rescue
Problem is, if Carrick gets a few wins, they'll give him a 3 year contract.
Maguire was one of the first names on Ole's team-sheet but honestly, for me, he's not a must-have, he's a luxury player. He's slow and clumsy. Yes, he can ping a ball from 50 yds, yes, he can bring it out of defence but he's vulnerable to the high press and he lacks the pace to make up for his mistakes. He's a good player to play against a team with no ambition. He's a good player for a manager with no ambition or tactical ability. And pairing him with Lindelof was asking for trouble as neither have much pace. We've seen what someone with genuine pace, someone like Salah or Zaha, can do against them.
Sentimental fc, ole takes all the blame, same coaching staff stil there, glaciers win again! I am a Chelsea fan and i feel bad for man u fans. Carrick will get the job, dont be suprised
Idea(s) I havent heard others talk about: The biggest mistake fergie made in his career is how he departed united, leaving them in a vaccum when he left. Could have left it to a player management collective coaching squad of the greatest teammates in any sport who were almost coaching themselves much the time anyway, running the dressing room: Rio, Giggs, Scholesy, Nevilles, Rooney, Keane, Ruud, van Der Sar, any number of of ex legends willing to participate and support the project would have been logical as a next step to either bring back in or if in already continue on as player/coaches or just coaches - many doing so in the past, groups of ex teammates coaching together.
Carrick!!! Man United manager!!!! OMG!!! He was the coaching problem. They're putting the main culprit of the midfield defensive disaster in charge!!! It was his area of responsibility as a coaching assistant that was the problem. This is beyond hilarious!! :)))
Frank Lampard
I always remember Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as legend ManUtd.
YES STE!!!!! finally someone actually starts talking about Ed Woodward!! SAF always said that whatever he needed the Glazers supplied yet it doesn't seem that way since Ed Woodward took the CEO role! I never wanted the Glazers to be part of this historical club but who's the real problem, Glazers or Ed!? This is why for me we need Ralf Rangnick to come in and transform the club back to concentrating on what it is, a football club not just a business
The whole coaching and football back room (Fletcher, McKenna) need to be scrapped. Ole was in deep waters since day one, and inherited a toxic club.
rio you must be happy ahh
Players complained about inept training methods, OLE admitted he didn't coach the Team, so the Glazers sack Ole & keep the coaching staff ! make it make Sense ☠
What a man Arsenal fan class 👏
They should not have sacked ole without a proper manager replacing him straight away. They are pretty much replacing an interim manger with another interim manager. Theres no way carrick will do a better job than ole.
Steve Bruce.. fits the bill
What if Furguson came as the interim
Laughing stock man🤦🏻‍♂️ I’m done with footy, how good was morikawa this weekend?🏌️‍♂️
Rio stop it, come on
Ole sacked but still nothing has changed , only utd would put carrack in charge which BTW is also the problem , ole was the scrapgoat , mkenna phelan carrack should of been sacked also . That's the coaching even though ole was a bad manager. Needs a reset new manager with his own staff
Vibe with Five , didn't I say it about Carrick after the Manchester Derby on the video. There you go.
Idiotic management. Feel bad for Ole but he needed to adapt quicker and give Donny & Co more game time.
Rio calling maguire professional?! LOLLLL 1. he chucked the captains armband on the floor 2. Shocking performances 3. Whether he is guilty or not he is still involved in that Greece Court case 4. The only player ever to slide someone when he has the ball and get a red (good reaction and leadership right?) 5. He is literally a cyborg ...some robot....literally no character in him at all, no charisma, dead personality in interviews and every time he is on the pitch. How he has the armband in the first place is an insult to all utd managers before him, how he is worth 80m is an even bigger joke, sell him for whatever you can get for him, cut your losses and get someone who actually can lead, yes he had a good tournament blah blah, but it's also not professional if you cannot replicate what you do for your national team for your club, and same goes for pogba, don't you think you should cut out the stupid dancing crap and social media till you can actually back all that stuff with performances?
Get Roy Keane in the coaching staff. Evra also.
Maguire isn't sat at home, beating himself up, Rio. He was out on a night out last night!..............Yep, that's your Manchester United captain. 💣💥
Joel is a wind up merchant... He brings nothing to Five other than the wrong kind of vibes...
United is brutally fucked. Fans have to start being grateful for getting top 4.
Kind of related, but would to see Nicky Butt on the podcast.
We need Ten Hag! He is the future and will be the next big manager to dominate!
Joel chomping at the camera with his new teeth is wild
We have to hire the right guy and not the one who Will be here for 2 or 3 years.  I rather we have no manager or an interim until end of season if it means a manager like ten haag isn't available right now..
Thumbs Dowm just for having this waste of time Goomer
Ya, he must be a Relative of Rio
Stop Having this Fake Wannabe Be Gangsta Gunner Fan on this Channel!
He should have gone 18 months ago  (Thanks Ole for spending over 430 million and no trophies to show for it but we got the good feel back at club) this not first time Ole has lost at Vicarage Road  with Man Utd. Joke Club
Why are you doing a podcast from your car?
Joel getting straight to the point. Appreciate 👊
Any idea of what we may see out of a Michael Carrick side? Is that a serious question??? YES, the exact same mess. He was the coach.
Gleizers out
Hey Rio - how you handed this the last couple of week; you did lose so many United faithfuls - now you got it your way, lets see what happenes, got an eerie feeling :/
Its on ole yes, but the glaciers, the biard and the “coaching” staff that should not be legally able to coach anything are still there. Man U getting related next year
this just might be a good time to invest some money in ManUtd stock? Any oppinions on that?
At least Howson called out the real problem in the club.. the cancer that is Woodward
Laurent blanc got exposed saying there is too many blacks in the France national team’
The board have somehow managed to make the situation EVEN WORSE! .. Carrick is one of the two coaches.. and they are now making him interim manager... OMFGG 😑😭  💀 RIP Man Utd 💀 🟩🟨
Ranick?
I get that Joel is an arsenal fan and literally all he has at the moment is the capability to banter other teams on a dip of form, as his club are an absolute joke. But his arrogant attitude it starting to make me wish he wasn’t on this show. By all means have someone on to go against the United narrative and bias inherent from Ste and Rio but Joel’s opinions are so hypocritical and irrelevant. And I’m a bloody Liverpool fan for gods sake.
united should get martin o neill as manager and keane as assistant irish duo will get da players playing as a unit
Ole will always be a decent human being 🤧💩
Ole said multiple times that he doesn’t running the training, Carrick, etc are the ones who do. Ole is the scapegoat in all of this!
All the "replacing a manager with an interim manager and then another interim manager" tells me that united have a long term plan and that there is an agreement with a manager that just isn't available until the summer. If there was'nt any strategy it would be much easier to get a permanent manager quite soon. This tells me that the club will not settle for anyone. I hate what it does to this season but if i read this situation correct it will turn out to be for the better and the right choice. If the guy they have in mind is the right man for the job of course.
Can’t we hire the current Dortmund manager? Chelsea took Tuchel from Dortmund and Liverpool took Klopp from Dortmund. They never looked back xD
What's the use of sacking Ole when the club doesn't have a plan.
Rio casually chilling on the hard shoulder 🤣
Lol mourinho won more than ole can dream of and he got sacked 2 years into the job. 😂 the logic behind the management making decisions is just pathetic. They gave the wrong guy the right kind of time. He was the man that would’ve brought you back but you kept dissing him because you didn’t like his vibe now good luck with the next few years or decades. Your screwed. Nobody is going to be able to pull this club back to where it was a decade back no chance
The incompetence at our club never ceases to amaze me!
It’s happened guys he’s gone . Olet We loved you as a Manchester United legend. But it’s doesn’t mean because you are a legend and we have to accept failing all the time . Thank you for taking us from point C to point B hopefully the new manager will take us to the trophy 🏆 thank you OLET ✅ we need a manager who have strategy because we have a lot of technical and tactical players exemple Zidane is the man we all need
there've been major structural problems at that football club for a long, long time now
ferdinand helped get 37 year old  ronaldo in that was the end of ole
Watch how Rio later says! Get the contract out to Carrrick! Give him what ever he wants!!! 🤣😂🤣
SCARY HOURS
Bailly scoring an own goal wasn't great but that isn't a good reason to deny him game time. Every defender who has played the game will tell you they have let in one, at some point in their career. If it wasn't for Bailly, Atalanta would have given United hiding in UCL.
What I'd like to know is why the coaching team have not worked on a coordinated high press, why haven't they worked on movement in midfield to allow the defence to pass the ball out, why hasn't someone told Sancho to go and attack his full back, why hasn't Wan-Bissaka been told to overlap and deliver crosses, why don't the two wingers drop back into shape and support the full backs, and why haven't they worked on anticipating losing the ball in attack to stop the counter? Can you think of any more? I think the new manager needs to be someone who's won a league title somewhere.
Am not convinced that the players didn't throw Ole under the bus. Not that Ole didn't deserve it but that whole Bruno act, for me, was an act. How did Bruno miss chance after chance right in front of goal, chances that were harder to miss than score? The entire team seemed to have downed tools. I wouldn't be surprised that the players deliberately threw games.
Howson is wrong. A guy being interviewed by another podcast stated there were lots of fans booing, not half a dozen. I won't be watching this propaganda channel anymore.
Still think our amazing keeper has to be included in any rethink. We’ve not been able to move the ball forward without running into trouble. The suicidal short passing and slip-ups drain the confidence and the mi Monty out of our game . The last time I saw a better way was a throw out against City and we scored the first of two goals. That was last season and a different keeper. Shot stopping is one aspect of a keepers game and David has never been in command of his area. With this defense it has proven to be fatal.
Roy Keane.
Rio: “Harry will be sitting at home gutted at that red card”  Harry: *goes out after the game with friends for dinner*  Yeah. Gutted
The whole coaching crew gots to go too, in my opinion, they have been there since Mou’s time.
Type of eps where joel isn't supposed to be featured tbh!
however told Stephen about the boos  is a liar, half the away fans where booing
You  need to remove this Arsenal guy from the panel,he is always agrguing,why do Arsenal fans just nag and argue,short minded,just dwarfs.
Ole needed more time😭😭
Stephen howson waffling again , most of the away end were furious & some of them booed him off quite deservedly so & the other fans didn’t say a word and were quiet  But that doesn’t matter cuz he is gone  It’s time to get a good interim and then that long term manager  And we don’t stop until we get a good one  No Rodgers nonsense who is below us despite our crisis
Ronaldo player manager
English supporters are obsessed with big named managers. Joel i agree withthe others. i would be looking at the guy at Nice
Why does Carrick get a freepass!? There are big big question marks over the coaching staff there. Would love to see some legends come in to help carrick, like what happened with Giggsy.  Was a shame to see certain players not running for Ole, really surprised... I think people are reading too much into DDG's interview...english isn't his 1st language and he rarely ever says anything interesting-hopefully the truth about what caused this mess comes out in the following days.
Take the armband off Harry and give it to someone who can handle the pressure. Someone who can energise, push and coordinate on pitch. It could only be CR7. His professionalism and strength of will alone could galvanise this team
Laurent Blanc, Jardim....Ragnick...imagine if they would have just gotten Allegri
Just to touch on what Rio said about Harry being at home disappointed.. He wasn't though he went out on the piss after the game.. Joke of man, no respect at all and doesn't deserve to play for United never mind be Captain..
Get kinsman in as interim
Jochim Lowe  Ten hag Gasperini  Blanc  These are the options imo get Lowe to run it till the end of the season and then go for ten hag / gasperini , great coaches with clear philosophy and play attractive football.
Ole doesn't to be sacked only for one of the failed coaching staff to take his place. Everyone of them coaching staff needs to go, they aren't good enough.
I was just thinking what is the point of sacking Ole and putting Carrick as interim when Carrick was part of the team advising him?
Heart broken for Ole and the club. Respect to Ole for pouring his soul into the club yet again.
This is funny. Ole was supposed to be the one who made it all stable. Isn't this just the most odd thing ever. We are such a poorly run club, that the man who was supposed to be an interim and stabilize the club has now been fired 3 years later. Pochettino, Conte, Zidane, Ten Hag, Enrique all either don't want to come or are waiting for other jobs. The board will not do well with Ragnick based on previous history. The fan base is divided on Rodgers.  "Carrick will take over until the club are able to fins an interim manager". An interim to an interim. Which manager would want a 6 month job. The only possible names would have been possibly Dean Smith or Potter, but that should have been done weeks ago.
The Glazer family all have a history of mismanagement. They have no idea what they are doing. Bunch of rich folks who have no idea how to run businesses. 🙄. They are running down United it's crazy.  They did the same thing to the Buccaneers.
ilike Zizu...
Ste miles ahead again in his evidence based insights. If it's partly the players as well, select different players. How is the rest of that coaching staff still there? Never gonna improve while the commercial side of the club, with no footballing nous, is running the club.
I don't think Carrick should be taking the team on Tuesday night. Surely it's most likely the same team and the same tactics. Is he going to drastically change things? NO. So why have him take charge of a deciding Champions League game. The interim should of been appointed during the international break. There are very few stand out candidates to take over now. A night off for Maguire and Shaw should be Carrick's first act.
Bring back Matt Busby
This is so funny as a citizen Of Manchester not Trafford crying rags are so funny. Franny Lee's blue and white army. We won unlike the the rags.
Get wenger in for rest of season why not
the coaches are a huge issue, i love them but they're not good enough, a new manager needs to bring his own backroom staff. I'm fine with them staying and learning and working 1-1 with some players and developing their own skills but we need more experienced coaches
Maguire is an absolute embarrassment
The tv cameras turned up the booing 👀🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿⚽️ They were all wearing merch 👀🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿what a bluffer 🚨🚨💣💣
Van de Beek after being benched for so long score the last goal for Ole’s career and on top of that he gets sacked around same time he was hired. What a comedic lrony 🤦🏾‍♂️ . But the nightmare is finally over #olefinallyout
SIMPLE ROY KEANE
beya looks like hes about to rob a house
The Glazers, the coaching staff, the manager, the players. That's the order of problems imo; we've seen the club remove the third on that list... are we supposed to expect things to change now?
What a complete Fuckin Mega Messup United have turned into!!!!! The players all look as though they are on the verge of breakdowns and the captain is throwing the Armband on the floor. Whoever comes in to fix this Mess has my sympathy, working for a Board that hasn't got a clue and players that don't give a Toss is going to be one Hell of a task!
Harry Maguire should no longer be the captain. Ronaldo should be the captain and Bruno and De Gea as vice captains.
Surely Ole could have played some kind of role at the club. They could have removed him from Manager at the start of the last international break, and moved him to doing something else, while they find a manager that could take over full time, and not this Interim manager malarkey.  Not saying that there definitely would have been some other role he could have been moved to, don't really follow the club as much as most do, just putting that idea out there.
Luíz Felipe Scolari also best CV out of work as interim
Rio is a muppet, never managed a club but stil knows everythinng better
Zidane man utd manager
Omg,get carrick and the jobs for the boys out,iv an awful feeling their gonna give it to rooney or giggs and we are back to square one,we need rid of carrick phelan mckenna and get an outside manager in
Don't know how many times I have to say this! Bring in KEANE! He's the one with the minerals to fix the club! Even if it is on an interim basis till end of season, he'll rid the rot an tell the owners how it is! 💪  Please Fergie let it happen! 🙏
GLAZERS OUT NOW!!!!!!
#GLAZERS OUT #ZIDANE IN OR #TEN HAG IN OR #RANGNICK IN GET RID OF CARRICK
Carrick has been coaching this team since before ole. Hes as big if not a bigger problem than ole.
If rio can see that the coaching is one of the massive issues get onto the board as a man utd fan with reach like you or neville be even more critical of the coaching and the owners because you guys get listened to
UNITED NEED A RESET!!! TEN HAG AND HIS COACHING STAFF. GET RID OF ALL EX-PLAYERS SIMPLY NOT GOOD ENOUGH!!
Fletcher or carrick or anything out now before its too late we need to start this movement before we go through another moron at the wheel.
Recruitment isnt the only issue. Selling of assets has also been abyssmal. Lingard, Tuanzebe, Herrera, Mata, Matic, Henderson/De Gea, Romero and many many more have all either not moved on ro been sold at smart prices bcos of being overconfident in their pricing.
Ronald koeman
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSu2vsh4rFQ    This will never get old hahahahahahahaha what a nob head hahahahahahahahahaah
I’d love Roy Keane. He would get them to play. No messing him around and there’s a few players he wouldn’t let get away with things. He knows the club and has managed. The club needs a strong leader in that dugout. Keano the best around for leadership.
So disappointed in you rio
I cant understand what foundation Ole build for long term. He spend millions and benches most of the players he bought. Never developed any youth or improved any player.  Next Season united will not be in a better position than what it was when ole took charge.
New manager needs to come in and sack the backroom staff the coaching staff and bring in his own and rebuild its a massive backwards step Carrick and phelan at the wheel crashing the same bus into the same walls no plan from one of the biggest clubs in the world disgusting how they've turned man u into a business rather then a competitive team season in season out fergie would rather play 11 players willing to run rather then what we watched yesterday
God get a grip  hes on more money .. people are been bullied into having a vaccine  and people  are  crying over this man been sacked 😂there's  people loosening their jobs  because of the covid 🐂💩 I think  he will not go hungry  🤔
I can’t stand these Englishman not flat out saying Maguire is absolute trash. He’s simply not a premier league player in this form he wouldn’t start for and PL squad yet game after game he’s a United captain this team is a myth
The irony Mourinho and Van Goal got more hate from ex pundits and factually won and achieved more then Ole. Rebuild is a MYTH, most players  are unhappy or just sh*t players still need a cb ,rb, lb, cdm, st. Dellusion FC
David DeGea must have played under more managers for Man Utd than any other player ever? If you include Giggs it’s 6 and at least two more to come in the next 8-9 months.
When does David Moyes's contract at West Ham expire? Maybe United can get him.
Mourinho and Van Goal got more hate from ex pundits and factually won and achieved more then Ole. Moral of the story no one cares how well you do just have friends in high places or that defend you till your last day
Considering that Soskjaer went into the Man U job as a rather inexperienced manager, one would say that he has done an ok job in the first two and a half years of his tenure. He would have been better off learning his craft as number 2 and eventually assume the position when ready as for continuity (like they usually do at Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Ajax).  The problem is that the hierarchy at the top rather seek to appoint yes men as coaching staff instead of ones who know who they are (footballing wise)....
There was no whatsapp groups back in the day, Rio ;]
Classic Manchester United. Out the frying pan and into the fire. No direction, no hope, no desire, no ambition.
One of them  it is
Wouldn't be surprised if the morons gave Rooney the managers position
There has to be changes in and around the squad. It seems like the club doesn't have a long-term plan and I think that some players don't have the quality/mentality to play for United.
What happened to Frank Rijkaard, get him in 👍 He was the best manager around when he was at Barcelona. Pep gets all the credit for what he did at Barca but Rijkaard started all that success. Before Rijkaard came in Barca hadn't won the league for ages and Rijkaard came in and built a great side that won leagues and the Champions League, he deserves as much credit as Pep gets in my opinion.
I’ll take Lauren Blanc for 6 months
Joel's new teeth has just caught me by surprise... Sterling Vibes.
If Michael Carrick gets  a few results there will be calls to appoint him that's how f##ked up things are at United.
Carrick was  the coach .. no tactics .. no style .. no plan .. now he is head coach , ... what will b the change .. Carrick should go too .. he is a roekie
The back room staff should have gone too. They are devoid of ideas just like ole.
We want ferguson & Roy keane back ..
Man United took too long to sack ole.
BIG SAM'S AVAILABLE 😂
How many managers have had the wisdom to take a player on poor form out of the squad totally and sent the player on a holiday to recover from burnout? And have that player return from holiday and have one of the best seasons of his career? One, as far as I can remember. Sir Alex, on Peter Schmeichel. And it wasn't like United had a very good replacement then. Capable, but not anywhere near Schmeichel's level. Send Maguire for a break, rotate between Lindelof, Baiily, Jones and Varane, whoever's fit at the time. Take the short-term pain, rather than keep a burnout player playing.
Lauren Blanc as interim coach and Eric Ten Hag as permanent coach in the summer.
Thanks for everything Ole. You left us great memories.  Once a red always a red🔴⚪️⚫️ Good luck babyface assassin✨
It takes two massive balls to manage ManUtd now. The place is full of clowns at the top. Everyone is avoiding managing there
Emperor Palpatine for Woodward Vader for oles job. Sorted. If we are losing, use the bloody force
No one next to Harry can have a good 90 minutes. As they have to do the work of 2 defenders.
de gea for captain on meeeeeee
Give it to Giggsey till the end of the season
I'll bet Big Sam would be more than happy to take the job on an interim basis until the end of the season. He'd organise the team much better and the rest of the coaches would learn a thing or two from Big Sam. Come the summer, pay the money to get van der Sar and ten Haag in as technical director and manager respectively.
FUN FACT Laurent Blanc debut season at Manchester United,the first 5 defeats in no particular order spelt the name Blanc. Bolton,Liverpool,Arsenal,Newcastle & Chelsea. Came across it on WIKI.🤔
The thing that I don't understand is way is Carrick out of all people he is the one that is appointed as interim coach what is wrong with this club. The Glazers board Ed they all need to go Man United is becoming laughing stock of everyone way are we not looking for someone better than Carrick. And don't tell me that no one wants to come to Man United.
HOW CAN YOU PUT SOME BLAME ON SOME PLAYERS WHEN WE SEE THAT EVERY PLAYER THAT LEAVES MANCHESTER HAS PERFORMED GREAT? STEVE BE SMOKING SOME DUMB SHIITE MAN.
Cristiano Ronaldo as player and the interim manager. 😂 🤩
The manager brings the vision and makes the final decision when it comes to tactics and moves.  The coaching staff’s job is to suggest new ideas, assist and validate the manager’s vision.   There were no adjustments.  All the coaching staff needs to go.
Comments full of people with IQ's lower than a gnat....
I USED TO LIKE STEVE, BUT NOW THAT I HAVE COME TO KNOW WHO HE IS EXACTLY, I DONT LIKE WHAT HE STANDS FOR. WE ALL SAW IT ON TV, AND ITS BEEN REPORTED EVERYWHERE THAT THE SUPPORTERS BOOED OLE, and he is here trying to deflect that. Bro, DOES THAT EVEN MATTER. Talking about, oh “..I didn’t boo him…”, SO WHAT? WHY YOU GOTTA MENTION THAT YOU DIDNT BOO HIM??? Damn, you not even an ex player for you to try to be on Ole side so bad. Dammmmm
I watch a lot of talk about candidates. But just honestly wondering, is Luis Enrique not available? I would love to have that kind of energy in Man U. When he would being some discipline into the squad of undeniably talented footballers.
NEW CAPTAIN PLEASE
Michael Carrick another lacklustre guy with no authority who'll be a total failure
I'm sure about to get flamed for this but United were undefeated before CR7 came in... since then the speed of the game and flow for the team has slowed down.. why?  There was no pressing and Ole was put under pressure to play CR7...I know he's a club legend but ask yourselves has he actually been an actual good addition.   Rio would slam anyone for this comment but man there is ZERO pressing with him on the field.  Cavani works with the team and for the team.  Yes it's all the players faults as well and oh man Maguire has been the real issue at the back the last 6 games and him throwing the band at Bruno the way he did, he should never wear it again.  Ole was setup to fail once Ronaldo came in.  Now Zidane has said he won't come until summer, Ten Hag has Ajax playing well, who comes in???  Everyone who was Ole out will be angry when united finish out of the champions league places and no where close to a trophy.  Ole should have been brave and benched Ronaldo every second game to give him rest but everyone would be up in arms saying you can't bench him.  United were growing but now took 10 steps back, blame everyone at the club players included.  Only Degea gets a pass since he's kept United in games they did not deserve to be in but he cannot stop every shot either and even his mistakes if you think about it have been because of crap defense.
Joel needs to learn when to be quiet
Conte was within reach and we blew it
Mad that Rio never wants to disrespect his pal Ed on anything
Ragnick is perfect, and he's available, but the club don't want real football people who are not puppets. Zidane would come, but he knows about the board. The board did not want Conte because he would of ruffled some feathers and expose them. Joke of a club from top to bottom. Furthermore, Rio said it's the coaching, yet guess who's taking over the interim role? The coaches, this is comedy gold 🤣🤣🤣
Rio is literally sat at the wheel talking about the sacking of the guy he repeatedly endorsed to be at the wheel
Here we go again 🤦🏾‍♂️
I thought Woodward was leaving. How can someone who's leaving be making such critical decisions?
Rio parked up on the hardshoulder 🤣💪💪
Carrick is too dull.. to manage Manchester United
They have to bring in a bigger name, experienced guy until the end of the season at least
Why my guy putting Rio on the spot like he works for Manchester U? 😂
All d best ole thanks for your effort n time
Whatever way you take it either having had a plan to sack Ole or not all I can say is thank you watford for putting the last nail in the coffin of our misery that's all the rest will get better after Ole has gone
Give it to Ralf Ragnick please, he can sort this mess out, german efficiency .....
Rio genuinely pulled over on a dual carriageway to stream this?
I know it had been time for him but i love the guy i know he will be hurting more then anyone rightnow i hope we never get another legend on here this really hurts
Guys we know what the issue is….the team has less balanced with Bruno and CR7 in the team and without a workhorse like Dan James for big game. The only tactics that Ole had was work hard and hit teams on the break with pace however that does not work with CR7 as the focal point. Ole does not have the tactical know how to set up a team to play to the strength of CR7. We asking the question what has changed in 2 months since you have strengthened the squad but you only need to look on the pitch and see which players are playing week in week out. Ole was give a poisoned chalice when we signed CR7.
GET RYAN GIGGS & ROY KEANE IN TILL END OF THE SEASON 💪💪💪
You guys need to replace Ed Woodward with Edwin Van Der Sar before Man Utd can start dreaming to rope in Ten Hag! Unless there is a reckoning in the leadership, on-field performance won't change
No new manager will be appointed till next season hope all you idiots are happy its over for the club
Anyone but zidane is a joke
Howson guys who were there said differently regarding the booing
Carrick is part of the problem
Put rio on the thumbnail
Carrick should be sack also the guy is useless.
As for the manager it’s not ok to let the fridge get the ball and use 5-10 touch everytime…. Everytime he get the ball i takes it up to the midefield before he plays it to shaw and stand still inn the area that are for mcfred to come and get the ball. He takes the tempo in the passing game down and play others in problem. This has been a problem from day 1 of maguire. And Ole has allowed it.
I'm with Joel, Sancho is bigger than Wenger already
My bet is Steve Bruce as interim
Maguire as captain is a joke
could keane not but inerim for us ?
Manchester United are in a seriously bad situ... We as fans saw the writing on the wall and knew that united needed a new manager and staff, but the board ignored us. Now man united are caught in limbo having Ole gone as the scapegoat and they're going to put Carrick in, even though he's had just as much fault in the club's failure. And no smart man would take the job.. If we think all these men are "good guys" then we're naive, because a "good" man would take responsibility for himself and not let Ole take all of the blame. I guarantee Ole ain't inviting Carrick to Christmas dinner next year. All I can say is....I think the Glazers are purposely ignoring the club because their feeling were hurt when the fans shut down the Super League. The club is going to fail, and man united will be absorbed by man city. Goodbye Man united....😔
Agree so much with david he stood up and said what needed to be said he is a true lover for this club
Guys, "right person" is one thing but "acceptable to the board" totaly another!  Steve, Ralf Rangnik as interim & then as Director Football, with Ten Hag taking over in the new season, would be PERFECT.  But the board will never let that happen cos they would then have no say in running the club/ transfers etc.   Problem is not the manager but the board, freakin' w..k..s
As a united fan get zidane in now i just feel he might not be tactical amazing and a genius but the players we have we can get the best from the with him
On the back of all that de gea said, why is Carrick now in charge?
Get Steve Bruce in now 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Jobs for the boys FC.
He should have been sacked before the beginning of the season... Chelsea winning the champions league should have been a message to us last season.  We could have had options in the summer
They need to sack all the coaches too!! Get them all out!!!
Nothing but love for Ole
Joel’s just hating cause Arsenal got spanked yesterday!
The worst part is, Carrick is going to probably play MCFRED
united need van der sar to replace woodward and ragnick to be DOF and interim manager to fix the whole football side of the club
I'm gonna take a back seat on having opinions about Glazer decision making. Unless they're bought out there's literally nothing that we say that makes any difference.   Woodward is sneakily being replaced back into the position of making decisions by using a different job title. They're snakes - what difference does it make for them what people are saying?
If we’re thinking long term and strategy, we need to appoint an interim and go for the perfect guy in the summer. The timing is terrible because nobody is available. Would prefer to try and get CL qualification this season under an interim manager if it means getting the perfect guy in the summer. For me the perfect idea would be Blanc/Ragnick as interim and Ten Hag in the summer. That is what would set us up for long term succes.
Can you guys push Ralf Ragnick please I love Zidane and Ten Hag but this is not about the managers it's the people upstairs. We need Ralf desperately to be the interim then the DOF. We sack our manager our technical director doesn't have a clue how to manage a team. Please Vibe with Five maybe did doesn't make sense but please help us we're dying here.
Interim right so get roy keane in .
We all knew Ole had to go but we all know that the best managers out there the likes of Ten Hag, Zidane won’t want to take the the job because the real reason we are in these  Grim times is because the people at the top are Leeches only driven by share prices and not for the legend of the biggest football club in the world, we are at a loss regardless so sad to see the club I’ve loved for 40yrs+ being stripped by some LEECHE’S who have no emotional connection to this Great club,…
Ralf Rangnick as an interim manager until the summer, then moving into a sporting director role after appointing Erik Ten Hag. We also need a new Captain.
Maguire is the worst captain. He’s worse than Harry Kane and that is saying alot
I understand people saying that Carrick, McKenna and Phelan need to go. If that were to happen, who do you expect to take charge of the team for the Villarreal and Chelsea games?  This sacking should have happened at the start of the international break. But incompetence meant that it didn't.   Woodward can't just sack everyone, march into the dressing room and say, "Chaps, I've got rid of the lot of them. Sort yourselves out for now and I'll get back to you on who the new guys are."  This isn't about sorting out the next Christmas party. The players can't take a straw poll on who plays the next two games.  There needs to be some form of continuity, just for the moment.
imagine if the club backed Mourinho, got rid of pogba, and bought him the players he wanted..
We still lose to villereal and Chelsea there is no change they have taken the head off but the body remains
Rio on the side of the A1?? And Beya... he outside his weed plugs yard?
It all makes sense now.... Ole knew he was getting the sack, that's why he went back to Norway to give him and his family a headstart for their return!
The whole coaching team needs to go
I thinka carrick is right but its temporary  And I say keep going Carrick
Ole said that he didn't do the coaching, nothing has changed making Carrick interim. United have just made Ole the scapegoat
It's not that bad. Ole has progressed the attitude of the club significantly from where he's taken over.  The good news is a new manager & fresh set of eyes can approach the squad in a whole different way.  Donny, Telles, Sancho, Bailly, Dalot are all alternate options a different manager might prefer, a new manager can shift someone like De Gea or Maguire whereas it would've been hard for Ole because of previous reliance.
Just let Ronaldo be the manager, and put Maguire in a solitary cell for a month so he can rethink his life.
Howson trying to lie that it was a few ppl booing 😂 this fat man doesn’t stop 😂 He should give up and face reality. No more Phelan exclusives 🤣
Manchester United are a joke
Ralph Ragnick Rio please Rio please
They sacked the manager but kept the clearly inept coaching setup, this is a dead club sorry.
Get Ten Hag
Why is the coaching staff still there get rid the board using Ole as a Scapegoat, Ole has said time & time again he is not in charge of the training, he's a manager not the coach, the players also has a problem with the coaching staff get them all out & start again.
They’ll say it’s “destabilised” now but say ole brought back the culture? Ole was supposed to only be and interim. After he did what he did should have got someone like ten Haag then.
CARRICK IS AT THE WHEEL YOOO....
Carrick , Phelan and rest have to go . Club is a joke
Put Roy keane it as interim he'd sort that useless bunch of players out!! They need there arses kicked!!
Rangnik interim till the end of the season then director of football to bring ten hag in  .. a dream
we dont look like a team" sorry we dont even look like a "club"
i honestly think we should be bringing in a professional director of football where the person can stabilise the backroom staff and go through a proper process to find the right manager and coaching team. Trully think we shoud be bring in ross wilson from rangers he has a good c.v and experience in this position. fletcher and murtough isnt experienced enough to make these decisions. I could understand if Fletcher had been a director at the likes of feynoord and won several trophies but hes not even won anything with the under 16s
All the coaching team needs to be Sacked. Carrick is a FLOP already couldn't help Ole pick the right players lol
Ragnick and then they should give him the job in behind like it's the best thing they can do to show fans they are ambitious
Board are conning the fans. Ole was only part of the problem. Carrick, McKenna have done the coaching, and the football or tactics were very poor.
someone please articulate them 'spirit' or Man U Philosophy that ole instilled... just cheap words.... for sure ole could not articulate it except the vacuous ferguson way or Man U dna...
https://youtube.com/shorts/TchlrQXksyo?feature=share
arsEnal guy wearing a gum shield lol
Joel keeps misinterpreting things because of his bias and it ruins the flow of the discussion a lot of the time. Banter is great and all but that's not what I'm on about here. Come on mate, you're discussing football with friends; it ain't war. Just try to chill out a bit ❤️
Roy Keane Could or will Be a Perfect Interim Coach as oppose to Michael Carrick
If the club stick with just an interim until the end of the current campaign then what happen's in the January window?
Maguire is dogshite united should never av got him overpriced and over rated.
Woodward is not a football man but for all the money wasted on managers, players, and his own salary he has gotten the club three times as much in return. So on the business side he is good. So you cant put economics in when criticising him.
Those half dozen idiots boo'ing yesterday need a slap. As a match going fan you're held to a high standard than these clowns sitting at home.
let me remind you, mike phelan needs sacking. this guy was sacked after 10 games with hull. if you guys dont know how they played and what system, yeah hull city played 4231 with similar style and philosophy. this guy is as much to blame as ole. clear as day. while we are at that, fletcher is another passion merchant dont want to see his face
Joel and Rio in the same car?
Rio, who would you like to see as the next coach for Manchester United? Good health!
So Bruno was hearing the tv audio 🤦🏾‍♂️
Start all over again for Man Utd... some of the players at the club not deserve to be wearing Utd kit and playing. Ole tried his best and took highest level as he can to the club but he did make some mistakes like tactic , transfers out and loan on Lingard last season  and those disgrace players also cost him the job.
to look at man utd that was an elite club that looks worse than fawlty towers then you look at  Glasgow Rangers within a week brought in giovani van bronkhourst after gerrard left its total night n` day. and im a man utd & Rangers fan.
Nice of Steve to clear that up about the booing. I was very much surprised and appalled at that news and that video. Our away end don't act like that usually.
Rio will be even more bias towards Carrick as he was with ole. Rio is his mate. This will get cringy watching Rio when things go bad for Carrick. I'm unsubscribing.
I think Joe is right 21:00 that we now need a manager who demands respect. These players need guidance and from someone who has won something and won’t have players questioning  what he’s actually won! Rangnick is ideal then bring Ten Haag. Otherwise I’d go Blanc then Zidane (the French connection with Blanc to help phase Zidane in). One thing is for sure, we need to move away from the amateurish coaching we have at the moment.
Mr flip flop Stie.   I remember where he gave his usual factual nonsense about when fergie was first manager and lost loads of games and wasn't sacked and what he became.   Give over only one fergie, stop living in the past.   Club could of got poch when spurs left him instead gave ole a new contract 😂😂😂😂😂  Poch would of been the best fit for man u. Style of play, handling of players and PROMOTIONAL OF YOUTH.
Carricky at the wheel. United will win the treble this year.
surely the coaching is the big problem
"Let him put whatever numbers he wants on that contract...  Oles at the wheel man, man utd are BACK!!" 😆
i cant believe the coaches haven't been shown the door as well. ole said himself he didn't coach the players so this shows how incompetent this board is. To be honest if ole went then the rest of the coaching team should've went they where part of the problem and should be looking at themselves honestly.
the logic of the board: sack ole and then keep the coaching staff who caused this mess, wow glazers think they did amazing job
You replace one incompetent, inexperienced coach with another one. Does this make things any better?
The Man Utd job is scary..even Zizou is quite scared of it..there is only one goat in Sir Alex
Donny should've flicked the biggest middle finger of his life on that clueless smiling clown during his goal celebration.
Carrick was there longer than Ole, he was there when Mourinho got sacked and then Ole too, Carrick and that entire coaching team needs to go. Let's have it right.
Zinadine is not the right guy for United  Can’t speak English … no experience in prem league and no experience as a manager outside Spain !!  Rodgers is much better match for us
But wasn't Carrick and co already coaching the squad, it's like your replacing incompetent with incompetent, Solskjaer once said he didn't coach the squad Carrick and McKenna did so are we expecting the same clueless football, I said yesterday that the board's next decision would make or break them, broken then in my opinion, why is Carrick and the two others still there? they were part of a management team. I am so against ex United players being involved with the club, if the CEO and Glazers won't go, the DOF, Fletcher and coaching staff definitely need to go, bring in a DOF, full time manager and coaching staff with absolutely no ties to Utd, new broom sweeps clean.
Where to go from here is to appoint ralf rangnick as interim manager
“Listen, Man Utd might not thank me but get the contract out, put it on the table. Let him sign it, let him write whatever numbers he wants to put on there, ZIZOU'S at the wheel man. He's doing it. He's doing his thing. Man Utd are Backkk
Ole is forever Manchester United legend
Half that squad needs to binned. Not good enough and a strong manager needs to come in. We had bad results with SAF but never had anyone not give 100%. Change the captain to Ronaldo or Bruno.   Sell - Lingard AWB Matic Maguire Telles Fred (100%) Martial McTominay Mata Lindelof
this ASSENALfan talks like they are any better,  like they are light years ahead of us
It's been an interim since fergie left
Most of the away were fans were booing, Steve talking bs
His biggest cheerleaders...we told you
Mr. WOODWARD has spent more than a £1billion and no premier league title with 4 Managers
Maguire is the new phil jones
The backroom staff ALL need to go, ole has just been the fall guy today
I'm not a big fan of Carrick the coach.   But what do people expect the club to do. Let the players manage themselves for the next two weeks?  Once the real interim coach comes in I expect Carrick to leave.   McKenna can go back to his U23 role.
Joe is just a contrarian, adds nothing.
Had to happen! Must get next steps right!
In 2008 we had a team captain and club captain. Rio and Ryan. Harry Maguire is neither. We used to win games with 10 men.
Ed Woodward is like Baldrick from Blackadder with his cunning plans. Absolute turd.
If United lose against Chelsea they can potentially be in the BOTTOM half of the table.
TV camera turned up the booing 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
What Steve can’t do hear is turn it into a Ed Woodward situation… we no he’s terrible but fans backin Ole until only recently was crazy to me. His style hasn’t just gone bad it’s been bad for 3 years. So forget emotion to Ole and understand Ole got given money and fans wer singin Oles at the wheel until only recently so did Woodward think he’s employed the wrong manager if the fans are chantin for him no. It’s the lack of expectations from fans that’s dropped. Low standards
Stabilised the club for who? The Glazers?
How do Arsenal fans always come out with those arsenal comments 😂 you can spot a gunner fan a bloody mile away lol
Carrick, McKenna and Phelan are more of a problem than Ole, they need to go.
Carrick, Phelan and Mc Kenna are 75% part of the problem - them staying around ain’t going to help. We are a shambles
Let it be known that Carrick was there working alongside Jose so how is that fixing the same problem that seemed to resurface that got Olé the chop!? They all have to go with Olé (even the Glazers but that’s another story) I cannot see another manager come in with the same coaching staff they all have to go with Olé or we’ll keep having the same problem(s) that has hindered us since SAF left!
This club need Ralph Ragnik as interim and move him upstairs. Only fans and ex players should be talkin about the glory days and nostalgia… United as a club need to move into the modern era, then if a manager leaves there’s a succession plan. Style of footballs changed we have a lot of champs league coaches in the prem compared to years ago so we need an actual plan
Get Sam Allardyce in till end of the season
An interim until we get another interim...and the same coaching staff are still here. THE GLAZERS ARE DESTROYING MY BELOVED CLUB!!
Rio, call Ronaldo and tell him to phone Zidane and at least get him to announce he'll take over next season.
What a joke!
Rio are you ok? Why you have parked your car on a highway or road?
How we went from some ppl chatting nonsense about Conte not being good enough and OGS being compared to him, to this  ?? 🤣🤣 How funny indeed how ppl flip flop in less than a month
Why is evra threatening
Ole has said that he does not do the coaching, Carrick being our interim isnt a change, its the exact same.
Steve Bruce surely
Get Ole on the pod
The glazers are terrible for this club. They don't care about it. Why are they still here? #Glazersout
Joel is trying to be opposed to the others 2’s comments but ends up saying exactly the same in an antagonistic way. I like him but his banter needs work.
Unpopular opinion: Under Ole Mna Utd clearly had no midfield
An interim till the interim??? I'm confused and I will get to the bottom of this questioning on Monday at 5pm #VIBEWITHFIVE
I believe we will look back at Ole time as period of transition that needed to happen for the team to progress. Well done Ole, you have done what the likes of other so called top managers could not do.
Man Utd need a strong hard figure like Sir Alex was....
The priority HAS to be Tan Hag. Sign him up for the summer and let him do his thing with Ajax until the end of the season. Until then, who knows. Bring in Steve Bruce for all I care.
The one thing which i did not understand was no squad rotation by Ole. When someone is not playing well week in and week out why were they not put on the bench or out of the team. Harry Maguire, luke shaw, wan bisaka, fred, mctominay, lindelof and even Bruno were at times not at there best. Dalot, Telles, Donny, Lingard, Martial and even Bailey were not given a decent chance. It was like no matter how bad anyone plays, they will still be selected every single week.  United needs to play 4-3-3 formation with   matic or mctominay as CDM and bruno nd Donny as CM. Rashford, Martial, Sancho and Greenwood play as out nd out wingers.  Ole had to be sacked long time ago.  Common guys after SAF had gone we are going in same old circles. We are the biggest club on the planet PERIOD...!!! JUST ACT LIKE ONE....
We''ve seen this coming already..
Ste still sticking out for ole .. baffling You a proper ole lawyer
Noooooo finally
managers should always be in charge and good enough
Everyone pull over at the side of the road and get on zoom
Thrown under the bus. Sacked Olé but left the rest there? WTF!! the coaches that have been coaching us through this ridiculous form are staying on? 🙄 Olé has to go and I can't believe they didn't do it after Liverpool but I do feel for him. What De Gea said is a reflection on the whole coaching staff not just Olé. The board are so clueless it just baffles me. How can the Glazers not see what an absolute shambles it is.   The coaching staff must go.  The Glazers aren't selling so they must replace the board.  Why can't they see that Woodward isn't the guy for the footballing side?  How can he "leave" after the super league but then stay as a consultant. For what ? To help his mate who is clearly the wrong choice as he CEO?  They're rinsing us. In front of our very own eyes. They're muggin us off to our faces. Woodward is muggin off the Glazers right under their noses. Someone needs to get hold of them and tell them Woodward needs his collar felt.   10:32 yes!! exactly that!!!!
Rio will yous lot (Neville & co) will stick it up for Carrick if he wins a couple of games?
In truth, the team reached 4 semi finals and a final, and 3rd and 2nd place in spite of Ole not because of him. Because as he said, he didn’t coach the time. The one piece of mitigation is that he was given Ronaldo - a gem - but not someone he’d prepared for in the way United have played over the past 2 seasons.
Rio why are you not a manager?
Ten Hag or Ralph Rangnick is the way forward.
United need Ronald Koeman🙏😂 perfect ole replacement
Suuuuuuuuuuui
Maguire  chucked  the armband  on the ground, did anyone  see that
Please not Zidane
Gerrard slipped
Ralf Rangnick as interim! That's what need to happen
The coaches need to go donny isn't going to stay ,bruno won't sign his contract even Ronaldo won't stay to imagine letting Pogba to leave for free
Just said on sky united  top target is poch at the end of the season, what you say about that
Everybody involved in the deal of signing Harry Maguire for 85 million and making him captain should be out of the club,Worst decision in the history of football transfers its time for accountabilty everybody involved in the deal should be punished harshly.Woodward OOUUUUUUUT
I blame Rio. He got horny over Ole
Zidane or Ten Haag in ASAP!
Ole isn't the problem he even said he doesn't do the coaching so they basically sacked the puppet and left the coaches back
Woodward still calling shots at United making decisions concerning club's Future which he isn't going to be a part of?? Club is a mess!!!!
Oles at the wheel man United are back..... HAAAAAAAAAAA
We feel sad and sorry the way Glazers handled this. At the same time, Ole and any manager knows that a sacking will not be dignified, plus they do accept millions in severance pay. Don't feel too sorry for the managers. Plus, the managers know what they're getting into before they take the job with the high expectations and demands to win trophies with cohesive purposeful style of play at a giant club like Man Utd. As a player, Ole will always be a legend but as a manager, he took us as far as he could but not quite to the level where Man Utd need to be at. All the best to Ole. Down side is that his coaching staff are clueless and are still in place so more rubbish kick and rush football to continue for now....
Rio, How can Manchester United become great again?

Goodbye pe teacher
