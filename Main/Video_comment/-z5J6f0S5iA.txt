Re-watching in 2025: the amount of great NFL players in this game is ABSURD
It's 2025 and Bama just stomped Georgia again. Damn.
Bryce and Williams and Metchie ,  it was devastating to deal with that combo👀💥
3:48 RIP 🙏🏽
2:49  No. Stetson holding onto the ball to long led to the sack. James Cook for 2 seconds, was wide open, Stetson just didn't see it.
Roll tide
And it ended with bryce young throwing a pic 6😂
But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding. Job 32 : 8
I think we beat them again if my wrs don’t get hurt
If Alabama had either Jamo, Metchie, Jobe, or Aurmor-Davis they beat Georgia. All 4 guys went into the NFL and they made Bama go way deep in the depth chart to replace them
RIP KYHREE JACKSON
we only lost this game to help bama get in playoffs 😂 we knew we would win playoffs easy so they needed this win i told people bama would beat us just so we can beat them in national lol all this entertainment shit on tv is about money & predictable
We all know bama would have won national championship if healthy 😂
My two sons say roll tide but I say go Dawgs
Who’s here after they did it again?
LOL Now Thanks to Alabama there will be no over-rated SEC team in the playoffs this year SOO SOO Funny!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
😂😂😂😂

Bama wins title if they didn't lose there 2 star players.
Kirby smart can't stop great receivers unless they get injured
Georgia proved it was a fluke. They had all kinds of mistakes this game and didn’t play like themselves
The last time georgia lost a game and that ends next week
Man I wonder what would have happened if Bama had not lost Metchie in this one Williams in the NC rematch.
This is exactly how the national championship would’ve gone if Bryce young had Williams and Metche. Georgia fans will refuse to admit it and just hide behind the “next man up” excuse. Don’t expect anything from a soft fanbase like Georgia.
Who won the national championship tho?
Just goes to show you the difference between this and the national championship game, When Bama had there healthy receivers UGA couldn’t stay with em. When they lost metchie and Williams it was over.
This is why we say Georgia wasn't better than Alabama. Alabama recievers was putting a hurting on them before they got injured.
In this video  don't think that NFL scout's  aren't  watching, sure they are.Its called the NFL DRAFTand if you look at how many go from the NCAA TO THE NFL,you will be surprised, look at the STATS,and the performance and you are talking about contract and signing bonus.
If jamo and mechie don't get hurt this would've happened again in the championship and thats a hill I will die on.
This should have ended the playoffs for Georgia. Losing by 3 scores in a conference championship....
I love Bryce young 😊
Best stutter and go I’ve ever seen 14:45
WHERE ARE YOU NOW SUZZANE? DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU'VE TO ME?
F Y POPE GEORGIA!
Bama wins in natty with metchie or jamo
too bad we didnt have it this year
Over a year later, and I still can't believe that route by Jameison Williams. He's special.
Generational defense my ass . The best team didn’t win the cfp in 2021, the most healthy team won.
Alabama losers
Alabama had the better team last season. Injuries got in the way. Watching this game proved Georgia wasn't that good as they thought. Alabama missed both corners and both receivers in the National Championship
after loosing to Tennessee and LSU in the SAME YEAR. COMPLETELY WASTING BRYCE YOUNG'S AND WILL ANDERSON'S BAMA CAREERS, I will be watching this to cope until 2023. Thank you.
Congratulations you won your first national championship since 80. Bama still owns Georgia IN Georgia by outscoring them by a combined 213-144 their last 6 meetings there. It's a joke people put this team in the same conversation as 2019 LSU or 2020 Alabama.
hahahahha enjoy that SEC championship, we'll enjoy the national championship
Alabama is a passing and  speed team Jamison willams,Jaylen Waddle, Najee Harris, brain Robinson, Bryce young So many more I can’t name Lol
21:22
Rigged game
Bryce is a Genius Quarterback
Wasn't impressed by the alabama qb in the natty game he lost his receivers but Saban had nuthin to help cuz he didn't have backups ready number 9 qb reminded of Tua, can't go the whole season as qb and win it all like McCarron who won back to back Coker willed them to a natty beat the best qb in the nation then Mac just kills it, Jalen was saved by Tua then Hurts saved Tua
🙄😎😂
You could see the difference Metchie and JAMO made both great great catches, I bet BAMA would have won the national championship if both were healthy, too bad both were injured in that game, they would have made a difference, congrats to Georgia on their national championship, but man what could have been ROLL TIDE ROLL
Good good good
at 1:15 jameson williams, the best receiver in the country is a gunner on the punt team and makes the tackle without letting the returner advance at all. thats the type of player i want.
https://youtu.be/EgAjx0Y7FMw
Yeah and Georgia wonThe national championship game first it was3-0Georgia losing Second it was3-3At the end of the game it was33-18
I was the biggest stetson fan but that throw he makes at around 12:30 is the best throw hes made ever.
If Georgia ever get that offense right Alabama better watch out
Roll tide
Georgia just an old sweet song 🎵 keeps Georgia on my mind. Georgia on my mind...... i said Georgia
Alabama fans done VANISHED!!! LOL... The ONE thing yall had on GA... WE TOOK THAT TOO!!! LOLOLOL
Just here to read yall dumb ahh responses about my DAWGS!!! WE ARE THE SUPERIOR FOOTBALL TEAM!!! GO DAWGS!!!!
We Need to make Alabama Great Again.
Go dawgs! Finally beat bama yesterday to get a natty title!

Go Dawgs!!!
We whipping any and everything come towards our way this year
Man think it's a game man we ain't playing this year
Didn't I tell y'all asses that we were going to put a beat on Georgia asses again
Just so you know Bama scored more points without Metchie in the second half than with him in the first half. Go figure. Roll Tide.
UGA #95 mom is a hoe
CBS does it again. 26 minute video with 10 minutes of play and 16 minutes of replays. Thank God for the mute button.  Two great teams with few mistakes made it a good game.
Bryce Young is the goat for Alabama
Ok n’ back r t to  Y if if text loh jag
no one talking about k Jackson for Bama (unsung hero, future star)!
Not being bias. Ga played like trash in this game but if smith jumps on that b young fumble in the 2nd before the half they most likely run out clock and go in tied 17 up. You take awy the pick 6 and thats 14 points rt there and we are talking about 27 points instead of 41. Those 2 tds were the nails in the coffin took ga out of their game.
Bama did not play a perfect game. Not even close. They had numerous penalties in the secondary. Poor play with the ball in the air. Poor tackling on that Bowers TD.  The offense did not use 2 minutes of the clock in 3 possessions.
Young was free all night, no pressure
Throw at 6:20 is one of the best passes I’ve ever seen
Alabama wins the are the real 🦁 of football let's go Bama 💪 #nebraska
This was the National Championship
RMFT !!!!!!!
Alabama is in Stetson Bennetts head. Stetson threw 2 picks, one of them a pick 6. But it could have easily been 3 or 4 if not for Alabama dropping a couple that were right in their hands. The truth is Stetson Bennett has never played well against Alabama and I fully expect more of the same in the National Title game. Roll Tide Roll!!!!
Man this was so satisfying… especially considering this was supposed to be a rebuild year 🤣🤣 roll tide..
That Natty belongs to Alabama! Don't think you are just gonna break-in like a thief and steal it from us!
Best Collage FB RB cooks
I did not hear Paul say a word !
Georgia favorite to win the national championship? How can you make a team favorite against a team that they already lost the previous meeting! When the sports world in a high profile game makes on underdog team the favorite team the favorite team  usually win the game and the money, Alabama looks to sweet to be true and being the underdog by plus+2 1/2 points the sports world doesn’t give any money away  Georgia wins the national championship and covers the spread!
Here we go again! Go Dawgs!!!!!
here we go again, this time for the natty just like in 2017 season!
I hate to say it but Cincinnati doesn't even belong in this game they're out of their league Bama is such another level it's not even funny
Typical bama o line game Drag people to the ground all game long with no holding calls
Georgia defense is not elite.  Great defenses don't give up 40 points in the biggest game.  They make the great plays and have that dominating 2 or 3 players.  GA can't lose this game and they did. They can't recover. The bowl game looks like a loss right now.  The bearcats might have the best coach in the nation. He is better than Saban  but does not have nearly the potential NFL players Bama gets year in and out. So in essence Georgia blew it.

bulldogs qb be selling
Glad we took a lost. Come back beat Michigan. And that extra boost because you can't lose to the same team twice
Hi
I Guess Georgia Will Get Somewhere and Sit Down Now!
BOWERS TRANSFER NOW!!!!!!
the lanes opened up and..... bennet sux
the announcers are so pro UGA... glad to see them lose
UGA secondary sux
UGA is a loser
still. cant. beat. BAMA.
Alabamas rushing game isnt that good and they rushed for over 100 yards against the #1 defense in the country? Michigan wont have to throw as many times to beat Georgia. Michigans rushing game is far better. Theyre gonna run the ball on Georgia and theyll have to figure out how to stop them. Im picking Michigan. Georgia D is overrated imo.
Gary Danielson wanted Alabama to lose this game so bad
Difference in this game was Bryce Gun and J. Williams, and slightly better playcalling for Bama. Shout out to #19 from GA. That's a STUD. He will definitely be playin on Sun.
Why it says y’all ain’t lost in y’all confrense and very obviously Georgia lost against Alabama
You're supposed to do your trash talking before the game not after I've been an Alabama fan since birth and I've said some things but never afterwards when it's over it's over for both teams you can't lose or win anymore when the game is over so that's when the talkin should stop if you're still talkin you don't really truly represent Alabama football when it's over you just say thank you and walk away you do not kick anybody when they're down regardless of who it is I was at Alabama fan when we had Mike Shula when we had Mike Dubose I remember when our quarterback was Pennington and we didn't win a game
These two Fools will treat these young men like this with no remorse. That’s what mutts like this two do. They get a kick out of demeaning these young kids.
Just listen at the Stupid Dumb little comments these to ignorant adults made about the BAMA players. I truly hope neither have kids.
Nothing more in this world I hate more than football
Rammer jammer yellow hammer give them hell Alabama
Georgia don't win big games always have a team but was not messN with bama roll tide
20:27 Game over
Great job on editing the vid
Anyway we can delete Garys comments?
You notice Gary “Dumb “ Danielson said nothing about BAMA stopping UGA the rest of the game after they score their final touchdown. You noticed he said nothing about the Helmet to Helmet tackle by a Georgia DB to BAMA running back. Two Fool that should be Barred from calling College Football Games.
I heard that these two Adults Fools that act like children won’t be back next year calling BAMA games. I hope and pray that it’s true because there shouldn’t be any place in College Football for two Adults like these two commentators that down plays these young men just because they don’t like BAMA. Just listen to these two idiots. They sound like Georgia Fans.
Two of the biggest Adult bias Fools against BAMA with the excluding Kirk  Herbstreit I’ve ever seen and these two idiots don’t try to hide it.
Someone please watch Jordan Davis at 7:32 and explain to me how THAT won the Bednarik over Will Anderson
ROOOOL TIDE ROOOOL!!!🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘♥️
15:42 those dudes can shut up  He can wag his finger all he wants because they destroyed Georgia
Rolltide
Great game! No pass coverage, Georgia. What happened?
Bama really came to play in this game. Bryce had a great  game as Will Anderson. I haven't watched Georgia much this yr but that Bowers guy is amazing. Georgia fans getting down on their qb but I think he's a real good qb. That one interception was not his fault. I believe they'll meet again in the NC game. Losing Metchie will make a big difference. RTR
Anyone notice every Alabama Td OL is holding like crazy...
You can't compare Georgia's success, or should i say, lack of success to the Florida Gators. One program boats multiple National championships and SEC titles in the 21st century while Georgia"s claim to fame is that it merely made a championship game once and has a winning record over the Gators over the past 5 or so yrs  These children need to realize Bama just passed Florida on number of SEC titles and we all know the Gators recent skid, that just shows how much they have dominated overall over many years. The kids need to recognize the opportunity to play for not only a better overall program, a much better school academically with a better location and better opportunities if football drys up even after a short NFL career. Once you get passed the Kermit the frog Smart snake oil, take the blinders off and wake up, you'll see the reality of what Gawga really is..... Is a school in Gawga that so lusts for the success Florida has achieved over the years and will again, and what Bama is currently doing. Wake up boys.... Your life is a bigger decision than the smoke and mirrors hype in a little town in Gawga called Athens. The real G is after all, Gville where EVERY team sport excels and wins tiles.... Florida don't just talk about it, they do it. I date ya, compare the titles and them you won't have smoke to blow no more!
We're big 99 lol Roll tide Roll
At 8:55 Bolden easily got a first down but was spotted short.

Who's here after Bryce Young won Heisman
Everyone know Kirby was payeed...GA ARE THE NEW MASTERS OF COLLEGE FOOTBALL

That shit was set up for more money alabama can't beat georgia twice in one year...watch every other game of the year...georgia wasn't even trying
Is bama just in ga bulldog head it must be a mental thing cause  ga has the players 2 compete
Bama has a team that is so poised it is hard 2 count them   Out of any game
Real easy to run through takles when you don't wrap up the legs

BY is a puppet to be praised by annoucers,and commentators. If a team scores on bama they say it was a blown assignment Everytime. Never the great bama player getting burned.
this is the 3rd or 4th time they’ve been up by two scores on bama and still lost. that’s sad
I knew George was overrated frucken bums

#Rolleth Shout out to Coach P.
Georgia as usual with subpar QBs against elite teams.  Jake Fromm from a few seasons ago.  Now Stetson Bennett.  When will Coach Kirby learn his lesson on sticking with QBs who are only game managers.
I hope Georgia will beat Alabama
now this was a good game!!  🏈
Roll Tide Roll
I'm a very big georgia fan born a raised in ga but georgia did not play like they have allyear like they partied in atl the night before but they will be ready next game
Michigan better be studying this game like crazy. GO BLUE 💙
Notre Dame and Georgia and Ohio's st have no more chances to play Bama this Georgia team needs a black QB to beat Bama ask deshone Watson. And dac and
How is it that Bryce Young and the dude that got a pick 6 both wear number 9?
Ga. Blitz the bama QB all the time
The last two Alabama-Georgia games have ended with the same score: Alabama 41, Georgia 24. It said during the full-game broadcast, but I noticed it myself as well. Congrats to the University of Alabama.
Brock Bowers man! Especially that drive starting at 21:18. He is going to be someone to keep an eye on. And a true freshman at that.
BACK TO BACK NATIONAL CHAMPIONS THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA 🏆🏆
Don't understand how Georgia retained its #1 ranking  after they got their asses handed to them 🙄
Punting the ball down 14 with 7 mins left?
Bryce got this on 🔒
I'm still sick.   Almost like it was rigged .
NOT a Bama fan(Sip)... but Bama is a badddddd  mother...(shut your mouth)!
Roll Damn Tide
Georgia now needs to prove in the playoffs that they're still dominant. Atlanta Braves finally made the state of Georgia relevant, now it's your turn Dawgs.
I don’t get why Alabama struggled against auburn
RTR!
Bryce was never contained.  Poor defense.  No other way to say it.
Rushing a QB is a must .  Sacking a QB is a must.  Must contain him.  That's where Georgia  failed to start with.
Bryce been like that since mater dei it’s crazy I been following bro since high school lol nothing is surprising Cali ball different ball !!
ROLL TIDE!!
Nn.
Saint nick is going all the way!! Roll tide
Here come the dawgs choking on their own arrogance once again! I love it!
Roll Tide.  We played this game . And we left everything on the field. Great game
This is so refreshing...😂😂😂.. ROLL TIDE ROLL!!! I just can't help but to keep coming back...Damn life is good for the BAMA fans....
Bryce was on fire! 🔥 Just a sophomore, so lots of great Bama football coming, thanks to that young man. Keeping positive thoughts for John Metchie’s recovery.
Kirby once again proves he can do LESS with the MOST talent in college football.  What a joke..... starts a walk on ahead of JT Daniels.  Georgia would finish 4th in the SEC West.   And the Ga fanbase thinks they are elite because they beat up on Vandy, SC, Mizzou and Tenn every year.  You have a losing record against SEC West schools.
It's hard to explain why UGA virtually disappeared from this game after scoring their first 10 points...
I’m still shocked they think Georgia will beat Mich by 10. Haven’t watched us and we’ve had better competition besides their Bama game
williams is fire
Whenever I watch Alabama, I sit and think......How many of these kids are in basket weaving classes......and how many have tutors that do their weaving for them.
Commentators really wanted BAMA TO LOSE😂
Stetson Bennet is just not built for this. You can see it in his body language every time something went wrong for his team. He’s fine when his defense completely controls the script and he just has to make the easy throws but any time Georgia needs a quarterback to win, it’s just a mess.
Williams. Best receiver in college.  Bryce Young and Georgia QB.   Gonna be special in the league
Never pull for Georgia teams.They will break your heart every damn time!😬🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Not gonna lie, after the Auburn game I was worried about Georgia, but Bama did well, wasn't expected this great of a performance!!! Roll tide!!!!
Rolltide
Alabama's game to be on Friday December 31, at 2:30 CT on ESPN all sucks. That to many is just another work day at a time that many will still be at work. #1 Alabama should be playing during prime time instead of Georgia and Michigan. Antenna TV should be showing these games so everyone can watch.
We're lucky Bennet didn't have more interceptions. Put the gun slinger in because it's obvious we need it. The mixture of Bennet throwing pics and the defense saying the worst all season we never had a chance. One major flaw with the spread offense is you give the defense a huge gap to sack the QB or back. After the pick six would've switched QBs.
Some things never change. Congrats Coach Saban and the Tide.
Georgia panicked when the got down on scoreboard..They never had any real tough games and they just got whooped..
Bowers was the entire leghumpers offense.
Stop the bias against Bama announcers/CBS….glad they don’t get the chance to call another Bama game this season. Also, the refs seem to throw more flags against Bama especially in the Iron Bowl it was ridiculous amount of penalties and some were just ridiculous. The SEC Championship was better but still a few very weak calls against Bama, only one weak penalty called against Georgia that I recall and the refs missed like 2 other real penalties. Called like  3 weak flags against Bama!!
Who else noticed the blatant bias against Alabama and for Georgia in the SEC Championship? If you weren’t watching the game and just listened to CBS, you would have thought UGA was either winning or playing good ball. They did a huge disservice to the Bama kids by not getting excited and calling the game as it was played. Bama’s offense and D played their tales off and scored on 5 consecutive drives against the “Best D in a Decade” according to the college football world! 4 of those 5 scores were TDs too BTW. That’s amazing but wouldn’t have known it by listening to CBS. ESPN, please don’t be biased against Bama in the playoffs. We know everybody is tired of us winning…but this is a totally different team than those teams that won those first 5 of 6 titles since Saban has been there. These kids deserve to be praised when they play a game like they did this past weekend and CBS praised Georgia more than Alabama in a beat down. MANY of these kids didn’t even start last year! Sure real college football fans picked up on it almost immediately, especially in the 2nd or 3rd quarter when Georgia drove the entire field basically on Pass Interference calls against Bama. Then Bama gets the ball the very next series and the refs miss a PI call against UGA. CBS announcer says the refs are letting the DBs play today, they let Bama get away with some running/touching which was a complete LIE. The other commentator cut him off because he realized how dumb of a comment his partner had just made!
Who else thinks the bias against Bama was so noticeable and that we are so glad we don’t have to play on CBS against this season. They sounded so dumb when Georgia drove the entire field based on 3 or 4 pass interference calls, then the very next series Bama has the ball and they missed a PI call against Georgia. CBS commentators say they are letting the DBs play today, they let Bama get away with some touching earlier which was just the opposite of what had just happened the series right before that comment. It was 3 PI calls against Bama in the same drive, then they make that comment when we get the ball and UGA gets away with some touching/rubbing that kept a Bama receiver from getting his hands up. Look, we don’t cry about calls but just commentate the game without blatant bias. CBS, you suck and need announcers who are gonna call the game as it is. They praised Georgia the entire game basically why Bama was literally picking apart the “Best Defense” we supposedly had seen in a decade. They even pointed out everything Bama did wrong when they’re playing the game of the year, plain and simple. Like in the 4th quarter early we didn’t eat off much clock and they act like that was the end of the world for Bama while we were up like 17-21 points at that time. So glad ESPN has competent announcers who won’t show any bias now that Ohio St is out because Herbstreit loves his Buckeyes but that won’t matter now, he also loves Clemson due to his son/sons going there and playing for Dabo. So we should get some unbiased announcers in the playoffs. Need good refs too, overall the SEC Championship was called pretty well by that crew of refs. But the Iron Bowl was absolutely terrible refereeing and several calls against Bama were extremely weak. Few weak calls in the SEC title game as well but only like 2….but they missed a couple of calls again UGA but overall it was a B+ score by that ref crew. Very first penalty against Demarco Helms when he hit #4 on the sideline was a weak penalty, Georgia hit Brian Robinson a few feet out of bounds later in the game and didn’t call a late hit. Also called Bama for every potential pass interference and then let Georgia get away with one on the very next series after they called 3 on Bama.
Bowers was no doubt the best player on Georgia
love it, Hell of a game . Roll Tide!!!
I do think the refs did a good job but they are throwing too many flags for targeting, late hits, PIs, etc. this season. Especially against Bama in the past two games!!! Bama got the short end of the stick big time in the Auburn game, refs were terrible. I will say this crew did a much better job refereeing but they still called a few bad calls, one against each team on offensive holding. Called our center for getting run over by a UGA defensive tackle and the DL fell on top of our center and they called holding. Then later the same type of play happened but it was with the receivers of Georgia getting run over by our DB and the WR for UGA kinda pulled our guy down on top of him which I don’t think either play was holding! That very first penalty against DeMarco Helms was super weak, he didn’t even hit #4 hard and they were not even a yard out of bounds. Then they called Bama for every single pass interference but missed one against Georgia. CBS says they’re letting them play today, they let Bama get away with some touching and now they’re letting UGA when that was just the opposite of what had just happened🥴🤥! How stupid of a comment to make when Georgia literally had driven the entire field the series right before on PI penalties. Overall the refs didn’t ruin the game like they almost did in the Iron Bowl. Made the Iron Bowl hard to watch because that crew threw flags every other play, some were extremely weak calls! But this game was fun to watch no matter what team you’re pulling for, not too many flags but just enough I guess. These refs better not be flag happy if they wanna call the big bowl games!!! Words of advice! If it’s not a easy call to make and a noticeable penalty, keep your flags in your pocket. Especially when it’s far away from the play!!! Newsflash: Fans get tired of seeing yellow flags every series! Also the CBS bias for Georgia was so noticeable when Bama was clearly outplaying this “ELITE DEFENSE” and making it look easy! Bama scored on 5 consecutive series and 4 of the 5 scores we TDs. Hello, how about telling the people about how awesome Alabama was playing instead of pointing out every single thing UGA did well or everything Bama did bad the few series they struggled like in the 4th quarter. Glad they don’t get to cover the playoffs because we hate CBS calling our Bama games but they outbid every other network to get the Bama games 90% of our big games. ESPN has the playoffs locked up and I’m thankful because their commentators actually know football and understand the game. CBS is the worst, especially when they want Bama to lose like they clearly did in this game. Because they both picked Georgia to win big. Announce the game as it is, if you were just listening to this game you’d of thought Georgia was outplaying Bama pretty much the entire game which couldn’t have been farther from the truth. Fact!
Man, sure hope Metchie will be able to return next year. What an athlete
Why are you guys given the coach, all of the praises and all the money? I  haven't seen him take not one snap, scored not one touchdown , nor made not one tackle.  If those players decided to attend any other school, that school would be going to the national championship. Unless they go to a historical black school.  It's the players on the field, period.
Georgia, the whole team, changed after the Williams TD. I can understand the defense considering how good they’ve been but I don’t understand why the offense decided to go air raid and basically abandon the run. Wild
I'll have to say that I was shocked that Gary Danielson, wasn't biased against Alabama like he usually is.
as an auburn fan i'm glad to see georgia get erased. Georgia is a liberal disgusting state now.

Alabama had a lot of games that they should've lost this year, but this wasn't one of them
Who else is here 3 days later just to relive the excitement?😆
Learning Facts Helps End Atrocities Torsten Trey, Executive Director of Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting (DAFOH), said in the opening remarks that “this horrific practice is beyond our imagination and thinking as human beings.”  “It is impossible to speak about the Holocaust without mentioning the Jewish people, and in the same sense, it is also impossible to speak about forced organ harvesting in China without mentioning the Falun Gong,” he explained.  Trey warned the medical community that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has been pursuing an eradication campaign against Falun Gong since July 1999. By delegating the execution of innocent Falun Gong practitioners from the courts to the hospitals, the CCP has thereby weaponized the transplant profession in China and turned it into the executioner under the name of transplantation. “However, killing a living person for the purpose of providing a cure for another person, turns medicine into an absurd practice and violates the medical oath,” he continued.  “I hold that by objectively speaking about the practice of Falun Gong in public, the incentives for the Chinese government to use forced organ harvesting as a means to eradicate the practice and deprive the international community from learning about Falun Gong will be defeated, and the stealth weaponization of the medical profession will be disarmed,” Trey added, “The earlier the world learns about Falun Gong, the earlier the forced organ harvesting of Falun Gong practitioners will end.”  In fact, Falun Gong is based on the universal principles of Truthfulness, Compassion and Forbearance. He said,“Talking about the victim’s practice serves two purposes. It not only gives a voice to the voiceless, but it also provides the most powerful and most peaceful approach to combat forced organ harvesting.”
The officials did everything they could to keep Georgia in the game. It wasn’t nearly as close as the 17 point differential would indicate.
Great Game Re-Cap!
People are blaming Bennett for this loss, but IMO, you get the same outcome with Daniels in there. Sure, Bennett threw a couple of bad passes, but if you look at the replay of the game, his receivers weren't open that often at all. Then you add that Ga's defense looked like they're wearing cinder block shoes compared to Bama, and I don't see Bama scoring any less. UGA hadn't seen talent like this all year, Bama was just too fast.

Jesus said,  "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery  already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said  "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying,  thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten  Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or  guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not  God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son  to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that,  while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the  dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who  confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do  that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a  wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God  will never let you down.Visit needgod.com
I believe Nick Saban has a Kirby Smart voodoo doll buried somewhere. Just look at the strange results of the  last four BAMA/UGA games: 2018 BAMA 26 UGA 23 "QB SWITCH-A-ROO I" 2019 BAMA 35 UGA 28 "QB SWITCH-A-ROO II" 2020 and 2021 BAMA 41 UGA 24 "THE BOOKEND GAMES"
Jordan Davis benched or hurt?
Bama has more kung fu poses than the wu tang clan. 🥋
UGA will always be Bamas bitch , "get yo ass back on the bus"  Hey and I'm a life long UGA fan

sick picks 0:40
This was the Most Surprising Alabama game since 1992 Miami Sugar Bowl Game. As Alabama Fan I really thought we were going to lose before the game started.
Nice to see Alabama beat Georgia!
Beatdown Highlights... aaaaaand action
Extended Highlights meaning Replay every fucking play 😂🤦🏻‍♂️💀
7:52...........very lazy effort / pass rush from the supposed most dominant defensive player (#99) in college football.
Rolling in the Dough with the tide!
Georgia was ripe for a loss. Alabama was up for it.
Not to take anything away from Alabama, they showed up, they played great, and played they actually wanted to win, but Georgia didn't even try.
It should be some great Semi final games leading up 2 the championship game
Bryce Heisman played really well. I think he would want that Young award for sure.
Bryce young is a good QB 2 be so young he is a poised Freshmam
Michigan’s d-line is about to have breakfast, lunch and dinner with the bulldogs quarterback.
that goal line camera is crispppp
Bama and georgia are 2 good Teams who knows they might Meet again
Bryce Young is the best🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
I know Georgia  wonder will They ever beat bama
Bama rises up 2 the occasion In big games a well coached Team
Was Georgia' ready 2 play did they take bama 2 light
I was surprised bama won the way they did but was glad Cause l was cheering for  Bama
Jordan Davis has some making up to do for his draft stock, I'm a Charlotte born Bama fan and It'd be the first time I'd seen him play since his Mallard creek days and I'm disappointed. Guy has 0 motor and moves outside of a bull rush, if you look closely most of those guys for Georgia aren't your average PR specialist.  I'd guarantee the stunts, blitzes, and dominating inferior lineman was what made them look so good. Solid front 7 nonetheless and they're definitely physical at the LOS but the Michigan game will be very indicative of that let's see if they bounce back
Somebody hear about uncle lou.talk trash about Alabama all week.
Bryce young is the heisman coming from me a uga fan
Brock Bowers spits in trashcan - Gary Danielson - "He's such a great athlete"
Williams got some unadulterated speed!
Eat PEACES Georgia, you never had a chance cause you never played no one, thanks for winning all that money 😅😂🤣😭🤪☝️... Georgia plays like Clemson, they should have played J.T
When's ga gonna field a qb
Stetson like a man
Roll tide
Nick Saban used the same kryptonite used on his big bad defences that Kirby Smart use to run for Alabama. A mobile superstar QB and portions of the hurry - up spread.  Wouldn't allow Kirby to substitute ...... Masterful coaching.  Saban has evolved with college football.  Yea Bama's young team has struggled on and off this year but we all have to remember Saban has 5 star players 3 deep all over the field. 5 Star players on the sideline who can't get on the field yet.  Georgia is built so similar to the 2008 to 2016 teams Bama had. Saban used all this knowledge and the Deshaun Watson formula to take down Georgia. Hes considered the GOAT for a reason
Watch when Bryce laterals the ball to Brian and then go on to block for him. Heisman moment.
Minus the big plays from Alabama I mean Georgia played a good game. The dagger was the pick 6. Everything has be reviewed with the QB situation Stetson to me just isn’t a championship caliber QB.
The Tide showed what it means.. The Alabama Standard
Williams and Young…the best of the best. Bama always surprises us!!!!
*Hey, to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Here’s the facts… Georgia hadn’t been tested all season, hadn’t had any adversity to deal with… all blowouts this year in the East division of the SEC… running over Kentucky, Vanderbilt, Missouri, South Carolina, and Florida on a neutral site!!! They don’t have to worry about the swamp, their rival game was Georgia Tech… Trash!!! The entire world said Bama should stay home, no way they could compete… Atlanta is Tuscaloosa East, Bama owns Atl…  Bama has been tested all year long, hostile environments, much better talent in their SEC West division. Tide had at least 5 games that were won by one score, Georgia is not Bama, no matter how hard they try to duplicate them.
https://youtu.be/t0xHlgWQvAk
Both these guys are going to be in trouble vs. Michigan especially after  watching this game.. Neither one of them have a defense to stop U of M run or the O line to block there d ends.
Georgia got out coach
Michigan fan here honestly shaking in fear
Ah sweet memories
Georgia fans were talking so much trash before this game.
It's only in college that Nick Saban is extraordinary, he got shown to be a scrub  when he tried to move to nfl and immediately ran back to college
The Georgia FRAUDDAWGS finally played someone and got their ass kicked! They played a garbage schedule all year. Michigan will eliminate them.
GROWN...........MAN..........FOOTBALL!
Proves bamas always #1 even if there not #1
This was trash the auburn vs bama was the best game to see this year
I think Michigan has a chance to get to the final
from the caribbean but loving this
Seeing a lot of Bama-Tua in Bryce Young. No fear to air it out and let his receivers run under it or make a play on it.  Composed in the pocket. Fun to watch.
Oh I thought a bulldog barked or some
only thing we need BAMA in life is a video of Nick Saban doing the karate kid move
As a Georgia fan, it's frustrating to know that Alabama always has their best game against Georgia (and although I hoped against it this year, deep down I knew it was coming). Due credit to Bryce Young and Alabama's offensive line.  They sure offended me last night.
Not gonna lie, I was one of the people who thought Georgia can't be beat, but now I remembered that they always get exposed by Bama
Georgia d exposed
Bryce Young is definitely the heisman now. He just put the icing on the cake
Why are people so mean to Alabama I
I despise Kirby.
best played game of the season for Alabama
Kirby Smart isn’t!
I don't know why the big gambling brains favored Georgia in this game. I picked Alabama to win outright. Not because I like them, I definitely don't, but because they pretty much always win. They are like the Patriots in the Brady era except without the checks and balances the NFL has with the salary cap and free agency. They have a competitive advantage every year due to recruitment. Top players want to go there to be on TV and have a better shot at making it to the professional level where they can be paid millions per year. I guess they are closer to an MLB team like the dodgers or Yankees who can spend unlimitedly to have a competitive advantage over smaller market teams.
Georgia has not played anybody this season. They've been highly overrated. Bama showed them puppies how to play.
georgia looks up to bama as a big brother
Last time Kirby decided he wanted to get the ball into Fields hand on a 4th and 11 fake punt. This time he’s down in the fourth and punts on 4th and 9… Sabans left foot>Kirby Smart
im tired of this same bullcrap man.. .. its gonna be the same BS game in the natty... same old stupid teams. same power house due to money. so boring..
Byryce Young like Babe Ruth calling his shots
Davis was a complete non-factor and looked tired and outta shape. That 'Bama OL whipped them for 60 minutes.
Straight up PIMPED DEM GA BOYS OUT!!!
I remember going into this game thinking it felt similar to the 2009 SECCG. Alabama playing against the #1 team after nearly losing to Auburn on the road a week prior, everyone saying Alabama would get blown out. Alabama proceeded to win in dominating fashion. Love to see Georgia fans get humbled.
Gary was absolutely devastated after the game got out of hand.  He wanted uga to win so bad.    He talked about how Bama’s o against uga’s d was gonna be a Mis match and it didn’t look good for Bama.   As soon as Bama scores it’s first td gary says well “ that must of been a blown coverage .”   Well even if it was he gave Bama no credit.   That alone isn’t a big deal but when u add in every 3rd down he talked about what uga needed to do to get it or if they were on d how they could stop it.     He was gushing early when uga was up but when Bama got control he went quiet on their big plays.    Roll Tide Gary.
Georgia lost because of QB and Alabama won because of their amazing improvement to O-Line (and heisman qb)
Mich v UGA ALA V Cincy
Well guess bama gets to go to the natty guaranteed. They have play cinci lmao
Smh. Dejavu
Holy smoke.... I though Georgia Bulldogs dismantled Bama...
TG Georgia out their a azzes Beat, I'm Florida fan, heat Georgia.
Does Alabama coach have anything on Kirby smart this isn't the first time it looked like he gave the game to Alabama  I also think Daniels need to play the next game seems Bennett was overwhelmed 🤔 and nervous
Bama beat Georgia bad. J Williams making Georgia stand still with that speed and doing the Karate Kid after was tough 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Now they’re talking “rematch” not 24 hrs since last nights shellacking - I don’t think they will beat Michigan
While Georgia does have a really good D they haven't faced an average QB all year much less a stud in Young..
This is a really young bama team so it just makes sense why they are peaking now. Bama is also dealing with several injuries at rb and o-line and now with mechie out they are going to need the young guys at the wide receiver position to play better
And the tide just keeps on rolling lol!
Waste
Anybody who thought georgia was unstoppable must not know who alabama is especially against georgia
Brad Nessler had his "Let's go Brandon" moment. After Young runs in for the touchdown, a hurt Metchie screams from the sideline, "Let's fu*king go!". Nessler hilariously turned what Metchie said into, "That's my guy".
Bama had it easy, their opponent never showed up
Mml
I once heard that a group of Georgia tailgaters would ceremoniously and with great fanfare eat the mascot of their opposing team before the game. For Florida they would grill gators, South Carolina, they would feast on chickens, of course, Arkansas - hog, Kentucky - sad pot brownies, (blue grass) etc. But when they played Alabama they would eat Red Tide PODS, cause they felt they were going to get sick anyway.
Young had all day to pass. That Alabama O-Line is insane
Roll TIDE so proud of our team
I can't name every single player for Bama, all played so great. Thanks for this wonderful effort, finish, even if playing Georgia again, finish it! RT
Re-match coming January 10, 2022.  Something tells me the re-match will be a closer score.
There are two words in college football that have caused more nightmares than all scary movies combined ... "Touchdown Alabama!" #RollTide
What an Awesome game,, can't wait for the rematch!
Correction to my previous comment - start asking questions like how good is Georgia's offense or how good is Alabama's defense.
This should put to bed all of the jocking  sent in the direction of Georgia's superb defense. Start asking questions like how good is Georgia's defense or how good is Alabama's defense?
ROLL TIDE ROLL!!! #1🏈💃🏿👍🏾😃
Thanks for keeping that #1 spot warm for us until be beat y’all, GA. We appreciate it.
This is why we do not play the game on paper.  As I noted earlier, do not underestimate Nick.   Oh yea, Young looked liked a :deer in the headlights" someone voiced last year. My. how things change opinion wise.Bravo Zulu Alabama and good luck during the play-off.  My Bruins will get a bowl bid for the first time in a long while. Unfortunately, the injury to the other wide-out is a concern and someone will have to step up their game for Bama.  Roll Tide.
How did that field goal count
This was the most complete game Bama has played all year. They really got motivated after the iron bowl. SEC Champs again baby!
Saban is going down as the greatest coach is college football history, and that is saying something.
Nick Saban has UGA's number. I don't think Alabama took the Bulldogs seriously at all
The lateral and the 55 yard deep shot should have secured heisman
The play at 1:48 and how the O-Lineman reacted at 1:55 had me seething!  I knew he’d eat that in the end like that defensive player in 2018 who did the little puppy walk move after a play.   UGA = U Got Annihilated    U Got Ass-Kicked.  U Got Alabammed!
They cheat to win
Roll Tide coming from underdog the media favored Georgia smh!
Alabama has been a defensive powerhouse for most of its existence but has transformed itself into an offensive powerhouse for the past few years. So now when another team has a good defense Alabama has had better and knows how to counter the best defense offensively.  Teams that gives Alabama the most trouble are probably those that are good at all positions of the defense; at the line and the secondary, no weaknesses to exploit. Alabama exploited Georgia's secondary in this game.
Bowers is a beast definitely a 1st round pick
GOD BLESS
Georgia just can't beat Alabama.
This game just reminds me how much I miss Verne Lundquist as a commentator over this hack
Amazing game.
Well I hate to say I told you so But I told you so lol #ROLLTIDE
Ps sub
It’s the same problem UGA had last year against Bama. They have elite players all over the field but lack an “elite” QB. Idc how good your defense is.. you cannot keep up with modern offenses unless you can score and keep up.
Gg to Bama but this isn’t over, we may see you in the natty. Oh and one more thing. START JT KIRBY
Bryce Young is just different oml😭😭 Bama on top
punting down 14 gave us all the info needed about this game. Kirby wasn’t trying to win.
Even CBS can't lie on this.
I like at 23:30 he was like number 1 on number 1
Grandad turned me to a roll tide watcher though the past wars queen ride on the elephants elephants are known to be good luck when they trucks are up wink
And I thought last week was a great game lol. Roll damn Tide!!
Alabama Is The Truth
Bullshit game to get 2 shitty teams in the playoffs
#70 on bama OLINE, your work did NOT go unnoticed bro
Where them Georgia fans at bruh….they was talking like they was champions 😂
When in doubt, bet on Alabama
13:03 heisman moment💪🏾
They the dawgs they love h&”$ and addicted to money cars and clothes it’s just 1 lost Go Georgia Bulldawgs
wonder what Georgia's thoughts were when the score was 10-0?
Georgia will get redemption with a National championship! Against Bama lol
Both defenses played poor
GA hardest game this year was the worst Clemson team we’ve seen in years. And y’all thought they was gon blow out Alabama? Alabama side of the conference is WAY more competitive 💯.
Yay...more bandwagon Bama celebrations all over. Fantastic...how I grow tired of seeing this 💩.
Dawgs: We don't deserve 🤧 this, to be beat 😤 like this. We were building a house 🏠 😫😥  Tide: "Deserves got nothing2do with it" bbbbbbbbbbbbbwwwwwwaaaaaaahhhhhhaaaaaa 😂😂
This loss might be the best thing happen to UGA. They got sum humble pie today and will have a month to get JT ready fix whatever issues they had in the secondary with busted coverage and play a Michigan team. Michigan isn’t Alabama and UGA should win that game and face a Alabama team that will not have Mechie available. Alabama was a different offense after he got hurt and UGA was able to just focus on Williams. UGA will be hungry and desperately want revenge and Alabama will have all the hype with their Heisman QB and defending title on the line..Gonna be a good one
Commentator doesn't say touch down Alabama. Anybody can tell he doesn't like Alabama. I watched full game.
The key to this game was the fumble by Bryce young that he was able to somehow recover and gave them the go ahead score at the half
Georgia got 0 sacks against Bama roll tide roll.
This is one of bamas worst years and we beat goriga and it's their best year roll tide
To all the UGA fans who were chirping about how they were gonna beat Bama because of how they played this year almost losing to Auburn and Arkansas. GET F***ING HUMBLED!! You hadn’t faced a top defense all year. And every time in the first quarter, the offense was stalled and you had to rely on the defense to bail you out.. And what happened to that vaunted defense? You deserve this loss. If you play like that against Michigan you will be wrecked.
Al-A-Bama
Lol everyone wrote us off and even our spoiled fans didn’t believe in us all season smh . We were tested all damn season . Almost losing the lead against Fl and then fighting to get the lead just to lose to A&M. That Auburn game really woke the whole damn team up . The garbage media and fans saying this is nicks worst team but now want to be hyped and making all this noise try’s fans will never switch up no matter what  smh . This team will be even better next season, I’m done rambling . Bryce Young is special !!! If he has another season like this I’ll take him over Tua and Mac 😂 #RollTide
Get wrecked ga 💯🔥 roll tide 💯🔥
Ok I’m not trying to talk trash to the uga fans but how, y’all talked so much saying bama sucks just how😂
Georgia always pics the wrong Saturday to piss the bed !! this time they got beat at the line of scrimmage !! he who blocks and tackles better usually wins the game
We were out coached plain and simple
I really hope we don’t have to play Georgia again. Yeah we won but I’ve seen it to many time in history “You got us in the first round…but just watch what will happen in round 2” So I hope Michigan will beat Georgia 😂 Georgia is good team and I’m an Alabama fans. I respect them. I just hope if we face them again we keep the same mentality and not “oh we beat them already so this should be easy” I’m sure Nick Saban is drilling that in the players head that we could see Georgia again and the next will be much more hard to beat because of the mentality
Bennet just couldn't do it I wonder did daniels even wanna play this shit is unbelievable
Bama made a few minor adjustments and the ass beating began !! game was never in doubt !! Bama is just flat out better
I’m a florida fan and I know we’re down bad but HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAA
We will face Ga again.... RMFT!
The GEORGIA FRAUDDOGS played a garbage schedule all season long, rolled up FAKE and PHONY numbers and people were calling their defense one of the best in recent memory. BAWWWW 🤣🤣 The FRAUDDOGS are going out in the first round of the playoffs. EXPOSED!!
À
This is what happens when you think you have a defense but haven't really faced a great qb
Where all the Comments that were saying Georgia will destroy us ??? 😂😂
Bryce Young will be a number 1 draft pick in NFL draft. Stetson Bennett won’t even be drafted. HUGE difference. Until Ga recruits top rate QBs, this is what you’ll get cause Alabama’s team hinges on its QB. And Bryce Young is that good.
Georgia gave up
To hell with georgia need them rapist an robbers back on team
Georgia needs qb, they have all these 5 stars defensive and skills positions players they need a joe burrow or deshaun Watson, otherwise the same thing gonna continue to happen
That's what happens when u sleep on the greatest college coach of all time!
Love that Georgia fans have been humbled. They were disrespecting the hell out of Bama lol.
I've never seen a team choke so consistently
Georgia getting overhyped and choking in big games will NEVER get old. 😂
I love Alabama roll tide!
Ayooo where the Georgia fans at?? Georgia fans where ya at?? Where was ya elite defense at? Georgia fans where ya at?? Come out. Don’t hide come out come out. All the shit ya was talking come on out let’s continue to talk shit together. Georgia fans where ya at??? 😂
I never doubted Bama I knew that Georgia would fold like they always do.
Butt Kicking.....The difference between Smart and Saban is that when Jalen Hurts was struggling, Saban put Tua in.When Stetson was struggling, Smart just just left him in. Out coached...again. And let's be honest, Stetson should have been intercepted 4 or 5 times last night. And I'm a UGA fan and was at the game. The question for this team all year has been: If we get into a shoot out, can we keep up with Bennet - now we know the answer - NO. But it wasn't all on Stetson - our defense - the generational wonder - looked confused on many plays. Bama's receivers were running wide open with no-one  even on the camera shot all night. And this with THREE all star defensive coordinators on staff - Lanning, Smart and Muschamp. Inexcusable performance on defense. Stetson is a remarkable story and God bless him he's been a blessing to have. But if he is the best QB we have, we're done for the year. It was a nice run. Kudos to Bama - well played game and a Heisman QB to boot.
Bama, Cincy, ND, Michigan
Nick Saban is the GOAT 🐐 of college coaches PERIODT!!!!!!!!
Looks like the only Championship Georgia can win is Baseball
I think Michigan wins it all
Georgia use to be a Red State but they turned Blue and yesterday they turned bluer when the Crimson Tide rolled in!
Now.Rolp Roll Tide
Another ass kicking by Bama on Georgia 3 in a row
Bryce young heisman no doubt
Analysts and Pundits were eager to Crown Georgia, Like Denny Green said "If you wanna crown their ass, then crown them!" But Bama has Bryce young and Georgia Doesn't. enough said.
Georgia needs Jt Daniels
Thanks for keeping our seat warm dawgs 😂😂 business as usual...
Roll Tide! 🏆🐘🏈
Roll tide 🐘😁
Bryce Young is a beast!
UGA and choking in the SEC Championship.  Name a more iconic duo.   Georgia is always the most overrated football program in the nation.
Brad Nessler and Gary Danielson = worst announcers ever:  Mute the TV and then crank up some heavy metal.  A much, much, better watch.  I hope the SEC cancels MSM contracts altogether.
Georgia Bulldogs 10 -0 then Bryce young put on an air attack and once again Nick Saban out coached the Bulldogs
Georgia not as good as they think
💥💥Well people need to learn is to stop betting against Alabama, I've learned that the hard way a few years ago lmao people probably thought this game was over when Georgia was up 10-0 we've seen Georgia have double-digit leads on Alabama. This the 3rd time since 2017   Alabama runs the SEC it shouldn't even be called the SEC. it should be called the ASEC Alabama Southeastern conference, because they own that conference.  They may take a year off like they did in 2019 and let some other team win the conference but for the most part you know Alabama is going to be SEC champions before the season. So was trying to pump up this Georgia team like LSU in 2019 this Georgia team wasn't on LSU's level.  Another thing that you watched during this game the weakness of the Georgia defense was their secondary. No other quarterback all year was able to attack Georgia's corners like Alabama was.
*GEORGIA GUARD 54 GIVES AWAY EVERY FKING PLAY... HE TOO BIG AND SLOW*
ROLLTIDE!!!!!!!!!
These comments are idiotic.  People are talking like GA sucks, like they haven't just murdered every team not named Alabama.  This happens a lot to teams that are good and don't get tested by other teams.  Bama exposed a weakness, GA didn't counter.  Quick throws exposes their DB's and doesn't give the pass rush enough time.  And GA didn't run enough to control the clock.
Congrats to Young on MVP of this game as well as all the very capable “pieces “ it took to have a winning season. Just as with Mack Jones, I will be tuning in to watch Bryce to shine on Sunday’s. He not only has a big arm, he’s a dynamic play-maker. RTR!!!
Georgia does not belong in the national championship Playoffs
UGA shouldn't be in the playoffs.  A cupcake schedule is how they got to this point
danielson is biased af
If things work out the way the way they should if it’s not fixed, these two teams will meet in rnd 1 as the 2 and 3 seeds.
kirby is in bed with nick,so obvious
bennet trash
Roll Tide!
We had no answer at all did all that great defense and was undefeated yet when it matters in big games we always find a way to blow it
Glad Georgia got humbled
Everybody said this Georgia team is the greatest college football team ever lol Roll tide 😎
there is a lot of first round draft picks on these two teams! WOW!
Georgia DB's sold 😴
Well looks we playing Michigan 😂😭that’ll be a kill !
They should've gave Bryce Young the hieisman today no need to wait
Alabama will go up to #1 and GA will fall to #2 and we will probably get a rematch for the championship.  I love college football.
Offensive line showed up
Ok I just wanna lighten the mood y’all see that Alabama player names Kool-Aid?
Rmft
Bowers seems like the only dawg that came here to play im so disappointed I’m my dawgs just rolling over and dying like that 😪
How Bama and Georgia fans were 🤣🤣 https://youtube.com/shorts/uF-CC9IVqMs?feature=share
Funny video of Georgia and Bama fans lol https://youtube.com/shorts/uF-CC9IVqMs?feature=share
When Drew Brees was in college, his then OC, Jim Chaney said Drew was a passer that can run.  Drew was fast and slippery, not like his Saints days.  Bryce remind me so much of the Purdue Drew Brees.   Brees did not run unless he had to, just like Bryce.
The "Geogia lapdogs" proved once again in front of the Nation when it comes down to it Geogia will find a way to lose! Vegas must love these guys, what a disgrace
ROLL TIDE! So glad georgia LOST!😁😁😁💪🏼
bryce young is the best in the nation by far
Bama keeps them recievers ready for the NFL
As a bama fan I eas expecting to steam rolled
Wtf 😐
I don't want to hear no excuses from Alabama hater saying that we pay the refs off Georgia just lost they haven't played nobody like us all year long
This is such a kirby smart way to lose. They have their game manager back up QB throw 50 passes even tho they had success running the ball. Idk if JT daniels is healthy but if he is he should have started this game.
Great game
Kirby Smart needs to be fired unless georgia still makes the playoffs and wins the natty.
I will never bet against Alabama they’re the best college football team ever been winning since I was a kid
So is everybody just going to sit there and act like this wasn’t the exact same score as the Bama -vs- Georgia game last year…😳
Georgia chokedogs. Just can't win the big one.
I TOLD YALL BAMA WAS GONNA EXPOSED THAT SO CALLED NUMBER ONE DEFENSE 🤣!
5:31 What is wrong with these DBs this season not even trying to tackle? Is this against the rules now? Dive and reach your arms out, you will likely  trip him and he will fall down. 29 has another almost play later. Humm.
I should have played in the sec lol I wonder how much I could have made lol
I didn't think anyone could beat Georgia this year. I forgot they can't beat Alabama no matter what. My bad.
Georgia will forever be Alabama’s little bro
they lose metchie (been underrated) but they get their RB back with rest for the playoff push…their other receivers are going to have to make big plays again to win it all,i have them winning it all again #gooregon 🤣🦆
Paul finebaum
Bama’s defense in 2017 > this years Georgia defense
Bama is rolling and Georgia fans can only "bryce" themselves
Never bet against saban he gets teams ready to play like maniacs
Roll Tide!!! Bowers for UGA is a beast though
Bryce Young will probably be the only QB from Alabama in school history that works out in the NFL. This kid was dropping dimes in this game!
7 point spread with a walk on quarterback and a man that never beat Saban. Ok, sure. UGA was going to kill them. Typical UGA fan delusional. No knowledge of football beyond "gO dAwG 🤡, REd aNd bLaCK".
Bryce is something else
Bama won
Bowers was amazing! But Bama was better! 😁
ROLL TIDE🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘
Georgia's Secondary got cook like a turkey on Thanksgiving
Cincy-Georgia final, you heard it here first
Can't blame the refs tonight so they blaming their quarterback and their coach.
🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘
The sadness in Douchlinson voice is priceless
Me and Shannon Sharpe are very excited Bama fans! It's going to be discussed on Undisputed Monday morning! Congrats to coach Saban, Bama coaches, and Bama players! Young was so composed and J. Williams was just a burst of energy.  ROLL TIDE!
Well we'll well the number 1 defense got there ass handed to them.
is it just me because everyone on the field runnin fast asl
As much as I can’t stand Bama, if Saban keeps them ready like this these next few games, they’re winning another title
Its like Alabama had a moment where they were like hold up were 99 overall
Their pass interfering in perpous it’s better than them getting 10 yards instead of 40
People are mighty quiet after this game lmao💀💯 bama shut alot of people up tonight
ROLL TIDE ROLL
This was a team win. The O Line did the best they have done against supposedly the best front 7 in the league. Williams and Metchie did they thang. I hate that we lost Metchie for the season. Bolden and Billingsly has some big time catches. Bryce Young won the Heisman tonight. Gotta give credit to Golding and O'Brien for calling a good. Can't forget Robinson and Sanders gained tough yards.
Problem is Alabama just showed the other playoff teams “how to beat Georgia” if those teams have the personnel or not is another question
5:32 SPEED
As a die hard Dawg… this game hurt! No excuses. Congrats to Bama for handing it to us. I hope we get our act together for the playoffs! Assuming we are still in… Go Dawgs!
What a win. Bryce Young = Heisman. Saban is Saban. Alabama is Alabama. See you in the Playoffs. RMFT
Georgia really held bad teams to under 20 points and people thought they were a good team their offense was sus
The Tide beat the Dawg 💩 out of Georgia.
Stetson should not be starting for this team. To get to where GA wants to go. They need another guy
Cincinnati has beaten only 2 ranked teams ND #9 and Houston #21....ok RTR!!!
roll tide baby. i knew we were gonna win when they changed the betting odds and uga hasn’t played anybody all year!!
Alabama lives in Georgia head, plus the Georgia Dome is Alabama's second home. They proably have a really good record there.
Well bama is mediocre? dawgs gonna blow them out? y'all people stupid who thought that.... BAMA has the 🐐 why do u think that man has 7 nattys LOOK at his  record in 14 years at bama y'all thought y'all was gonna blow a bama team out like a cream puff Lord some never learn 🙄🤣
Is Kirby the next 100-million-dollar man  ???
Rolltide
The Alabama Invitational is on Aka Playoffs
Great game. All the naysayers, keep sucking dat thumb.
Both these teams are in the playoffs regardless of this game they will play again ROLL TIDE
Its like bama spotted them 10 and then said hold my beer
How dare you doubt Coach Saban and the Alabama Crimson Tide. They always pull out a brilliant performance when it matters. Roll Tide 🐘❤️ Heisman for Bryce 🏆
I told everyone that young man from California is a BAD MOTHA!!! (Bryce Young) Heisman Trophy Winner! Next on his plate!
Well we'll well they say Georgia going to do this and that Bama not going too score more than seven points tonight Bama show the sport world they not going too just show up lol  as I always say if Bama play the way they support too do they be okay... Roll tide.. Ps they not going too let Bama play them again in the playoff
Georgia  has great talent  but until they prove something  then they are just like the rest of the hopefuls around the country.  Hasn't  won anything  since 1980. If the sec sec sec is so great then why does Alabama  run it almost  every  year? Alabama  is why the sec gets the hype and everyone  else is just overrated.  Bunch of jock riders who chant sec sec sec. It's Alabama  and everyone  else is along for the ride.
Yeah I want to move on from Kirby Smart. College teams need to stop with hiring former Alabama coordinators its not a magic pill for success.
720p?! come on, cbs, This looks terrible.
Georgia overrated asf. Cringed to see them at #1 all year knowing the SEC has always been overrated because they always have the powerhouse Alabama
No matter how good your defense is you need an elite quarterback in big games ask us bout Deshaun Watson in 2017
This game shows you can never count out a nick saban coached team especially one with an elite QB. Bryce Young performed open heart surgery on the best defense in college football. Kirby had to actually coach in this game he couldn’t rely on elite talent alone because bama’s athletes are just as good. And saban proved once again why he is the best college football coach in the history of the sport.
Georgia can’t win the big games
That left tackle was blocking like his new Mercedes-Benz was counting on him.
That left tackle was blocking like his new Mercedes-Benz was counting on him.
Kirby benched Justin Fields yrs ago remember that
Fuck Georgia…..ROLL TIDE ROLL!!!!!
As a ohio state fan so glad bama blew them out
Buckle up Georgia Big Boys from the modwest coming ur way! Michigan won't be denied the championship game ur better off playing Bama again. Our team is the most complete team in the country we can beat any team anywhere and we went from unranked to 1sr in the country with a team full of men that got stomped as boys! This team embodies m8chigan Midwest men and women. Hard working blue collard people with a fu***n huge chip on their shoulder. Who ever qe play better be ready couz we coming baby! 〽️〽️〽️〽️〽️〽️〽️GoBlue!!!!
Alabama want there throne back I see
Roll Tide!, Finally Georgia's Defense Wasn't Perfect.
UGA is no match for Bama...never will be under Smart
Bama’s last offensive series that took 5 minutes off the clock and resulted in a field goal, making it a 3 score game, was HUGE.
*Cue the Imperial March*
Gary Danielson.. haha the biggest alabama  hater !! 🤣
It was yummy 😂
It’s Bama’s technique for me! Just insane 🔥
We now know who really is THE BEST TEAM IN THE NATION and there's NO DEBATE ABOUT IT because they proved it against the SO-CALLED HISTORIC GEORGIA DEFENSE!   Put 41 on them!   ROLL TIDE!
Williams or Jaylen Waddle. Who faster?
Do I see another historical SEC national championship game coming real soon…. 2018 rematch….Roll tide roll!
RTR 🐘🏈
I guess Georgia didn't want to be there... again.
Bennett  hasn't been pressured all season..this Is what happens when he gets some heat  from a real d line
My Georgia family members are likely Blackout drunk right now 😬
To all you Alabama haters, just remember Nick Saban says he wants to coach 10 more years at Alabama, I say at least another 6 Saint Nick will be able to do, Roll Tide
Gawga by 40😁
Roll tide Roll don't ever count the Alabama football team as underdogs it seems to piss them off rolled right over them dogs Goodgame Alabama good season Georgia see you again soon
All these Alabama fans were also Patriots fans a couple years ago... Funny how that works.
Anyone seen this clown called drwinstonOboogi?  Loser Auburn fan who said, "This is our Year". It is your team's 6-6 year,  enjoy drwinstonOboogi. I love it when just about everyone picked UGA to win. LMAO
I knew this was gonna happen lol. Georgia was no better this year then they were last year. They just got waxed by bama early last year😂 This year they just had an easy schedule🤣
Roll tide
great
I was listening to the talking heads on the radio as they were bragging on how Georgia was easily moving the ball on Alabama throughout the 1st Qtr. And other dramatic discussions about if Alabama loses to UGA would they still be able to make the CFP?....lol.  I told a friend of mine at work who is a die hard Alabama fan not to worry. I assured him that Georgia can't beat Alabama!
maybe this will finally teach kirby smart to go with the better qb
Roll tide roll
georgia should have gone for it on 4th down when it was still 7 minutes left, still though the score does not do it justice this game was a battle, oh and that umpire is a dick
HEY BULLDOGS! WE JUST BEAT THE HELL OUT OF YOU!!!!! RAMMER JAMMER YELLOW HAMMER GIVEM HELL ALABAMA!!!!!🐘🏆
Georgia's  defensive backs got exposed. Period.
I thought Georgia would be the best team but now I think Alabama will probably win the whole thing
You can call PI on almost any pass play against Alabama defense...
6:40 missed flag right? His receivers are blocking before the pass is even thrown.
Did the defense party too hard the night before or something? Very little pressure on Bryce and the receiver coverage was nonexistent.
Let’s give a big hand to the refs for winning the game again😂
The committee wants to set up a Bama vs Georgia rematch in the Championship is what I meant to say
We know who the 4 teams are who'll be selected tomorrow, we just don't know the order. Here's my order 1) Bama 2) Cincinnati 3) Michigan 4) Georgia  This is my order, but the committee won't have it like this because they want to set up a Bama vs Georgia rematch. Us fans don't want to see this because it's going be just like tonight, accept on a different day!
Im a Alabama fan and its not over yet. Motivation is EVERYTHING in Football. Georgia wanted to win but did not have everything at stake like Alabama did. The biggest prize and the one that only matters still lies ahead .Until they meet again...
ALABAMA RACIST STATE
I know what it's like to lose. To feel so desperately that you're right, yet to fail none the less.
U ga LOSERS!!!! 👍
Anyone who Innerstands the quarterback position totally. Knows this is one of the greatest QB's ever on any level at any point in one's career. The way he utilizes his legs, wisdom in the pocket is something I have never seen before. Even slightly better than Mahomes. That play against Arkansas to the rb out of the backfield showed how aware he is of the game.  Roll Tide Roll
I Bowers eligible for the NFL draft ?
7:09 one of the most aware plays I've ever seen from any qb. That was a Heisman moment if I ever saw it
Bama against the world. Roll Tide Roll ❤🤍
The Bennett kid did not play up to the hype he's been getting this week.
This was a good game. Bama beat Georgia with the same score from last year’s game. #RTR
Georgia shouldn't make the playoffs. That performance was pathetic
1. Alabama  2. Michigan 3. Georgia  4. Cincinnati
Georgia went 12-0 just to get humbled by their nemesis Alabama. Such a waste.
Georgia i need a reimbursement
All We do is Win!! Win! Win! Discipline and Prestance!! Always win the Game!!
Oh I'm so glad BAMA WIPED THE FLOOR with those bullpuppies I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY THREW A FLAG RIGJT AT THE OPENNING drive what the eff..he was running and just bumped him out of bound ....what was he to do ask him to go out of bound....it's football you bought and paid referee bought and paid by bullpuppies.....ha ha ha ha we beat yall again...
Georgia: I know how Mia Khalifa feels...
Roll Tide!! The Tide Rolled the 🐕 Dogs Big Time.!!
I see a lot of finger pointing by the bulldawgs.
If I had a nickel for every time Danielson said "wheel route" over any given season, I'd have a bunch of nickels.  I've watched football for over 50 years, and I had NO IDEA what a wheel route is.  I miss John Madden-level explanations of terminology and play design.
My Boyz
Typical Bulldogs choking a 10-0 lead. Both them and the Falcons are the choking brothers *slow claps*
The DB had the angle and the lead on Bama WR and he still couldn't catch him.
Dawgs were barking all week. Now they gotta sleep outside. 🙂
Roll Tide!!
Auburn did better than that Georgia!
Dang!  Williams got some unadulterated speed!
Win it all or lose, this Bama team is going to be ridiculous next year.
Kirby Smart… excellent recruiter but a bang average coach.
Same ol Georgia..crumbling when it counts
12 - 0 for nothing considering Bama the underdogs.  That's why it's you lose during the regular season, it teaches you something about your team, what it takes to overcome your mistakes.    - Congratulations Bama your into the College Playoffs.
Same ol’ Georgia. Still unable to win the games that matter, and still Bama’s bitch
😎💪
Exposed they ass
Same stuff every year . Bitter OhioSt fans crying about Alabama. Alabama has 1 loss in 2 seasons. Ohio state had 2 this year. Alabama has 6 NC since 2009. OhioSt has 3 since the 1960s. Alabama played a top 3 SOS and last year they literally played a all SEC schedule. Crying isnt going to erase the Buckeyes 2 losses or the beating Alabama gave them last year
I really don’t want to see a rematch in the playoffs, UGA will get waxed again.
ROLL TIDE 🐘
As a bama fan, I was totally expecting a blow out by Georgia, I fell asleep and woke up to a score like than and I screamed
It’s official, Alabama is probably the most hated team in the country 🤣🤣🤣
See what happens when Georgia plays a good team lol?
Business as usual for Georgia.  Absolute humiliation for the players and coaches.
Rolllllllllllllltideeeeeeeeeee
Georgia we good, they the ones who needed the win … thank you for not playin hard and not gettin Injured smart to not show them everything 😌😌😌😌
Looks like the Big Bag Bulldogs got humbled pretty badly.
ROLL TIDE ROLL!!!! 🐘🐘🏈🏈🏆🏆🏆
J. Williams is another Jaylen waddle
I had Bama in this game right after Auburn, Nick Saban prepares a team like no other.
Let’s gooooooooo I love ALABAMA🏈🏈🏈
ALABAMA BOOOOO!!! GO DAWGS!!!!!!!!!!
I love it when Saban's gang are deemed "Underdogs"  RTR!
I told everybody we'd win...cant wait to go to work to talk shit 😆
Bryce young =  Heisman
Bye Georgia fans we beat yall and yall won't make it this year idk when tho
Georiga had a bad game Alabama had a good game gg to both teams go dawgs
Bryce young is such a great player
This is why I don’t watch college football. Alabama goes all the way really every year. Same teams goes to the playoffs every year and only 4 teams are able to go in the playoffs.
If these 2 meet up in the national championship game, then Alabama will dominate them again
Georgia Fans Quiet Now
Just like that it’s over
Georgia fans thought this would be a blow out lol well it was just not the way they thought
UGA is out of the playoffs.
