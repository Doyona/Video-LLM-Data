"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” John 3: 16 (King James Bible)  9."In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him." 10."Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins." 1 John 4: 9-10 (King James Bible)  “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” Romans 3: 23 (King James Bible)  8. “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." 9."Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him." Romans 5: 8-9 (King James Bible)  3."For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;” 4."And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:” 1 Corinthians 15: 3-4 (King James Bible)  9. “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.” 13."For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” Romans 10: 9+13 (King James Bible)  "Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth." Luke 15: 10 (King James Bible)  “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” Romans 6: 23 (King James Bible)  I hope everyone has a nice day as well! ^_^
Awsome
Hold on- Was that Jeb from Duck dynasty?
I kept wondering why this song is even more addicting than all of his other songs…it’s because this one sounds like 90s Country!

Hands down, this guy is going to be a country legend some day. Every one of his songs his solid country gold.
My best song ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Q
:) Hello so I wanted to share the gospel of Jesus Christ so look Romans 6:23: The wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord so when we sin it's like this a man gets a speeding ticket and goes to court to pay the ticket but say someone else pays it for him u see that someone is Jesus Christ and if it wasn't for him we'd have to pay witch = hell but god is willing to forgive U and so we receive our forgiveness when we acknowledge our sin, repent, and put our faith and trust in Jesus as our lord and savior if u have any questions let me know ❤
I love country songs that get me excited and hyped up
💯💞🙏🙏🖤♥️💖🖤♥️🙏🙏💞💯
Absolutely love my wife the same way ❤️

Hi, Luke Combs. My name is Kennedy. I wanted to let you know that I am a huge fan of you and this song is one of my absolute favorites. I listen to froggy 104.3 radio station and I heard you talking about how you have to take a break from vocal lessons for a while. I hope you feel better, and I look forward to hearing more songs from you in the future. Keep rocking the music. I'm lovin it dude.

I can’t believe so many people doubted this man’s singing ability. For gods sake how could you just listen to how he sings his songs, especially this one, or “doing this”  every song luke puts out just catches you and carry you to the end. His songs have relatability, excitement, emotion, etc. love this song.
Love his music and everything he puts out he's number one

He is the soul of country music
Bad ass
Broden 🤠😎🌽🚜🚛
They are perfect for one another I love the ending of this video and the song is totally rocking
That so 🤗🥰 sweet 🥰💕 🤗😇
great song. odd the video is about kids, makes it weird.
What a Awesome song
I love it when he presented his wife with the one ticket and asked her what can I get with that and she said a Whoopi cushion and then his response about the fart that was hilarious
My dad got me into this and now it is the F*+KIN HIGHLIGHT!
A big hit with the pedos 👍

My beautiful daughters in their big Toyota four wheel driving. Luke combs songs
My ex sent me this I miss her man
Got my UK Manchester tickets💥💥 Cannot F ing wait
So cute 🥰
Funny you look like my cousins and their last name is combs but they are all from Kansas and Missouri.  My Grandmas last name was Combs. ❤ Love your songs.
Luke combs is awesome singer love his music
I was hooked on 90's country music, But Luke added new songs to my play list.... Awesome
❤️🙏
I'm in loooooove with this song
please guys I want to sell my 3x luke combs ticket for a reasonable amount drop a dm if you need
Ah what a good song... Since the song track starts you know it will be a good song.  If someone here is Spanish-speaking, you don't have to understand them.  With the rhythm of the song and the voice of the artist.  This is more than enough.  Because if you like Countrys you know very well that it makes you feel at home.  Very good I loved it.  Let me play it on Apple Music on Android.🙌💚🇺🇸
I am a Black woman who enjoys country music and don't mind getting out there and doing the boot scooting boogie 💜
This man is handsome 😍
This was filmed at Brentwood Skate Center? 😁
Yuss!!
Broski her names Nicole stand down she bipolar all bitchs named Nicole 😂😂😂
Trop cool 🎶❤️
Luke you good looking it just your weight
Country singers really need to start doing classic R&B covers. This dude is not white, the nigga is just pigmently challenged, LMAO. That's one of us, I don't care what you say✊🏾
When I saw this video and heard this song a few year ago I was hooked , I have been a fan ever since and am crazy about so many of his songs could listen to him for hours

That end scene was legendary
The ending cracked me up. XDDD
Love this song it sounds old school
💜
For me the 1st time I heard, "when it rains it pours" been hooked ever since.
i love a cold miller lite before 12
Jesus Christ Saves  Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time.  Jesus Christ died on a cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later, to pay for the sins of mankind, to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God.  EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God:  1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord.  2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead.  Biblical References: 1. Romans 5:9 2. Romans 3:23 3. Romans 6:23 4. Romans 10:9 5. Romans 10:13 6. Ephesians 2: 8 & 9 7. John 3:16  God bless you, peace be with you always. Thank you for your time.
😀😀
he can put tunes into any sentence, word into a great song!
I'm in love with a lovely This song's.😄 I'm Inlove.... I'm in lovin on you.Whowww ....🎶🎶🎶🎤🎧❤️❤️❤️❤️
Who ever on the piano straight snapped on dem keyss 😬
Am I the only one who thinks it's kinda funny how it keeps cutting to Luke singing about the 8 year old Nicole🤣
The kid is cute, young like combs
I love this song OMG
I love the song but am I the only one who thinks the video is so sweet 🥹
Never liked to chase but I got one now I'm chasing 🔥
In case you missed me:  You're absolutely awesome, don't blow your reputation with a f'up like Morgan Wallen...not all country boys are ahem Conservatives ;)  I love all the good stuff tho; American muscle cars/trucks (have a '69 Roadrunner myself), trudging through knee deep mud to fish all day and catch nothin then trudge on back, hate the government, and love good ol' country music.  I love your music and sound, don't get political.  Morgan left a sour ass taste in my mouth but I love Way I Talk.
You are one of the most talented singers in music, it would be so awesome to hear a song with you and Chris Stapleton.
People who hate this are so weird
Wth is tick tock? Lol we were all better off without social media #shutoffsocialmedia
Great Song 🙌
Does this guy have a bad song I don't think so
This is the best song ever
Carry s a tune...enunciates
Awww greatest love story of all time
This song is so underrated!
We sat in Kampana pub in Bornova/Izmir. We started to drink with my darling, after this masterpiece was sounded...
Luke combs you are my favorite singer I love you’re songs
💯💣🎶🎵🎙👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸😘😘😘
I've just been through 5 of Luke's songs, because YouTube keeps throwing them up at me. Every one of them is boring, dumb and unoriginal -  the kind of song you know you've heard before. Gimme a break with all this praise for this guy. He has very little talent as a singer and the lyrics are so lame I wanna shut the window down. For some reason I didn't and I've punished myself and wasted the past 30 minutes on this rubbish music.
Man I love this video so much not only is it amazing just because it's a luke combs song but also me and my boyfriend have been together for 3 years now and I always went skating all the time so I invited him and now we go skating every friday and Saturday together so it's really just fits💙💙💙
Yo Luke how did you meet your wife
Good I love it I love this song as my favorite song in the whole entire world you're just the best of a world and I'm going to see that I'm going to have the ticket to come down there to watch your next video
Coming here realizing Forever after all has pieces of all these videos
Does this music video remind anyone of 'The Miracle' by Queen?
This is my favorite one
alexis rae S ❤️❤️
Reminds me of the love I won’t have😂
Don't get me wrong I like a bobber on the water Hookin' 'em and reelin' 'em in I like a Friday night slow ride Brooks' n' Dunn, Bayside Hit rewind, spin it again I like a strong shot of whiskey The way a Marlboro hits me Some broken in cowboy boots But I'm in love and lovin' on you I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room I can't get enough of you, honey You're right on the money I'm a junkie for your midnight moves I'm in love and lovin' on you I like a sunrise, duck blind Birdie on a par five Miller Lite before noon I like a two-door old Ford Wood board back porch Three chords and the truth But I'm in love and lovin' on you I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room I can't get enough of you, honey You're right on the money I'm a junkie for your midnight moves I'm in love with lovin' on you Girl, I'm in love and lovin' on you I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room I can't get enough of you, honey You're right on the money I'm a junkie for your midnight moves I'm in love and lovin' on you I'm in love and lovin' on you
Most fun music video I’ve ever seen hands down!!!!

Just the sweetest dang video I've seen in a long time.
Here is my version of this absolute classic by Comb https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8uLiyneodg
His smile is everything 😌
Noticing the skates at the end basically showing hes all for her and wants to make her the happiest and just showing that that's how he feels about his beautiful wife nicole who he is with today 😭😊...😂 and the connection they have towards the end you can definitely tell they understand each other's humor.. amazing song overall..🤍🥲
My ex made me love this song
We had my birthday party last night at the skating rink and this was on you know I was going all out with this
At least you can go to a party 🥳

Cool song great artist love his music
i looooove iiiiiiitttttttttt
I started listening to this guy only last year and I have already fallen in love with his music. I used to only like 80’s country music but Luke keeps his just like the originals. Whenever I need to wind down I just sit on my laptop listening to his music and it just soothes me. I love that each and everyone of his songs has a great message. You are an amazing singer and an amazing man Luke and I admire you. Just keep on doing what you are doing.
Algum Brasil aqui? KKKK Luke é muito boooooom!

The greatest feeling hearing this song at Braves games!
I’m actually convinced he can’t make an sub par song. All of his songs are so good especially this one when he sings the chorus.
5k dislikes?? There some weirdos in here yall
He gave off some serious Chris Pratt vibes at the end lol
Googled my local Brentwood Skate Center's hours just to find out this music video was filmed here! adorbes 😬🛼
She says " I married this guy"

JESUS EASTER SONG * There once was a traveler driven out of town On His shoulders was a burden that pushed Him to the ground. On His head was a crown made of thorns from a bush  The street was so crowded the guards had to push.  They beat Him with nine tail each step of the way Where Christ found the strength, only God could say. They stopped at some sandstone at the top of a hill There was a round hole the cross would soon fill.  They made Him lie down upon that wood cross There they nailed Him to prove who was boss. The beam was up-ended by the muscles of men As it plunged down the hole it was carved to fit in.  Jesus looked up at the lightning that flew Cried, God, my Father, they know not what they do. They crucified our Lord as His blood flowed to Earth Inside if you believe, you feel what love’s worth.  They wrapped Him in loincloth when He was taken down Carefully removed His scarlet stained crown. They placed Him in a cave with a large, round, stone door Before sealing forever, they lay lilies on the floor.  It wasn't very long the stone rolled away Jesus resurrected, to rise Easter Day!

THE SINS OF MAN !!! Our world resembles a ruthless game Where all are eager players. There's smiles of joy and tears of woe With hate, lust, love and prayers.  Overrun by war and uncontrolled greed Our world becomes more wicked each day. Dishonest politicians, criminals and the media Survive by their falsehoods at play.  Evil deeds are Life’s test of resolve To destroy or increase our measure. All mankind has times of woe As we hunger for happiness, sex and treasure.  THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART ?

RAILROAD CREW = 2021 We're just a railroad crew Racing down the track Far from our families Who will kiss us when we're back.  We're running by the river She’s flowing muddy brown Everywhere, someone Hears our haunting sound.  As we glide across a silver bridge Above the Mighty Mo. What we'll see when we look down We never really know.  Behind us on those rolling wheels Are a hundred cars of coal If we should jump the rail Then God shall judge our soul.  When we reach the station We’ll head for the hotel Crawl in bed all by ourselves And dream until the bell.  THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART ?

I HONESTLY love the voice pitch changes from time frame 1:50 to 2:03 - where you sound deep then light then deep and then light again.. i dunno if everyone catches that.. but you should do that more often!
I love this song. I can't stop smiling laughing dance  Luke is an amazing artist
Refreshing.    Not corporate country.      Nice
ALL THAT WE ARE - ?? There's no better teacher in life Like the trials which come our way. Adversity strengthens our minds As we pray what to do and say.  Fame is what we steal or take Character is what we give. To this truth we must awake So we might begin to live.  All that we are is because of God As we share His blessings we began. To be inspired and moved by love  Helps us to stay complete and whole within.  My wife to me is God’s blessing of love Even though I was forced to live without her too long. I’m totally aware of what she does for me As from my heart flow the words of this song.  THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART ?

GOD’S ROAD TO LOVE ! Life's a book written through Where the pages are the years. There's good, evil, false and true With laughter, sweat, and tears.  Our days are songs composed by God As we set them to music with pleasure. His cup of life is for us to drink Though, He, decides the measure.  Hurried and worried, dawn till dusk There's no time for a curtain call. We burn our candles from both ends And we're lucky to be alive at all.  Cards are shuffled and hands are dealt For all to place their bets. Youthful blunders, adulthood struggles And old age with its regrets.  It matters not, how long we live But more, how well we play our part. For the road to love is always near As long as there's truth in our heart.  THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART ?

Someone please bless us with a piano version of this song.
COAL MINERS LOVE !! Coal mines in my daddy's day Were dug with strong hands and back. They got larger and deeper As the lungs of the miners turned black.  Cave-ins, fires and explosions Were my father’s daily fear. But what choice has a man When the wolf of hunger is near.  With three small kids and a wife There were five stomachs to fill. As we lived in poverty In our shack below a hill.  I feel his blood within me As the years of my life pass by I'm proud that dad dug King Cole For a miner so am I.  Life to me is but a rose Though it's thorns can make me cry. And like my dad before me To my Lord I will not lie.  In cold earth someday I’ll sleep With a shiny stone above. Carved in it, shall be the words I have known the joy of love.  THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART ! By Tom Zart Google = Most Published Poet  Tom’s 1,650 Poems Are Free To Share!

Who made the clouds and sky above? Who lights the stars and moon in the night? Who makes heaven and beyond so bright?  Who gives us babies we follow till death? Who made us able to speak with our breath? Who gives us heroes willing to die? Who made the tears we shed as we cry.  Who shows us hope and guides our way The same who loves us night and day.

SOMEONE TO LOVE ! You're great to gaze upon And ever better to touch. Though sometimes your moods Are a bit too much.  Your body is warm And your skin is fair. All that I acquire With you, I'll share.  When you come home Tired from working hard. I help with the house And manicure the yard.  You always respond No matter how you feel. To a great back rub Wine, and a good meal.  Love's uncertain outlook is Where mankind's torments dwell With both its pain and pleasure Our needs are alive and well.  I've said thank you a thousand times To Heaven and God above. That somehow, some way I have someone to love.  THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART !

3:47
😍🎶🎶❤️❤️
I love this video and Luke Combs is my favorite singer!!
How cute gonna apply to real life 😂
Live this guy. He is on freaking fire. Keep on boy.
THE ROAD TO LOVE ! Life's a book written through Where the pages are the years. There's good, evil, false and true With laughter, sweat, and tears.  Our days are songs composed by God As we set them to music with pleasure. His cup of life is for us to drink Though, He, decides the measure.  Hurried and worried, dawn till dusk There's no time for a curtain call. We burn our candles from both ends And we're lucky to be alive at all.  Cards are shuffled and hands are dealt For all to place their bets. Youthful blunders, adulthood struggles And old age with its regrets.  It matters not, how long we live But more, how well we play our part. For the road to love is always near As long as there's truth in our heart.  THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART !

I am in  love with this song and I am not  steven
SWEET JESUS SONG FOR SUNDAY ! Coming up sweet Jesus, coming up I know that you love me Or you wouldn’t have relived me Of all my wrongs of the past.  Too Many I know have forgot to pray Living however till their judgment day. Earth has it’s givers and fingers who take As too many suffer from fear and mistake.  I’m blessed I’ve felt You since I was nine Singing in church at the front of the line. Observance to word and obedience to law Let’s our Lord we heed His call.  Coming up sweet Jesus, coming up I know that you love me Or you wouldn’t have relived me Of all my wrongs of the past.  Hum = !!!!!!!!  THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART !

“I’m marrying this guy”...for his fuckin name and $$$ 🤩
He is definitely the very best country singer in a long time!!  Love all his music!!
X a
Love how the kid in the beginning is wearing a PFG button up.
A quality woman will always want a quality man.
I feel like I'm at texas roadhouse when I hear this song 😂
In the video at 2:17 there was a picture of the Mona Lisa hanging in a house which is a reference to another one of his songs “I Got Away With You”
This has a good beat
I love how this song came out after I started everything. Except love haha that died but that's another story... now I sing this to my dog izzy haha
Sad thing is that my birthday is 7 /22/99 and I just caught the beginning of the video
I am a kid but this song is just amazing
Good song
Cool as hell.
Reminds us all of simpler times, when kids could be kids. Enjoy the moment  !! Keep those great tunes coming Luke 🎶
With ALL the respect in the world to Luke Combs, the man is living proof that you don't need to be "traditionally" handsome to pull a hottie. Man probably picked her up by being charming, funny, and for singing to her. Gives a brother hope, that's all I'm saying
Where the heck can you get a whoopee cushion for ONE TICKET? Usually a piece of gum is like five. Is there some sort of hyperinflation going on in the world of arcade tickets?
I'll see u oct 19 luke I'm only 13 and I am so in love with ur music and cannot wait to see u!!!!
This song just goes to show Luke’s range. Such a different style to his other music. He has such a wide range and his songs are just right on the money every single time.
Can you add me on warzone pls and btw you are the best country singer their is and trust me I listen to country all day long so I would know
1998 Luke was so good at guitar Hero, they wouldn't release it until 2005 just so the rest of the world could catch up.
Who was that playing the part of RHONDA COMBS!!??
Loving you is a great song luke combs
I love my KC girl💕💕💕
at the end me dieing XD
He has a really good voice but not the best in the world try Shannon hoon even though he’s from a 90s band
That really is the sweetest video ever. #80skid
We don’t need another pretty boy singing pretty songs
TURNCOAT...
Great vid an great song
hasn't took a shower since the stone ages tunes smells like his farts 🤢
i think that is her wife on the music vid?? am i right??
I'm not a country music guy never was but I'd listen to this guy any day.
Showing love all the way from South Africa, such beautiful music!!!♥️♥️♥️🇿🇦
I love you Luke, fan from the Philippines
The best part of this video (even though I love all of it) is when he tried handing her a gift, he was smiling and everything, but she just walks away, so someone offered him an Icee. It's hilarious, but sad at the same time
What a great feel good song!
I'm Mexican and I love country music.
Luke combs is my favorite singer i would do anything to meet him in person ANYTHING
I don't like your music...at all. Not even a little bit. That said, thanks for not being a massive piece of shit that prick Upchurch or the walking definition of racism that is Adam Calhoun. It's nice to hear someone own up and apologize for something that clearly causes a large amount of people deep pain. So again, not a fan, but will gladly recommend you to people that somehow enjoy country music haha
Love it you have the best songs
i love this video!  reminds me of so many things way back when i was a kid--except we were at the ice rinks in upstate NY.  Even the station wagon looks so much like one we had with wood side panels.  Love your music Luke!
Love  your good country music,you have got my whole family hooked on your voice i just went out and bought 3 cds  thans luke  keep bringing out the albums and i will keep buying them well done luke im hooked  have a great life
As close to 90s country as we are gonna get. Love this song, sounds like a new Brooks & Dunn song!
another luke combs marathon, it just happens every time
Great song and video Greetings from the netherlands
I like how you put the song on your list you put so much so much effort in it I love you you're my favorite singer
Luke, I’m just a girl from the small state of Vermont. We don’t have much but maple syrup, Ben & Jerry’s, and lots of farms here.. It would make my LIFE, if I could be in one of your videos, or even try out for you!! Please reach out to me! @KatiieKoch on Instagram. Please please please! It would make my entire life. I love your music, it’s my favorite. Not one song of yours I haven’t heard or don’t love.
your wife is a stunner luke
STEALING STEALER
This is what’s wrong with country music. It’s so bad🤦🏻‍♂️

Excellent music, I'm Brazilian and I started enjoying country music because of The Ranch series and now I'm a big fan.

Luke Combs 🖕
Jorge Pardi,Morgan Wallace,Luke Combs are the only real country singers of our generation
"fake country boys doing country all wrong" 😂
Was this video filmed at Rivergate Skating rink in Tennessee?
i love your music i think it is amazing
Life was fun them
Makes you want to start the day in a good mood  and just have a great day send me some concert ticket 😆 lol
This song describes me at the skate park. I try holding onto the wall, but I still fall because I'm paying attention to everyone else. Also, if they have any ticket games, I'll only win one ticket 🤣
"One ticket, what can I get with that?" I'm dead 🤣
This is my favorite song
My fav!!!
Love it!
Just another pretty boy singing pretty songs
Wish I could meet you,you seem like the coolest guy ever.

For the haters on here saying pretty boy singing pretty songs. May I remind you that George strait Garth Brooks and hank Williams and other legends in the game sang love songs. So why can’t he about his wife?? It’s so hypocritical
Luke Combs aka the Jonas Brothers of Country.. sold out
I love this video

Keep um coming. We young so I have to hear you for many years. You in the groove. My modern day George Strait and I don't say that lightly.. Country is country is country.
IM LOVIN ON THIS SONG!!!
sticks and stones...can break your bones.....but words can never hurt you.....everybody needs to get their sticks out of their butts......no black person gets linched for saying the "N" word.....give me a break....doesnt mean your racist....its a word...get over it....it matters what the context is.....
Me to

Heard this song on the radio and thought it was great. Now that I've seen the music video, it's even better. Such a sweet video.
It's a shame hes not a real man
Luke Combs is a chump. Leave America pussy.
It was like nostalgia from the 80s I love it
This song says it all...
Love you brother praying for you
Nothing but a whipped sellout now

Another good song from Luke Combs Robert Paul Montero
never say sorry unless you hurt someone you love feelings. saying sorry about a conferderate flag.. its our american history. cant change the past but we can change the future but not by saying sorry
Sell out
Luke is fake, fraudulent, and subjective true country outlaws don't apologize for being from the south or for the flag . You pissed on all true southern people .
I get that you started making that real money but damn, love on the ones that brought you to the dance.  You had nothing to apologize for!!
oh, Luke, you are so adorable 😍
Cher Combs, vous êtes nul en musique ! Changez de job !
Sell Out!!!!!!

Beautiful ❤️💞❣️❤️💞
I used to like Luke Combs but I think he’s just a sell out. He’s a fake. Really disappointing. He played a good character while it lasted.
Sell out
Check out Upchurch - Can I Get An Outlaw, way better than this pretty boy crap.
Amazing song listen to it all day
Aww how cute "just another purty boy singing country songs." What a sell out
Bitch made
Lovin the music my hats off to ya
Ray Fulcher just played this song on our show and told us the story behind it. Such a great song!
Fuck Luke.....Creek Squad
Sellout.
This man is weak for bowing down and crying making the confederate flag look weak. Great music but you need to grow some.
Talentless sellout
Your a FICKING SELLOUT!!!
#canigetaoutlaw
This Texan who used to frequent Gilley’s on the weekends and the Longhorn in Louisianan once a month (lost a lot of friends on that I10 coming back drunk as a skunk)..can say this takes me back ..nice tune my man.
Upchurch
Upchurch
Luke combs is a sell out a fake. Look up upchurch watch the video all the country singers are fake. Doing whatever their label tells them to do. Be your own person if you can't be your own person in country music get out of country music
#RHEC
Why does Kid Rob look like Earl Dibbes Jr without overalls?
@IdxI when luke was a man

The spot on my upper right leg inner side has been affected by the IBM and contract with their devices. Look into the pigment and how it doesn't tan like the rest of my skin. And the pigment around my back. Lyndseynickoson8@gmail.com

COVIDNINETEEN VACINATIONS, THE 1ST STEP TOWARDS THE MARK OF THE BEAST IS HERE SOON. A great and formidable enemy seeks to enter into the very blood of My children through the altering of your DNA. Because of the curse that came about after the fall of the first man Adam, I came to make a way for you. You are renewed and made clean again by your belief and salvation in Me, your King and Messiah, sent by My Father to redeem you by My blood sacrifice on the Cross of Calvary. Only through Me, the Door, corruptible is made incorruptible, unredeemable made redeemable. I have ransomed you in order to bring creation back to its Creator. Creator YHWH was made flesh to overcome death, hell, and the grave, and to take what was tainted and impure and make it whole again. The spiritual battle that is raging now is ultimately to strip you of the Divine image of Myself that has been placed within the DNA of My creation. Ask Me for more wisdom and revelation about this and it will be given to you. The veil was torn, access granted when I shed My blood, died and rose again. We have created you in Our image, and when you walk in holiness, righteousness and purity, obeying My commandments, I am enthroned on your heart. You are then transformed in body, soul and spirit. When this transformation occurs, the very frequency of your cells then resonates with Me and raises you closer to your Creator and further away from the lower realm and lower frequencies which keep you bound. This is by design, and when indwelled, My Holy Spirit will be the gatekeeper of your heart, and your entire being, My sanctuary, and the place where I reside in you. When this occurs, My Kingdom is on earth, as it is in Heaven. It is then that I am able to provide victory over the curse for you, preserving the Divine design I have placed within your DNA. There are many layers of revelation to know what is coded there and hidden, secrets to be revealed to only those who overcome. However, if the gates are breached by sin, lack of obedience, compromise, or lukewarmness, the enemy sets up thrones (strongholds) instead of Me, because my laws, My Word have not been written on your hearts. You have a sworn enemy whose utter mission is to destroy you. He will stop at nothing, and as My Word has foretold, the time is here when the greatest of all violence and evil against My people, those made in My image, is taking place. The battle is for the soul, and the battle is about the blood. Satan’s ultimate goal from the beginning was to corrupt the seed, corrupt the blood that carries My blueprint in you, My design for those made in Our image, your DNA. There is only one way to ensure that My Throne is upon your heart and your eternal destination is sealed, or your soul will be lost forever. Your must be born again. Your heart must be sealed with My blood. You must be quick to repent often and seek holiness above all else. Love what is true and just. Be extremely careful what your eyes see and your ears hear. This is guarding your heart, guarding its gate. It is in sealing these portals to the soul, in commanding the spirit to govern or have mastery over the soul, that you overcome. You will then be prepared for My return, and be protected from the evil one. If you have not already done so, seal the portals to the enemy now! Confess your sins and repent for the midnight hour is here! Bind the access points that have given satan legal rights within your temples, within your body, mind, soul and spirit. Give satan and all his dark kingdom a certificate of divorce and be free from the bondage, and from all the oppression and possession in your bloodline immediately! Break the curse from your ancestors back to Adam. Cover it all with My blood and command the enemy out of your bloodline, sealing it as well, the gates to your heart, using the authority you have been given through Me. Exercise dominion as a gatekeeper and a son or daughter of the Most High God, taking your positions as heirs to My Kingdom. My Holy Spirit will then have permission to use you for My glory and manifest through you in this crucial hour. *(Please see the prayers on the right hand side bar and the one titled Increased Demonic Warfare Prayer covers everything He is instructing here)* This must be done this moment!! This is crucial! Precious moments remain before the implementation of the enemy’s plan to destroy the DNA of My creation, making you forever unredeemable. The Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and it must be taken by force! Take My Holy Word and dispossess what has had control of your gateways and that of your family line through covenants, oaths, soul trades and agreements made by your ancestors. Do it this moment! In Me you will be made FREE! The implementation of the plans to alter your DNA and make it programmable by something other than Me, your Creator, are here. I control and govern the DNA I have placed within you, but if you allow man to administer anything within your bodies, that will recode your DNA, I will no longer be the controller. I will no longer recognize you as My creation. You will have become a mixture of something else, an altered form of man and technology, and therefore, not in My image any longer. Do you understand what I am saying? Truly the hour is here when you must prepare to make the choice to remain fully human, infused with My Spirit. The enemy wants nothing more than to deceive you through propaganda, fear and manipulation and cause you to allow either a mark or an implant (vaccine or digital tattoo) into your bodies that will forever separate you from Me. This is your reality right now! You must know what you will choose to do. When you open doors to the enemy through sin and through your choices in life outside of My ways, the demonic spirits appoint gatekeepers over your heart, your mind, and your soul. Then those spirits invite more, and when no repentance occurs, strongholds occur. The heart of an unregenerate man is wicked and deceitful above all things. But My Word is quick, powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing apart of your soul and spirit, your joints and marrow, as I discern the thoughts and intentions of your heart. Allow Me to write My laws on your heart and you will know truth at last. You will know what is now directly in front of you and the choices that are here for you and your loved ones. My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge, but it does NOT have to be this way. Allow My glory to penetrate your spirit so that your soul will come under submission. To not allow this, means you will remain in bondage and you will be easily deceived. If I do not dwell in you fully, and your gates have been breached, another will easily influence you and take governance. My people, I have given you the keys to the Kingdom. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in Heaven and whatever is loosed on earth will be loosed in Heaven. Bind the strongman, bind the strongholds on your life and be delivered! The technology for the mark of the beast is here. It is upon you. It will be presented at first to be taken voluntarily, then very soon after, you will not be able to buy, sell or work. Do not wait another moment. Come out of Babylon and make Me King of your heart, the Divine Gatekeeper of your soul. The evil ones have set in motion their wicked schemes, as it must be so according to My Word. Many, many judgments will occur as I allow them. This is to wake up My church. You must know where you stand in your walk with Me, because in an instant, everything will change, and there will not be another opportunity to choose, because the choice will be made for you. You are either all in, or I am turning you over to your carnal mind and nature. You have the choice My loves, choose life and eternity in Me over eternal death in darkness.The time is now.  YAHUSHUA, JESUS THE CHRIST.  257

I heard this song one time over a month ago and that was it...👌🏼 Well for some strange reason I just woke up from hearing this song in my dream a little bit ago...😴🎶 I woke up muttering the words and humming the tune and couldn't get it off my mind, so I had to search for it on Google from the words I could remember and by putting in "new recent big guy country singer"...👍🏼 I found a picture of him and the song and was able to get her to listen to it and write this comment...💯✔  December 10th, 2020 - 9:30pm 📅🕤

Such a flashback of memories you brought back here, skating rink and crushes.  And Luke's' voice is so true, calming and satisfying, reminds me of an uncle that us kids  would mind because i think now it was his voice .  Good on ya Luke Combs
This video made me tear up..  all the feels.

Love this song the video is good
A lot of us must have fallen for different scam hackers i fell for, lost my entire savings and even got into debt because i needed a very delicate hack job done. These scam hackers took advantage of me, i curse them till their dying days. It got so so bad i had to open up to my very close male friend who always made use of private investigators back in the days to spy on his business partners and other loved ones but due to the kind of hack job i wanted done which was bank hacks of my family’s confiscated funds by the government, i couldn’t just tell anyone what i wanted to do except the hacker himself. When he saw how reluctant i was he then told me to contact a guy his private investigator used to help him get his ex wife’s location by hacking into her bank account and seeing her recent withdrawal locations, this man was Akmar Nasir, "goldenhacker794@gmail.com" Since i met him, i can boast that my life has turned around, i even have met with him on different occasions after buying him tickets that he turned down initially but now we are close and good business partners as my secrets are well kept with him. I will advice my fellow ones out there who have lost cash and other things to these fake hackers to please stop communication and go for the right thing. The advantages of "Akmar Nasir"  he might have pity and give you a discount, always provide something to make you rest assured he can do your job and also in most cases if you are close to him he would arrange for a meeting. He does any hack job you want, just name it and inquire from him, tell him you got his email from Mildred and let him know you need help. He doesn’t reply immediately as he's always very busy so be patient with him.
I dont know why all of this is being done to me and my kids , but idc I will ALWAYS keep Faith in God. He is the MOST POWERFUL and always will be MOST POWERFUL. GOD ABOVE . He is and will keep protecting & loving us forever.
Super weird video. That don’t work at all
Never would’ve guest that u like Biden😕 but I still love your music
Not that literally being filmed like across the street from my house, no joke it’s like 2 minutes away

This music video was too cute, and very tasteful. Nicely done!
Hfhchdhddhhdjjdjhxddr  Hhdjdhjdndbdbdndbxhdhehd what are you doing Aaliyah
Skspc we be clo
💜 What a cute video, he won enough tickets to get her the rollerskates! Awwww 😊 I can't get enough of this song...I gotta play it at LEAST 3 times or more, before I move onto something else! This guy's ONLY got ALL good songs! And that skit with his wife at the end of the video is funny!  😄
I love this song
Terrific song.  Didn't like the video.
Not to take anything away from Mr. Combs and his flawless execution of this song, but it took 4 really talented guys to co-write this excellent song - Combs, Ray Fulcher, James Mcnair, and Thomas Archer.  One or more of these writers have co-written with Combs on most of his hits - it's an excellent team that I hope continues to the benefit of us all (and them).  The songwriting is almost everything, and, though many, many songs get written/produced, great songwriting is increasingly hard to find, these days.  Embrace it where, when, and while you can.
Omg this is my childhood.
Awww this video is super cute!
Luke Combs is setting the music industry on fire. Setting records and breaking them. Keep rocking.
Aww
First time i listening to this man, absolutly top top top god !!!!Best regards from Sweden and Roland Andersson !!!!

I love this video and song!!!! I miss the videos in country music! This is great!
Awesome  !!!
I'm feel your music Luke 👏🏾👏🏾
such a shame she lost all that weight :-s .. did NOT suit her well
Come to the u.p of Michigan loved ur show  in grand rapids a few Years ago
The fact that I loved this song so much and his others just to find out he has a racist and problematic past and has yet to apologize is so upsetting.
Good stuff! We are a team of music producers - feel free to take a peek at our instrumentals as well. Peace
Its the car for me lmao
is this how you meet or is it  when it rains it pours?
Just as cute as the Brad Paisley Video!!!
I loved it. The ending was hilarious
His teeth are brighter than my future
I am convinced Luke has never released a bad song
Did you notice everyone in the band is 6 feet apart lol
I hope to see you in person one day.  I love your music a lot. You got us all hooked on you. 😊
Love this song
A lot of country singers can't seem to grasp the value of real instruments. Not electronic made beats.  Luke Combs has this down like a champ in his music and it shows.  Nothing beats a natural sounding band and a good voice.
He’s the best love his music
Great Song
Get sum black friends
All time favorite song by him, Luke never dissapoints
Imagine disliking this song will go down in history
Accidentally hit the dislike button dancing to this. 1.4k other people did too 😁.

I love the hell out of this video! Wish I could have been there! Plus, his wife is in it, Shes gorgeous! Blessed man.
Not sure what you're talking. I'm a bot that was performed with an error and removed from that comment! I was wondering about it when they had it on reddit for that matter and then it didn't make the same way they said they or their parents had their kids to make them happy they had their name to make them happy and we would never be in their
Is that girl name Ella harvy
Hi Luke I love your music
Like the way when the tickets fell and Luke raised his hands like in “when it rains it pours”
the beginning of the video when they where all kids remind anyone else of the beginning of grown ups ?
spider man far from home
Love this song!!❤️
Just like in the movies. HERO GETS THE GIRL!
You just see he’s genuinely happy to finally be able to make a video

“I can’t get enough of you, honey, right on the money” is my favourite part of the song
Love at first sight💰 💰

My daughter trying to learn this song 👁👄👁
Say what ever but when he said I love a good fart and they both laugh .. that micro second look they give each other you both know it's TRUE love. Love seeing the other laugh 🤩 and when you find out they met long before  fame, you know she is the real deal

Great video.  And that bit at the end - 'I love a good fart...." 😂😂😂😂  I'm sure I recognise the young Luke from somewhere though - what've I seen him in before?
Hey man this ol Carolinaboy has got your 6 my oldest son and youngest nephew Play you so much that I feel like you are part of our family Thanks man just for being a Carolina boy too
People say anything is possible, and that might be true, but it’s sure in impossible for this dude to make a bad song
I LOVE the messing around between the couple at the end lol
This song is on the radio
This was super wholesome 😪
Love it
I love 5his song so much
i know the young “nicole” and one of the little girls in real life
Haha that kid in the video is on my friends baseball team I was at my game and we had games and the same time and I went to talk to me friend and the kid showed us it kinda cool
Ha! Cool - Brentwood Skate Center!
❤🧡💛💚💙💜
I love your video: was so cute
Nothing like a good fart!!
Best singer ever man, I hope all of your hopes and dreams come true. You are what I hope to grow up to be. Just keep doing what you do best, making music.
This video is awesome!!
I ❤u
Thank you Luke.
I bet that's how he really was!
Great video this song fits me and my wife perfectly
Luke is changing the game for country music he will forever be a legend just like George Strait. His music is addictive!!! And he seems to always come through with songs and videos when we all need it the most 😊 Nicole is gorgeous and they are so lucky to have each other!!!
I'm in love with lovin on you Critty Poon🤗💞💞👩‍❤️‍👨💞💞YOU ARE THE BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME SEXY WOMAN💙👫💙😊🤗💞💞💞💞
Cool video and I Love the singing
Well last time I went roller blading I broke my elbow
Best country artist on the radio to date!
i find his music awesome
You are amazing Luke Combs, thank you for the music!!!!! I’m a huge fan!
Did anyone else think the lyrics were "I'm in love with lovin on you"? Because I thought that was way more clever than 'and' lovin on you
Love this song. The video puts a smile on my face remembering times at the roller rink. The little Luke is spot in. Keep it up Luke!
goonzquad
I am not into country music but this man Mr. Luke Combs is a Grammy award-winner. God bless you All
I’ve never been a country fan but I haven’t heard a single bad song from Luke Combs
So cool he filmed this in my hometown skate center! Grew up at that place!
I JUST ADORE THE ENDING!! <3
Amazing music video, it really keeps me dancing all day and all night. :)
I love you luke!! This song truly raises me up when I need it and wow your vocals, love ya man!!
Feel the tune and voice are more 90s country thank goodness can't take no more of that hip-hop country nonsense go luke combs
Too cute!
Is Luke wearing eye make-up? 1:16
I remember one year I had a birthday party at the skating rink. I believe it was 1998 too.
is it just me or is there a Nicole, Rachel, or a Kelly we were all in love with at this age??
That was awesome
Haha great video, great song as well. Luke keep them coming.
trump
They didn't have guitar hero in '98. Come on with the details! Lmao.
Damn I didn't know timthetatman can sing that good...
I sing this out loud to my boyfriend Everytime it comes on the radio! 😂 💜
One fact about Luke combs if u want more facts about him watch more of his song and subscribe and like his whole YouTube channel now we get back to the facts this is the first time he laughed smiled in one of his song vids same thin
You know , I looked to see if there is a song I didn't like. I couldn't find one. I will be going to his concert. He is my favorite!!! As soon as I hear his music at work, I blast it. Me and my supervisor just sing every song WORD FOR WORD ❤️❤️❤️
man its like watching a short movie
!
I make it a point in my profession to not underestimate where a good idea comes from. In this day and age everyone is looking for something. I could care less. I just want to see the song. I think Luke is the guy to do it and I would appreciate it. I renounce any rights to the idea that I may have had for the corporate lawyers.
I could write the lyrics myself but I think Luke can write one better about watching a soldier's coffin get pinned. I don't think I've ever heard that. Not in the way it's personal to me. Maybe a bummer to most but not me.
mind on my murda
Great work as usual
Love the song luke, keep up the amazing work!!!
Bruh I didn’t know he went to this skate center I live like 2 min from 😂😂😭
He filmed this at my local skate center💫
Brentwood skating ring. Used go there every weekend. When I was little...
Love his music North Carolina boy saw him in Atlanta best show
I’m in love 😍❤️💋👌😘🤓😍
Is she the one from “when it rains in pour’s” the hooters girls
This is the most talented guy ever
loooove this song :D
Why would they just assume that baby Luke Combs was chubby? 😂😂. Great song btw
Am really grateful and thankful for what Dr sebi has done for me with his herbal medicine, I suffered herpes for so long without a solution, it took everything from me, i went to different doctors who told me it has not permanent cure until this faithful day I went online, I saw a couple of testimonies about this great man named DR sebi so I decided to give it a try  and he assured me i will be well. he send me a couple of his herbal product and instructed me on how to use it. and after a few weeks i went for another test and it was negative and that was how i got cured from herpes. If you need his help, email him ( dr.sebi324@gmail.com) WhatsApp +(2349044159370) and get your healing..
Am I the only one crying at an upbeat song. Don't take this wrong but Nicole better watch out cause I would marry this man. Lol Well at least buy him a few rounds
Tee amoo🥰😍🥰💙🤠
We play you in every single bar and the radio loves you down in Florida!! Come play for us!!!!
Please come to Florida
I absolutely love this song. You have done an amazing job with your songs!
I'm a huge justin Moore fan but  Luke combs is a closet second  literally every  song he comes out with is an instant hit and this  song is no different I absolutely love this song I don't  think he's capable of making a bad song  or video
I wish Luke was the old Luke not a sell out. He produced & wrote his own music before now Nashville controls everything for him he sings what they write and what they want. I miss the upchurch & Luke comb days
Shot in Brentwood,TN😎
It’s a damn shame he’ll be dead in just 5-10 years of a heart attack
I dont think he is capable of making a bad song! My absolute favorite in music right now.
I absolutely loved this vid! Love Luke Combs and his music! The end got me cracking up! His wife is beautiful.
LMFAO that laugh 🤣🥰
What is this song about it’s so cool
crush
Just like I say about mine bro, she brings your group average up! Lucky guy.  Keep bringin it

Even though I'm 10 when I'm in the tractor I always have to put you two music discs in and I'm singing loud and proud 🙃thank you for great music happy fall🍁
imagine disliking a Luke Combs song
I swear Luke Combs cannot make a bad song , every one is a classic. Loving this one , from a UK fan :)

When ur buddies always got ur back
The "One" Upchurch couldnt diss....... Or at least tried an missed LMFAO
Top tune
Omg I don't usually listen to country but this is an exception! Love it. I hope to also get an acoustic version  soon!
Luke Combs OKKK I SEE YOU 👀! KEEP KILLING IT! KEEP UP YOUR AMAZING WORK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why does 1:35 remind me when I first started skating? 😂
Luke you agreed to this video! Straight from the horses mouth we need an outlaw. Fruit cake!
It’s sad you gotta buy a woman some materialistic things to get her to like you
radioactive
lmao upchurch laid you out
How do those skate still fit her though it been like 20-30 years
when your fav singer is from your hometown and you can hear his nc accent!!!!
chris brown no guidance

I love the detail of Lukes videos... So many easter eggs that are so obvious if you've been a Luke fan for a long time
I worked at a roller rink while in high school; BEST JOB EVER! Love the video!!

This guy really has one of the best voice in country. He might be the next king of country someday.
Excellent. Excellent! Great song. great story. great production.

LOVE this song and the video for it!   So cool doing younger versions of y'all and using your beautiful wife in the video.  I've loved your voice since I first heard it before you were big.  I know then you would go somewhere and glad you have!  Keep on rockin' out the great music!

I love how in the very beginning of this video and young Luke is pulled up in the car with his Mom and the DJ said "wait a minute, who's this guy, who is this GUY?" The inflection in his voice sounds like he's saying who the HELL is this GUY?  LOL 😂😅

Who's the little girl? She's gorgeous
Hey guys... Black peoples like country music too 😐
You are by far one of the best true country musicians I have ever seen. Keep making country music great again.
That was smooth not even gunna lie
So we just gonna ignore the fact the year is 1998 and somehow you’re playing Guitar Hero and not to mention winning tickets from it.

Just bless you.
Alguna vez se han preguntado por que tenemos cortes de justicias,jueces,policias,milicia etc..? Esto es porque nos importa la justicia porque somos creados a la semejancia de un Dios justo.  Nosotros hemos pecado en su contra y roto sus leyes que tenemos en nuestras conciencias; cuando mentimos, adulteramos, robamos, somos orgullos, tenemos sexo antes del matrimonio, pornografia y muchas cosas mas, lo cual un Dios justo condenaria al igual que condenaria asesinato y violacion.  Dios es justo de condenarnos a todos pero en su amor y misericordia nos ofrece otro camino, el envio a su unico Hijo Jesus para que muriera en nuestro lugar por nuestras faltas y despues resucitara para justificarnos para todo aquel que se arrepienta de sus malos caminos y ponga su fe en Jesus sea salvo; Como un hombre que se tira de un avion y no confia en sus brazos para salvarse sino que confia en el paracaidas, asi nosotros debemos confiar en Jesus y no en nuestras buenas obras para ser salvo", porque delante de Dios nadie se va a poder justificar por su cuenta solo atravez de Jesus, por esto Jesus es el unico camino hacia Dios!!

This man saved country music when he stepped in
Song like this are keeping me in a good mood. My only vehicle's motor finally blew up not long ago and no means of transportation is truly depressing. Which reminds me, anyone who would be kind and generous enough to donate even a penny to my new vehicle fund, here's my CashApp and Venmo. $mattross47 and @Matthew-Moser-47
My dad passed this year and we played Luke at his funeral best decision made for a very sad hard time.
Tall really couldn’t get any more perfect 😍
This music video put me in such a good mood way to go Luke!!
Jesus can change your life bro <3
Coming from a Mexican American does this man ever make a bad song. His music is amazing.

LOVE IT💯
Love the appalachian state hat luke! Go apps!!
Absolutely stunning video ❤️❤️❤️
Jesus is coming on a day we least expect so pls repent. Beware of false prophets who will say they are Jesus. Get rid of whatever causes ur downfall, spend time with God daily, and read the Word We kindle God's righteous wrath when we sin. Jesus is the sole mediator. We're saved by His mercy not by our works. God does not want us to perish in hell. Im saying this bc i luv u all. God bless ❤️

Greetings from Egypt, Luke. TBH I've never heard of you before. Just got recommended to watch this video, and it's freaking awesome, man. Reminds me of the good old days' songs. Keep it up!
The intro reminds me of a Lynyrd Skynyrd song. Can’t put my finger on which one, but it’s real similar to a Skynyrd song intro.
Goddamn, this stuff never changes.  Same old derivative sound.  But they can’t tell the difference in the south.

#1 rule in my house and car:  If a Luke Combs song comes on, it's going up Full Blast and the mojo shall rule the room.  It's just that simple.

We will definitely be listening to this and your other songs for years to come! Zac Brown and Kenny C are going to have some good company on my playlist! *insert a tip of the hat to you and the band*
One day I’ll be in one of your concerts and I’ll definitely earn and a handshake.

Awesome video! LOL

Nice to see a few real country artists are still around.

So cute love it!
1. Thou shalt have no other gods before me 2. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image. 3. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain. 4. Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy (Saturday) 5. Honor thy Father and thy Mother  6. Thou shalt not kill 7. Thou shalt not commit adultery  8. Thou shalt not steal 9. Thou shalt not bear false witness  10. Thou shalt not covet  Are you guilty of breaking any of GOD'S TEN COMMANDMENTS above? These are GOD'S standards by which all of mankind is held by. If you are guilty of breaking even one, your debt owed is to perish in the lake of fire for all eternity. This is why we all need Jesus Christ! A sinless man, GOD'S only begotten Son. Who took all of our debt/sin onto the cross with him, and killed our debt/sin and himself on the cross. Then buried our debt/sin as he was buried. Then Jesus was raised from the dead by the Father three days later, defeating death and sin on the cross for us. And those who repent of being a sinner and receive Jesus as Savior, and choose to follow Him as Lord over their life, have their debt paid in full by Him.  You will be saved and receive GOD'S grace, mercy and forgiveness for your sins. And you will not perish in the lake of fire, but have everlasting life through Jesus Christ and the blood He shed for us on the cross!!!  WOULD YOU LIKE A RELATIONSHIP WITH JESUS CHRIST? WOULD YOU LIKE TO GIVE YOUR LIFE TO HIM TODAY? He loves you and is calling you to him. This is a relationship of free will and not a religion of man.  Adam, the first of mankind to be created by GOD, brought sin into the world because of his disobedience toward GOD. So by Adam, all of mankind was born into sin through a generational curse (Genesis 2&3/Romans 5:12). According to GOD and his Word, the wages of sin is death. Perishing in the lake of fire for eternity. Eternal torment where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth (Romans 6:23/Revelation 20:14/Matthew 13:49-50).  So while we were yet sinners, GOD commanded his love toward us and sent his only begotten Son Jesus, who is a sinless man (2 Corinthians 5:21), to die for all the sins of mankind and to free us from the curse, by becoming the curse for us (Romans 5:8/John 3:16-18/Galatians 3:13). And to set us free from perishing for our sins through the forgiveness of GOD, and through the shedding of Jesus's blood on the cross (Ephesians 1:7-12). This is GOD the Father's gift to the world through his grace, to those who are called to his Son (John 6:44), and receive his Son Jesus Christ through Faith (Ephesians 2:8-10). Because Jesus is the only way to the Father and eternal life in Heaven (John 14:6).  By confessing with your mouth that you are a sinner, in need of Jesus as The Lord and Savior over your life. By confessing with your mouth that "Jesus is the Lord" And believing in your heart that GOD the Father raised his Son Jesus from the grave three days later. Defeating death and sin on the cross, and becoming the one and only true living God having victory over all (Romans 10:9-10). Then asking GOD to come into your life in a relationship with you. And to fill you with his Holy Spirit. Then you will be saved and recieve eternal life in Heaven through Jesus Christ, adopted as GOD's child (Romans 8:14-16). And through your new relationship with Jesus, you accept him as Lord over your life and follow him and his Word (The Bible) (John 14:15-21/Matthew 12:50). As the scriptures say, no man or woman can say that "JESUS IS THE LORD" but by the Holy Ghost (1 Corinthians 12:3).  ACTS 16:30-31 KJV 30. And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? 31. And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.
I NEVER EVER EVER GET TIRED OF HEARING YOUR VOICE! You are the Salt of the Earth.
Who the hell is Heck Finch?  Fool around and find out: https://www.youtube.com/heckfinch
I can’t wait for “forever after all” to be released🥺

Luke's laugh at the end, I just love them together!!💙💚🧡💛
Finally they got one with Nicole!
Loved the song, as always, and the video really took me back to my days rollerskating in early70's & my kids in mid 90's. Even bought that fishing game for my kids bday. Please always keep your amazing sense of humor. It shines through & brings light to a dark World. Congrats on hot wifey btw. 🙌🎵🎶🎸❤❤❤❤
Honestly the best music video I’ve seen since the 90s
This reminds me so much of my teenage years and Friday nights at the skating rink. Miss the innocence and fun of those days!
👍 👍 Brasil 🇧🇷
My Hero. #ChickenCoop#IceSkating.
Love you Luke Combs...
This song always puts me in a good mood!!
Coming from a Hispanic household there was never any country music on weekend mornings, as I grew older (I’m 26 now) I found myself in the holy grail of country music from so so so many huge artist and I’ve never looked back since. I know there’s a lot of people from my generation who absolutely hate country but for me, this genre has a special place in my heart, it feels like coming home! So every weekend when I wake up early to get my house cleaned, dishes and laundry done, if I’m not blasting some good old Latin flavor music you bet your damn ass I’m blasting some good old country songs, this beautiful voice of a man included. Idk why but country music just lights up my mood, even the sad songs lol 😅👌
Great song !!!
I think we got a winner 😜😊
Super liked the "Mona Llisa" hanging on your wall reference 👌 🔥🔥

My favorite song of yours is beautiful crazy...I literally cried when I heard it live. After that concert I lost my voice from singing and screaming every word to every song lol...I love you guys so much...I even have a sweatshirt! Congrats too by the way, you found a beautiful girl!

PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO READ THIS. IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU COULD EVER DO AND IT ONLY TAKES A FEW MINUTES ARE YOU 100% SURE THAT IF YOU DIED TODAY THAT YOU WOULD GO TO HEAVEN? (CLICK 'READ MORE')  There are some things that you should know:  1. Realize that you are a sinner and in need of a Savior:  Ro 3:23 "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"  Ro 3:10 "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"  It all began when the first humans, Adam and Eve were created and God put them in the garden of Eden. God created them perfect to live in fellowship with Him. There was no death or sorrow. God told them not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They disobeyed God and as a result, sin entered into the world. The pain, which this world sees, is the result of sin.  2. Because of our sins, we die both spiritually and physically, but God sent His Son to die so that you can have a chance not to have to go to hell by accepting what He did on the cross:  Ro 6:23 "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."  Ro 5:8 "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."  Every person who has ever lived is a sinner and is not righteous because we do bad things. A sin is a crime against God, just as if you steal something at the store, it is punishable by going to jail. It's the same thing with sin. Lying, stealing, sex before marriage, pride, hatred, ect. are all sins. Hell is a prison for those who commit crimes against God. That’s because you must be perfect in order to get to heaven. No matter how well you live your life from then on, you have already sinned, which will be punished if you are not pardoned. If you commit a crime, and then live as a good citizen you still will go to jail for the crime you committed. Right? Just as the President can pardon a crime so you won't go to jail, Jesus can pardon your sins so that you do not go to hell, and can go to heaven when you die. You won’t have to pay for your own sins because Jesus already did that for you. But if you reject the pardon that He offers, you will have to pay for your own sins by going to hell.  3. If you will confess Jesus Christ as Your Lord, place your Faith in Him and Believe in your heart that He died, shed His blood and rose again as a sacrifice for your sins, you will be saved (from hell).  Heb 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.   Heb 9:22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.  You cannot get to heaven by being a good person, going to church, baptism or any other way other than by turning to Jesus, believing in your heart that He died on the cross and rose from the dead for your sins and placing your Faith in Him. While these are good things to do, some people believe that they will get to heaven, but your Faith must be in Christ and His sacrifice alone and nothing else, giving your life to Him.   Eph 2:8,9 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.  Ro 10:9,10;13 "that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved..For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."  4.  You must submit your life to Jesus Christ and His will in Faith, believing in your heart that He died and rose again shedding His blood to pay for your sins as a sacrifice to God.  If you want to accept Jesus free gift of salvation, or if you have any doubts about whether or not you are going to heaven, HUMBLY PRAY THIS PRAYER TO GOD FROM YOUR HEART IN FAITH:  ”Dear Lord Jesus I know that I have sinned against you and need you to save me.  I believe that You are the Lord and believe in my heart that You died on the Cross and Rose from the dead, shedding your blood as a Sacrifice for my sins.  I turn to You as the only way of salvation, I submit my life to you, placing my Faith and Trust in You as Lord of my life, Please save me and I thank You for it, in Jesus holy name, Amen.”  If you have placed your faith in Jesus Christ and meant it with all of your heart, you are now a child of God and will go to heaven. Now that you are on your way to heaven, you should attend a bible believing church and follow in baptism.

I absolutely cant stand country music, but there’s something about this dude’s voice that’s incredible.
Such a feel good wholesome song and video 👍🏼👏🏼

Trash!
You’ve outdone yourself again Luke

Love your music bro
Heard this song today at the dentist.
Amazing as always!
How many country cliches can one man fit into a song
Literally 99.9% won’t see this but, God bless you and stay safe during these hard times read my name btw🦋! (help me reach my goals plz)

Love the hat. I was just in boone, NC last weekend. Love this song!!!
Great concept for the video.  My kids watched it and didn't realize that going to the skating rink was a thing.  There aren't many left.  But that was the thing back in the day.  And damn you would have needed that many tickets from skeeball or whatever to score that prize at the counter for sure!!!!!
THIS IS MY HOME TOWN SKATING RINK!!!!! How crazy!!!!!
Ahhh I LOVE it!!
This is such a cute video for such a beautiful song. I love Luke’s music.
🔥🔥🔥
Love this dude👍👏🤘
Nhạc nghe hay vá bạn ơi thanks bạn đã chia sẻ🔔
Thus says The Lord God: The trumpet I am blowing is revealed to the wise and enters into the heart of the humble, causing the penitent to shudder and the rebellious to burn with contempt. It is a trumpet of old, yet remains the trumpet of this time also. For My servant is soon entering his seventh year, and My Word and this Trumpet soon after. Lo, it is the seventh, and shall be blown for seven without ceasing, even as this seven sounds continuously before the time.  Behold, is it not also that which I have revealed which remains holy in My eyes, the fulfillment which has been long, followed by three which shall come in rapid succession, the fulfillment thereof short yet everlasting, even as the seventh with an eighth yet to come?  Therefore, thus says The Lord: I have trumpeted the call to awake, yet who has heard My call? Who has given heed and walked according to the will of The Lord? Wicked and slothful generation, DEAF CHILDREN, you have forsaken Me! For you have filled this world with every kind of evil; behold, you have reached new heights in wickedness! Thus I must blot out the kingdoms of men! I must wipe them away and cast them from My sight forever!... Never again shall they arise! Never again shall the nations do evil in My sight! Never again shall they walk proudly, shaking their fists toward Heaven in their self-proclaimed glory! Never again shall they revel in all these perversions and practice all these abominations, seeking always to satisfy their ever-increasing lusts as they pursue evil gain! FOR I AM THE LORD, AND I HAVE SEEN IT!   Therefore I shall speak, and this Trumpet  Shall sound continually until the time; And when it is finished, another shall sound...  And oh what a cry shall be heard,  Oh what bitter weeping shall fill the streets; And like the sound of a plague of locusts  Devouring every green thing, so shall the  Sound of gnashing teeth devour the air;  Behold, it shall break out in every  Corner with a great noise!...  Yet I shall continue to speak, and in My hot  Displeasure I shall pronounce judgment upon them!...  And whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear,  The voice of YAHUWAH shall be heard!   For I tell you the truth, this Trumpet before you is but the beginning, a whisper from The Almighty, a still small voice spoken in the ear. For the day is coming quickly when I shall speak My name aloud! Behold, I shall open My mouth and into the air I shall speak, and the heavens shall tremble and the earth shall shake violently! For none in the earth know Me, not one sees Me as I truly am. Yet all shall know Me! For by My judgments they shall know, and in My Mercy they shall see, says The Holy One, The God of Israel, The God of power and fierce jealousy, The God who has come forth from His sanctuary to punish, The God of Judgment! Behold, The Mighty One of Jacob has spoken in His authority, yet few have given heed, few have bowed down to give Me glory, few have cupped the ear. Therefore I shall speak louder, and the sound of My voice shall increase throughout the earth, and the days shall be turned into darkness before the Great and Terrible Day of The Lord! For in My anger, I shall turn My face against this awful generation, and in the fierceness of My wrath, I shall bring down My hand hard upon all peoples of the earth! And all these tall mountains shall crumble under the weight of My presence, and all these lofty hills shall be bowed down... Behold, the giants shall fall! Says The Lord. They shall be crushed beneath the weight of their fallen riches! Says The Almighty.  Therefore look among the nations, O foolish people, and watch, O most wicked generation, and be utterly astounded, be horribly afraid! For The God of Recompense is risen up, The God of Glory is come out! Behold, I am risen up in My vengeance, I am come out to repay! For I have looked and I have seen; yes, I have beheld your hearts, and I have looked upon all your doings, and I HAVE SEEN IT! For nothing is hidden from My eyes, neither are My ears dull of hearing!  Therefore be dismayed, O unfeeling generation, be dismayed, all you who have shown no mercy toward your neighbor, and tremble in fear at the indignation of The Lord! For behold, I shall kindle a fire in your courts that can not be quenched, and it shall rage, until every abomination is consumed and every wicked way perishes from before My face!... Let their faces be blackened with soot! Let the multitudes fall in their weariness! Says The Lord. For who can endure the Day of The Lord?! Who is able to escape the wrath of God when it comes?! Who has the stamina to flee continually, without respite?! Yet those who wait upon The Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint, as it is written.  https://www.thevolumesoftruth.com/The_Last_Trumpet_before_The_Time
I absolutely love this video and song💗💗💗 So awesome to see a fun and creative video😍😍😍
Adorable!
There's at least 6 or 7 guys that look like that in my town and their names are Justin, Michael, Robert, Devin, Kevin, Tom, and Mark so good for this Luke guy for getting out there and making music cause I would not have been able to tell him apart from Michael.
TimTheTatMan really fell off, huh?
God it would mean the world to me, I love his music and really can’t wait till I can go to one of his concerts.
Amazing!
My daughter introduced me to your music, I’m so glad she did!
The tickets coming out had me dying! Best video yet. Good job 😍🎶
Love this...made me cry
I love it its so cute
Luke is Gods greatest gift to earth
I dont like this song dude. You can do better. Regrads from Norway.
Nothing like the skating rink. My fondest teenage memories revolved, literally around a rink. Cheers! 🎟🎸
This is pretty much how my girlfriend Nicole and I spent our free time at Happy Wheels in Portland Maine. The new location in Westbrook is opening early 2021 Luke, if you wanted to go for a good skate, Happy Wheels is the place to be!
Personally I perceive country music as white folk R&B.......😈💪🏽💪🏽
I swear this is the best music video Luke has ever put out
Great sing great joke yep luke knows what to do
I don't like country music 🎶 at all but...I LIKE THIS👍🏿💕
Trump 2020  Law and Order  4 more years!!!!     ALM
Can’t wait to see Luke in concert again! One of the best shows I’ve ever been too!
Turned out awesome love the ending
Jesus Christ loves you.
Good Afternoon Mr. Combs, I’m commenting to let you know that I believe you should make a movie about your life. Just imagine how awesome it would be to add an Oscar to your extensive collection of awards and accomplishments!!
Aww this is cute
I love your music, and hope that you’re going to do a world tour at some point in the future!
#GeorgiaPeach
Música para os meus ouvidos 😍😍
This has got to be one of the cutest country music videos ever. 💕
Super thankful for Nicole. The muse of all this amazing music 😭❤️
Go back to about 1976-77 and then I can relate, young man....Like, play some Funky Town, The Locomotion, Y.M.C.A., Shooting Star, ABC, Disco Duck, Boogie Oogie Oogie, Stayin Alive, September, Double Dutch Bus, Freak A Zoid, Jam On It, No Parkin On The Dance Floor,  You Dropped A Bomb On Me, Disco Duck, Celebration, Another One Bites The Dust, Bounce/Rock/Skate/Roll aaaaannnnd a whole lot of others from back in the day 👀😶🙃😁

Who’s here before 1mill🤘🏽
This song just changed my hole mind set on my path to life
Blessed be the name of the Lord! This day I testify of the glorious gift of the Holy Ghost which I received April 21st, 2019! Eleven days after I was baptized in Jesus name for the remission of sins I received the Holy Ghost and was endued with power from on high! After I was baptized I went through so many spiritual attacks by the devil and his agents that it caused me to doubt God’s love to the point that I was ready to give up on the faith. I had quit my job, went through many family problems, struggled with sin and loss of faith, along with relentless attacks in my sleep by the devil. But God, even while I was without strength and having so little faith and being so deep in the pit of darkness, gave me the strength to rise up early in the morning of April 21st, 2019 and go to the Apostolic Church where I was baptized in Jesus name eleven days prior. Having so little faith and doubting that I’ll ever be redeemed from all that was in my life at the time I sat down groggily in my seat at the church. As I finally rose from my seat, I began to look around the room and saw people who I now have reason to believe may have been angels, glancing at me from time to time throughout the service and darting their heads back forward when I would notice them. Near the end of the service, they called for anyone who wanted to go up to the altar to worship. Me, having doubted that I had any praise left to give because I failed God so many times, didn’t go up. But God then spoke to me in an audible voice in my mind telling me to go up to the altar. Me, not discerning whether it was God’s voice or my own voice, didn’t listen the first time. Then he spoke again and said, “Go up to the altar.” Then I said in my mind, “What’s the point? I’m completely empty of praise and void of faith. I’d only look like a fool up there.” Then God spoke to me a third and final time saying, “If you don’t go up to the altar, you may never know what I have in store for you.” After God spoke those words, I immediately forced my legs to move up to the altar and I was making my way there purely by faith. As soon as I got to the altar, being the only one at the center of it I began to lift up my arms to praise the Lord, thanking him and praising his name. Then people began to lay hands upon me and I felt faith building up from within me and I began to praise more and more with confidence in my speech. Then, I suddenly collapsed to my knees, and when I realized it, I was filled with this immense power in my body. It was coursing through my veins from head to toe and it was so immense and so abrupt that the only thing I could think or say was, “What’s going on? What’s happening to me?” Someone then whispered in my ear, “It’s the Holy Ghost.” Having that realization I lifted up my hands back to the heavens to praise the Lord and I began to praise him, in a language I had never learned before. It was like rivers of living water flowing from out of my belly. Like the water coursing through in a river. Eleven days prior to that day I was born of water and that day I was born of the Spirit. This promise is unto you even as it is written,  “Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do? Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.” ‭‭Acts‬ ‭2:37-39‬ KJV  If you wish to see my testimony after I received the gift of the Holy Ghost, watch this video starting at 2:07:25.  https://youtu.be/hrlI1iIUHiU  To see my baptism in Jesus name for the remission of my sins see this video at 15:00.  https://youtu.be/dVQjyz0jV8A  By the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony, the saints, who have obeyed the gospel of Jesus Christ, overcame the dragon, that old serpent who is called the devil and Satan. Obey the gospel of Jesus Christ and abide in the ark of safety. Through baptism in Jesus name men are baptized into Christ and by the baptism of the Holy Ghost men receive Christ in them, the hope of glory. Today is the day of salvation! As the lockdowns continue as restrictions in this current world are being applied, time is running out to obey the gospel! Get into the ark even as Noah and his family did when, by water, eight souls were saved when the rest of the world perished. The wages of sin is death but God has given men the opportunity to obtain everlasting life by Jesus Christ. A sinner’s prayer cannot save you. Accepting Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior won’t do anything for you. I know that’s what you may have heard your whole life but it’s simply not true. Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God (John 3:5). I say unto you all, save yourselves from this untoward generation and get in the ark of safety, that is Jesus Christ.
Love this so much! 💙
You know that kid spent $100 to get enough tickets to get her a $20 pair of skates.
LOVE this video!   so fun and carefree!
You guys are to cute
I love the small features like the Mona Lisa hanging on the wall from “I Got Away With You” and “Neon Dream” on the guitar game for “Beer Never Broke My Heart”.
7/22/98 i turned 10... bdays at the roller rink were a real stressful day
Dude looks like he's about to drop the hottest oil change of the year
Hey random person scrolling down the comments .. ..     Have a wonderful day :)
This is so cute! The end really got me. It reminded me so much of my boyfriend and I 😂😂
A future millionaire will like this
Only people who didn’t come from tiktok are worthy of liking this
Always love me some Luke Combs wether im in Texas, Alaska or California.
I COULD NOT STOP SMILING! Luke combs you did it again! Setting the bar higher and higher AHH ❤️
Loved the 90s theme!!
😍😍😍😍😍
Haha I love the beginning!! ❣️
In a world of Luke Bryan thank god we have him
This video was so heart warming and the vibe is so cool! I love it! Awesome idea too!
Watched this whole video just hoping to see Luke "Shoot the Duck" !
The moral of the story: A good fart joke can get you somewhere.
I dont owe anybody anything now because of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
この曲めっちゃテンション上がる！
How do people even dislike his songs?
Great song
Great vid👍🏽
Love this Song,    Hope you play it in Boston next year.    Will be my third time seeing you live! look forward too it!  Section 11! :)
Love that you somehow incorporated my childhood in the skating rink with my kid's childhood playing guitar hero.
okay, that was a super cute video and definitely one of my favorite Luke songs. Great job!!
I LOVE THIS VIDEO!! my favorite part is at the end where Nicole says, “And I married this guy!” 😂 such a great video with an amazing story ❤️
This video is absolutely adorable!!
Awesome song and video!!
Your great sir. Great song.
I love this so much
🥰 this is the kind of music that makes my heart and soul happy ❤  they just don't make a lot of music like this anymore and I thank you for being one of the few artists that do 💯
I been stuck to this song since day 1. Crazy how they been together since they was kids.
THE END
Clone Hero, Pog
Didn't know why I'm crying watching this 😅😂
I love your music Luke, wore out both of em and had to buy them again, my hubby and I play them whenever we get a night together usually sitting by our bonfires!
“i married this guy” 🥺😂
music video was awesome
What a way to make a week.
Great video! Great song! 😃😃
I love you
I do love a good fart
👌
The most adorable video everrrrrr...... made me tear up and then ball my eyes out!!!
Hands down, this guy is going to be a country legend some day. Every one of his songs his solid country gold.
Poster of this song would bring back memories of my childhood of going to the skating rink from 5 years old up to now at 18🙏. Songs i can relate to in music videos really do help ! Thanks Luke 🤟
Does this man even make a bad song ?
cloen hero
Awesome video, awesome song! Love seeing your wife in the end! Y'all are a beautiful couple, congratulations!
I love the concept of this music video so much!!
nappiest sarcous
The ending of thought, which is the cutting at the root of the self, when there is such non-identifying attention, then does the self exist? The act of listening implies listening to the senses you can’t stop the senses but the moment I say I must have more of that begins identification.
The end is the best part love to see you guys (better together)
If I say ' please ' will that get me a music video poster???? You know, good manners really do go a long way!  Love this song, and LOVE the video! I got a warm feeling in my heart and goosebumps when she opened that card! So sweet, cause I felt it!  CONGRATULATIONS to you and your gorgeous wife! Hope you have a long and beautiful life together! xoxo
Love this!!!!
Man!!! Luke Combs fan since-day-one. I'm from the Philippines btw. This video hit me like a Hurricane!!! Well, I'm not from Houston, but we got a problem! Cheers Luke!
Love this!! Love your music! Can’t wait for the day I can finally see you live in concert!
Now we know there's 58 stupid people out there
I'm Loving On this video!!!
"I do love a good fart"   I  laughed way too hard at that.
Just cranking out the toons during these days or quarantine
Simp
You're my favorite country musician, id love a poster!
Aww. I love that his wife is in the music video. So sweet.
That moment when he picked up the guitar to get tickets for her... it gave me goosebumps. Especially knowing he never picked up a guitar before turning 21. Such talent and emotions in this! You can see the pure love amongst everyone he surrounds himself with. Every song of yours gives me the feels! Can't wait to see you in concert one day!
I’m in love and lovin’ on you 🎶  ♥️
Hey that’s Clone Hero in that video 🤪

This is so cute loved it!
so cute!!!
The song is great, and the video takes it to a whole new level. Haha. Nice work!
"I do love a good fart!" omg!! too funny!!
I don't know if you'll read this, Luke. But I'm your biggest fan despite that I'm from the Philippines and there are no country concerts here. I've been a fan of you since 2016 when you released your first song Hurricane. I know, I'm a thorn among the roses, 'cause I'm one of those country fans that are so far from America. Then it hyped me up to listen to This One's For You and What You See Is What You Get, and it made my high school days 'cause I always play your songs in vans when we're getting out of town. I'm currently saving money so I could go to your tour. By the way I'm just 18 and I'm in college now and I'm getting more and more die hard. I'm also songwriting whenever I have free time. So the music video poster would mean the world to me.
This video is adorable! I love this song and this video just made it that much more enjoyable. I'm hoping to be able to see you when you come to Iowa summer 2021 since your show was cancelled this year! You are by far my favorite artist the past few years and I can't wait to watch your career grow. I can't name a song of yours that I don't like.
Congratulations on your NINTH NUMBER ONE HIT-and the best decision you ever made: your recent nuptials. Wishing you continued success. #bootleggers
This was pretty cool
10000/10 video!!!
Pretty sure Columbia PFG shirts didn't exist in 1998 :)
Good times at roller skating parties!  I love the video!  That little boy was a doll!  I want a poster please!  Congrats on finding the love of your life!
AWWWWWWE-SOME
This was a great music video reminds me of what some of us went through once upon a time. Keep on bringing this great music!

When he put the Mona Lisa in to reference 'I got away with you' MY HEART 🥺
Don't get me wrong, I like a bobber on the water Hookin' 'em and reelin' 'em in I like a Friday night slow ride, Brooks & Dunn, B-side Hit rewind, spin it again I like a strong shot of whiskey, the way a Marlboro hits me Some broken-in cowboy boots  But I'm in love and lovin' on you I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room I can't get enough of you, honey, you're right on the money I'm a junkie for your midnight moves I'm in love and lovin' on you  I like a sunrise, duck blind, birdie on a par 5 Miller Light before noon I like a two-door old Ford, wood board, back porch Three chords and the truth  But I'm in love and lovin' on you I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room I can't get enough of you, honey, you're right on the money I'm a junkie for your midnight moves I'm in love and lovin' on you  Girl, I'm in love and lovin' on you I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room I can't get enough of you, honey, you're right on the money I'm a junkie for your midnight moves I'm in love and lovin' on you I'm in love and lovin' on you
incredible.
Luke, you’ve become my favorite singer. I remember high school listening to hurricane in the truck when it was raining out and that’s when I knew you were gonna blow up. I love your song beautiful crazy, played it at our wedding when i married my beautiful wife. I can’t wait to see you in concert December of 2021 and for the deluxe of what you say is what you get.

Luke you never disappoint

I live right down the road from that skate center! its in Smyrna Tennessee
Any other thing would exchange the one ticket for a kiss or something stupid and Luke Combs is like "I love a good fart" lmao
I’m obsessed with this video😂❤️
Never thanked upchurch for his success and has a team of writers be my guess, that's how mainstream anything thing is 🤷‍♂️
LOVE THIS SONG!❤️❤️❤️
I absolutely love this video!
i was late to watch the music early :(
The smile at 0:38 is killing everyone
🔥🔥🔥
What a voice! Luke, thank you for being you, someone who loves real country music and for doing your best to bring it back to the radio stations who barely play real country music anymore. Thanks for everything you do buddy! Keep it up!
I love this so much
The ending got me ahaha I love the video!
Love it!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 love it brotha! You two are mayjah together ! 🤙🏽👌🏽
🥺 currently sobbing over this
the attention to detail in this video is amazing
what a great video
#LukeCombs hey great music as always a big fan. Have you ever thought of doing a cover of Toby Keith- how do you like me now
Luke combs hasn’t made a bad song yet. My kids will listen to him like I listen to George Strait.
Awesome song and video!
I fucking love luke combs
OKAY I LOVED THIS 😂
Many say country music was never lost, but when you listen to any Luke Combs song, you can't tell me you're not flooded with memories of mamas front porch swing, cold beer, cool spring air, and old Craig Morgan, Tracy Lawrence, or Garth Brooks. music you didn't know was lost. Luke Combs is the itch you didn't know you needed scratched and the country music you didn't know was lost
This is great!
Good lord, I didn’t think I could love this song any more.
Why are you so great! I can't wait until I get to see you in concert!
This song reminds me of 90s country and I am here for it.
Love the younger versions of them!! Great idea. Cant ever lose with having kids in country music videos
Who y’all tryin to fool!? Guitar Hero wasn’t around in 98.
Mona Lisa on the wall, tickets like confetti when it rains it pours. Luke Combs is without a doubt the best. From vine to big time. Congrats Luke.
Can’t wait to see you Corpus Christi patiently waiting for the other 5 songs on October 23rd
loved when this song came out and still love it now. plus the whoopi cushion comment had me laughing for a little too long
I hope this gets a million
You really let me know what country music was when I was going through hard times, especially these past a couple months. Keep it up and I can’t wait to see what else you have in store!!
This is so amazing wow. Totally needed to see this was having a bad night. Thanks for sharing.
I love that when it rains it pours reference
Ah man .. that got me teared up..... so sweet..
Eeeek!!!! I love it! Haha everyone likes a good fart 🤣😉🤣🤣
One of the best songs out there right now
Love the throwback in this it is cute

This guy does not miss! I haven't pushed skip on a luke combs song yet and I dont think I ever will!
Yep. Pretty much a mixture of girlfriend country and bro country. Can you say pandering.
Ummm, this might be one of the best music videos I’ve seen in a while
Love this music video, the ending was so awesome. Best part of the video. This has been one of my favorites since the cd came out.

A couple months back, me and my fiance were having dinner. The entire time we ate, I had to older women stare at me and whisper the whole time. Needless to say, she was stopped on the way out by the women to be told that they thought I was luke combs having dinner. 3rd time I've been told I look like him. I don't see it.
This is so cute oh my gosh
I love your songs bro...
Not what I expected, but so cute! Love it!

I used to think that there was nothing Luke Combs couldn’t do. I was wrong. I realized that he does not possess the ability to release a song that isn’t great
Every new song gets better and better!! Love the video,brings me back to my 80’s roller skating days! Tnk u!!

The music video basically is Luke Combs being a player as a kid. EPIC! Great song, Luke!!!
bdbdbdhf
I'm a huge fan. MR.Combs thank you for all your great music.
this is... amazing.
This dude is the best country artist out right now, Can listen to all of his music on repeat all day long!!
GOAT
he never seems to let me down with his music !
Luke Combs is this generations Alan Jackson...his style is a throwback to George Strait and Brooks and Dunn, back to the  "Prime Era" of country. A refreshing change of pace from all those awful "country" artists out there like Jason Aldean and such.
So bloody sweet 🥰🥰🥰 good job Luke and nicole
Love the video! You’re the reason I got into country music! Die hard fan 💛
Don’t get me wrong I like a bobber in the water...
Best country singer loveeeee it ❤❤❤
Love this video. I don’t think Luke could sing a bad song I’m my opinion!
Very nice song Luke.. love from India!.. 🇮🇳
Even tho he’s famous he’s still hella underrated

Loved the video! Reminds me of my husband and myself. We grew up together, our families were always friends. Started dating each other in high school. We married and now have 3 kids. Fixing to celebrate our 31st wedding anniversary. Still going strong. The video brought back a lot of memories...

Don't get me wrong, I like a bobber on the water Hookin' 'em and reelin' 'em in I like a Friday night slow ride, Brooks & Dunn, B-side Hit rewind, spin it again I like a strong shot of whiskey, the way a Marlboro hits me Some broken-in cowboy boots  But I'm in love and lovin' on you I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room I can't get enough of you, honey, you're right on the money I'm a junkie for your midnight moves I'm in love and lovin' on you  I like a sunrise, duck blind, birdie on a par 5 Miller Light before noon I like a two-door old Ford, wood board, back porch Three chords and the truth  But I'm in love and lovin' on you I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room I can't get enough of you, honey, you're right on the money I'm a junkie for your midnight moves I'm in love and lovin' on you  Girl, I'm in love and lovin' on you I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room I can't get enough of you, honey, you're right on the money I'm a junkie for your midnight moves I'm in love and lovin' on you I'm in love and lovin' on you

Huge fan Luke, keep being awesome man!
Love this song! You music is the one thing that has gotten me through these times I’m in my mom has been in and out of the hospital sick, my dad has cancer, my brother has MS, and my grandpa also has cancer but he has two different types. I’m currently four hours away from them at college stuck in isolation because my RA tested positive for covid. I get to get out of isolation tomorrow after days upon days of not being outside and seeing others and days of eating gross food as soon as I get out I’m driving home to see my family who I haven’t seen in weeks and I’m blaring your music the whole way!
I am not happy today

I am looking very much forward to see the clip, me and my girlfriend always go loose on this song and it has become kind of our anthem. It is a real pity that many people from my country (the Netherlands) do not know the beauty of your music. Therefore I would be humbled to get one of the posters.
Can't wait
