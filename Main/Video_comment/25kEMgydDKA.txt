A DREAM COME TRUE YALL LISTEN BELIEVE IN YOUR DREAMS ALWAYS IT WILL CHANGE THE WORLD 🌎 THUMBS UP THE VIDEO AND GO WATCH THE MUSIC VIDEO “THE JACKIE” on YouTube!
This was awkward bro
Leland nodding to everything🤣
Why Cole ain't pull up to Con yet
Bas bas bas!!!
2:03 that dap was perfect. mf went too hard
would've really loved if there is MORE traffic and construction sounds
Gave that man a honey bun 😂😂😂😂
Cole might actually be the chilliest dude
Jermaine?????  Cole?????????
"Jermaine.. cole" is not a line man it's ur motherfuckn name watchu u mean u forgot
W bro
"Jcole... Jermaine... Cole..."
I like how Mark acts like he, himself, isn’t a legend. Like, dawg, anytime something happens basketball related, I’m on RDCworld right away.
I remember this video blowing up, and I had no idea what a big deal it was because I didn't have a clue who J Cole was 😅  Jesus, I'm getting old 👵
recommending this after kendrick performance yesterday and Them meeting him😭youtube yk what u doing
1:55
Who would have thought that Cole would apologize to Kendrick? Xd
🥰🥰🥰 love this
ngl, the audio quality makes it hard for me to make out what y'all are saying half the time, but I'm really glad y'all got to meet up with J. Cole. Jermaine. Cole.
2024 rdc witnessed they goat get folded by kendrick and actually be a smart individual to back away, then see drake get folded by kendrick. this was kendrick's year fr
But did you ever eat that honeybun ???
Mark eating with the boys he started out with too. RDC is the best group out
hope that didn't change
But now that's a different story man!
now what
so glad to see that one of bro's dreams just come true
Idk why I thought it was funny that you guys meet J.Cole and talks about anime 😂😂  I have a 50+ years old friend and all we ever talk about are anime and I still found that funny. 😅
Of course j Cole wearing a mask. Dudes a softee
W
Awe❤
Nah, y'all not talking about the perfect dap that mark and jcole at 2:03
My goat
That’s not accurate Cole does not use cars they make to much pollution he used bikes a public transport
Something about seeing people genuinely happy to be doing their thing. 🥰
man this feels like the most incredible crossover i ever witnessed, god bless y'all
Y'all asking RDC to make a skit about the beef that never was are weird. If they want to do it, they'll do it but stop searching for YouTubers to validate your opinions. If you think the apology was trash or good, why does it matter whether RDC does a skit.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥😊
black people funny as hell
Waiting to hear these boys reaction now that Cole apologized to KDot… disappointment ain’t the word.
Stop apologizing
Let nas down 😢Cole… Smh
Who else thought that was T-Pain 😂😂
This video puts such a smile on my face
Where is the skit
Literally Made It
J Cole rocking the LeBaron/600ES? I knew he was a G.
This is cool af. I feel like im with yall
Wow, Ya'll actually meet your Heroes...Dope❤️🔥💯
This is awesome😂
2:02 perfect dap
Yoo if rdc can get dreamville @ dream con that’ll be legendary
0:08 ART MEETS REALITY! LOVE IT!
💯💯💯🧡💛🙏🏽
Rdcworld1 proud of yall
Cole sees through Mark lol Mark fake af. Mark talks crazy af to what he calls his friends in their skits. He just hids it in a form of comedy. Look at the way he talks w/ Cole and Cole clearly sees that
Yessir
the vibes are f***ing immaculate bruh fr
Rdc: howd yall like the video? Jcole: you mean howd i love it?  0:52
JERMAINE
Hearing Mark talk about how they tried making manga then and it didn't work, God is the truth and the greatest. Manga and anime wasn't big back then at all, so if they did it then they wouldn't have been successful. God let them get big in another way for years to many people and now anime and manga is big, and they are now making their anime and manga, at God's perfect timing.
Good stuff
THIS is how you meet your idols People be shocked as hell that, artists? Deep down, they wanna be treated as normal Yeah, show you really respect them, but don’t be so starstruck you can’t even have a conversation  Understand. Your idols? Might be looking at you the same way you look at them  When I met Eminem? We talked for a good 30 mins. And it was all about Rhyming. And both of us geeking over crazy rhyme schemes😂  When I met Daylyt? We talked for a good hour on nothing but Consciousness and random shit like quantum mechanics and how it applies in real life😂  Artists just wanna know you respect what they do. And POSSIBLY talk on things they also are really into
I love this for you man
Jermaine......cole.......😂
.
So we just not gonna talk about how solid that dap was wit JCole at 2:04
Yo, where the Javari/Wolf's Rain combo piece

You better take your damn mask off when you talk to me Cole. Man sucking in his own bad air for nothing.

Imagine after asking what he thought about the videos, jcole said “i love them …I GUESS”
the realest

I wanna personally thank Mark for getting the words “Attack on Titan” and “Demon Slayer” to be uttered under the same breath as Jermaine Lamar Cole.
How tall is Ben j Cole 6’4 and he’s taller
J Cole is one of the realesr rappers!  He seems so genuine like the fame and money didnt change a fucking thing about him.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yooo, loved seeing this! So real & so wholesome ❤❤

He’s so down to earth 😊😊
I read the title and I was like "Jermaine, Cole"
When this happened, I was so excited for them
Bro is recomending anime to j cole we anime fans never fucking change
"Don't meet your heroes" does not apply to RDC this is amazing
Mark wearing a hornets jersey, 1 year later j Cole's buy the hornets..Life is amazing 💯👌🏿
J cole need to use JERMAINE COLE as an intro
My boy lied to Jermaine & said the he can finish Attack on Titan quick 😂 He in for a ride because he ain’t stopping
Cash money mawk the goat. He put his people on. Simple as that
RESPECT
"He tried to play it cold" 🥶
The "you can go" to Leland is such a good running gag fr. RDC are geniuses.
im glad hes wearing a inuyasha shirt while recommending anime, that and rurouni kenshin were always my favorite when i was a kid
JERMAINE… COLE!!!
Bruh Mark putting J Cole onto anime is something I didn't know I needed in life
Y’all just gonna ignore t-pain on the right damn😂
Y'all hyped to see a 2003 Canibus-Central forum poster?
J Cole one of my favorite artist
I met J.Cole yeeeeaars ago in Liverpool, UK (where I live)  just before Cole World dropped. What's weird about that day was I was preaching about JCole to my homie earlier that day and later that night I see JCole standing outside a bar with a black hoodie on. I freaked out but dude was so humble and even let me take a picture with him. I later found out he was doing a show the next day in Liverpool opening for Tinie Tempah
Cole humble asf
Why a honeybun? Is that an insider? "seems a lil sweet to me, sweetness" *bow wow vc*
🤮none of y'all picked up on the subliminal messages exchanged in this conversation.
Jermaine Cole Jermaine Cole
Hold that fown lmfao. I knew J Cole was a mask person. He woke
They act like 2 legends cannot coexist
“ I see everything” j cole 😭
Had me smiling the whole time. So proud of them.
He even tells his boy he can go when he meant J. Cole
I am so proud of these gentlemen, may God bless them all!
bro me and j cole have the same birthday date other than the year and im not lyn
Sick 🤒
RDCWRLD looks like the Anime heads from school that sell loud packs that all the clicks kick it with and cop from.
Marks face in the beginning he was geeked
Theres gonna be an RDC world movie Im calling it
So much positivity in this video
Seeing j cole in traffic and being on verge of tears while saying jermaine 😂
Your favorite anime is my favorite anime one piece!
THIS NEVER GETS OLD
Imagine meeting your idol & he talks about anime with you. That’s lit.
Shit funny af especially how his voice broke when he said Jermaine!?🤣😂🤣😂

That's love ❤️
The most wholesome video of all time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
these mfs had the chance to talk to j cole uninterrupted and they chose to nerd out about anime… Cole clearly didn’t give no fucks about all that he just being nice
Let them video games go they dont grow dreams but destroys them.  Name one good thing a video game has done for somebody or is it related to dissension and discord
Golly fam throw some rx on that bih, mad wind
Boi in the white look like the penguin from happy feet
He always dismisses his boy.....nigga you can go
Cole gon pull up to the spot too. He is solid
How could he keep himself under control meeting him like that bro😂? i’d pass out right then and there 😭.
Not only did they say the line to the man himself, but he followed it up with the classic "you can go nigga!"😭
This right here gives me hope that I could potentially meet j.cole and actually have a conversation with him
*I THOUGHT BAS WAS T PAIN HELL NA LMAO*

Bas a 🐐 too bro they don’t even know who that is low 🔑
This is what you call Real Dream Come true. RDCworld1 is <3
J cole really cool for sure
For black people? How about for all people? I love someone from every race. I don't look at color tho, I go by what I feel. Each individual person in this world is unique. And all have unique souls. Racism lol it's a joke the elite rulers started way back to divide us. Our bodies are shells with souls inside of them that have no race all are the same inside. For this color and that color is stupid. People are good or bad the color of a person's skin doesn't define that one single bit. Stay humble homie peace
Its a classic. .
I can guarantee you that those guys were not able to sleep that night! I know I wouldn't!
i woulda cried
mark isnt it crazy to you that some of us see you in this way. getting to meet your idols

Dreamville.
Yall already realised Christianity was a religion made by the white man given to us during slavery. But don't understand why. Christianity is the biggest spread religion on earth because it was created by Romans (constantine) and we're living in an Roman empire. Christianity is nothing to do with the bible. They changed the sabbath to Sunday (that's Satan's day) and made Christ white. Christ was a black man. The bible literally said Christ had DARKskin feet and wooly hair. Revelations 1:14-15. Constantine made him white. The Bible literally tells people don't follow the heathens as they get trees  and put silver and gold and decorate it. What do christians do. Christians do this on the same day that one of the pagan gods that constantine followed was born 25th December. Christians are pagans. The Bible was made by Israelite people. For Israelite people. The black people of this world (well most of them, including Mexicans, native Americans, South Americans, carribeans, African Americans, west Africans) are the Israelites from the Bible and are the ones that are meant to be in power now. This is the reason why black history only in school only starts after 1619. The the white people of the Earth (Esau) are in power now because us Israelites didn't follow our God (the CREATOR himself). The elites of the earth worship the devil from the bible. Yall know who the top of the triangle is... the only reason these things are happening now is because black people aka Israelites are waking up to who they are and keeping the Commandments and there's now an inbalance. It's the end times. What's happening now is the wheats seperated from the tares. The real Jews are black people.

Look up the meaning of the word quarantine on youtube (google changed it after it got some attention on youtube, around 3k per video uploaded!)  Very important File you can read to wake up yourself and everyone from the matrix: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jkEZeq8P2vkd_axEvStsjgLbZWTRO93Ey8Ge5c4la9k/edit?usp=drivesdk The laws you need to keep if you want to make it to the kingdom: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VHc6x0aqicS8indziW0oftjlLQ9HCPnIyhQY59mYejk/edit?usp=drivesdk And go read deuteronomy 28. Israelites know they're special but don't understand why. We are literally The CREATORS chosen people. Look up the 12 tribes of Israel! This isn't religion. This is OUR REAL IDENTITY 🕎

Yall already realised Christianity was made by the devil. But don't understand why. Christianity is the biggest spread religion on earth because the Bible holds the truth about everything that's going on in the world and the government don't want anyone to realise this. All religions on earth are created by Satan. Why do you think constantine caused Christianity to spread across the world. Christianity is nothing to do with the bible. They changed the sabbath to Sunday (that's Satan's day) and made Christ white. Christ was a black man. The bible literally said Christ had DARKskin feet and wooly hair. Revelations 1:14-15. Constantine made him white. The Bible literally tells people don't follow the heathens as they get trees  and put silver and gold and decorate it. What do christians do. Christians do this on the same day that one of the pagan gods that constantine followed was born 25th December. Christians are pagans. The Bible was made by Israelite people. For Israelite people. The black people of this world (well most of them, including Mexicans, native Americans, South Americans, carribeans, African Americans, west Africans) are the Israelites from the Bible and are the ones that are meant to be in power now. the white people of the Earth (Esau) are in power now because us Israelites didn't follow our God (the CREATOR himself). The elites of the earth worship the devil from the bible.

Being the guys J Cole asked for anime suggestions is goat status
Jermaine?
This is damn wholesome I’m bout to tear up
When the algorithm god gave you the N pass
This to me shows how Mark is a natural leader, and very humble. Many people I can imagine would be star struck, but Mark is just in it. he's in there talking about what brought RDCworld1 together, about their anime roots, and he's just amazing, doesn't put the spot on himself but showcases the entire group and the beautiful anime subculture as well. Amazing to see that shine.
That Inuyasha t shirt!

THIS IS SO DOPE!!! Cole really is the most down to earth celebrity I’ve ever seen

RDC WOULD HAVE BEEN ON DREAM, TALK TO EM!!!🥶🥶
Too clean!!!
I’m so happy for y’all!!
Recommending anime to j cole>>>>>>
Now tell me your dreams can’t come true after watching this. Very Inspirational!
RDC telling J Cole about anime seems like a fever dream.
These dudes had my childhood and Cole walked us thru it
I love your content bro but I will nvr understand why ppl think meeting a celeb is badass
*points to honey bun*, “Hold that down” lol
This nigga Cole is impeccable ...nuff said 👌🏾
t-pain best musician ever 😍😍😍
Love this 🌹
Love this 🌹
This man met jcole and Bron in the same week. Amazing 👏
This feel like watching my little brother make it. Proud of all you guys!
Cole face in the beginning 🤣
Shit lit 🔥Happy for yall fr💯
RDC is squad goals I'd join that power team in a heart beat legit anything is possible
Yall's event sounds like Controllerise in Atlanta...yall should collab
RDC: Anime blah blah blah   J Cole:😪
Yo I’ve watched y’all play and have fun for years but this is Squad goals fr……..live it up keep making magic happen……..
hahah that  was so cool just  kickin it.
it felt like he was God when he said “i see everything”
Something about RDC that just puts a smile on my face. It can be a simple video like this and it just makes me happy for them.
you for real said "small not too big" then followed it up with "3 to 4 thousand people" like thats small lol
Big fans y'all said it. I ain't know how to say it but y'all have definitely opened up the lane for black folks watching anime. As a black man y'all have helped make me feel more comfortable about liking anime the black community can be harsh. Other niggas can definitely hate on you for this and y'all have shown the world that black folks love anime too. And it don't take away from your blackness or make you less black.
Nigga‘s got a lifes together me and J Cole and shit you can go my nigga
I love thiss
RDC world doing big things
Y’all met Lebron and J. Cole!!! I’m so proud ♥️
You J cole I guess u can give me a honey bun 😂

RDC has made J Cole more famous. Only because of RDC have I searched specifically for J Cole’s music and videos.

J Cole wasn't acting Hollywood I fucks wit that. 💪
so exciting that worlds can come together over anime, dope as hell
This epic 💯❤️🔥
NO WAYYYY
Omg
"Just a man of the people not above but equal"  Bas gave us the same vibe when he was outchea in Africa. My homies never even got a chance for a photo when Cole was outchea. Understandably, security didn't let anyone near him. Also, we just as inspired as anybody by your music dude. Next time you outchea and all these niggas singing every lyric on your verses, think what it would mean to them to get a simple picture.  You let Nas and US down.
Cole watches ANIME 😤😤😤. Anime is life !!!!
RDC World putting J.Cole on Anime. Definitely my favorite YouTuber.
That one day when you don’t go to school
This is such a sick moment so happy for them and man like Jermaine seems so down to earth.

Why that dude look and sound like T-pain? In the Yankee jersey.
Jesus loves u which is why he suffered and died for ur sins so pls turn to him, he changed my life for the better, he saved me from my own stupid desires and he can so the same for u if u accept him into ur heart and confess that he is ur lord and personal savior, turn from sin and receive the gift of eternity in heaven that Christ died for u to have
AOT goes dumb

SUPREME DREAMS COMING TRUE!
Bro how can y’all watch anime
Yo when jcole drop some anime bars you know who put him on
Does this speak of your ancestor's history? If so you may want to look closer! There's a reason they try to tell us we have no history before slavery. Deuteronomy 28:68 [68]And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.
First time I ever saw RDC act like a fan and not the loud big personality he usually has lol
Bruh dream con sold out already  I'm fonking tight.
I can only imagine standing in front of the people who inspired you to grind. this is so dope bro
That Inuyasha shirt TUFF

Doesn’t make sense how hard this video had me smiling. Much love y’all 🙌🏽
Dude needs to get the ridge wallet
jermain😩
I grew up without a Father. So many walk that same path of life, never knowing the TRUE guidance a Father can provide, the sense of protection, the unwavering love a Father is supposed to extend to his children.  It only got harder once I had children of my own, HOW do I be a Father, when I don’t even know what it means…so many abandon their children asking that same question to themselves.  God changed everything, God began showing me what it meant to love, to care, to nurture…but not just my children, but those around me “thy neighbor”.  I realized I knew no Father, just so I could come to know THE FATHER, when the time was right 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽  We are going to have “Moments of Uncertainty”  But that is not as important as the element you use to relieve yourself. Many followers of Christ are still indulging in our vices and addictions to relieve our “Uncertainties”  Lean on God in your darkest moments, lean on the word that says you were created with meaning and purpose, lean on the Grace of God…let it steady your mind, your heart and your body.  I don’t know who I’m writing to, who’s reading this, but God is ready, and waiting for you to seek him, through Jesus Christ, whom he sent to die the death meant for you and I.  Not just on Sunday, not just when you “need” him, not just when you’re desperate…but every day, hour, minute and second of your life.  Develop consistency in Christ, and you will come to know what it means to “Be still, and know, that he is God”  Glory be to God 🩸🩸🩸  If I still have you here, God bless you, join me as I take you inside a moment of my own personal “Uncertainty” in life, while never forgetting God has me always 🙏🏽🕊  https://youtu.be/VXfWQtxnwqc

I mean, I dunno why I’ve never noticed this in a video clip before but whewww j Cole has such a commanding stature. Tall, broad shoulders, holds himself like a king, doesn’t even try to look kept with the messy dreads but somehow looks so damn pretty. Yeah I’m female, I’m allowed to fan girl on him 🤩😛🥰😍
Just seen this & made my whole day 😂.  So happy he finally got to meet COLE
If J cole drops an attack on titan or one piece bar, that’ll make my day💯💯💯

Come on Jermaine take that fucking nonsense off your face… disappointing man
y’all explaining anime an manga to j fucking cole will be the coolest sentence you can say to someone
Legendary
Cole did not say Spirited Away. Miyazaki’s masterpiece is my fav animated movie of all time✊🏾   Then they start talking about One Punch and One Piece and NC (lived most of my life there). Much respect to the crew; I’d love to just kick it with everybody. Good stuff.
This shit is wholesome and beautiful. Im happy for yall and im happy for y’all’s success. Keep doin big things man
RDC probably will be the biggest channel on youtube
Next you're going to meet LeBron.

Imagine if he was able to do a sketch with them
YOU MET JERMAINE?!!!! COLE?!!!  DREAMVILLE?!!! (Meanwhile I'm at home crying and I live in NC and missed out on going to a concert because of the World lock downl last year 😢)
Attack on titan I understand... But demon slayer?? Yes the animations are amazing but that orange-haired crybaby is annoying af and will most likely turn off most non-anime fans to the show UGH i hope cole only watches titan
This meet up was over due…. Proud of you guys ❤️

You better drop that address bro I swear it’s queens Thouugh
I've noticed that Mark always seems to steal the spot light. He hardly let's his fellow friends speak.  I dont like that. Has any one else noticed that?
My dude is an old G.  He mentioned Trigun, Outlaw Star, and Cowboy Bebop. True classics.
Soo dope congrats 🎉
Cash Money Maw gotta get a feature wit J Cole
Invincible is trill too!!!

Everyone in this video is a GOAT
These dudes put J.Cole on Anime
The fact that hes been watching you all this time its amazing
I feel sorry for the ppl that bothered to dislike a video of a group of ppl meeting someone they idolize. The misery is strong in them.
*It’s confirmed, J. Cole is a man of culture.*
That's just good stuff man so happy for you people
How can you dislike this video? This brought me nothing but joy
I wouldn't have suggested attack on titan as a first anime. Its great but there are much less disturbing current animes to start with. I'd have said code geass or something. That's on Netflix too

Jesus Christ died on the cross for sinners, to redeem them from the hands of Satan. He was buried and rose to life after 3 days. If you realize how wickedly the world is pulling you to hell, then come to Jesus Christ. Believe in your heart Jesus Christ is Lord, confess it with your mouth, and you will be saved from the Wrath of God. Jesus Christ is King!

Man...That's legendary.
Truth
Bro we really need to appreciate how normal RDC World acted around J Cole. They treated him like another human being. The fact they can have a normal conversation on the street with someone with such popular status such as J Cole and not act as if they finna die bowing to his knees and all that. I get that meeting a famous star is a once and a lifetime experience but at the end of the day we all human's bro just one is more well known then the other.
I think Cole would enjoy Samurai Champloo
rdc is so goated bruh stg best channel on this platform
This is wholesome!
I didn't know that J Cole was a Blerd You learn something new every day on the internet 😅😭💜
Y’all some good guys man yall deserve all the blessing coming 🙏🏾💯

Bro shouts out to you! I was so lucky to have met into my idol Lin-Manuel Miranda as well right before he made Hamilton. I was his stand-in for a TV Pilot that never got picked up. But I hadn't made something of myself at that point. So I know this moment had to be surreal for you! Not only was he meeting you, but he was seeing you eye to eye as one of his peers, even quoting you!! Its been my dream to run into Lin again as friends. As you did here. BLESS UPY! You see the drop top.

“J COLE? JERMAINE COLE!?
Why take life into our own hands when we could let go of everything and trust God? Living for pleasure and gain doesn’t matter since death and time erases all your hard work. It’s all meaningless. Of course, if we don’t believe in God, whether we live an honest life or not would also be meaningless (Be of no consequence). Now if you take into consideration that there’s over 2 billion people on earth making their claims that God is real, would you gamble with your life the same way you would with money? Truly, it’s only when you believe in God, does one’s life become meaningful. Simply because it now means there will be consequences for your actions. I say this to you, not to force anything on you, but to encourage you to at least do your own research. Don’t gamble with your life. It is written: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the duty of all mankind. For God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing, whether it is good or evil.
I can’t even say enough I’m so happy for y’all between Cole and rdc y’all have been such an inspiration to me bro happy I got to see my favorite group and favorite rapper choppin it up like y’all have been friends for years only bigger things for y’all from here on out 🤟🏽

John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen.

Jesus is coming back soon. Repent from your sins, follow Jesus, get a real relationship with Jesus, Love everybody, and do the Lord's will for your life which is to lead others to Jesus. That is your true purpose in life. Jesus is our Lord and Savior. Jesus is the one true God who came in the flesh to die for our sins to be washed away. Jesus us the way, the truth, and the life and the only way to Heaven. This life is jus temporary but Heaven and Hell is forever. Follow Jesus before it's too late. Jesus commanded us to go out and preach the gospel to the world. So tell people about Jesus, teach people the word of God, and lead others to Jesus.

JESUS LOVES YOU!!! He loves you so much that He hung on a cross and took upon Himself all the sins you would ever commit, the question now is “Do you love Him”? How do you genuinely show your love to someone? What is the greatest showing of love? The answer is sacrifice and then time. Christ Jesus paid the cost for us, through His sacrifice on the cross that we may live a life of health, deliverance and prosperity. What is it that you lose in spending time with Him, thanking Him for the privilege of seeing another day, and by reading His word “The Bible”.......nothing. He offers you the gift of eternal life through having a relationship with Him, and partaking in this relationship immensely benefits you . He protects, guides, provides, heals, delivers, prospers, blesses you, and so much more. A true, authentic relationship involves communication on both sides. Christ Jesus is often taken for granted, many don’t give Him the slightest of acknowledgement, regardless He is still merciful and loving. Seek Him, acknowledge you’re a sinner, lost without Him and destined for destruction, REPENT, REPENT, REPENT, believe in your heart wholeheartedly what He did for you on that cross and His resurrection. Confess with your mouth that He is Lord, and you’ve taken your first steps on that straight and narrow path to eternity in heaven with Him. And in this process your life will never remain the same, He will give you the Holy Spirit and grace, which will transform you and enable you to overcome sin, temptations and addiction and live a life that shows your love for Him. Slip ups happen, no one is perfect, but through asking for forgiveness and  by His grace it will occur less and less. And you will enjoy pleasing Him and living a righteous life. You have everything to gain in Christ Jesus. Have a blessed day!
much deserved 💜
😁
He told his boy to go 😂 love you guys man been with you for a few years can’t believe all the fame y’all young men have be humble

Nikka got a honeybun 😂😂😂
I doubt that they will ever see my comment, but I just wanted to say this in the small chance that they do, these people are the definition of hard work and passion paid off, from their Home Alone 5 trailer to People who take anime to serious and to the iconic J Cole videos, their come up story in this platform has been a true inspiration for me in my pitiful attempt of trying to grow on YouTube. I'm truly happy that you guys came into my life and blessed us with such iconic memorable videos that will forever be in the hearts of many people, I hope some day I can get a chance to take a picture with all of you guys and  RDCWORLD1 is taking over baby.

*I'm a white, straight, conservative, male. I found it very interesting that there is a negative stigmatism for colored people that like anime. It's so sad. There are many great works of art and shows that will never be watched because people are afraid of other people's thoughts about them.* 😥

God doesn’t want anybody in hell because He loves us, but you must understand why we deserve hell and why those who refuse to live under His authority will go there. He gave us the law (Ten Commandments) not to make us righteous, but rather to show us our sin (Romans 3:20). We’re not sinners because we sin, but rather we sin because we’re sinners. Sin is the nature of our flesh that we are born with due to the sin of Adam in the garden. For someone to be justified before God they have to be sinless. We’ve all sinned (Romans 3:23), and the the law demands death for those who sin (Romans 6:23). God is righteous, so He must punish our sin, which is what He did through His Son Jesus Christ on the cross. Jesus is Holy and sinless, yet He received our sin when He died on the cross, so that we can be righteous before God (2 Corinthians 5:21). When He died on the cross, He said “It is finished” (John 19:30), which means He paid the full price for all of your sins (past, present, and future) to be forgiven. He was buried and rose again from the dead. God will forgive anybody who puts their full trust in Jesus Christ alone for salvation. We aren’t saved based on our good deeds, but only by the grace of God (Ephesians 2:8-9). His precious blood that He shed is the only reason why we can be forgiven of our sins (Hebrews 9:22). If you confess that Jesus is Lord and believe that God raised Him from the dead, then you’ll be saved (Romans 10:9). You are born-again with the Spirit of Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17), and are not only legally justified before God, but also are accredited His righteous (Romans 4:24). Believers live for Christ now, so get to know Him through His Word. I recommend reading the book of Romans and the gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John), and watching Pastor Joseph Prince’s online videos!!
🔥🔥🔥

LIIIVVVEEEE!!!!
Yoooooo fam that’s so litie 🔥🔥🔥☄️”look how far I done came"they say that dreams come true,when they do, that theres a beautiful thing"  RDC ain’t done yet though frfr 💯
You gave who anime suggestions? J. Cole? Cole? Jermaine?
Legendary 🔥🔥🔥
Bro anytime you talking about putting someone on to Anime, especially someone you want to like you, it's tough. Cuz most people who like anime got on that shit young as hell. Shit I was like 7 when I first started streaming all sorts of anime online. I grew up with the shit.   Explaining that shit to normal people is odd. "yeah it's like a cartoon", "no, it's not childish, but it kind of is". Best way to show them is to go with the safe ones first, like death note, Naruto, bleach, Cowboy Bebop, Yu Yu Hakusho and Hunter x Hunter, and one piece maybe. Any Shonen basically is a go.
Wow
Congratulations I’m happy for y’all 💪🏾💪🏾💯💯💯🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾

About time 😂😂😂
They really meeting everyone
Jermaine.... Cole.... 🔥
Need to give him short nice animes. 12ep gems. People need to chill tryna give people anime suggestions with 200ep and fillers. Give him something that drop straight heat 12ep deep. Not no slow paced 200ep shows. If anyone interested i got some.
Dreams really do come true
I wish I could like this video more than once I’m so happy for everyone in RDC. REAL DREAMS CHANGE THE WORLD next we need them to meet lebron and after that they can run for presidency #RDCTAKEOVER 🖤
Making me smile so much
You know who to thank for when J Cole starts referencing Anime in his songs.
Imagine telling J.Cole. “Imma send you the link”. Niggas are an inspiration fr. Ion even wanna really do nun big. But now I feel like I could. And that’s the important part.
Honestly, this is a blessing that they were able to do something like this. I hope that RDCw1 looks to the Lord to keep the blessing and reach new heights.
Jermaine???
so...i watched it again
Am looking forward to on Cole's next song to either hear some spirited away bars or some AOT bars bout to be too nice
Jcole just unsheeped near the end
Damn J Cole meeting Rdcworld1, he must feel so lucky
YOU DID IT BRO!!!!!! Congrats!💪🏽

JERMAINE COLE
FROM 8 YEARS AGO TO NOW...... so inspirational 🤩🤩🤩
this is actually legendary 😭😭
I usually don't comment on vids and this will probably get buried, but I'm deadass crying tears of joy for yall man. I've been a fan of y'alls for years because you guys reminded of myself. Yall made me feel like not only was it ok to be black and openly love anime, but it was cool even as an almost 30 year old now. And we y'all started making skits about my favorite artist and that it was also Mark's favorite artist,  I truly felt like everything I ever wanted to express was being express through this group and channel. I was damn happy when Cole sent y'all pairs of shoes, but to finally actually get to meet the G.O.A.T.!?!?! WOW MAN!!! I struggled to get through this comment because I was fighting through these tears because I'm just so damn happy for y'all man!!! It somehow felt like I was meeting him along with y'all man. I know y'all made it big a while back, but man, to not only see y'all find out my favorite player Lebron watched your vids, that Mark was being considered to play one of my favorite comedians of all time, but to meet Cole in the flesh...I don't even know how to put it into words. It feels like y'all have BEYOND made it man.  I'm truly happy and proud of y'all man!!! Congrats to each of y'all! Keep grinding and reaching goals that you never would've dreamed of!! Love y'all!
Love to see it
Y'all deserved this, period
Imagine J. Cole at dreamcon

Mark putting them onto some game for good anime. I feel like for anyone to truly get into anime and all it has to offer you have to start with a show like avatar the last air bender and appreciate the beautiful story, art , martial arts and animation.  Then you can work your way up to stuff like death note, demon slayer, darker than black, fate stay night, bleach, kenichi, full metal alchemist, etc
Can't wait to see anime house 6
I wasn't even there and this made my day
Real Dreamers Change The World 💯💯 congrats
