How did I miss that?  Pretty awesome.
Fake af. Earth flat
What kinda fake earth is that. Where is Land?
This is fake that's a green screen in the background 😂
Where is flat earth fiction? 👀
i love cgi❤
Those astronauts had the first unrestricted 180° over 360° view in space ever.  That must have been unbelievable.😮
Earth isn't round. Fake video!!
Day by day the mass extinction event for flat earther become closer..
I bet Flat earthers love this video. The earth being the shape it is and all that… LOL
Privately funded space rocket! Hail yes
It looks kinda flat 😐
HOW INternet Work On Space???  ---> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uavYRgc-9kA
FE Said...is CGI !!! LOL
Fake AF... Fake AF... Fake AF... Fake AF... Fake AF... Fake AF... Fake AF... Fake AF... Fake AF... Fake AF... Fake AF... Fake AF... Fake AF... Fake AF... Fake AF... Fake AF... Fake AF... Fake AF...
Again NO stady footage of Earth. Is that so much to ask? When someone goes to space i expect to see some Space..As man Who knows science i can conclude they were on half way to the Moon because it is the only footage i saw with whole Earth. Ah wait it was fish eye. But why???
Flatearther - When reality is staring at your face and you look away ignoring it shouting noooo you don't exist you are a fake.  lol
Wait. The earth is supposed to be flat. What is going on here.
What a shame about the fish eye lense.  Makes the view bend too much. Makes very different view too that of the race shuttle.
Amazing CGI
it's fucking tiny. who is buying any of this shit anymore? the picture of the fantasy globe earth at the start again featuring no land masses. china's fakery is as bad as spacex' and nasa. bollocks to it all
❤️
Now you've done it! You know you shouldn't show a round blue planet. It totally upsets the poor flat earthers.😖
Why we never see how the earth turns by 1600kmh speed?but the view is insane!
Yes  successful. Oooo thanks.all.  Wonderful.
thanks for uploading
Time for LIVE CUPOLA CAM !
Que vista maravilhosa!!!
did jeff who already file a patent for a cupola window in space?
Am I wrong in thinking that the Male announcer has so many sexual connotations in his voice when he speaks to the pictures. I'm a trained Professional Singer and Actor. West end Theatre even. Talk about the LGBTi using "almost" subliminal tactics like Coke-a-Cola commercials in 1960s cinema. That was banned, so should he be. Have another listen, I dare you ! :-0
Space x : knock knock Blue orgy : who's there Space x : orbit Blue orgy : what? I don't get it Space x : exactly. Blue orgy : *dies*
Jeff Who?
How do you clean the outside?
Space X can now change it’s name to ENTERPRISE!
You feel like a dog,you can do it parasites
Looking for views from it? Nothing burger.
The flat Earthers should be able to see their dome from there. They’ll probably just assume it’s cgi’d as usual  haha!
Looks pretty damn round to me. 🌏
At 0:50 there are 2 unknown white objects appearing in the upper left quarter of the screen , on the Earth, and moving fast from right to left. They are moving towards the solid cloud cover. Que words; "This cupola will actually allow them to......"  Can anyone else find them?
😂😂 SO A BIG ASS FISHEYED LENS FOR YOUR HEAD.
I want a 360 8K VR view of Europa moon surface...just to turn the head and see Jupiter.
Guys guys yall r forgetting things can be round and be flat at the same time.
I'm intrigued to learn which company made the cupola. The one on ISS is from Thales, I believe
Even with so many unknown factors, humanity can achieve this. Amazing! One step at the time. We will get out there.
does anyone know if they filmed or photographed all that space junk that fills our heads for so many years, or maybe a shot of at least one satellite?
It should be called FAKE X ...earth is flat wake up guys,,till when will you believe in lies..? Read your bible and do your research...its flat as God made it..WAKE UP
Russians are saying......."Holy Shhhhhhhhh"
But the earth is not a plane? 🤔
Should I be afraid of heights?
Any other Flat-Earther’s in the comment section? No?            …just me? Listen scientists, I don’t care what kind of ‘fancy gadgetry’ (your cameras, space shuttles, probes etc.) you concoct and use to try and prove your point; your data does not, in any way, shape or form, demonstrate that we inhabit a 3D realm, let alone a sphere. Matter is merely an illusion; whereas consciousness is the *only* thing that we can all agree upon, unless you’re a solipsist. I will debate this topic til the end of my days!  🌝👍
WOW! Space X engineers are proving adept at creating elegant solutions. Such an exciting company!
Ooh! It is round! Flat earthers blowing their Flat brains out now. 😆
This will put the blue origin view a big joke then
So amazingly flat
I think this is the moment where astronauts become obsolete
Hello Mr. Musk
13.88889 square feet  and 13 at that really wake up
Any defrost system ? maybe no need if no atmosphere
Earth is not flat!!? U oh 😱
fish-eye lense
hello everyone health and happiness
bad video - want to see actual images from Dragon - not another marketing promo.  And you wonder why folks are bored w/ all the space race stuff.
Made by the Tesla truck glass folks..
Our planet is so amazing, very beautiful, we need to protect our planet, keep it amazing all the time. Stop developing technology that will hurt our planet. Climate change will destroy our planet if we will not act right now. Stop polluting the outer space  with space junk and dangerous gases.
As long as Elon don’t hit the glass with a sledgehammer
We have a global earth not a flay earth
Elon Musk should offer a flat earther a free ride to prove once in for all the Earth is a sphere.
The earth looked round. Must be a fisheye lens! :-)
Suprised that Elon didn't call the cupola Francis Ford.
HAHAHAHA YEAH RIGHT .
hype. please buy ours.
Brilliant
That shit would scare me shitless I can’t lie
Are they time traveling by circling earth 15x times every 24 hour?  Like kinda having a birthday in New York then quickly go California and celebrate it again 🤪
越多人买这门票的话世界就越来越多贫穷！有钱人玩后回来就会开始计算它的门票和时间不行，然后开始要用更快更短时间赚回来！我不懂英文但真想告诉他们是地球害虫！地球资源不是这样用的！伤害地球后再扮演圣人说找适合人类居住的星球多伟大！地球最该消失的就是你们这种人！
So flat. Wake up snowflake.
Hello every body  I'll be really happy if you see our movie 💜🙏🖤
that wasnt nearly enough information
How do they have a view of it in space before it’s gone to space lol
Its a fisheye lens... clearly
Fake bullshit.
well.. the new private jet for 2035?
This must be fake! Everyone knows that earth is flat!🤣🤣🤣
I talked to my buddy Eddie Bravo and he said this footage has been doctored to make the earth look round.
I hate that all the time we talk about space and there IS NOT A SINGLE IMAGE OUT OF THE SPACE! Just the cupola and the Earth. Is something there out to be hidden? And same s...t everywhere... You know, we are going in space to look at the space...
Just don't let Elon throw a ball bearing at it!
HOW IS THERE NO FOOTAGE YET 2 DAYS AFTER LAUNCH?     something happen?????
Please explain how did they obtain the video of the Cupola during countdown T -3:42:50. How can this picture exist BEFORE the Dragon left the ground? And why does the Earth look so small from the Cupola? The Earth is monstrously large so you cannot see the full globe shape from that height! You would only be able to see a part of the globe with the angular field of vision of your eyes or typical camera. Correct me if I am wrong.
They should send "flat earthers" up there!
Why do they KEEP using fish eye lens though?!?! Serious question
Oh look.. there's a sun spot on the earth.. from 92million miles away 😒
Stop this stupid CGI 🤦‍♂️
God didn't abandon us. He's always been here for us and now *He as shown us where Eden's location was.* Look what was found on Google Earth 10 years ago and no one told you!  https://youtu.be/2K2XfdCjXfk
LOOK THE EARTH ITS FUCKING FLAT!!!😵
LOL....idiots believe this crap..
❤❤❤
Elon Musk proves that placing cupola on top of MK1-3 command pod instead of clamp o tron docking port is fine.
3,2,1 flat earthers are crying out fish eye camera!
The Earth view was actually amazing
Jeff Bezos might be the richest man in the world, but it will be a matter of time Elon will destroy him in net worth.  Jeff got lucky with one great idea. But Elon is an actual engineer and genius-level intellect.
I really hope they install sensors on that glass and if there is a sign that it might depressor, they have a compartment to block that off.
🤡🤡🤡Flat Earthers: The curve of the glass makes the Earth curve!
What a time to be alive
The engineering..the explanations,  even the lay man understands
Why are they not sharing footage from the Cupola? Not this 20 second loop
Love you men
No one does what ELON DOES!!@-@!! Jeffrey needs to grow up and man up. He should be spending his millions on getting his rocket 🚀 to space instead of disrespecting others & suing NASA!!
WARNING ALERT ! Incoming wilfully ignorant comments by the adherents of the Flat Earth & Magical Dome Cult, and other nincompoops of the Lunatic Fringe. That’d include religious neurotics
Elon is my hero! I’m so happy he is out there to prove all flatearthers are stupid
What's that big blue and white thing in the background?
But it’s flat.
Good god American's pronounce cupola poorly, lol.  Please just call it a dome for the sake of our ears.
my beloved flat earth
what camera did they use for that last shot, turns out it went beyond the galaxy
My bets on it blowing up. ULA > SpaceX
give everyone the fake look of a globe Fu Off
Good for the engineers and employees of SpaceX and their hard work and the true founders of the company.
SpaceX is 360+ miles above the earth where no Bezos lawsuit can touch them while Blue Origin/Virgin Galactic are bickering over the Karman Line... imagine the highly annoying Wally Funk being highly annoyed looking at that view they're having, she got 5mins in space and the chance to rub Jeff's bald head in Zero G
Eat your hearts out Flattards
Looks round to me. Hmm 🤔
Astounding!  That’s some view they’re going to have orbiting Earth every 90 minutes.  I would love to go there sometime.
Next step to human race
Fake ass views lol.
Flat earthers will say it’s cgi lmaooo
When you are looking out it's the viewpola....When you are going to the bathroom, it's the poopola.   :)
I hope it is not as strong as the window of the cybertruck.
That's only a portion of earth obviously, you won't be able to see the entire planet from orbit. I know there will be some people who say the earth is flat.
Is it Safe to say the Earths not flat?
Francis Ford Cupola
can they see starlink sats?
imagine it breaks yikes
Just rehashing old stuff to get views/likes.
I'm curious to know what the astronauts on the ISS think about civilians chilling out in space for 3 days?
Best toilet seat out of this world.   But do they really have a camera filming you when you go to the toilet?
Maybe Bezos can buy a ride on a Dragon?
Tough to be a phlat erfer these days having to make up excuses such as the human eye's curvature causing the phlat erf to look round from that altitude. Apparently it even affects the view we get from a camera lens.
What are the chances space debris would collide and shatter the glass
I can’t stop saying “cupola” in my head now.   Its an interesting word
I know how this it goes! Next they will put it in front of a giant screen showing a round earth.   ; )
8
Great idea.. 👍🌎
But did they throw a steel ball at it?
they should name it Francis Ford
Will we be seeing any live videos of the crew on the dragonx today?
Really groundbreaking what SpaceX is doing, even without the crux of their operation the Starship not being ready yet. I think 3 whole days is too long for civilians, maybe like a day and a half would be more appropriate, but no privacy or showers for 3 days is a bit too much for the average person, hopefully they further refurbish the Crew Dragon capsule to make it more in line with what a luxury liner should be, their already almost there in terms of aesthetic. Maybe sending the capsule from the Falcon Heavy configuration and making a bigger capsule would be more appropriate....
Did you know they're civilians? Four civilians I tell you. Civilians in space. The first all civilian crew. Space civilians. In case you didn't hear, they're civilians you know... CIVILIANS!!!
Point the cupola AWAY from Earth and lets hear how the stars look. "The first professional British astronaut [Tim Peake] said the most unexpected thing was "the blackness of space". "We always talk about seeing the view of planet Earth and how beautiful it is and you come to expect that. "But what people don't mention that much is when you look in the opposite direction and you see how dark space is. "It is just the blackest black and that was a real surprise to me."  From A17 transcript:  “CC Question 12 for each of you: What do you hope to tell your grandchildren as your most memorable moment of your trip to the Moon?”  “Well, I'll start with that one, Hank. I had two impressions. The-the first is the dazzling beauty of Descartes -the surface. It was just one of the most awe-inspiring sights I've ever seen. And, secondly, on the EVA, when you look away from the Earth -or the Moon - it's Just the utter blackness of space. It really is black out there.”
Just in time for the space debris crisis....
Anyone toss a steel ball at it yet?
I'd feel a lot safer if they have a solid metal hatch to close when not in use.
Jeff bezos boner is getting hard, Space x achieved something, means more lawsuits!
I hope they call it Tommy..
Everyone wave as we pass over Jeff Bezos' house!
wrr
That earth doesn't look particularly flat to me.
you Nasa fans are gullible  . it is all a show  CIA and Hollywood production.follow the money .
Jeff WHO???
Cupola moon roofs! Now on your vehicle!(in space...as well😁)
That’s pretty ingenious of having a cupola added.  It shows the docking port could be modified for special missions.
king kupa la
it's sounds like a mafia word
A bit worried. We where about to view the cupola. But they all glanzed at eachother and ended the broadcast. And now nothing.. but a short loop of the cupola???
Amazing
Didn’t nasa change the goal posts in the wake of the virgin flight stating that unless you contribute to the command of the flight you ain’t no astronaut….so other than the mission pilot I’m pretty sure we shouldn’t be calling them astronauts 😂
Don’t forget all those sad bastards that think the Earth is flat.
My cupola is bigger than your cupola!!
I really hope the cupola is more sturdy than the windows of the cybertruck were... 0=)
King Koopa approves of this cupola!
Another sad day for Jeff Who of Sue Origin…
Flat Earth humans need to see this.
The US military is criminal because it kills the children and women of Yemen. And everyone who cooperates with the American army is a murderous criminal.      Islam is the path of truth.China is a criminal state that oppresses innocent Muslims.
Liberals still think earth is flat
Lies lies lies u can't leave earth
Excellent stuff
Asteroid projectile: Let me introduce myself
The view is going to be insane!
Over two thousand square inches... this is how I will describe my coupala/ manhood. Over fifty inches Sq² bwahahah
What is the thickness, materials, and strengths of the cupola?! *I NEED ANSWERS!!!*
2,000 square inches! lol
EXTREME brilliance  SpaceX and america really...well done
FINALLY it's not a fisheye le--oh nvm
😐After a decade of playing KSP, I've just learned I've been pronouncing "Cupola" wrong the entire time...

SpaceX makes both Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin look so primitive
Hey I am pretty sure they didn’t think to bring a telescope with them. Oh what a view that would have been for them personally!!!
Is the young woman now an assistant doctor or nurse? I think they were given a job just for fun. The black woman won't be able to land the thing even though she is a "pilot". And the fat one is included as ballast?
You can claim , a few bunch know it's fake
Doesn't that skin of the craft look irregular near the cupola structure - right center of the feed
Is there a Toilet in the Dragon? they are stuck there for 3 days, I wonder if they come back it will looks like a Public Toilet
I am here just curious about the bathroom ……
Bozo the Amazon clown is turning RED right now.... "CALL MY LAWYER NOW!@!!!"
as  a feat its  cool as  it gets.   but  a lot of p r too.  keep in mind  as a nation   we sent  people too the  moon   52  years  ago.  i would rather  see the  rich pay taxes  instead . but you have to  say it   musk is the   coolest  . he gets things done.   i wish we  had healthcare  for  all and   food and shelter  where  seen as human rights.
The earths not flat, neither is that & dont forget, Jeff Bozo is a twadt.
misleading headl8ne, did NOT show us the CUPOLA IN Space
How can there be dozens of Youtube posts all claiming in red boxes to be !LIVE NOW" yet they are all about 13 hours behind time. I expected dozens of feeds and presentors would be broadcasting the orbital views. Not 1 all day!
Are they ever going to show the crew looking out the window or their reaction to the view, or let us see the view ourselves so we can get an idea of what the view looks like ? I was really Hoping for this, was very excited about it n they never showed it n I'm very disappointed.  Please let me know where I can find the footage of this if they are going to show it. Thanks.
Flat Earthers Can Rest Easy Now Fam  We Live On a Globe And Gravity is What Keep Things From Falling
Feel so sad for Neil Armstrong,he never wanted commercial spaceflight.
we need to take a flat earther up there to see the world as it really is ......then eject him from the ship
No better view in this world.
Si sólo subiendo a un árbol a bajar mangos ya me da vértigo...alla arriba me muero
Wow. This sucker has a bubble top. Just like the old cars. Lol
Damn, Elon's twice as big as Jeff's
Whenever there's a manned launch, the online viewing chat is filled with people hoping for the rocket to explode spectacularly.
oohh lala
Awesome ! Just hope it’s not the same engineers as on the tesla cybertruck windows :)
What a view!  Imagine in orbit around Mars!
Anxious to see it operation on board Inspiration 4
They better not smash the glass.
Who needs a coupla? 😆
Well, I guess the  the cupola views clinches it for the flat-earthers...
how the women go to toilet in the small space of ship?
Ahhh, just give me a cup of coffee and Zine music!
Jeff BeSOS will sue the Cupola window too.  Mark my words! It will happen.
Can we just have regular cameras please.
Truly amazing!
What they didn’t tell you is that that’s where the ships’ toilet is (this is true).
Eso debería existir hace 50 años 🙄🙄🙄
Next trip take some Flat Earthers.  WAAA?  Wazizat???
Blablabla🙄🙄🤢🤮🤮
Fake
Good Jobs 👍
Can the Dragon capsul support EVA  at some future point?
This the true beginning of Space tourism!!!
There must be some serious distortion in that window because everyone  knows the earth is flat. Ok, well, I guess that proves the nut jobs that say it's flat are WRONG doesn't it?
Does nobody gonna mention that after more than 12 hours since launch we have seen NOT ONE photo of them inside the capsule in orbit or any worded update/status from anyone of them???  It's giving me anxiety😣
Neat.
Sadly, flat earth believers will say the dome window just make the *flat earth look round 🙄
Theirs a face of a creepy woman in the clouds
Narrated by either a teenage-sounding girl or an adolescent male with a severe lisp. ThpaceX sounds like NPR entering the space program .. where the females are dominant and the males diminutive and effeminate.
Soon to be fitted on the cyber truck 😊
I pray that Elon dream come true and man become a space traveling race . Because on this little planet earth , all packages together. We are not going to make it. Greed, stupidity ,lust,envy.gluttony, sloth wrath, pride and the lack to improve yourself in mind, body, spirit and just being a better person is goings down the toilet fast. We need space.
Fake... The earth is triangle, not sphererical or flat like a pizza! Lol. 😁
Thing has a shield protecting the side that is moving forward 😰 , thats some scary sheit 🥴
It is so wonderful that these people were able to go to space. They have absolutely provided no benefit to humanity in any way.
360 cameras distort the view. Is there a normal camera?
It is actually a Flat earth , 💛 I'm a Flat earther and I approve it
Amazing earth view. In case you are still doubtful about the shape of the earth, there you have it.
The earth is flat.     🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is so amazing Elon is just the best thing to happen to space industry
Bezos who, virgin galactic  who?
Wow you can see how flat the earth is! Although the dome on the glass creates a feel of curvature 😀
Jeff Bezos and should book a ride.
Wish I was going!
wow, the earth looks really round 😂😂😂
Where is this footage all I seen was take off and sep of the trunk then the live stream stopped. So whee is this live stream
Yeah more bubble lens
Jeff Bezos about to see spacex
That testing setup was slick
I would like to restart an old conspiracy theory. The Earth is Round. Tell everyone. 🤔👍
cool
We are seeing fresh snapshots of outer space, hopefully, flat earth/ers don't explode.
Giving flat-earthers migraines.
Where are the Continents..? 🙄
comment c possible de voir la terre entiere a 578km
As close to floating in space as your going to get to date
I'm disappointed they didn't send a flat earther up there too. It fits 7 guys, what a missed opportunity
Flat earthers in shambles
What's up with that flat earth thing? It looks like a meme on the internet, like people are trying to pull your leg, but with so much effort, I am starting to believe they really think it's flat. Amazing... It's 2021 now.. it's been round for a while, allegedly, do your own research, blablabla  (Yes Tom, that's your line) Anyway, what a time to be alive (sorry 2 minute papers, that is your line)
Jeff Bezos is gonna need some more lawyers. …
How many times you think the crew is gonna bump their heads on it? Haha
The word is astronauts.  Not ashtronauts.
What the heck is going on.... no live coverage or at least on going updates? A successfull launch was not the end of it. Lets go peeps!!!!!!!!!!! coverage please.
What a load of crap
Old news = click bait 🤮
Where is the toilet?
"Astronauts", seriously, we give people that name now for just paying X dollars? They are tourists, we don't call tourists by the name of the people they are visiting either right? Jeez.
WHY WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING FROM THE CREW ON BOARD YET
Hey Flat Earthers! Take a look, pool you money and send one of your flatheads in space to see the truth.
This footage is from before the launch correct? I can’t wait for the actual footage from the crew.
To:Spacex and inspration crew  Happy engineer's day..👨‍🏭👩‍🔧👨‍🚀👨‍🔬👨‍💻
Astounding!  That’s some view they’re going to have orbiting Earth every 90 minutes.  I would love to go there sometime.
The engineering..the explanations,  even the lay man understands
This will be very amazing view because of its messive giant size .
Woowwww❤️❣️❤️
Beutiful
