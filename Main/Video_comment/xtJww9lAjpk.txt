Why did I only see this video now
Wow this is a great idea
Heads up I do not recommend watching invisible man without your parents permission if you’re under the age of 18😅
These guys do anything in minecraft
bro seems like a smart person but in reality bro is completely dumb but still funny
16:14 HAHAHAHA!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wow.
2024 here : first thing i thought when he said he was gonna disguise himself as a zombie, was “uhhh don’t they… like… have their arms?? raised??” 😂😂😂
Do some videos with guns please.
“A man like me needs meat”  That line did not age well
how do you get this set up on a server?
I miss 2 weeks ago😢
Wow! your videos are so cool
Again great video awesome work on it keep the effort up
WOW, Can't believe this man snuck down, got some iron or something like that and made a pike. That's one crazy guy
It was the stupidest plan ever
Why are they’re no trees in it
Is no one gonna talk about how kim set his gamemode to survival in the middel of the game?
Some of these early deaths are such bullshit but no. Yeah. Glitchy invisible zombies. You get a pass this time.
Wow, can't believe this man snuck down, got iron or something like that and made a pike! Ooh, not good my man's. Not one bit.
Which 1
Wow can’t believe this man snuck down and made a pike
Paper is right 😊
Kim is funny
Can't believe this man, he has an plan but he is actually clueless
He would have had better luck if he'd used name tags to rename zombies with his name
Wow can't believe this man snuck down and got some iron or something like that and made a pike what a crazy guy
So why not put on the armour after you revealed yourself? My man has no brains just like the zombies...
I think akin is from Germany
6:37 am I the only one who hears Castle Crashers music in the background
The castle crashes battle music was great
Sometimes I hear his plans and I'm like "that's such a good idea!"  This isn't one of those times.
Would love to see a reboot of this concept !! Great work :)
He sounds like he hates everything In life lol

Bra kom on
Wow can't believe that man smooth down and got the mine that's a crazy guy
Invisible zombies you could of used invisibility potion.
My man uh... definitely needed to think his plan out alot more.
I wanna see all three of them do 100 days of a zombie apocalypse 💀💀
Give me a good job because I’m subbed
I subscribed to a man like you
That plan would have worked if he didn’t stand so close to them.
I like how only the competition and 100 day videos are popular
At the first five seconds I was like "Okay bro that's smar...stoopid zombeh fr lost his brain."
Wow what a good looking zombie
5:56 peep the castle crasher music
“Wow,can’t believe this man snuck down and made a pipe what a sneaky man”
🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼💀
I would like to note The zombie spawn eggs were from the chest at swamp Forge cheated after he died so he could spectate And idk the other guys story for cheating
i lobve your video
The invisible zombie glitch comes from the zombie mod, it happened in DayM as well. No idea how or why though
It was a good movie. You need to watch it
Did I just hear comona during the boar part?
Did you turn off your name tag
I hear that Ace Combat music at the start you can't hide from me.
How hasn't he ever made an 100 days "7 days to die" on hardcore expert mode nightmare configuration vid ever!
that Castle Crashers beat tho 💯
This looks beautiful. Anyone know what shaders/texture packs are being used?
What shader does he use
Wow u rock man
The castle crasher soundtrack brought so much nostalgia can not lie.
these are my favorite videos
Wich resource pack did he use ?
Vanmose
Sub to forge lads!
WAUW cant believe this man snapped down got some iron or something like that and made a pike thats a one crazy  man
What version of minecraft you using
Rlcraft 300 days
also another plan is tell the truth about where you are he will think its a lie
0:13 Call of Duty Black Ops 2 Zombies
Zombies are cute they not hurt you
wow he died and they won and he scores himself 2 and the other guys that won got 0 and 1 wow what a greedy guy that wants to win
20:18 "the invisible zombie disappeared" That doesn't make any sense?!
It's wierd
His friends sound real but he doesn't
Barbarians theme from Castle Crashers
yes sir
Everyone else is pointing out his plan failed because his arms weren't up and there's me just thinking that if he'd succeeded in fooling them completely there was still a fair chance they'd try to kill him anyway. He was a zombie afterall.
Plsss more video like this  Wow My men
See at 13:03 they are using creative mod how can we believe them ⚡
Forge Labs:"OK, listen here. My secret plan... is to cheat by changing my skin"
Why would you fight them at spawn tho, no armour and only an axe.
I wanted to let everyone that Jesus Christ loves you and wants the best for you and is coming very very soon. Heaven and hell are real and It’s the end times and I pray and hope everyone will repent and come to Jesus Christ before it’s too late. I know this is going to offend people but I have to speak for the Lord and speak the truth, the rainbow is not an symbol of pride it is a symbol from God reminding us that he will not flood the whole world again. I love you all and I’m praying for everyone’s health,for everyone to have peace and for everyone to have salvation. I love you all Romans 10:9-13, 1 John 1:9,John 14:6, Proverbs 16:18 and Leviticus 18:22🙏🕊🌈✝️💜💜

Feed the algorithm uwu
wow, can’t believe this man snuck down got some iron and made a pike
What mods/plugins you guys use? I love the environment being used and the graphics.
What made Robert suspisious of you as a zombie was that you were moving way to much and you didnt move like a normal mobs, mobs dont look down or move around smoothly. and they just stare around for awhile and maybe turn 90 degrees then and there
Ah the mustard virus zombies
Which shaders does forge labs use??
love your vides
I love the way he speaks its so unique
Its so poetic that Robert was attacked by a boar in the first few minutes
Honestly not surprised you died first.

What resource pack you use in this video?
Wow, can't believe this man died to an invisible zombie at day 2! What a man

castle crashers music in the background
Wow look at this man he's doing so GOOD correction AMAZING
I heard the presence footsteps mod nice!

Wow, can’t believe this man snuck down and got some iron or something like that and made a pike, that’s a one crazy guy
the only thing I didn't like about this video was the adds
😀
Tip: put a dandelion in the stew while crafting it and then eat the stew
The zombie skin thing is so smart. Also I'm not all the way in so idk but next time make an underground base so no zombies can't get you
oof mode
Don't know about y'all but the ash skin hit me so hard I rolled down to the basement 🤣
At 6:20 castle crushers music plays in the background
There was a moment he could have escaped as they ran away from him until they realized they were the ones in armor, noooo
What shader/ texture pack are you using? I love these videos btw
It's a War Hammer! Not a Pike! Read the name! great video man! ;)
How their eyes glow
18:03 tries acting like a zombie, when there is no other zombies around.

Pretends to be a zombie: doesn’t wear a helmet so you don’t die in the sun
Whats the mod that allows him and his friends to use and craft those new items?
Please explain why it says unsorted_guy:set there game mode to survival. When they should have already been on survival 13:00
My man's I just wanna say u almost had it and it was a still great/sneaky plan on fooling them 👍
LOL  WOW
yes
Everytime I do multiplayer survival like this I dig a bunker underground and put a dirt block instead of a trap door.  Works Everytime, it's how you can lose people quickly if they chase you   You could've also made traps where they fall in a zombie pit
Why dont you do a 200 or 100 days in zombie apocalypse with your friends working together and no pvp fight only surviving?
Keep up the good content.
Wow… can’t believe this man stuck down, got some iron or something like that and…made uh pike. That’s uh one crazy guy.
the only death that doesnt counts

I love your content man it’s amazing!!!!!!
This is my new favorite youtuber hes so cool and the way he talks
Ah yes my mans
I Love your Videos
What shader are those
Your plan was good for observation and spying but was maybe only really good for one sneak attack hit, maybe two. So you shouldn’t have relied on it to kill anyone...
Isn’t that like uh you know... cheating?
Do one as a team
I always feel happy when he said " they mam how it's going " that's why i subscribe
kanay join plsss
13:02 check the chat [unsorted_guy set own gamemode to survival]
Wow. can’t believe this man snuck down, got some iron and made a pike. Crazy.
At 13:00 why was he in any other game mode besides survival?
leave kim alone, hes slow
How do I get the resource pack to work? I have optifine installed and the pack installed but it won’t work
Wow cant believe this man snuck down got some iron or something like that and made a pike that's a one crazy man

Wow, can’t believe this man snuck down, got some iron, or something like that, and made a pike. That’s a one crazy guy
I just had an amazing idea forge labs should go back and do every 💯 days video together so they would be a team. it would be so cool to see this. But side note no narrative we just watch it from forge labs point of view the then and there. Also I love your vids forge labs and I try to watch all of them they bring a smile to my day
"What type of comment was that?"
You guys have come a long way real quick since The Forest video 4 years ago. Good to see you found a niche.
yay castle crashers music the first mission
"My mans, hows it goin?" -Forge Labs
Forge labs is dodo win
Step 1: find diamonds Step 2: make huge lava moat Step 3: make tower with obsidian base.  Step 4: secure some food and wait.  That's basically the gist of how to survive from what I've seen.
That DK64 nostalgia
Lol lots of meat
Miss your (100 days) man. Understandable it takes time. What about having a partner in a 100-200 days survival. Would be awesome, atleast in my case!
wow, can’t believe this man snuck down and got some- oh nevermind
My man, I love it when he adds Castle Crashers music.
Post the vidieo and tap this number 13:02 look at the life  the one guy set to survival it means he cheated
We need longer ones, its too short
Ok but like- why is his voice so calming? I fall asleep so fast listening to him
wow cant believe this man snuck down got some iron or something like that and made a pike
Something  sed tern game mode survived
What mod is this?

Your Way of talking is just so amazing! You really know how to tell a story! Keep up the great Work dude!
Wow, I can't believe that guy snuck into a cave got something like iron to build a Pike on Day 1. 👁👄👁
Forge labs is the type of guy who can make a sequel of a movie and still feels original
hey anyone know what texture packs/shaders he uses? they look really amazing
you should a count on how many times you say " A man like me" in all your videos <3
Smart plan but you forgot the arm physics

Thats as crazy crazy man
The way that he explained his plan, actually made me believe it was going to work LoL, such a bad plan to murder armored guys without armor
The fact they played into the “Zombie” thing is so nice.
He is a whisper from The Walking Dead
i noticed thet the song in 6:01 is from a arcade game named castle crashers
يب الزومبي اقوي
WOW
My man I’m like watching you a lot okay my man
Is funny that you became a zombie but your hands are not like a zombie
That platform looks the same as your house when you survived 100 days in parasite world
all the invisible man movies are good espically the very first one
I've watched a couple of these videos and I have a feeling this man plays the game with 50% of his brain turned off. I don't know why.
Should've used a morph mod
I SUB TO YOU MY MAN
Wow can believe this man snuck down and got iron or something and made a pike
The zombie disguise is a good idea, too bad it is minecraft.
Man didnt know guns were in the hospital
Is creepy
Who can survive the longest midevil world?!?!
You looked like a guy trying to be a zombie rather than a zombie
13:02 Why'd they swap to survival?
Anyone else hear the castle crashers music 👀
Wow
my ears died at  10:32
10:29 rip my ears...i put full volume
Is that castle crashes music I hear?
Day 5 of repeating what he says: Wow, can't believe mans snuck down, got some iron and made a pike.
Play this with friends but be together no split up
Make more of these with friends

What shaders are these
Wow, can't believe this man mistook a warhammer for a pike. That is a strange strange man.

He really did have the brains of a zombie, lmao
Cheese Mod
Man should Make another one of these but just longer would Make people happy
Ok but how could anyone fall for that? Zombies hold out their arms.
“A man does not choose his companions. These two, they have no courtesy. A man must ask forgiveness” -jaqen-hghar (Game of Thrones) AKA Forge Labs AKA a Mans Man  But in all seriousness, your playthroughs are nice. Good quality video, relaxing voice, and decent and entertaining assortments of mods and content.   Just work on your gaming research when showcasing popular content. For example, with the SCP 100 Days, you should learn the lore of the world your delivering and experiment with mechanics rather than taking us through parts of the trial and error while you repeatedly question what and why without caring to know.  Still, top notch quality as is and I appreciate your hard work. 🤘
Wow can’t believe this man snuck down and got some iron and soothing like that and made a pike that’s a one crazy man 👨
So cool 😉😉😉😉😉
You need to have Dream in one of these videos
I love how he had such a fool proof plan and it didnt work at all
at 13:03 i think unsorted was cheating since he change gamemode to survival from possibly creative or spec
The world generations, shaders and mods here are super freaking awesome
Why doesn't he have more subs
SPREAD THE GOSPEL!!!!!
The strange quit philosophically afford because run conformably whistle pro a attractive literature. beneficial, voiceless income
The BGM in the beginning of this video sounds eerily similar to the soundtrack in the beginning/end of the movie "The Thing" (John Carpenter's Original).  That movie is terrifying. I watched it when I was 8, and it gave me nightmares. I'll never forget the baseline beat of that movie's intro soundtrack. Still to this day, the scariest movie I've ever seen.
Got to love the castle crashers music
How did u create A Server Wirh that modpack?? Im not able to Pls help I wanted to play it with an friend
The icy act phytogeographically lick because beef wessely rinse near a quick digital. cowardly, bad yak
Can you tell me how to do shader like you? please
Wow I can’t believe this man snuck down in the mines and made a pike
lol forge labs be like : muda ! Muda ! MUDA !
He such a unique awesome voice for story telling.❤️🤗
This channel deserve 50million subscribers😍❤️
Are we going to ignore the fact that in min. 13:02 unsorted guy switches his own game mode  onto survival mode?
Him:"my mans " Me a trans woman: 0_0
I have mine craft.so how can i play this mode?
Forge who already did this challenge: I am god
So I've been binging forge videos for the past 2 days. And it was all fun and games at the start, but now my internal dialogue is starting to sound like forge. Like I was heating up soup and my brain was just going "nothing like a- like a good fresh bowl of soup. You you know what they say, a man's soup a man's world. Yup, yup just came up with that right now hows it sound?" it's quickly become very distracting
We’re armor
MAN COUNTER OVER 9000
Anybody eles notice the background music is from castle crashers 🤣 - 6:18
I subscribed :D
the SECOND he asked if i could find it in my heart to subscribe, i did no cap
I sore it
I have a question, What shader did he use?
Did i just heard Comona in the beggining?
What about the arms thing for the skin?
Can someone count how many times he says “ man”
I'm sorry but the last part was like saying to me that you have 0 brain cells
Wow i cant believe a man like that would grab iron like that and make an pike
the idea with the zombie skin is pretty nice, but zombie always have their arm up. You can't do that
“Wow, can’t believe this man snuck down, got some iron, or something like that, and made a pike. That’s a one crazy guy.”
Subscribed
Sounds like Dream’s long lost cousin
20:26 that's an oof
he really thought the zombie plan would work
Dumb question... How did you make this multiplayer???
Burn baby burn I love fire
Wow I can’t believe this man uh snuck down there and some iron or something and uh he’s a one crazy guy
WHATS THE MOD!!!! TELL ME
what shaders do you use?
Your smart-
He really does have an obsession with swamps
How do you play this with your friends?
i've been watching this channel for awhile and didn't even realize i wasn't subscribed. i am now these videos are great
whats the shaders
I was wondering that u would be insensible amongst them
Dude , I think u sucked this time bro
Forge tries to come up with a great plan but then forgets how to play Minecraft
Bruh forge always does dumb shit lol. Zombies have their hands raised just below a nazis right hand and how he forgot that zombies can sometimes have armor
wow can't believe this man snuck down got some iron or something like that and made a pike that's a one crazy guy.
Forge lab more like. Man
13:02 sus
also who thinks he should do something like spending 100 days in a abandoned school or prison and there could be prisoners or ghost kids and also maybe a hostpital
this isnt a hate comment but he already knows exactly how to survive and also like im just saying the zombie goes with his arms up and he cant put him arms up like a zombie-
They should do this again but trying to survive with each other, that would be hella entertaining to watch
where is my good jobe
Hey dude your a little dumb cause zombies have there arms up
No no no you got it all wrong instead of changing your appearance tell them what to ACTUALLY do that way they wont trust it and therefore not do it,causing them to die      ✨ B I G B R A I N ✨
someone wanna explain to me what I saw in chat at 13:02?
I like his sound. Its so cute
The husky caterpillar cytochemically train because attic comprehensively stop in a wandering agenda. second-hand, fortunate cave
WAIT A SECOND HE IS NOT IN HARDCORE
Ash ketchem from pokemon in a zombie apocalypse XD
When he says man i go nuts.
The fragile coat mainly weigh because grade similarly carve across a massive justice. makeshift, shaky unshielded
13:03 WTH LOL NOT AN SURVIVAL AT ALL XD
Hearing Comona Island in the music talking about the boars was an unexpected surprise but a welcome one.
*Im on Minecraft pe. I can’t even download the mod :(*

Still waiting for part 2....
He is the M  A   N of culture
Wow, Can't believe this man snuck down and got some iron or something like that and made a pike. That's a one crazy guy. That doesn't even make sense, what type of comment is that?
His favorite sentence is “A man like me” His favorite thing is swamps  His favorite word is man That’s what I’ve learned so far!
The invisible man is actually a really good movie
Everybody: We thought you died! Forge Labs: My death was extremely.... Exaggerated
I watch the invisible man just before we officially lockdown for the virus and we were the only ones in the cinema. It was a interesting experience also I think the movie wasn’t too bad. Very suspenseful
You def sound Canadian lol
What's up my mans I made a very unique video not even forge labs has made my mans... I added RLCRAFT, Zombie Apocalypse and Jurrasicraft https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIq2ugSOSk
THE INVISIBLE MAN IS A FANTASTIC MOVIE, YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY WATCH IT. IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD.
anyone know where this song is from bc if you do good job 5:35
You Robert and Kim should do a 300 day zombie apocalypse
I don'tike this format of putting everything in a video with commentary, I prefer the old RL craft format of in game voice and many episodes
A man like me uhh
https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
i wish someone would count how many times he says man
i love watching him play all the 100 day hardcore videos so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
you know forge is a real one when he starts playing castle crashers music
The attractive point thirdly annoy because sand plausibly invite anenst a therapeutic shoe. rhetorical, insidious step-father
OK how did Robert even get iron that fast
This Man deserves an award
Wow, can’t believe this guy snuck down and made a pike
Wow
the invisible zombie is one of the bugs of 1.12 I remember from time to time I encounter it, it's so annoying you can't hit it and can't see it
How did he even find out how to get a pint it makes no sense.😧😓
The invisible man was kind of a good movie but it wasn’t great
You should do a 100 days with them and survive together
This was your best video so far,i liked the rlcraft 100days video second
Christ is Savior
He said man 33 times, thats more that 1.5 every minute
ooh thats one sneaky man got iron made pipe down mine first day zombie and house pretty much really nice of him for the lower:)

Even if zombies couldn't wear armor, it would've made sense to have armor on your hotbar and quick equip it when you entered combat and the jig was up, assuming they had fallen for the ruse to begin with.

i can not join i am a kid  can i hav the mod i am sorry i  can not join
I love the castle crashers soundtrack in the background.
I can survive 20 days
A healthy tip cause I dont usually see you doing this: When you jump, hitting the enemy mid air with the sword will inflict critical damage and you can deal much more damage with that... A good combination is using an axe then hitting the enemy mid air but it would cost more time (4 econds I guess) to re inflict again a critical strike unlike the sword which you can re inflict critical strike in just a second. Idk know why he's not doing this😄

What's with the calling everyone 'man' is it like a tic or...? Not hating, just trying to understand.
I am so jjealus of how much his pc can handle i am playing on a laptop with 20 fps
I need a count of how many times he has said "man"
:)
The movie was Hollow Man, I think
The castle crashes music tho
"Wow"
5:53 "um I can hear sum tho"? UH YEAH THE CASTLE CRASHERS THEME FREAKING AWWWEEEEESOMEEEE
13:02 creative what

Wow, Kim really snuck down into the caves and got some iron or something like that... he made a pike... what a crazy guy
u should do this more often.
Its minecraft but the music is from castle crashers lol
wait, if the zombies were able to wear armor, BRUH, he could have worn armor too. Also, zombies have their hands up, another bruh. lol, those mistakes.
I love ur vids plz make more
How the hell did this guy think he was fooling anyone?? Here's a list of all things he did wrong: 1. Zombies have their hands up at al times, his hands sat down and even wiggled when he walked. 2. Zombies' eyes glow, his don't. 3. Zombies' walk is just a tad faster than a player's crouch movement, he never crouched and if he did it would have given off his disguise. 4. Zombies make noises, he can't. 5. Zombies walk the same direction their face points, he walked around, strafed and turned his head way too often. 6. Zombies' movement is slow and rarely change directions and when they do it's with their head first, not their bodies, I'm honestly surprised he didn't just start sprinting because of how erratically and jittery he moved.  I'm ready to pay money to receive the clip of him planning this approach to the competition, 5 minutes at most, 4 minutes of which he's waiting for the zombie skin to download. 0/5
The invisible man was this abusive boyfriend who was touring his exgirlfriend with a suit that turns invisible
Which resource pack used???
Why not a 3 v 3 or an 2 v 2 v 2 with zombies and parasytes?
Id like to know what are all the mods he uses not just the main zombie one
i would like to see more 100 days videos. I get that its difficult to survive but i really do love the storyline ones more then the videos where he camps for most of the story and doesnt actually investigate
How were they able to play this with friends did they just buy regular realms on that version on mc and used curse forge to play the mod with friends or?
10:18 yeah it counts
imagine dream vs this man
I like you're voice 🤣
can somebody help when I got the mod pack the zombies didn't sound and look like they were in this vid help?
I subbed
what shaders does he use?
You know, if he does not believe anything you say you could have gave him real information and he wouldn't have believed it.
You asked what theme you should do next in a video I watched.  The next theme. Should be alien invasion. Starts off with one possible friendly alien. Then more show up, they start to get hostile. More aliens. More kind of aliens. Then just like the parasite they use the living mobs to breed more aliens.   Maybe they attack a living mob, which then kills it and it becomes zombified, which it will later die. After it dies, it spawns in a baby alien which then will grow and evolve into an adult?
love your vids forge labs!
That was short
Make a  video with monster  school
Why is your game voice is worse than your narrative voice?
Ok so Forge Labs, I noticed in most your videos that you don't jump and crit the things you're killing, might wanna do that for more damage
I got the modpack and there were these random steves with swords just killing everybody on the map.
hey my dudes and dudets out there (including forge labs) I hope all of you are having a great day and week and month and life but you get the point with that, i may not be the best at giving advice but for everyone who reads this don't let anything stop you from living a good life and obviously you'll face challenges but just push forward, and even if you think no one is there for you, you still just have to push yourself and prove everyone wrong be successful everyone and live your life to the fullest.
I want to join yall lol
i love your videos
Is not hardcore it dont look the hearts like hardcore
I'm your biggest fan
I love your videos ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
wait whats the mods
what weapons mod does forge use?
I love how he gets mad at comments we never did 😂
He should rename his channel “Just a man”
Next can you do the parasite one
WHY DOES FORGE LABS SOUND LIKE OBAMA!
Is there a vid where U and your friend play as a team in a z.a
I've only watched 3 of this dudes videos and I'm already sick of him saying the word "Man" or referring to himself as " A Man" learn some new words bud
What server host?
I love to Subscribe and submit
Yo when he got on the island for a second you can see the text saying one of them switched to survival
The man has castle crashers music playing, my man, that’s some good music - lemme tell ya.
if you press TAB you can actually see other players faces in the server...
hope i get to see who survive the most in parasite world
Kardashian?
Is it just me or is this mans voice like 🤤🤤🤤
Gotta love the castle Crashers music
;o; poor Kim
I’m too the point where I’m rewatching streams, Sean, buddy, I need more content, I’m sure the men can agree.  Note: Sean is going at a wonderful pace but I just wish I would’ve found his channel a year from now so I had more vids to watch! Don’t even love Minecraft vids the commentary and editing makes it entertaining.
Why is the downloaded mod file a zip file and not a java file?
I just found your channel, im really addictted to these minecraft 100 day survivals, i really like your narration, and you are funny and entertaining throughout your videos, and its something i can also just listen to in the background while doing stuff. Keep up the good work!!!
I really like it
XDD
So i dont have to click the bell?
aye can you show us how to make a multiplayer server?? plsss
My mans your big brain
John 3:16 - For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.
He kinda sound like Kermit the frog
My man
I like this man
6:50 yes i have watched it
you should do 200 days of the zombie apocalipse
Challenge: Take a shot when he says "man"
What what do you use in order to make everything look the way it does
WHY DON'T YOU WORK TOGETHER
The zombie skin would’ve been genius if it weren’t for.. Zombies holding their arms out..
It was a good idea but an idiotic one, anyone who knows anything about Minecraft knows very well that zombies have their hands up
He should have said he hade some string and as soon as he and him stops to get/give the string he punches him and runs
I hope they make a video that they can team up in zombies
How do you make your maps?
What recourse/texture  pack do you use
this > anything dream smp
Wow that's one sneaky guy went in a mine got iron and made a pike
Wow, can't believe this man snuck down and got some iron or something like that and made a pike. That's a one crazy guy.
I’ve been watching his videos for a while now and I still don’t know what are his shader.  Like please tell us :<
The invisible zombies are an optifine glitch that existed since 1.8. Something to do with how optifine handles rendering.
No homo but i love your voice its so mellow
Play the “Blightfall” modpack for 100 days
Wow, can’t believe this man snuck down got some iron and made a pike. That’s one crazy guy.
300 days hardcore RLCraft
Man sounds like a canadian
This is what mansplaining sounds like
whats the shaders
Im surprised that he thought that discussing as a zombie was smart. If they think you are a zombie with no armor, they will kill you in 3 hits no problem while they are wearing armor. That is the most stupid plan ever, going in a straight up fight is a better option lol.
kinda wanna know what it'd be like if they worked together now
you trid your best
Kim won. Bringing the score to, uh, ad plays.
Anyone notice the description is completely wrong
I love how he always says a man like me 🤣
Parasite survival
I would love a series like this- but instead of trying to finish it in 3 or 4 days, you just try and see who can generally survive the longest in a scenario like this. If you die once, fairly or not you lose, but everyone try to just make it the longest. And you can team up 2 / 2 if you want but generally just go solo. No back stabbing - no extreme pvp attempts - just some mans trying to see who'd make it the longest.
wow cant believe my manz got iron thats uh- one crazy guy
he should do it on a whole 200 days
12:37
i really wanna play his maps but my broke ass cant afford the real Minecraft xD fml
11:50 I absolutely love that track  4-28-2021
10:27 I like this death excuse because you can just say that he canonically died and then came back as a zombie
This is like a mincraft movie
I love how this guy has a thing for swamps
Anyone else feel like forge talks weird?
sombody changed there gamemode
Wow, can't believe this man snuck down, got some iron or something like that, and made uh... pike. That's a crazy guy!
...Why didn’t he just put armor in his inventory, and when they found him he just weared it?
I finally got my PC so i can start doibg this too lol, and maybe if my friend wants to
Well, he didn't really look like a zombie, but he sure did act like one...... He threw his brains away when he made the plan and decided it was a good one
kimsitet
I’m new here- is the schtick that forge is a moron?
Just a man. Being a man, a man
How do you not know that you can make string out of leather!?
You can win I know
I like how every video he keep saying "My man"
man I love forgelabs
The invisable man, trash
They would think it was another zombie. With his arms down. Nothing strange at all.
I already found it in my heart to sub u in the first time I saw you
Co-op Apocalypse.
He left the dirt pole... 13:03 he nerd poles with dirt. And then just fuckin leaves it like no, a boat is absolutely suspicious, but a DIRT. POLE. SEAN. You're better than this.
should make like 3 people cooperating 100days to survive but much more stronger zombie
wish I could play too
I thought you were hard-core because at the first part I don’t think you were.
u  remind me of kermit when u say my mans lol
"wow... can't believe this man snuck down, got some Iron, or something like that, Then made a pike!"-Forge Labs
You should do when you and your friends try to survive 1000 days in a zombie world
he reminds me of a funny guy narrating a movie, like dead pool kinda😂
If it was me I would've made my house in the sky, it can't fall over. I love Minecraft logic sometimes.
Wow, can’t believe this man snuck down, got some iron
Usually invisible mobs are caused by Optifine, the only way to fix it is to remove Optifine, but sometimes if you're using mods all you have to do is remove those
This video is cool
you do know zombies cant stay in daylight right?
umm how to ı can downland this free?
Wow. Can't believe this man snuck down, got some iron or something like that and made a pike. That's a one crazy guy.
How do we play this in multiplayer?

This was very risky mah man
Wow

1:51 rip Robert
I would love to see surviving 100 days with other people in the server with this modpack. Would they all be friendly and create a massive base together or would theere be 20 civil wars in 20 days? Would be very cool to watch
Pretty cool 😎

Oh no I’m about to die only two hearts went down*
Lol they have no idea
12:12 im sure they would not spot the difference even if you had your normal skin
WOW
Why would you just put on amour after they figure it out plus you got to work on how to act like a actual Minecraft mob lol
You got to work on your ai skills
if the arms were sticking out like a ghost pack that wouldve fooled them
What shader pack is he using?
Bro i gotchu, i gotta sub if you say sum like that
I love forge, he is the 2nd smartest idiot I know
You are a smart man
What if he makes an smp that only patreon supporter can join  But the twist is its hardcore  And everyone spawn in a different location  Its like walking dead  Everyone is exploring looking for survivors
Yeah Freinds! With you! Aww bolucks
Forge labs is the master of Hindsight and second guessing himself.
you talk like obama
Ggg
You guys should do one as a team
Wow, I can't believe this man snuck down, found a Zombie hole and almost died... Thats a Crazy Man right there
They notice because the zombies have their arms out
You should do a video where all three of you guys are in a parasite or zombie apocalypse world surviving together

I like how he use "I'm a man , A man like me , A man" in his videos bruh
Good.
You decided to use your brain, but your brain was not up to the task.
Kim that’s me
Please do more videos like this.
That is one sneaky man
Expectation: Day 1000  Reaity: Day 4.
bro really said ''i'm gonna act like a zombie'' then instantly started acting in the most un-zombie-like manner. Forge, my good man, have you never seen how a mob moves??
Wow, can’t believe that man went down there to get iron or something like that and made a Pike.
Castle crashers music nice I love that game
There was so much wrong with his plan it's embarrassing.  1. Zombies don't look up or down unless they are targeting something, and he was looking everywhere but straight ahead. 2. He was moving way too fast for a zombie. Even if he had crouched to slow himself down that would be even more obvious. 3. The zombies had glowing yellow eyes, he just had blank white ones. That would have been visible even in daylight. 4. He was strafing around, zombies can only walk straight forward. 5. He didn't have his arms up, zombies always have their arms up no matter what. 6. His movements looked nothing like a zombies, even excluding the points above. Zombies will usually walk in long straight lines, while he was doing short sporadic movements.  I'm sure that someone could write an 800 word essay on how bad the execution of his plan was. But you at least got to give him points for trying, he really gave it his all.
Pro tip,  u can make plant string (like the plant string from RLCraft) by cutting grass with a knife. you can make a knife by using any material such as wood or iron or stone or diamond on top of a stick! get easy halberds and crossbows!
Wow, can’t believe this man snuck down, got some iron, or something like that, and made a pike. That’s a one crazy guy.

When you are wearing armor and confuse an enemy with a Warhammer for a pike. Last mistake you are ever going to make.
That's a big button
Next time try to use firearms, It can be interesting :)
Wow you are a good man and I’m not a man lol
Castle crashers!
Try 'Whoever survives the most days in a Parasite world wins'
Castle crashers music is a vibe.
Your man here does not need to think to sub to u

Forge was kinda stupid he chose to pretend to be a zombie instead of getting loot and armor

why arethey running from him when he has no armour and they do? 19:08
The thing that gave away your “foolproof” plan was your arms,they stick out with real zombies,and your arms weren’t sticking out...
The castle crashers music when he was in the cave was amazing
he’s so intensely Canadian
5:45 castle crashers music lesgoo
How that plan is even gonna work a zombie doesn't nod his head up and down and move like a normal player
How many times is guy gonna say “A man that...”
bruh your arms stick down
you  should try  doing it together
How do you get it realistic like that??
Woah it's Ash!
You should do a episode where you work thoger
Already subscribed!
I remember the first video I saw of you I instantly subscribed
Let’s see my mans give us an invisible man review
I love the way he refers to himself as man, no cap it makes my day
he needs to do a parasite version of this
should've put your arms out
why you say this three FUCKIN words again and again         MAN LIKE ME
Something like wow, can't believe this man snuck down and got some iron or something like that and made uh pike, that's uh one crazy guy
I always love the music you add to your vids! Like the one at 3:09 it adds such a fun playful yet ominous vibe!  The song at 11:45 is rad too  Does anyone happen to know the name of these songs?
I’m currently having the song heatwaves by glass animals play as an ad.  Update: it just ended
13:02  someone change to createve and  to surviveal
Zombie skin that cheating
Ass ketchup is gonna be the very best like no one ever was
you should make more of these
Damn man you so great
I loved the castle crashers music around day two and the cave. Was I the only one who recognized it?
I love your videos I sused to you the first time I watched one
Jesus Christ loves you
When u realize that ur plan would never work because zombies have their arms up and you didn't even walk like a zombie you were walking too fast. Very unconvincing
This man needs a thophy by acting like a Zombie without walking straight and like a robot, nice work.  dont forget that zombies have their hands raised up
"A man like me" Got me hooked already!
i got mineraft for free
How many times did he say 'man' in this video
What's the mod?
When you make a video, Please make it a 2hours vid
Ouch my eardrums are now deatroyed after the minute 10:30 (dont click/touch that time stamp unless you wanna be deaf)
The biggest give away was looking down and the fact that your arms weren't outstretched like an actual zombie
Take a shot every time our man says "man". You won't be waking up the next day.
You say man as much as I say Dude tbh. Also his zombie plan was so sad tbh
Shader pack?
“Foolproof plan”  :’)
the castle crashers music really hit me with some hard nostalgia
what shaders  does this man use
You went into 3rd person so many times in the zombie skin yet you never realized you didn't actually look like one since your arms weren't out. Not even in editing
got that fungi forest music though
This man puts so much effort into his videos
What an infinitely retarded move, lel
nice exp farm loool

All of you forgot one major detail, zombies walk with their arms forward.
The title says hardcore but it isn't

Wow, can’t believe this man snuck down, got some iron, or something like that, and made a pike. That’s a one crazy guy

You need to change the version of forge because the gun mod doesn’t work
Me* hates Minecraft: me enjoying your channel and narrative voice..
https://youtu.be/o9aulHjSeqM
The zombie strategy was horrible lol You are aware that zombies have their arms in different position than the players right? And that guy wasnt even *sure* it was a zombie, he went check. Sometimes the best strategy is just trying to keep things simples
