I've been getting a lot of comments saying I didn't follow the instructions correctly, so I thought I should mention that being a redstoner myself, I could immediately tell the AI had absolutely no clue how to build a simple redstone circuit. It's something that's probably a lot less obvious to people who don't make redstone  Lots of the instructions were very ambiguous, so I had to guess what the AI wanted me to do. Even if I followed the instructions "properly", the redstone still wouldn't have worked. The AI just didn't know how to make redstone xD
Snapchat is dumb
Bro you are stupit
yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Yo what a come back from Discord
Amazing advice, I’ve started small on fanvue
Google’s AI is Gemini
i think this guy sound like postal dude😂
Philadelphia Phillies you are mean lol surprise LOL surprise LOL LOL LOL LOL lol again
Turn on And subscribe I can subscribe I don't want to hurt you but whatever I want to see if I wanted to tell you something is happening to you poo poo poo your face poop poop poop poop poop poop poop poop poop please make a love you and I love you babe Cafe😂
I think on I think on the google thing on making the TNT cannon You are meant to do that in bedrock
i like purples a lot
For the last two you have to ask can you tell me how to build and what you want to build
Hey man, i just came back to this video after two years cuz i just remembered it existed and its genually a good video ! But i'm wondering if you could do a second episode because chat gpt is getting way smarter now and i'm pretty sure it could even make a redstone circuit properly !! :)
2:20 thats a crop farm, not a tnt launcher
Bing wins
this is even more funny from a LLM perspective, because these models have (almost assuredly) been trained on data that contains redstone build instructions.  You aren't asking it to build anything it hasnt already seen, so theoretically, a model with enough parameters could perform this task perfectly (and the models you are using are huuuuge), and a pure LM probably would.  BUT! in alignment training (basically teaching the model to do what we want instead of just generating... stuff) openai, FB, X, etc. specifically train their models not to plagiarize (not out of any morals, but so that the company doesnt get caught for stealing data)  SO! despite the model KNOWING how to actually make a piston door or w/e, It shoots itself in the foot instead of telling you, because openAI doesnt want to admit its crimes.
Chatgpt literally dumb
8:32 Chat tpt wins because it build a side door
Bro, you’re wrong doing it wrong
It’s 2-maybe nearly 3 now-years ago. When Ai was in its beginner stages and when very little people knew it existed. But good content!
everyone gets points for effort but clyde wins for that perfect execution
Smily face

i love how he didnt say "best one" but "least worst"
When I make my own game it's not gonna have any AI And I'm gonna make a website
*dc ai gave me a website when i asked for a minecraft addon it was a virus- 🥀*
Can someone point out that on the door for ChatGPT he actually kind of got it right but purplers didn’t build it right
I think you could have asked the discord bot tips for making things not instructions
4:04 SMILEY FACE😀😀😀😀😀😀
9:56 why did i laugh so hard at this 😂😂
Discord is the winner cuz it actually Made it work
Discord wins because the other AI maked al yhe build wrong and discord did 1 thing good even it did 2 times nothing

discord ai thinks you want him to actually build it for you, not tell you how to build it
The discord bot wins because it can actually do at least one thing perfectly
discord won by far
Now it can
Dont forget grammarly ai

discord wins huge comeback !
The only thing that I’m wondering is, how does Google know all this like they know everything like almost everything what’s the first living being boom you got the answer
Discord just looked it up 😂
Your so funny 🤣 😂😂 love your videos
Hey, when asking Discord AI, you might have confused it by telling it to make you a tnt cannon instead of "design me a tnt cannon"; design vs create. It doesn't need to play Minecraft to design but does to actually create (the physically make definition and not invent or design definition of create)
The comeback is crazy
bing chat

Merl….
What about chatGPT?
bro is doing it soo wrong like your actually dumb and probably bcuz your british

Use google Gemini. He would be more than willing to help

This is like that Peanut Butter Sandwich video where they follow the instructions exactly
Discord just thought you wanted it to build the door instead of giving a tutorial
We should be praising AI bots for being honest about things it knows it cant help with. ...and here we are saying its worse than the ones that wasted your time on junk.

Bing chat is SO SMART!!!!
So when the universe ends goes hard😂
🔥microsoft edge🔥
Google cooked in the tnt cannon challenge

BROOO I AM GETTING SO MAD ON HIM HE LITERALLY DOESNT GIVE ANY SAPCE BETWEEN THE PISTONS IN 3rd ROUND WHEN HE WAS MAKING PISTON DOORS.....      Some people were telling me that  i am dumb cuz the AI told to keep the pistons facing each other      BRO I AM NOT DUMAB, "KEEP THE PISTONS FACING EACHOTHER"DOESNT MEAN YOU HAVE TO STICK THE PISTONS YOU COULD LEAVE GAPS FOR ENTRENCE....
8:06 you littlerally made a 4x4 frame instead of 2x3 and kept two blocks missing
7:37 Thats sounds like skill issue to me...          *BRO YOU ALSO HAVE SOME ISSUE CUZ IAM NOT TALKING ABOUT DISCORD BUT YOU DIDNT FOLLOW SOME OF THE CORRECT INSTRUCTION...*
Place four piston in each direction (Up right down left)
Bro for the ChatGPT it sad 2 by 3 2 block up 3 block horezontely 2 block down bro
4:39 I asked Snapchat AI myself to make a TNT cannon. My words were exactly.  Can you make me a Minecraft TNT cannon?  It responded with  Creating a TNT cannon in Minecraft can be super fun! Here’s a simple design to get you started:  Materials You'll Need:  *   Any solid blocks (like stone or cobblestone) *   Water bucket *   TNT *   Redstone dust *   Redstone repeater *   Button  Steps to Build:  1.  Build the Base: Place 9 blocks in a row. At the end of the row, add two blocks on each side to make a U shape.  2.  Add Water: Place water at the closed end of the U shape. The water should flow to the open end, stopping at the edge.  3.  Place TNT: Put a TNT block at the end of the water stream. Then, place TNT blocks along the row of blocks, stopping one block short of the water.  4.  Redstone Circuit: Place redstone dust on top of the blocks behind the TNT. Place a button on the solid block at the closed end of the U shape.  5.  Add Repeaters: Place redstone repeaters along the row leading to the TNT, facing away from the button. Set the repeaters to different delay levels (right-click to adjust).  6.  Test It: Press the button! The repeaters will ignite the TNT behind the water, launching the final TNT block.  Have fun experimenting with the timing of the repeaters to get the best launch distance!   Somebody do this

0:28 poor hamster.
I can make piston doors easy, but its sooooooo complicated
Discord thinks that you want it to make it for you so like say " tell me some steps to create a [Minecraft  build 🏢 ]"
discord wins bcz is was the only one who made a working build
I think if you asked the discord bot “Can you tell me how to build a [build name] in Minecraft?” instead of “Can you build me a [build name] in Minecraft?” it would’ve done better.
ai is dume
when do we get official google and discord to comment??
Van Gogh, I’m so proud Im dutch
Discord 11:15  !!!!!!!!
Discord bc it was the only one that ACTUALLY SUCCEEDED.
On the automatic minecart one the reason why chatgpt didn't work is because you didn't even press the button also I don't even thing the Burton was close to it for it to work
DISCORD IS THE WINNER cause discord may have failed the other two rounds but it was the only AI that actually did it correctly
🙃
The discord bot threw off at first then at the final round made a perfect contraption to test purplers

The incompetence in how to actually execute this video idea is ridiculous, hard to tell wether you really are braindead or are baiting

Chat GPT  got really wrong
SMALLY FAACE
Pretty sure bing chats actually works if you add water and tnt to the dispenser
Why do I feel like he can’t spell 😂😂😂
I do not think you followed the instructions
Discord obviously.
Discord ai won because of the last part
Guys he tried on Java what if the ai was talking about bedrock
Ur useless

I asked ChatGPT to make a paragraph about pears spot the mistakes   Pears are sweet, juicy fruits that belong to the Rosaceae family, closely related to apples and quinces. They come in a variety of shapes and colors, ranging from green and yellow to red and brown, and are known for their soft, buttery texture when ripe. Pears are rich in fiber, vitamin C, and antioxidants, making them a nutritious addition to a balanced diet. They can be eaten fresh, poached, baked, or used in salads and desserts. Cultivated for thousands of years, pears hold cultural significance in many regions and continue to be a popular fruit enjoyed around the world.
Hey Siri
Yo snapchat got an upgrade it can now make a 2x2 and a 3x3
7:02 🤨🤨
try this now
Discord and Snapchat AI is dumb YOUR NOT GONNA PLAY JUST SAY HOW-
Chat gpt updated now it searches if you say something
can you do Khanmigo next?
Sorry, maybe you should’ve just tried bedrock edition because you could put repeaters in water in bedrock addition
i think discord because i never was able to make a red stone door until now
0:28  YEET
2:07 bro thinks that the ai is dumb but turns out he is instead
They mean 2 up and 3 wide not 3 up and 2 wide dumb ass
7:37 "That sounds like a skill-issue to me," 💀💀😭😭😭
11:15 is worst part
Discord won!
I think discord is the winner because in the first 2 tests it sounded like clyde thought Purplers was telling him to join his minecraft and build it for him instead of giving a tutorial
0:04  I told you it’s pronounced van GOOOOOOOOO!!
😀😀😀😀😀😀
Snapchat
rubbish
For the first two, clyde just didnt understand that you didnt eant him to play minecraft. Clyde actually knew how to do redstone, but he wasnt physically capable of it. An obvious winner.
I don't know why, but I was freaking busting up laughing at this!
Google ai was more about details with the mine cart track
😅 discord won
9:17 made me laugh so hard😂😂😂😂
3:02 say Java edition because it thinks it’s bedrock edition
0:35
The best thing ever😂
tbh your handling on the Discord's AI situation has pretty bad tho, you could've asked for instructions on how to build the stuff instead of asking it to build the stuff. On its set of instructions it didn't have any way to build anything, so he really couldn't do anything, so everything comes down to how you ask it. "I'm trying to build X in Minecraft, can you help me with instructions on how to build it, explained in a way that even unexperienced players could follow?" that would probably be enough to get much better results, even from Snapchat AI.
Put the actual do I do if this
You need to be specific for bedrock or java
Discord
Microsoft edge? more like Microsoft egg!
10:53 my bedrock bros who can’t use qc
Clyde!!
For the discord bot it was saying it couldn't MAKE it not give tips to make it
discord
I think discord won and BTW you probably could've asked discord for a tutorial on the builds
thank god this is a better video from the fake gametoons video I just watched and roasted
1:38 MICROSOFT EDGE👹👹👹
Omg…I couldn’t stop laughing!! Pure gold!!
fake
Greatest Comeback in History!!!! DISCORD 'O'
2:46 did you specify Java or Bedrock? Because that works in bedrock.
you should have asked the snapchat and discord bot to give you instructions, not if they can build it for you
This feels like rage bait because half of those instructions would’ve been good for me
you need house for lt so... friend me
0:27 is the most HILARIOUS MEME on YouTube lol
Technically all of them failed in every round so discord wins
RIP BARD 3:08
he sounds like ai lol
2:24 that could work, if you did it right....
1:37  NOOOOOO IT CANT HURT ME
5:56 Binge Chat was high
I don’t think none of them won 😂
Me having a hard attack when he called the villager nigel…
nah bro i thot he was bout to say ______!😂💀😭 7:11
Khan Academy also has an AI
That's only for Java I guess cause Im pretty good at red stone in bedrock and you can't do that
Discord because it only won one and the rest of them did not win
I think the discord bot thought you wanted it to go and build the contraption, explaining why the bot  said that it couldn't play minecraft
You need to press the button to move mine art and put it beside rail IdIoT
Obviously for the redstone repeaters it’s think of bedrock
smiley face……….😂😂😂 4:04
7:21 I mean you never TOLD the AI to put I minecart on the track, you just said to make the station so it should count
Bard now is called Gemini
Googles ai is Gemini
How does discord always does nothing but at the end discord does the exact thing
Bro you should try gimini is the best
At least this are 1 year ago, actually the IA's its so better
Bedrock edition mf
You kept asking it to create it for you, when you should have asked them to tell you how. At least thats my assumption given the context.
I know how to make a machine that actually works it uses TNT to blast you high up in the air, the more TNT you use the higher you go
I think google won because he had the most interesting setup and I like he idea’s
When you asked discord clyde, you probably asked him to build or show how to build, you should had probably ask him to guide or make step by step tutorials. Maybe that would make him do best in each round.
Clearly the winner for all the rounds is snap chat hands down chair out and user in the Refrigerator crying and eating chocolate cake.
how tf does java redstone work?? Im looking at this 2x2 door and how in gods name are the bottom pistons being powered, let alone the top ones?? I play bedrock for windows and i know its different but wtf, literal magic
Why don’t you try helping the AI?
clyde basically knows how to do it but refuses to do it😂
2:23  it’ll technically work if you put some tnt in the dispenser so good bing!
YOU SHOULD OF SAID TO THE DISCORD ONE (give me a tutorial on how to build a _____ in minecraft)
do this challenge again, but with Claude 3.7 sonnet, GPT, Gemini, microsoft Co-Pilot and any other ai you wanna try out
When the Minecraft AI that knows how to do all of this
It’s wierd since on first round, binge chat I felt like could’ve worked if they were more specific and said the add tnt
8:24 that looked so weird
This kid is so dumb, he didn’t specify any of the directions to Clyde, and he was trash at following directions. Please use all 2 of your braincells.
11:15 worst part of the video
1:39 🤮🤮🤮🤮
4:35 I think it's more than likely a totally made up URL, rather than a video that's been removed.
Clyde
To be fair maybe the question to Clyde was wrong?
I think discord wins because it was the only one to work that didn’t have overly complex instructions
the embarrassment i felt after watching bro scroll past my old yt channel
discord
deepseek
I think the cannon Google made could've saved the redstone because I, a Bedrock player can place redstone underwater.
This is when I start getting abusive to the AI.
The discord ai lost the two rounds because you ask for the ai to go into Minecraft and make it for you, but you didn’t ask for tips to make it
The 2 AI was good
Oh no it’s Nigel and marmalade!!! 7:04

He doesnt see that you have to place the piston  up high aswell as connecting the slime to it and putting the the dispenser but the rest is no quite right-bingchat
I asked chatgpt who the creator of Minecraft was and chatgpt said John Pork
Maybe Discord and Snapchat thinks that you're asking them to help building the redstone builds as players. They take requests too literally.
WHY
Yeah I just think you asked the questions improperly to Discord.  I got wildly different answers for the first two questions when I asked: "Could you instruct me on how to build a TNT cannon / redstone-powered rail station in Minecraft?"  The key word is what you're asking it to do.  If you say "Build me a redstone-powered rail station" or anything along those lines, it will interpret that as you asking it to do something it is incapable of doing.  But if you ask it to instruct you, you get a completely different outcome from my experience.
Clyde locking in 10:30
i asked chat gpt and google ai to help me build a lego sword but both ended up looking like a HUGE wiener.....
2 of them you built wrong. On both rounds.

I think we all know that if you would’ve worded it correctly with discord and Snapchat Ai it would’ve tried. Something like “can you show me step by step how to make a 2 by 2 piston door in Minecraft”
Chat GPT
I love chat GPT
Why do i always read the "as" like "ass"
Cat got is good
bing cooked if u understanded it
4:06 smaily face 😊
discord wins because you should have told it that you can build what it said, it thought it had to update your minecraft world itself
u forgot one ai
Discord Won
What's wrong with Microsoft edge?
Discord wins because quality matters not quantity
Opera GX has Aria too
Bro how did you now my name my name has nigel on it😂😂😂😂😂
Don’t u dare mock space):
by looking at the last round Clyde might can get 2 previous round right, you just need to tell it what you want
even in 2024 im in 2025 btw gemini was a thing why u using bard lil broo
6:59
9:56 IT MEANT ON THE GROUND😭😭😭
Discord cuz it has 1 point
10:52
I thought something else 7:04 💀🙏
I know this is a year old but like.. It's all about your prompt. If all you tell it is "make tnt cannon in minecraft" offcourse it's gonna suck because you aren't telling it to give you clear instructions with what goes where... If you give it a garbage prompt it will be a garbage output
Liar, I tried to do the piston door but only the top did it maybe it’s because I was in bedrock
Discord win
that one? hmm let me copy the text and now is here @RedstoneMaster Edit: it's was not an youtube channel, but the Most Redstone Master is Mumbo Jumbo.
Wenn he said "Nigel" it sounds like the dog friends with nigel
9:27  Google is freaking making a infinite time loop  Repeat it until the universe ends
bing chat could have won the first round if there was a tnt in the dispenser btw I think discord won
Discord
Discord won.  It knew its limitations... it was honest... and actually helped you build a simple piston door without guessing at any of the details it was unsure about.  What a champ, LOL
humans are smarter at Redstone than AI bot which has no touch word thing
Bard BUILT train station! Hahaha it doesn’t even work!
Discord
At some point it will tell you to make a rollercoaster with lava and sand
1:37 What's wrong with that I use it as my main?
😃😄😀😄😃😀😄😃😀😀😃😄😃😀😃😃😃😀😄😃😃😃😀😃😄😄😄😃😃😃
Google ai just changed to Gemini and changed to Gemini 2.0 which is the smartest of them all
Discord of course, it just says it dont have access ingame, so you need to be specific that you want tips on how to make the redstone contraption
UGHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
All AI's are stupid
the discord bot knew how, but since you asked it to "create" something, it was mislead in the direction that you were trying to get it to do a physical task. if you asked it to give advice to build ______
discord because no others got a single one right
discord clyde final round gave me emotions ngl, it though you wanted it to join a whole server but when it figured out you wanted the instructions it nailed, please make a new vid about a competition!
@Purplers DuckDuckGo has an AI bot now, too.
Looks like the AI just expected you not to act like a dumb ahh lil kid like oh i don't know how to do it can you show me every last detail bruh r u dum
The real winner of this video is humanity
9 :22 escuse me what😂😂😂😂
Clyde just needs some confidence
1:48 at least i got UBLOCK
Discord and Bing tied as they both made a successful build
tnt cannon by openai reasoning model: To launch players into the sky using a TNT cannon, we’ll modify the basic TNT cannon design slightly. Instead of firing TNT blocks for explosions, we’ll aim to create a setup where the player is propelled by the blast of TNT.  Materials Needed: 7 Blocks (any solid block) 5 Dispensers 1 Button 1 Redstone (or more depending on the length of the circuit) 1 Water Bucket 4 TNT (or more) 1 Slab (optional, to prevent the TNT from exploding near you) 1 Armor Stand (optional, to test before using a player) Step-by-Step Instructions: Create the foundation:  Start by placing 7 solid blocks in a row (this will be your base). Place the dispensers:  Place 4 dispensers facing towards the direction you want to launch the player. These dispensers should be placed on top of 4 of the blocks in the row. Place the 5th dispenser at the opposite end of the row, facing upwards. This is where you’ll place the TNT that will launch the player. Add the water:  Place water in the second block from the end (next to the dispensers, at the farthest end from where you stand). The water will ensure the TNT doesn't prematurely explode when it drops, keeping you safe. Position the slab (optional):  Place a slab in front of the last dispenser (on the block just before where the water flows). This is optional but helpful for stopping the TNT from floating or rolling away. Place the TNT:  Place 3 TNT blocks in the dispensers facing the direction of launch (where you want to go flying). Place 1 TNT block in the dispenser at the far end (the one facing upwards). Wire the dispensers with redstone:  Place redstone on the top of the blocks where the dispensers are located to connect them all. The redstone should be powered at once when you hit the button. Add the button:  Place a button on the side of one of the blocks near the redstone circuit, facing the direction you want the TNT to be activated. Test with an armor stand (optional):  Before testing with yourself, you might want to test the cannon with an armor stand to make sure it works correctly. How it works: When you hit the button, the dispensers will activate in a quick succession, launching the TNT toward the sky. The TNT is fired from the dispensers, and the last TNT block that gets shot upwards creates an explosion, propelling you (or the armor stand) into the sky. Extra Tips for Safety: Timing: Make sure to time the explosion so that you are launched just after the TNT explodes. If you're too close to the TNT when it detonates, you might still take damage. Protection: Use armor or a shield to protect yourself from the explosion. Practice: It can take a few tries to get the exact timing right, so don’t get discouraged! This setup should launch you sky-high if you stand near the back of the cannon! You might even be able to create larger versions of this cannon for even more height!        You said: make a hole wheree you jump in and tnt connon launches you sky high.  Reasoned for 5 seconds Crafting the setup  Thinking about how to create a hole where someone jumps in, and a TNT cannon launches them into the sky, I’m crafting a unique action scene. This leads me to consider the logistics of such an outdoor event with a touch of adrenaline.  Crafting the scene  I’m channeling the creative direction, focusing on designing a user-friendly gameplay environment with clear objectives and tasks. This ensures players understand their goals and responsibilities effectively.  Crafting the adventure  I’m considering a carefully crafted adventure, ensuring obstacles are negotiation-friendly. The goal is a stimulating yet achievable challenge, with a clear direction for guidance.  Mapping the adventure  I’m piecing together a one-level game to satisfy the user's quirky request. Incorporating TNT cannons and fire elements, with simultaneous character actions, creates a smoothly integrated experience.  Crafting the level  I'm considering a level with multiple TNT bursts and fire elements. Ensuring clarity and simplicity through color-coding and labels is crucial.  Enhancing the experience  Adding dynamic lighting and smoke effects can vividly illustrate the movement from the hole to the sky, making the scene more immersive and dramatic.  To create a TNT cannon that launches you sky high after jumping into a hole, you’ll need to modify the TNT cannon setup so that the player stands in a pit and is launched upwards when the TNT explodes beneath them. Here’s a step-by-step guide to build this setup:  Materials Needed: 8 Blocks (any solid block) 4 Dispensers 1 Button 1 Redstone (or more depending on the length of the circuit) 1 Water Bucket 4 TNT (or more) 1 Slab (optional, to prevent the TNT from floating away) 1 Shovel (for digging the hole) Optional: Armor Stand (to test before launching yourself) Step-by-Step Instructions: 1. Dig the hole: Dig a 2x2 hole (or deeper if you prefer) where you want to jump into. This hole should be at least 2 blocks deep, but you can make it deeper if you want to add more space for yourself. 2. Build the TNT cannon frame: Around the hole, place 8 solid blocks in a shape that leaves space for you to stand. The goal is to build a circular or rectangular structure around the hole to hold the dispensers. 3. Place the dispensers: Place 3 dispensers on the blocks around the hole, facing downward (into the hole). These dispensers will hold TNT and provide the explosion force to launch you. Place a 4th dispenser in a corner, facing upward, where you can place the TNT that will be used to launch you. 4. Set up water: Place water at the bottom of the hole (in the center or one of the corners, depending on where the dispensers are). The water will prevent the TNT from exploding prematurely, giving you a safe setup. 5. Place the TNT: Place 1 TNT in each of the dispensers facing downward (the 3 dispensers around the hole). Place 1 TNT in the upward-facing dispenser (the one at the end). 6. Wire up the redstone: Place redstone along the blocks, connecting all the dispensers. Ensure the redstone connects to each dispenser and reaches the button. 7. Add the button: Place a button on one of the blocks near the redstone circuit. The button will be used to activate the TNT dispensers and trigger the cannon. 8. Test the cannon: Stand in the hole and prepare to jump into the center. Press the button to activate the dispensers. As the TNT explodes beneath you, the force will launch you sky-high. How It Works: When the button is pressed, the dispensers activate and fire TNT toward the center of the hole. The explosion occurs under your feet, and the blast force propels you up into the sky, using the TNT blast as a launch mechanism. Extra Tips: Safety: Ensure you’re standing in the center of the hole, as being too close to the TNT can cause you to take damage. You may want to use armor for protection. Timing: The TNT should be timed so that it explodes right as you’re jumping, ensuring maximum height. Extra Power: You can increase the number of TNT blocks in the dispensers to increase the power of the blast. Optional (For Testing): You can place an armor stand in the hole before you test it to ensure everything works smoothly without risking damage to yourself first. This setup should launch you sky-high when the TNT explodes beneath you! Let me know if you need any further details or if you want to adjust the design.
please challenge o1 or o3 mini.
Only under water Redstone in bedrock edition
most these AIs probably just get a transcript of a bunch of random minecraft redstone videos and try to draw patterns betweens the videos so you get a bunch of random garbage
Google
I made a tnt cannon so powerful the tnt teleported
These "Ai" are still just akinators with bigger data sets.  Not true ai, if we're going by the definition.
your pastebin link in the description doesn't work btw :)
Discord won because he wanted to create a functioal restone door and it actually went the way!
"AI will take over the world!" Also AI:
The winners of each  TNT Cannon: Google Minecart Station: Bing 2x2 Door: Discord
1:37  "We would love to see how you EDGE" moment
7:04 i didnt know nile red also was in train stations
Grok is superior
1 years
google bard is gemini ai
Nah bro discord clyde totally wins. He made the redstone door no mistakes despite failing the first 2 rounds
2:05 Bro thought it was FL Studio lmaoo 🤣
I read "Nigel" wrong 7:04
Tylko ludzie z Polski zrozumieją co  oznacza jeb door
Don't forget meta ai
7:03 took a dark turn there
Discord bot He was the only one who literally did anything
Love how purplers said "Make me a tnt cannon" and "Make me a minecart station" rather than "Can you tell me the instructions to making a tnt canon/minecart station in minecraft"  😀
BRO AI IS NOT IDIOT, YOU DO IT WRONG, but snapchat and discord is really idiot ai 😊
3:03 You can add repeters in water at minecraft badrock edition
The discord Clyde ‘Smiley Face’ got me rolling
Do you mean levers
his idea hahahahahhhhahahahahhahahahahaaahahhahahahahghahahahahaaaaaaaaaahhahahahahhahahaghahahahahhahhaahahhahahhhhhhhhhhhhhahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhahhhhhhhhhhahhaahhahahhaahhahahahh  0:28
You need to try gemini now. Its MUCH better than bard.
I don’t know if I can take no more. I think I’m gonna start a fight. I’m going to start. I make it alone. I don’t wanna see you out the door, baby blah bye-bye want to be a fool for you. I’m just another player in your game to do do you may hate me, but it ain’t no lie, baby blah bye-bye
I think discord one
Discord won because it made a perfect 2x2 piston door Press if you agree:👇
Jeb door? More like Wall-E
I asked chatgpt to make 2x2 door too and it told me to face the repeaters directly into the torches 💀
*:SMILEY FACE:*
😮
ChatGPT is stupid’s
Not even 2 mins and I'm layghing my ass off, amazing video idea dude
1:36 or skype
I can’t believe you waited till the end of time to drop this vid. Real hard working content creator right here guys.
chatgpt made an actual functioning door for me
Feels like someone who doesn't like AI making a video to hate on AI. I gurantee with the right prompts you could get a good redstone tutorial
This is skills
I wonder if asking for guidance rather than a build from the get go would have rendered Discord more useful 🤔
Dead yourube links
5:27 u have to click button !
Fancy launch with Google well you need to be in Java to do that
Google wins beccause Gemini is my assistant so i would support him
3:18 well at least it was honest about it and didn’t make something that makes no sense
Discord was the only one that made one so discord
Bard 1 pooint  Bing 1 point  Discord 1 point  so 3 way tie
it would be interesting if you could get the AI to type in all of the coordinates they want blocks placed tho that’d probably be way too tedious to be worth
You gotta say to discord can you tell me HOW to make a Minecraft tnt cannon
1:36 It looks like it's circling the google sign
smily faceee😀
Ypu should have told the  clyde and snapchat to give you instructions
10:50 HOW IS THE REDSTONE REACHING THE SECOND PISTON
You know i hate u now bc u know but u don't do
Whats the seed at the beginning?
Discord won. Congrats discord !
999+ missed calls from Mumbo Jumbo
Why why I use Microsoft edge!!!!
I like how you say least worst and not best 😂😂😂
12:22
Make the station with google genimi
VAN GOTH!!!!?????
I think the Google ai was for bedrock
If i calculate... All others got 0,0,0 and discord 0,0,1
I almost needed to go to the doctor of all laughs 😂😂😂😂
5:05 I think what chatgpt meant is that he wanted you to put the redstone torch on a block and have redstone turn it on and off.
7:04 NILE RED COPY?
10:30 legendary moment
Do the opera ai
google wants you to play on bedrock
I think…..🫥
Discord🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Discord🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Ismmaaaaalllieeeee facw
its a stalemate between bing and discord  0-1-1-X
0:27 hamter
😮Redstone
I think you should say Tip for (whatever you're asking) for discord
For the discord bot you should Type:"Give me the insctructions to make a ..."
You
Why did it say microsoft bich
Ma you should’ve asked the bots what they meant when you didn’t understand them. That would’ve still been funny
What the fu
Discord
Clyde definetly cooked
0:28 WHHHHHYYYYYY MR HAMTER!!!!!
Bro you you did the other two wrong for the piston door and discord right how it wanted it.
4:43
Discord won, he was the only one who could describe an actual mechanism. Not only it, but in all the other rounds, he didn't try to teach something he doesn't know how to do.
10:54 FINALLY
For the redstone on google it wants the water in the ground probably instead of next to it
No but seriously, add some automation.
Discord
S M I L E Y  F A C E
1:38 is very evil
[07:05] no but he sells emeralds for 24 tickets
I thought google had Gemini? Why is it named Bard now?
Bing chat's cannon wasn't fake it was real you just have to place the blocks in different order
PURPLERS. You were wrong about some of the AI. If you just say "Can you teach me how to build redstone" IT WILL DO IT. It just thinks you want it to "Play" Minecraft, Not "Teach" you how to play Minecraft.
I love how discord could Redeem his self😊😊❤
Coastal impressions able to do the last one discord
Why discord and snapchat? Copilot for example would be more interesting
What
Discord won 😊
Discord
google or discord
7:10 why u have that sword 😂 is it for Nigel
Your on java thats why you can't place lever in water, bedrock can do that😎
I thought Google had Gemini.
Chatgpt also cannot tell you how many "r"s in strawberry are.
discord won because the ai didn't like chat gpt wahhahahwah
why do everyone hate Microsoft Edge  its my main browser i use it every day  yeah i am 9   but i still dont understand  i actually started using Microsoft Edge because when Pizza Tower was popular i was trying to download sugary spire leaked build but when i tried to download it on Google it said that it will be downloading this for 3 years so i started using edge and i downloaded it on edge  yeah
Discord. all the others did bad but they work still bad tho. but discord redeamed itself at the end and made it perfect. so i say discord wins.
why does youtube say any more and not just anymore?
I slowed down the spinning smiley face to .25 it was really slow
Give me your server link
Why do you sound like kurzgesagt
Discord won because of the 2x2 door
Ive got 0.2
Ngl Bing had something with the tnt launcher,if you move the dispenser a bit and put a slime block so the slime block is pushed by the sticky piston,the tnt that comes out of the dispenser could be pushed
Mine is copilot
Hey purplers my name is Clyde
Your telling the discord ai to make a redstone thing but the ai thinks you want the ai to play but you want to know how to build it dummy
Put 2
Def discord cus of the final round
Discord cooked last round.
Discord😊😊😊😊
u didnt even properly follow the steps for some of them like in the last one you just started making a piston door instead of EXACTLY following what it said like with the other ones
Didn't You Get Meta In Messenger?
Rip clyde bot
Guys why do these chapters exist
actually for google its fricking gemni and it sucks google could of done better
9:02 how the hell did it get powered
Snapchat loser cheater
3:19 rip clyde the AI in discord because he was deleted
Nobody won because the universe ended before the video was completed
No one lol
RIP Clyde 😭
Absolutely, discord is the winner
Bot
clyde
Hmmmm
OBVIOUSLY DISCORD
I could make a mine cart move automatically 😂
Poop poop poop
Now they are : Gemini and CoPilot time is flying😢
Try copilot
you couldn't build both the chat gpt and google doors...
Why does purplers sound like an AI voice
Discord the goat
Great video, although during the piston door, you kinda messed up with the instructions.
Discord discord discord!!! 👾👾👾
I think it’s Google,Google,discord
1:27  foreshadowing

he said bart station 7:12
OMG g
yeah idk. Ai asked for a 2x2 square and you placed them like a hole. The Ai doesnt mean 2x2 air still you did it. I feel like one of the ais from earlier wouldve done it if you wouldnt have had the skill issue
It's kind of hard to judge these without seeing the prompts   Depending on how your prompt is worded Google could have absolutely beaten out the others for the rail station, because if you were asking for something to send you then it clearly missed, but if you are just asking to make a rail station that's about as accurate as you can get
0:17 its geminj not bart

7:20 google likes build hacks

1:37  MICROSOFT EDGE👹👹
Discord won cause it’s the only one that worked
Discord won. ChatGPT and Bing both gave 1 of 3 builds barely working while discord has one of 3 builds actually working. Stats issue.
you sound like the narrator from stanley parable ultra deluxe
u could have used a little more common sense
discord is the guy who doesnt show up to class for the entire year but when he does, he's the coolest one
look im being honest its gotta be discord bot but also give google a designation award XD
1:38 the way he said Microsoft edge💀
Everything right but the slime block because you have to put it with the sticky piston not over it then you put the TNT and light it 1:40
1:25 💀
Discord because it was the only one that did one bite but the two failures I tried it in that updated I feel like because it won’t let me do it
if you tried out microsofts copilot they would get everything right i know this bc i had help from them and they do so good
spoiler warning!!!
Rip red strone brain 0:28
7:04 NIgel💀
Discord understood that you were telling me to build it and play with it, but you were actually supposed to show him how to do it. I think Discord won
Brad is now called Gemmi
Clyde definitely did the job. It perfectly described a 2x2 piston door, and it works properly. 10/10 for the discord AI named Clyde.

7:03 8 thought it was something else…
when i saw nig for nigel, i got excited
Obviously the google one was meant to be built in bedrock since repeaters and levers aren't destroyed by water in that version.
What about Gemini?
1:00 Is that the Tomodachi life music in the background?
im the discord bot
I Thingk that Chat  GPT Wan

Bing seemed to be on the right track for a slime block type cannon, but wasn't descriptive enough.   Google seemed to be onto something with the traditional cannon designs, but made critical mistakes and also wasn't descriptive enough.  You did kinda cheat for the discord piston door because you used a lot of interpretation which you didn't for some of the other vague instructions, tho this is probably just for comedic effect which I could understand. To be fair, trying to further interpret the other instructions for the other builds probably wouldn't have much better results tho.
The hamster😂😂😂😂😂
I saw him on a game 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊 😊😊😊😊😊 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
Discordy wined
Discord because who use tnt to explode stuff and who need rail when you can travel with boat and on land elightrer
If you told tell how to make it or give steps to make it then it would give i think discord wins
2:24 A pretty good spam-clock (for machineguns for example...) but please don't put TNT into this dispenser... it can be... very not good.
i think discord clyed wins cuz it was the only ai that got redstone corect
Sure! Making a TNT cannon in Minecraft is a fun project. Here’s a step-by-step guide:  ### Materials Needed: - TNT (at least 4 blocks) - Water Bucket - Building Blocks (like stone or dirt) - Redstone Dust - Redstone Torch or Lever  ### Steps to Build a Basic TNT Cannon:  1. Build the Base:    - Place a row of 5 blocks in a straight line. This will be the base of your cannon.  2. Add the Water:    - On one end of the row, dig one block down and place a water source block. The water will prevent the TNT from exploding prematurely.  3. Place the TNT:    - On the opposite end of the water, place 2 blocks of TNT on top of the base blocks.  4. Add More TNT:    - On the side of the TNT that is facing away from the water, place one more block of TNT on top of the base.  5. Set Up the Redstone:    - Place a redstone torch or lever next to the TNT block that’s on the side. Then, connect redstone dust from the torch/lever to the TNT blocks.  6. Ignite the Cannon:    - Activate the redstone torch or lever to ignite the TNT. The TNT closest to the water will explode first, launching the TNT on the opposite end into the air.  ### Tips: - Make sure you’re at a safe distance when you activate the cannon. - You can adjust the number of TNT blocks for more power, but be cautious as it can cause more destruction.  And that’s it! You’ve built a TNT cannon in Minecraft. Have fun experimenting with it! That’s what my Snapchat ai said to me
I get chat gpts redstone door the pistons where pushing the blocks on the side and they were the doors
😊
diskord
Maybe you need to specify to the discord bot for a blueprint
Bing can actually be run in chrome . Just go in settings, search engine and change it to bing (:
why.  XD Bing 1:45 was just too funny
0:28 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
10:44 i just love me and bros life and reaction
the issue with discord and snapchat is that you weren't asking them to design redstone. you were asking them to play the game.
I asked Snapchat ai to give me steps to build a tnt cannon and it said to put 2 redstone dust on one block 💀
Super funny video! Made me laugh a lot. 1+ sub!
😊
0:27 oh that was a twist... 💀💀💀
W discord
Well Discord has the only ai that build at least Something that works and don't want to place irrelevant Blocks. so thats definitly the winner to me.
just rephrase your question for clyde like "what are some tips" and he'd win right away honestly
Now try, Openai (THe makers of chatGPT) now have new models like gpt4o and o1
im using edge for all the time. even this comment comes from edge. MICROSOFT EDGE >:DDDD
The reason discord didnt answer for the other rounds was bcuz clyde thought you are asking him to play minecraft to make redstone, he didnt know that you are asking for tips on how to make redstone
I think discord won because its the only one that madea working device
What about Microsoft copilot?
Bro my name is there Nigel
Fun Fact: Did you know that you can use copilot in chrome?
who the fuck is van goff?
2:50 only works on bedrock
Bing ai works if you ll place tnt by yourself continuously (раздатчик (translate from russian) will use flint and steel on it and youll be blown up
Google did not beat discord
discord won
now do opera aria ai
The winner was obviously the Snapchat bot
For me the llm hype is over. Llms can do language and nothing else.
for some reason chatgpt makes up most shi... maybe along with gemini :3
I think it means 1 block per space
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂.
Pretty obvious that it doesn’t know what a Minecraft is.
Final round, and discord because its the only one who got ANYTHING correct.
2:47 2:57 i'm pretty sure on bedrock the repeaters nor the levers break
This makes no sense
Discod
2:27 you’re supposed to put TNT in it￼
Wait, the first one actually did
10:14 please
Discord wins
WHAT THE HAMSTER
Zombey bist du‘s 😂
🤧i think discord win with the last build 🤧
Btw snap Ai knows knows how to do it now
Clyde cause it did the right thing and the others didnt
*Round 1* 1. Bard 2. ChatGPT 3. Ping Chat 4&5. Clyde & My AI *Round 2* 1. Ping Chat 2. Bard 3. ChatGPT 4&5. Clyde & My AI *Round 3* 1. Clyde 2. Ping Chat 3&4. ChatGPT & Bard 5. My AI *OVERALL* 1. ChatGPT & Bard 2. Ping Chat 3. Clyde  4. My AI
Discord wins he literally built the one number thing and it’s a piston door
i feel like google bard won?
Let's count the points:  • • • (-1=Fail, 0=Something but wrong, 0.5=Kind of Correct, 1=Correct, 3=Start) GPT 3+(0+0+0)=3 Bing 3+(0+0+0)=3 Edge 3+|-1+|-1+2)=3 Snap 3+|-1+|-1|+|-1=0 Bard 3+0.5+0.5+0=4 Final Standings: ChatGPT: 3 points Bing: 3 points Microsoft Edge: 3 points Snapchat: 0 points Google: 4 points     [So Google wins!]
"Then once the unvierse has ended" got mt laughing
Discord won in my opinion
You worded it wrong, you should say tell me how to make a tnt cannon in Minecraft
I think when they mean inwards I think they mean like not a facing together so close maybe like a 2 block gap or smth
I’m going to do this round by round thinking with who won it round so for the first round Google one because it actually flew to Canada in the second round I will give it to Google again I love the artistic design and it was correct it did look like a whale world and for the final one it’s the discord one I’m missing you cannot be the party possibly made until I took two best and I can barely make it to buy two and I can barely I can’t even make when its self can give you tips to make one
How do you make it❤❤❤
I think the bing wants you to put a tnt into the dispenser
"add some automation" lmao
your interpreting them wrong they are just saying to do what ever the hell you want
Clyde. Reason: Only AI who actually got it right XD
Snapchat bot win 😂😂😂
1:39  ew
“I had to use world edit to make a floating repeater” 💀💀
My name is nigel😅😅
I’d say Clyde won for being the only one to make anything truly functional.
.
Think discord for the last one
DEISCORD
IM DYING IN LAUGHTER
Ask discord for instructions and it will win for sure
alll of that sentence make sense? 9:11
0:28 poor hamster.
11:07
Drink court
He’s just being sarcastic at the first bit of the first TNT launcher😅😅😅😅
No, it’s just didn’t explode anything that’s why you thought. It just passed it off. No no no.
i love dumb people
Clide
I see nothing to support the idea that one of the doors is named Jeb and I am very disappointed
Creators of every AI: What an idiot...
That hampster fail made my day man
Discord wins
clyde definitely won. of the 2 results that worked at all (being google tnt cannon and well, clydes masterpiece door) only one of them was efficient, and guaranteed to work. he won because he was the only ai that could actually make a functional door
9:56 I think that’s meant to be a top down map
I don't understand why people trust AI to do literally anything even slightly important when, more often than not, what it gives you either doesn't work, provides instructions that make no sense, or sometimes even directly contradict eachother.
That's what you get when the AI tries to learn how to use Redstone by reading all the articles about Redstone of people who have no flippin' clue how to use it... 😭
11:11 I think that I won💀
0:10 me too lol
0:21 PFFFFT
Random guy : AI is gonna take over the world  The AI in question :
1:38 Wait DID HE JUST SWEAR?
computers suck
Bro when i ask snapchat ai to give step by step tutorial how to build TNT Cannon it give me but it was strange
so cooooooooooooool
You are an ai voice
Discord's chatbot is obviously set up to take propts way too literally so it just responds with "no silly. As an AI I can not play Minecraft" and it just refuses to interpret the prompt as "can you describe how to do this in Minecraft".
Idk about you but Snapchat just gave me a step by step tnt canon and it worked perfectly
Discord is the one that wins because it’s the only one that has made a single actually functional device
Well, you’re doing it wrong the ChatGPT train draft. It means to do it. It didn’t accidentally backwards you you put only one Redstone torch away from the first powered rail, and then Redstone going to the power rail turning with the repeater if you need one hitting the other one hitting the other one hitting the other one and then the button near the Redstone torch to deactivate it and activate it OK
I HATE THIS VIDEO!!!!!!!!!
Bing Chat excels in Minecraft, but the issue lies in structuring prompts. Instead of asking for assistance, ask for a step-by-step guide. The Clyde AI created a functional piston door, which is impressive. The AI's ability to admit when it doesn't have the answer is more valuable than getting it wrong. Discord bot wins because it doesn't claim to know how to do something it doesn't know, and when it does, it gets it right. Accuracy over quantity is always important. Bard's answer to the redstone question is impressive, as a Minecraft builder who has never touched redstone in his life.
It's mee 😭
7:04 I thought you would name him with the n-word 😅
5:12 im pretty sure it meant to tell you to put a button on the start/end of the train track. if you place a minecart there, sit in it and press the button it should make you go forward
Discord 100%
Team diskot
As successful as the recent space x launch💀💀
tbh discord because you forgot to say can you give me tips
Bing chat is copilot now
Discord had the potential to obliterate all the other AI's
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT SKIN
Its Called Saving The Best For Last.
Now I know how to make a 2x2 piston door 😊 You’ve earned a sub 👍
discord. It remained humble and came through 1/3 times, which is more than 0/3 times.
discord clide won
In Google he meant place one in the ground but ai is so dimb
Last one was st@ged
Like this comment if discord won 🏆  I think u should give it to discord
i think snapchat won
Copilot is like, extremely creative and will try to give you the best answer possible
WHAT ABOUT COPILOT
So basically the tnt cannon one , its trying to use the slime block for making the tnt go far like a tnt slime cannon
It’s not that the ai s r dumb , its juts that ur reading it wrong (no hate intended)
My name is Clyde 😲
Discord BC it got it right but everything else was just close or didn't know how
t explained them bad
Discord won
U gut a pisten u place 5 rails in front of piston u place a lever on pisten then use the lever then boom 5:38
I use a Gemini
Discord won, since it actually made something that worked properly.
Discord won 🥇 they didn’t know that you want them to explain it they thought you wanted them to actually build
How is AI supposed take over the world if it can’t handle Redstone
Did you know that Google Bard is now Gemini
Discord wins beacuse the other AI got everything wrong
At the end I really thought discord would not do it
I hate how everyone is calling these applications a.i.  that is technically the wrong name for them...  These are finally tuned advanced neural network algorithms comprising 10s of multiples terabytes of sample data.  A.i. is fundamentally as it possesses quality's beyond simply churning text input and text sample info into an expected response...  Chatgpt and all those other "A.I."s don't comprehend what they are saying, they simply are checking if the randomly generated answer they give is comparable with their expected result to the question.  So... The answers they are giving are all correct and well made since they are the expected literary result... It literally doesn't care if it's functionality at all...  A real a.i. would crush this
He didn't even say which one is the best he said which one is the least worst😂😂😂
8:56   my FAVOURITE
8:51 - 11:15 made me laugh
You should have asked GLaDOS.
discord won only because is the only one who works
U need to type help i test in Snapchat and worked so
I think discord
What were you asking the ai? were you asking THEM to make it, or were you asking them HOW to make it, because there is a big difference
I have Copilot
tomodachi life music is so nostalgic
cheese
To see that discords ai finally helped you make a red stone door I’m impressed
Ah Clyde, your bad SKIL ISSUE!!!
Discord 1st  bing 2nd  google 3rd  snap 4th \/
You forgot WhatsApps ai called meta wi
2:05 "add some blood" not automation
That is lame, TNT cannons my end, crystal cannon made my whole flatland world into a bunch of holes
7:40 man insane!
Purplers: Can u make a tnt cannon in minceraft java edition?? My AI: im not really good at minceraft; but i can find a tutorial fou u! 😊 Purplers: 😡 u are disqualified!!!
The one before discord is your fault, ur using java
I was summoned
Hi
Discor wined
OBVUOUSLY SNAPNAP WHAT SO EASY CHEEZY
tell me why TELL ME WHY I laughed so hard 0:28
Bro is just building it wrong😂
“That was about as successful as the recent Space-X launch” got me dying 😂
Bruh the chat gpt and bing in last round  [][]    [][] Pistons  What you doing  [][][][] Pistons  BRUH!!!!
Discord wins
Discorddddddddddddddddddddd
discord was horrible but still was the only redstone that works so i think i should win
Rip Clyde the discord bot 😭
Discord was the only one to make a proper functioning machine
Your supposed to be in bedrock
Google: i should add a new chatbot *adds a chatbot called gemini* ahhh yes perfect
You have a wonderful voice
2:49 its probably for bedrock
Discord won, as the only ai that build working redstone contraption
discord wins!!!
I remember
Heh
Clyde wasn’t the hero we deserved… he was the hero we needed

Thank you
OK
kinda ironic that the Jeb-Door.....doesnt work
nige...l💀💀
The redstone torch was it really out Minecraft April fools event wasn't lying what they were going to add 😳
When you were going to the next one and you're building that was it out 😳
First Round Winner is Bard ( The TNT Launched ) Second Round Winner is Bard ( You said Train Station not Train using Minecarts ) Third Round Winner is Clyde ( Only Working Door )
W discord for redeeming himself
DISCORD BOT SHOWED HES TRUE POWER LOL🎉🎉🎉🎉
ngl in the bing one, the prolly couldve worked for 1st one if it had tnt
Discord won last round
Discord
Discord just dominated the last round so discord probably wins cause google bingchat and chatgpt  and snapchat probably got a 0 out of 10
2:47 you should’ve specified Java this would work in bedrock edition
you can use bing chat enabler to run bing chat in other browsers

Google on the second one for design, discord for quality or quantity.
Discord
What press the button?
ai is dumb as a rock
🙂  -Clyde
Discord bot just thought you wanted it to go in game and make a redstone build. It can easily explain and teach you. But not show you.
there is another ai you can use called deepai witch i use all the time and i think you should use it for this series
btw the youtube auto chapter bot, made the first chaoter called "place the piston like this"
Place the dispenser facing upwards now place a block next to the left repeater now add a sticky piston on top off that block u placed add a slime block in front of that sticky piston now place a another sticky piston in front of the right repeater now place a slime block on top of that sticky piston
lel
discord all of then didnt work but discord was the only one that had something that worked
discord tought me hot to make a 2X2 door
I think chat gpt won
Discord wins😁
those ai:i dont use this me:🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿
Google and discord tied tbh
Bing was assuming you already had a track and you just wanted to make a station
Discord
ITS VAN GOGH
Hello wat did i do
discort cooked with last one
The discord bot thought you meant for it to play the game for you and to make it💀
Me
TronicGpt7 > Chatgpt, Bing, Bard, Clyde and SnapchatAi 😎
when u named the villiager at the train station i saw nige. . .  .L phew nigel what a releif
10:25
9:15 was just to funny😂😂😂
DISCORD WINS NO QUESTIONS ASKED!
Random 7:27
Im not good at redstone but i can do better than this so far 3:12
Bro didn,t do compelete tasks what chat GPT said😂 in round 2
that's the most perfect tie ive ever seen
you should make a vido like this but if it where your testing the new gemini AI for redstone
*S M I L E Y F A C E*
First, Google one works in bedrock edition
I don't know why you are using Bing, it just ChatGPT with a few extra steps, literally it is the same training data and code as ChatGPT.
I think Microsoft was actually the best one but you just did it wrong its the tnt cannon but without water
Winners ( According to me ) 1 Google 2 Bing 3 Discord
911: whats your emergency Me: my own build is flipping me off 0:58
AI now: 😭🫱    📱  AI later in the decade: 🤓🤓🤓
Discord bot wins
The problem is you need to be very specific, to the point where you could easily bu8ld one yourself. You need to make them understand the logic of each redstone piece and how things interact with it. Im trying to make a dmg calculator for fallout and since idk python i need gpts help, but it doesnt know shit other than python stuff so i need to define the logic for everything
🗿 7:51 🗿
*Physics breaking intensifies*
Discord wins because he the only one who made something work
No offense but you sound like ai
at 8:58 you dig the hole wrong it meant to dig it 2 blocks long 3 blocks wide and 2 blocks down not what you did you clearly see 2 by 3 by 2
I aint sellin no tickets, get ur own 6:58
Can we see an updated video? I just asked my snap ai how to make one and it gave some instructions (I didn’t read) with materials. I think you may have just asked it wrong?
He did not give them a chance 😂
Microsoft edge worked for me beacuse i READ IT
I feel like the reason why discord refused to answer was because you asked the wrong question, you asked it to build the door for you, not explain how it would build that door, and the Discord AI being truthfully, said that he can't
1:56
Snapchat won
7:23 I think the reason it made you use powered rails is because it slows down the train/minecart so it will use it the same way a regular station would, to slow them down to allow passengers to enter and exit.
Land 💀
The bing actually just made a tnt launcher as to launch tnt next to it
You sound like snappy
Hai
I was about to let ai build my library but now thst i have seen this video... YEahhh no
Cool, now make A.I in Minecraft 💀
Well maybe ask the discord and Snapchat about “can u help me upon making a red stone door in minecraft?” Instead of saying “can u make me a red stone door in minecraft”
8:56 dementia:
DISCORD WON!!!!
I THOUGHT GOOGLE HAD A GEMINI
this vid has 3/8k dislikes
0:27 0:28 hahahahaahhqahahahah
1:38 So we have to use MICROSOFT EDGE!  👿🔥
1:38 ɱɪ̈ɕɾøʂøʄɬ ɛðʛɛ
this shows A.I is described better than it actually is
Discord Clyde won because even if he didn't succeed in the first 2, he is the only construction that works well
For tnt cannon I thought it would not get worse then bing I was wron
7:57 it said 2x3 you did 3x2😂 but it still got it wrong
so we don’t know what a 2x3 is anymore?
“now it’s google butts turn” 6:25
Discord, for the amazing comeback
I think either google or discord won
Discord won
The Secend tnt canon just needed tnt in the dispenser
I think discord qould win if you asked for STEPS
No one can agree that Snapchat is the winner and I agree with that discord is the obvious winner. It’s the only one that actually got it fully correct.
You suck at following instructions
R.I.P Clyde
Now whatsapp also has Mera AI😂
7:07 Nahh💀
Hey Purplers, I asked Bing chat how to make a Bedrock edition 2x2 piston door and it actually got it right. You should probably check that out!
Discord because it was the only one to do what was asked cause nothing else actually worked In the right way
I think the query you used could be why Discord Clyde bot didn't work. Asking to make instructions might've worked, but saying to build one would imply the bot has to physically play minecraft, which it can't do.
Facing ji ai chat
My name is nigel how did you nkow
Discord won, didn’t lie or act like it knew what it was talking about…until it knew what it was talking about
I thought people said redstone was getting smarter😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
That last rounds gave me goose bump when it was discord
I think Google wins just because of it's door.
I honestly thought Microsoft would do better
Was he asking the AI to build one themselves, or was he asking them to TELL him how to build it? Because if he asked them to build one themselves, that would explain why discord kept getting confused
Google AI just turned into a zodiac sign
I think discord wins because if the question was worded differently it might have done better in the first two rounds.
L human
The google one was human error
3:13 in bedrock the repeater would have stayed. Changed nothing, but stayed
👾
discord definetly wins
Ang pangit😂😂😂
4:49
4:49
Naw its all good
DISCORDDD
discord won. was 100% honest about it when it had no idea, and delivered a perfect build when it did know what to do. the others only made big bogus.
discord bot have a high intelligence but looks like he not appreciate to use them
If u haven't done make Mario
This vid was posted on my bday last year
Clyde ;-;
WhatsApp also made a assistant just update it
The 2th is for bedrock
i should take this video and put in a tictok video on the top with subway sufers down
next time you should ask how to make one intead of telling the them to make one
funny but hes trying to misunderstand them
it said 2x3 not 3x2
9:06 How to basic cooking ahh tutorial
Bing chat is basically just that one owl meme that goes “step 1. Draw 2 circles Step 2. Draw the rest of the fucking owl”
This is the power of AI, and big companies are investing in AI, but sometimes, AI looks like this showed in video.
3:03 needs to be in bedrock
Why don't you just ask for the tutorial to the dicord ai?
discord
It’s actually not very good at anything. This is just a stupid capitalist bubble that will pop once people realize that all AI does is predict, not comprehend.
GPT had the station right you need to place the button next to a powered rail and press the button when the minecart is on it
I think you asked it to build it in the game What you need to ask is for it to give you instructions on how to do it
Discort is thebest
Hello from the bathroom
I bet IT meant like    ⬜⬜⬜                              ⬜.             ⬜                              ⬜.             ⬜
the villagers name was to close to the nword
am new on yputube
0:55 ok, lemme just say it, i think chatgpt means to fill the space with 1 type of block
Smily face 😊
Because I have TNT brain when I’m in Minecraft
What did you just say? Redstone brain instead of TNT brain
ai is going to take over the world!!!!      also ai...
DISCORD
Bro what is liver 😭🙏 it's called Lever 😭
7:07   “Goddamnit Nigel” Got me dead 💀
Snap chat won💀💀💀
Bro never asked the discord ai to give instructions just to build it lol
2:11 "add some automation" is a redstoners equivalent of a builder telling you to "add a little bit of detail"
One ai name is clyde my middle name is clyde 0_0
i think that mumbojumbowon
I love how this shows that LLMs are just overgrown autocorrect implementations.
these things were so easy but AI makes them harder with useless stuff
You probably didnt spesify that you need instirductions not outright playing the game itself so discord and the other one that i forgor didnt rought of giving instruducitons
Win
Discord
😀
discord😀😀😀😺😺😺😺
I get the 1st one it  pushes it away and then you go in
Legends say he is still placing sticky pistons😂
Snapchat 100%
im sorry i cannot create a 2x2 piston door, but if you need tips on how to make a 2x2 piston door...
of course. The winner is obvious… Snapchat’s “My AI”
Bc you should  know where it not like we  have 0 iq
discord
Discord won🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Discord
Smiley face ☺☺😊😊😀😀😁😁😄😄
Me
Don't have ai because someone might hack
Not me
The explanation of discord on the 2x2 door was vague and you gifted him the space between the pistons, since he said the same as the others
Your voise sounds like tts
dc is the winer
Discord cuz the build worked
you asked the ai the wrong questions you should have asked discord on instructions on how to perform an task
You're just asking the wrong question to the bot. You need to ask for tips to make a [INSERT BUILD HERE]
Google has a new ai called Gemini
S M I L E Y  F A C E
Now google bard has gemini new name for bard andd google assistant not another bard name of google assistant
maybe tell discord to give you instructions on how to build one because to me it sounds like you are trying to get it to hop on Minecraft and build one for you, same for snapchat
No hablo ingles 😞
This dudes inability to follow instructions is kind of annoying
For the discord just ask him to tell you the steps
Bro literally asked snapchat and discord ai to create one for him and not how to create one (i am saying one instead of each individual build)
the winner to the video is either, Google or Discord
The "MICROSOFT EDGE!👹👹" got me dying🤣🤣🤣

this video infuriates me, the way you worded it made the clyde bot think you want it to phsically join and make it itself. it wouldve been better if you were to say something like "tell me how to make this machine".
For snapchat ask for instructions on how to
Nice google would make train station
Discord is the tortoise of this race. It made the only thing that functioned right at the end
why u name da villiger my name😅
You miss understand them like you trying to bully a child
0:52 LEVER not “Leaver”
*press o to dismount💀💀💀*
the gpt door could work if you tweaked it, like those things with two doors in SCP games
Bing chat made the right cannon you built it wrong you had to put the dispenser then put the piston 3 and 1 block behind then put a slime block in front of the sticky piston and put tnt in the dispenser and make a clock wired with piston and dispenser
IKOL AI can (its discord bot)
I think that discord is the winner, since it was the only one that gave a right answer, even if it failed the first two
Why the obisilly real how minecraft pls create the super firr sword in minecraft
Ai is still learning and since it hasn't really become a public thing until around 2020   Maybe we should wait until 2030 if not 2050 maybe you'll be so advanced that you won't even be able to tell us ai and you'll probably think it's a real person
0:27 NOOO THE HAMSER
Easy win for Clyde
☺
Snapchat: sorry but I’m useless in this video
The problem is you needed to ask it to teach you how, not to make it. Of course the AI can’t do it, but it can tell you how to.
Discord discord discord discord discord discord
I hate Snapchat ai, i would rather walk on lego then have it in Snapchat
CLYDE WON THAT
Discord definitely 💯👍like if you agree  👇😎👍
im on chrome and i have bing
It feels like I'm listening to an ai read other ai and doing they're actions in game
Discord one
L Nigel
I think the discord ai thought you were asking it to physically make it and not tell you on how to make it
I asked the snap AI to describe how to make a 2 by 2 piston door, and it worked immediatly. (The door didnt but the AI did tell me where to place blocks and redstone) justice for snap AI
You dont speak A.I 😢
Can u do me next I’m subbed
I think bing copilot won
APPLE does not have AI
8:04 it meant 3 (width) 2 (height)
That space ex one was personal😮
bard turned into gemini
I have an interesting info about IAs links :  They think their links works because they use their own database to store everything, and they have their own internet in their database, so when they give you a link, its a link from their own youtube stored inside their database, and so we can't access it.  To be honest, i know its not possible since youtube is huge, so i think its more like a blank copy of youtube in their database without any videos, and the links are just videos they created.
Whys ur name purpler when ur blue?
Why this hate against SpaceX ??😂
What About Telegram It Has Too AI
00:27 😭😭😭
Discord
I think Clyde was saying, “I basically can’t go out of discord, and I’m not gonna be like other AI and say I can build red stone even though I can’t.”
Mouse 0:27
Bro I'm pretty sure chatgpt was giving you some actual information, you just either didn't understand or ook it literally. 😂
At least it works. It’s not a TNT cannon but it actually works. 2:26
Messenger has Ai called meta ai
Hi!
im the 100k like lol
bro your the wrong one not ai
Google won 🎉🎉🥳🥳
Yesterday I made a tnt launcher that launches tnt 97 blocks up
My favorit was the station
Here’s a basic design for a simple launcher:  Materials Needed: Redstone dust Redstone repeaters Redstone torches Pistons Minecart Rails Building blocks (any material for the structure) Design Steps: 1. Building the Launch Platform Start by creating a platform where you want to launch the minecart from. This can be a flat area or a slightly elevated platform. 2. Redstone Circuitry Launch Mechanism: Place down a row of blocks where your minecart will sit. Underneath this row, place sticky pistons facing upwards. This will be the base of your launch mechanism.  Redstone Power: Wire redstone dust along the row of blocks where the pistons are placed. Ensure each piston has a redstone torch beside it, which will serve as the power source.  Timing and Delay: Use redstone repeaters to create a delay sequence. The timing can be adjusted by right-clicking on the repeaters. This delay will determine how quickly the pistons push the minecart.  3. Activation Mechanism Triggering the Launch: Create a redstone circuit that leads to the torches or directly powers the sticky pistons. This circuit can be activated by a lever, pressure plate, or a button, depending on how you want to initiate the launch. 4. Testing and Adjustments Place a minecart on the track and activate your redstone mechanism. Adjust the timing of the repeaters and the strength of the redstone signal until you achieve the desired launch distance. 5. Enhancements (Optional) Booster Rails: Consider adding powered rails on the track leading up to the launch mechanism to ensure the minecart has enough speed before it reaches the launching platform.  Multiple Launches: You can duplicate and stagger the launch platforms to create a sequence of launches if you want to launch multiple minecarts.  Tips: Redstone Signal Strength: Ensure your redstone signal is strong enough to activate all pistons simultaneously for a smooth launch.  Precision: Fine-tune the timing and spacing of your redstone repeaters to control the force and distance of the launch.  Safety: Build fences or barriers around your launch area to prevent accidents or interference from other players or mobs.  This basic design should give you a starting point for creating a Minecraft redstone machine that can launch minecarts really far. Experiment with different configurations and adjustments to achieve the best results!
😂😂😂😂
na soz just testing smth
fuck
They patched it up and all 1.21.0
Google won
Least worst 😂
considering that microsoft owns bing and minecraft, bing AI had to know how to do minecraft things
Bro doesn't get Ai grammar
4:10 I think it might be gamerzer
This is funny  😂😂😂😂😂
the fact that I use bing for some reason -_-
This is such a good vid! And I did read it all
7:05 "god damnit Nigel"
4:09 I remember dc2
4:09 I remember dcw
You missed a point for chat gpt because you didnt even test the mine cart ride by MOVING it
0:03 The fact that the AI thought he was correct
Hey what the fuck is wrong with Microsoft Edge
Duckduckgo has ai chat now
I'm sorry, as an ai language model, I don't have the ability to subscribe. Is there anything else I can assist you in?
I think what the Bing one ment was that the TNT would come out the dispenser then it would ignite by you then be launched by the piston
3:02  Google ai it's a bedrock redstone maker
Google. It made a tnt launcher and while the train station didn’t technically work It did look like on that would
Fun fact:TikTok has a new  ai called tako
here's the proof for you all. AI is nowhere near taking over humanity if it can't conceptualize something such as this.
Discord won because all of them got everything wrong but the discord one got one of right so discord won!
NACE
In theory, the bing chat one could work, it just doesnt know that you didnt immediately place the tnt in the dispenser, therefor, you could take that design, make it... better.. and it would work
chatgpt at the end 💀
10:20 Real way: put a 2x2 or 4x4 space in between two pillars of the block of your choice put sticky pistons  ON THE OUTSIDE of the pillars (if you know how to make it stove, you put that there yourself because I don’t know how) and that’s it!
10:20 you could’ve just asked for it to give you instructions instead of making it😂
Did you write make instead of design to the discord and snapchat bots?
Bro did not have to disqualify those ai just say "no I want you to give me instructions on making a TNT cannon.
7:03 I thought ur gonna name him the n word💀
Btw I'm Clyde  Edit:And i suck at redstones
i hate bing/microsoft edge, opra is best
This absolutely goes to Clyde, as you were incorrectly prompting him the whole time. A ChatBot needs to be told what you want it to do in a very specific way or else it may not be able to read you correctly.  Rest in Peace, Clyde, but instead of asking him to make it, ask him on how you would go about making it, see?
3:51 well, Redstone Master is a Minecraft channel, Also, it was great when you looked to find out Brickbuilder is a Lego channel
Google won
I think your prompt was at fault here. You could have used: « explain to me how to make… » rather than « create… »
8:57 that says 2 blocks wide 3 blocks long and 2  blocks deep… i think the human failed this one
e
Discord
7:56 go back to school bro. you did the complete opposite of 2x3🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
First time say my brother name
Why’d I get so happy when I seen Clyde was the only ai that actually got something that properly worked
Google's ai is now called Gemini
Personally i think i won that round
bing is the winner because round 1: bard was almost correct. round 2: bing sent the minecart away with redstone round 3: clyde/discord was correct! but the true winner is clyde!
Omg my name is nigel
Plot twist : this comment is AI generated
a funny alternate clip played in my head where when bingchat said to "add automation", you went to a page to download the Create Mod xd
clearly snapchat helped the most
Here is what chat GBT gave me for the proof of a 2x2 piston door. Seems a lot different from the video: Creating a 2x2 piston door in Minecraft involves using redstone, sticky pistons, and other materials to create a door that can open and close automatically. Here's a detailed step-by-step guide to help you build a 2x2 piston door.  ### Materials Needed: - 8 Sticky Pistons - 4 Pressure Plates (or 2 levers/buttons, if preferred) - Redstone Dust - Redstone Torches - Building Blocks (any type, for the door and structure) - Blocks to place Redstone on (any type, e.g., Stone, Dirt)  ### Step-by-Step Instructions:  #### Step 1: Prepare the Area 1. **Choose the Location**: Find a flat area where you want your door to be. Ensure there's enough space around it for the redstone circuitry. 2. **Dig a Trench**: Dig a 2-block deep, 2-block wide, and 4-block long trench. This will house some of the redstone wiring.  #### Step 2: Place the Sticky Pistons 1. **Front Pistons**:    - Place 2 sticky pistons on top of each other facing inwards on each side of the trench. These will push the door blocks into place.  2. **Side Pistons**:    - On each side of the front pistons, place 2 more sticky pistons facing each other. These will pull the door blocks back when activated.  #### Step 3: Install the Door Blocks 1. **Door Blocks**: Place the building blocks that will act as your door on the sticky pistons facing each other. You should have 4 blocks in total, forming a 2x2 door when the pistons are extended.  #### Step 4: Set Up the Redstone Circuitry 1. **Place Redstone Dust**:    - Lay redstone dust in the trench to connect the pistons together. The redstone dust should connect to both pairs of pistons on each side.  2. **Redstone Torches**:    - Place redstone torches on the blocks adjacent to the pistons in the trench. This will power the pistons, causing them to extend. You may need to place a block above the trench to lay redstone on, leading to the torches.  3. **Connect to Pressure Plates**:    - Place pressure plates in front of the door on both sides. Run redstone dust from the pressure plates to the trench, ensuring it connects to the redstone dust in the trench. This will create a circuit that powers the pistons when you step on the plates.  #### Step 5: Test the Door 1. **Testing**:    - Step on the pressure plates to see if the door opens. The pistons should retract, pulling the door blocks back and creating an opening.    - When you step off the pressure plates, the pistons should extend, pushing the door blocks back into place and closing the door.  #### Step 6: Conceal the Wiring 1. **Cover the Trench**:    - Use building blocks to cover up the trench and any exposed redstone wiring to make your door look neat and integrated into your build.  ### Optional: Using Levers or Buttons - If you prefer using levers or buttons instead of pressure plates, you can place them on the wall next to the door and run redstone wiring from the lever/button to the pistons in a similar manner.  By following these steps, you should have a functional 2x2 piston door that opens and closes automatically when you step on the pressure plates. Experiment with different designs and placements to suit your build style and enjoy your new redstone creation in Minecraft!

The google piston door was actually instructions for half of a piston door. The diagram at 9:54 is displaying all of the blocks top to bottom but in reality it’s trying to show it from an overhead view where the pressure plate is connected to a repeater which leads into red stone and powers the piston in front of it. As for the torches it could’ve been an incomplete way to connect the red stone to any top pistons but idk.
Second last Win It was so cool
Discord won cuz it did the only correct one
Discord
Yang password aku
Aku tidak mau bermain password
1:39 Chrome is the worst program ever I even installed edge on my phone
I tried Clyde's Redstone door in Bedrock, and with a few modifications that only added some Redstone to connect the bottom pistons, it worked. The base system Clyde describes not only works, but also functions on both versions with no major modifications. Good job, Clyde.
Do this again, please, it never fails to make me laught watching AI attempt to make Redstone LOL
Did you forget meta ai
the only reason that clyde couldnt respond is because you were asking it to build a redstone contraption but you have to ask it for instructions on how to build a redstone contraption
discord did the only thing that was right so they won
Giving any AI a single prompt without additional clarification is so dumb, should've had a 2-3 prompt limit so they can understand your situation lol. Coming from a chat gpt engineering graduate
WaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!AAAAAAAAAAAAA!AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3:55 ah yes lego tutorials and reviews i wonder what sets or mocs he has made     My brain when seeing the UP sd70: WE'RE A GREAT BIG ROLLING RAILROAD-
Google
this guy is so annoying. literally makes everything worse trying to be funny but its honestly not funny at all
If you ask the discord bot "Can you make me ____", Discord is going to think you want it to create it FOR you in a game. If you simply asked it: "Can you tell me how to make ____", then discord would know you were asking to EXPLAIN it for you. Grammer bro :/
OH MY GOD DISCORD TOTALLY WON WOOOMMGGG BRO IM SPEECHLESS YOU MAKE A REDSTONE DOOR LIKE THAT FOR REAL??? ASEROGHNIJLSFGFSG
Why the second one 😭 2:27
W Clyde was being honest the whole time, too bad he’s not on anymore
Sadly Clyde is dead. Rest in Piece, you will be missed.
Discord came in at the end to save all of them
2:17 I think he wanted for you to make something else there 💀
As my literature teacher said once diring class, "dont ask chatgpt about these things, it will make you think it knows even though it doesn't"
clyde won
Discord
Discord because it was the only one that made somhting that worked❤❤😂😂❤❤❤😂❤❤😂❤❤
I can make 1x1 door
Well, I don’t!!! Because I’m only 7 years old
Ugh hi g ihpcvyugufi
بد نبود
9:21 hey the ai meant the other side are you stupud?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It’s funny how Clyde (the dc AI) knew this whole time but was too insecure in his ability’s
purplers: everyone has to have a chat box me: no also me: switch from my chat box to find a video to listen to
you should have specified about java or bedrock edition
discord won the competition for 2x2 door
TIP: TNT stop after geting in  water
technically gpts door works. its just... you know.. two 1x2 doors
Purplers are you the enemy of NotNico?3
1:30 bro did it again!...microsoft edge...the rookie of all browsers...who knows what kinda madness is held behind the doors of...MICROSOFT EDGE...
I've been getting a lot of comments saying I didn't follow the instructions correctly, so I thought I should mention that being a redstoner myself, I could immediately tell the AI had absolutely no clue how to build a simple redstone circuit. It's something that's probably a lot less obvious to people who don't make redstone  Lots of the instructions were very ambiguous, so I had to guess what the AI wanted me to do. Even if I followed the instructions "properly", the redstone still wouldn't have worked. The AI just didn't know how to make redstone xD
Honestly, I just think your incredible inability to follow instructions is partly to blame here.
4:49 its actually explaining it right, he’s just being difficult 😑
Funny content but you are just bad at reading instructions
*me thinking 2x2 piston doors are complicated* *also me realizing its one of the easiest things to make*
can you create a super pack folder
he put the redstone dust in the wrong place of the pistons
Anyone remember that one microsoft chatbot that was on twitter?
You med all things bad
Discord because it was the only one to get a red
Did you have to do this spaceX joke! It didn’t even make sense. (Just look at my name and you’ll get it!
discord clyde won no doubt
Discord be unlocking ultra instinct for the last
discord its the only one that made something functional!
Maybe discord
discord wasnt bad, it gave the other bots a chance but then when it saw the other AIs attempts, it just went *"really???, am i the only one smart enough???"*
Discord it’s the only one that got one right
Hola mi amor como te va a
Only Purplers fans can make this right if I got you tell me Read more
Discor do the job done
for chat gpt it meant 3x2  so 3x 2y not 3y 2x
discord bot, because it was the only ane who made working redstone as the others didn't work, so even if dicord disqualified the first 2 rounds, it did something the others couldn't do😀😀
Discord bot wins it can actually make something Redstoney
Discord bot wins because it redeemed itself when he thought it couldn't; true clutch there
discord
10:50 WHY CANT WE HAVE JAVA REDSTONE MONJANG I HATE. THISSSOQ
snapchat won
you forgot an ai (Copilot) which is apart of microsoft😃

I think bard won
1:43 I used the ai to bring me into a part of the video and it came to this
Discord bot wins.
Discord did what I would do last round but wrong blocks
Discord def won
6:30
I didn’t 😂 stop 😂 laughing 😂 😂😂😂
You are the stupid not the ai
Ｐｌｕｈ
Literally discord is so obvious. He’s the only one that did it perfectly yes he didn’t do it at all through the first two but the last one was perfect. It’s also the only perfect.
Bing chat aka Copilot now actually cites it's sources and usually provides a YT video on stuff like this
maybe dont ask them to do it, and ask them how to do it and snap and discord wouldve had a chance
I think discord won the last round!😂
discord
When I said I liked his old skin better I didn't check when the video was made.
Google
9:22 omg he so funny XDD
I love da video
Goddamit Nigel💀
Bro Edge is not that bad 😞
do 1st one in bedrock
I think I the Google one was ment to being bedrock edition
The Google tnt is for bedrock
9:17 wait for the after the world ends😆
Goddamnit Nigel fucking murdered me
bro am i the only one who cares about the hamster that fell out in 0:28
7:04 I thought that name tag was going in a different direction at first💀
Microsoft Edge🤮
should redo this vid after a year to see which AIs improved
How to make those AI pictures
Chat gtp made a tnt launcher so fast that you cant even see it
Rip Clyde 🫡
When I heard the hmm it sounded like a villager 💀 1:15
You could ask the discord bot for explanoation of how should you built stuff. He is right he cannot build in minecraft, but he can maybe guide you.
Discord
BRO WHERES MICROSOFT COPILOT
Please use your brain next time:/
Your skin is weird
i like how bard took round two *literally*
Funny thing is discord and Snapchat are the same ai model, it’s just chatgpt. Lol
Clyde sure likes smilyfaces :O
Maybe all of the ai robots thought you meant “bedrock edition” because its called “minecraft” yeah, only “minecraft”
Thank you discord to help me making piston door😁
Google had bard before Microsoft lol
I love the I guess I’ll be placing this piston the rest of the time 9:22 ❤
Bruh 9:21
Second round first ai it only didn’t work for him because he wasn’t supposed to put the Redstone torches right next to the track
For the Snapchat and discord, they didn't teach you because they thought you wanted them to get in your world and build it. You should have asked "can you teach me how to build a 2 by 2 piston door
The double door doesn’t work because piston are inside
Doscord wins becuase non of the other build function at all.
DISCORD
discord, its the only thing that actully worked
I hope gramarly didnt make it on to the next vid😂😂😂😂😂
1:14
10:34 when did it say 4 blocks apart
I think discord won honestly, it dominated the last round with an amazing door! So why not?
it just expoled but it didnt made the sound
Everything got me dying except discord and Snapchat😂😂😂😂
😂😢
Bro did not use Copilot!?
Fun fact: Clyde is gone
w discord for the door :D
are you sure you weren’t viewing the steps 90 degrees in wrong direction. 3 blocks wide, place block in middle and destroy block in right, could be corner if you consider facing the 3 wide width
6:20 but it works right?
discord
"can you TELL me how to build..."
Yeah discord bot is so good at making images too
„AI will soon replace designers and engineers” AIs who struggle to build a simple mechanism in a game:
You forgot #Leo from the search engine "brave"
10:16 I think he thought you wanted him to get inside the game and build it so that is why he didn’t help you on the other rounds but I think you should do it again but specifying so that we can see if he is smart or not
Chatgpt is stupid
This is stupidly entertaining
Your prompts are weak
The ai is dumb
Rip hamter 😭 0:28
5:28  Ngl bro is the guy from the mobile ads ong
i think the problem with discord is that u asked it to do it for u, instead of asking it to explain how to do it
You're the problem! Stop blaming the bots
Obviously discord AI wins, because it could admit when it didn't know what it was doing, and when it tried it got it perfect, but I personally think Google deserves second place and a cookie because it got the most points by technicality, it's first contraption DID launch tnt, just not in a conventional or repeatable way, and it's second build was a railroad, even though it wasn't functioning, it tried it's best to decorate it and make it look good, and you DID never technically ask for a WORKING railroad.  Google AI just gives off the vibe of a kid who has NO idea what it's doing, but tries it's best anyways.
I don’t like you
just ask them to be more specific like dis
Discord wins
you didn't even ask discord to make instructions on how to build the TNT cannon
I don't know the AI from opera gx
9:35 Maybe what he meant was 2 blocks in and 3 blocks to the side
0:03 i feel bad for chatgpt
Discord
WAT 😮
1:15 Ahh... yes. The old days when AI was dumb.
Discord won
add slime blocks!!1!1!! :D
4:33 AI can't search anything up on the internet. A lot of AI chatbots make up the links they give you themselves so it's not a dead video it probably never existed.
what mic do u use
8:33 one tick pulse it.
At least discord bot is honest. Google bard made an epic train station though.
i can make a 2-2 door
Discord
You made a mistake, you asked the AI to *make* something in minecraft, which as discord explained they can't do. What you shoul ask for is instructions specifically. So "Make me instructions for building x"
7:03 None of you are without sin
bro ur the ai
The thing is, half the prompts you mess around with, discord would have not done well in the last if you treated the prompt like the rest
Fun fact: Purples followed chatgpt's instructions wrong, far away from what it meant
Score wins
Discord
When you said Bing Chat you meant Copilot?right?
Opera GX made their own AI chatbot named "Aria".
Dicord won because he was only on to do somting right
w discord
Google asked u to place a slab
People in the comments saying he "didn't structure his prompts correctly" as if the fact that the AI couldn't figure out the intent behind a simple sentence isn't just more evidence of the AI's stupidity
“Van Goff”
Snapchat: Here's a dead video link. But in all seriousness, you asked them to do it for you. Not a step by a step guide.
Jb dr
IT didnt get anything  wrong YOU did
Discord wins because bro actually made a full 2x2 piston door
Clyde was only saying it couldn’t play Minecraft you needed to ask how you would make ine
Discord
Not sure you understood the brilliance of these designs.. no one will ever get into your base.
Loved the bing one, stupid just like microsoft
Discord wins because the one that it *did* do was the only correct one of all them
chat gpts piston one was right you just cant follow instructions
Just ask Clyde for tips
5:27 wait, they no longer move randomly when placed on powered rails?
Google was the first one to actually look like it tried
9:09 that was amazing
opera gx has an ai called aria
R.I.P clyde missed but not forgotten
Use gemini
The moment where discord clyde sounded dramatic made me want him to win 😭😭
Hahahaha
You are sucks for redstone
Round 1: google Round 2: bing Round 3:discord
edging
To be fair, none of them knew how to do the first 2 challenges, Discord was simply honest about it, and the only thing it said it could "Certainly help with" it nailed it
when he said edge my pc lagged and repeated the bass boosted edge.my ears hurt like hell
Me?
I think on the last one discord won
Another thing is that you asked Discord Clyde for builds like you wanted him to do them for you, which he obviously can’t. Some AI take some questions way too literally, so if you would just ask for *tips* on how to do those it would give ‘em for you.
How is IA take over with not being able to make a minecraft minecart rail track?
chat gpt got it right on the red stone doors it isnt in the midle but it opens on the sides
I laughed so hard during the whole thing omg
hello
You took the instructions too literally sometimes. But fairs
I'd you'd just worded it as telling you how rather than literally making it for you..
You ruined this by asking it to "make me X". You should have asked it "Give me instructions on how to do X". The AI responses from discord and snapchat even pointed that error out to you every time "As an AI chat bot I can't..." but you ignored that completely.
Only true fans can like this comment 👇👇👇
For bing you need tnt to launch in the dispenser
Discord Clyde won
Arcums hammer is an idea ais don't get
the first game to have ai, Tyreoek, kuma
Discord won (probably)
1.google  2.bing chat  3.discord
9:10 i think that should actually mean repeat step 3 and 4, wich means a redstone torch and than a piston to mirror, but the ai is just bad at numbers. And i think it had to be a hole in a wall, not in the ground.
Discord is the only one that actually made something good so it
I'd say Discord is the winner because it is the only one that got one right.
I will NOT accept Microsoft edge slander its Goated asf
6:33
RIP CLYDE
W Discord
For discord you should ask to tell me steps my discord ai worked
I don't sub many minecrafters outside of a specific spere but this science was good. I'll give it a try.
Discord
Why doesn't he wanna try to understand what they are saying? He just misunderstanding on purpose.
It’s between discord and google for the W. Bard actually described a semi-nice-looking train station even if it didn’t work. Discord came in clutch at the end with that 2x2 tho.
"And then once the universe has ended" 🤣
" MICROSOFT *EDGE* "
You can redo it with bing (now copilot) now that there is an option to disable the search functionality.
Nonton video dash
If you think Snapchat won then like this comment😂
You don,t have eyes in minecraft
in bingchat's machine, just put TNT and water in the dispenser
its content like this that makes companies add ai chat garbage to everything even when its not needed. this is super lazy content , do better
East or West YT is the best
ngl. idk whats happenin, just heard the tomodachi life music and started vibin.
This whole video is just you not knowing how to give good prompts and use the AI properly 💀
Sounds like you asked the wrong question for 2 rounds
all the ciurrent iterations of AI do are put some words together that it statistically calculated should be written in response to hte words you wrote. there is ZERO "intelligence" about it. they are coherent text generators, nothing more.
Bing know how to COOK 🔥🔥🔥
Snapchat did absolutely nothing
U made me laugh today new sub coming in!!!! :)
The beginning with the idea of the hamster got me XD😂
Discord went full on 100 iq on the 2x2 redstone doof
It will all have similar result, since all of those Ai's are based on GPT architecture
I think, to be more fair to the AIs, you might have to specify you want a written tutorial, as the AIs seem to be dumb enough to think you actually want them to just go into the game and make you a piston door themselves.
Discord, because it's the only one that had a success.
Is everybody just talking about the bills I want to talk about is the hamster OK
Bing Chat running only in Edge, that's so Microsoft
Ur voice deserves an oscar
gpt tried its best bing was stupid (but did good on the train) bard was more stupid discord was dumb but did good at the last snapchat didnt try
Pov: Youre staying quiet because you use Microsoft Edge  Me too, dont worry
You needa just get better at understanding the bots and how to talk to them to get them to do what you want

Oh My Goodness Discord's Epic Comeback!  🔥💯🌟
Team 1. Discord, 2. Google, 3. (Ur choise or smth) 👇
i think discord clyde won, just because of the last round
hey, facemoji keyboard has an AI too what acually does something  https://www.youtube.com/s/gaming/emoji/7ff574f2/emoji_u1f604.png
1.Bard 2. BingChat 3.Discord
Discord Made the perfect and purest redstone 2x2 door
This sounds more like prompt issues.
"How do I make a Redstone clock?" "Tower"
I think discord won...for true science you should have gone back and asked it to try the first two again in the context of 'I need advice on making a X in minecraft' instead of just stating you want it to build something...with AI, how you ask the question can make all the difference in what it replies with.
The prompts for the AI were garbage. No wonder they didn't give any actual answers.
i panicked for a moment when you went “Lets give our ticket master a name!” N- I- G-
I was doing something with my friend and I was a robot character, and he asked me “what are you running on? RTX3000 or something?” And I said “um no actually I’m using chatGPT” and he burst into laughter.
i love how you didn't specify which recent spaceX launch the first tnt cannon was like so even our children will understand the joke
i use edge
i think your problem is you're asking discord to build it not give you instructions
Please do this again but replace bard with gooder bard (gemini)
Clyde was my reason to have no life, I’m glad he redeemed himself in the end and may he rest in peace.
it's funny how whatever any of those ai will say, you'll mess it up however you want, cause they didn't specify something, but then... there is discord bot, which didn't specify everything as needed, and yet you made it look like he did it correctly. If you'd make it as he told you to, it wouldn't work
did anyone notice that nigel rrhymes with the n-word
The Bing Station compared to the Google Station is Exactly how I'd expect the comparison to be 😂😂😂
6:59 bro when he named the villager I almost got a heart attack
try aria, opera's built in ai
"then, once the universe has ended" killed me lol
It’s called a Jeb door because it doesn’t do anything
Discord, because you asked it to make it for you, not to tell you how to make it. It was right, it can't make it for you. Should have said teach me how to make a tnt cannon or something.
Watching this in 2024 after his skin update
Hmm, if I correct ChatGPT that 9+10 is not 19 bus 21 it states: "The statement "9 + 10 is 21" is often used humorously or ironically, originating from a viral internet meme. However, mathematically, 9 + 10 equals 19."
The Smiley face is so memorable
I remember watching something like this if not this
Discord was robbed, you kept asking it to play minecraft by telling it to build it for you, if you would've asked how to build it would've dominated
I know how to make the TNT CANNON! But I can only show it to you instead of explaining it :(
Isn't the bing ai gpt 4 already
Might try asking for tips on how to build instead of asking if they can build one
Snapchat won😂
1:16
snapchat won
0:27 hamsper
Im a little biased but Google
Snapchat won
Honestly this "snapchat ai" is trash against every *actual* AI. Everything it can do is basic smalltalk and it's just so unimpressive!
For the bing ai it’s referring to the tnt canon where the tnt will be dispensed by the dispenser and the slime block and sticky piston will send it flying.
You have to ask them for instructions, not to build something
You have to push the cart a bit so the cart MOVES when it touches the powered rails
Problem of the ai seems to be no ability to visualize what they are doing. Meaning they want to do something but don't have the perception of space to do it.
Man that Bing one was 🤌
if anyone wants an actual explanation as to why they can't do something so simple, it's because these bots are trained on text data on the interned. So while it can understand what you're asking, it has no way of actually knowing what a TNT cannon is like, because people don't tend to wrote that down like it wants. And it doesn't actually know that, so it gives you something plausible based on what it does know and assumes that works. That's because chariots don't actually know anything, they just give the most plausible output. When you give it a lot of data of true things, it tends to output true things. But when it doesn't know anything about a topic, it just puts whatever feels like a response it would likely give, hence the inaccurate info.
0:29 Undertale OST: 054 - Hotel
I quite liked Google's train station, noticed it took more of a builder's approach than a functional approach.
I will say if you placed the redstone torches a block away and replaced some with buttons, Chatgpt would be good
the fact that you didn't catch on to your mistake is incredible. none of the AI's can make anything for you. you have to ask them how to make it. YOU are the one making it. so discord and snapchat didn't even get a fair chance because you don't know how to use English, and they do. they were just doing what you told them to and you just gave up Forthwith.
Bro, you got it wrong on the door, the chat gpt wanted to tell you to put the pistons OUTSIDE the frame, not inside
This is no joke i swear:  As he showed the edge logo my video froze and I thought it was a gag done by him😅
2:45 Water on the hill Rock on the ground 🤓☝🏿
Dude is just bad at following tutorials
Every ai you used, except for googles, is basically chatgpt :-
boring video
you ask ais incorrectly

I 100% have used Bing Ai or now known as co-pilot in google chrome. So idk what 1:35 is about
The first one went so faaast
“Place a leeever”
bard is now gemini
Clyde is history's best redemption arc.
You are doing things wrong not al
Actually, many answers were correct, but you were too stupid to apply them correctly.
Clyde!
Google won because of the astethic
The hamster 😂
Discord Clyde was just saying he can't *play a video game* ... you should have asked him for tips instead of asking him to "make a <redstone build>".
Discord was the only one who created a functional piston door
Clyde solos negative diff
i think discord wins
Wait I'M CLYDE?!?!?!?!?;?!?!
Bing chat was goos for the first- Nevermind
Discord is the winner I think
https://www.youtube.com/@user-fg2pp8mv5y
Discord clide because: IT ACTUALLY DID A REAL WORKING 2X2 PISON DOOR!!! (although it bombed the other two)
9:06  bro created  the step paradox
gap that:uwu
Discord got the biggest comeback so i gotta say discord who agrees 👇
Bing sucks fuck Microsoft oo wee oo I look just like Google oo wee oo
Discord saved the day…including me from falling asleep, just seeing the end made me smile. I think discord won
do opera gx it's realy good
Chat gpt piston door does open... once
you made Bing chats tnt cannon wrong it supposed to be when a piston pushes the dispenser fires tnt and then the pisten with the slime block pushes the tnt
discord wins
Discord ai won cus that ai made an accsual working 2x2 piston door
input issue  you ask a bot to "make" rather than "give you instruction" obviously it can't work
9:22
Bard
Discord wins. It was honest about not being able to build the others and was the only one to build a successful redstone machine.
did anyone notice that at 0:02 that the AI said 10 + 9 = 21?
Clyde wins because they are the only one that legit made a working thin
I laughed my ass off at work. Thanks, I needed the laugh a lot. 😂
7:04, yup nigel, thats what I thought aswell
Nigel had me thinking sum else
google won
Ofcourse discord won’t work, if you’d asking ti to PLAY the game, not to ask them tips
discorddddddddd!!!!!!!!!!
MONKE
It’s cool how Clyde is the only AI that made something correct to redeem itself from the last two rounds while the other 3 just made it wrong or just doesn’t give anything.
Okay, i know mods exist, but we NEED an official remake of this game with better graphics and inproved physics.
You literally made the AI instructions wrong on some of them that’s why they are not working 🤦‍♂️
Are you a chat bot🧐
I wonder how many of those got filtered by the safety checks because "TNT" was in the prompt lmao
Well i mean clyde said exact same thing as chatgpt but you made it diffrently?
Discord pecause id IS The only WHO do something fight!
7:03 had me in the first half
I would say Snapchat won that 🎉🎉
Discord might won
the discord ai definitely wins.
The true redstone was the friends we made along the way
How can the literal Gaming platform not be able to explain something that is from a game, but the work and non-gaming platforms be able to explain it. (If my comment doesnt make sense, its because im tired and its late.)
the first ones
0:02 bruh how can it help kids cheat on their homework? There's no such thing as cheating in homework, as most kids need help from parents or internet anyway.
We're not talking about swords and mining 4:12
these ais are insane
discord bot thought that you want him to play minecraft as a player and build it. but when it got that you want him to discribe how to do it, it did it perfectly.
Discord
Bro thought he could have bought him
5:48 LMAO, i started laughing so hard from This part XD
Ask it for instructions not to make one for you
Discord wins
i made clyde swear on me
AI
I’ll miss ya Clyde 😢
Now bing ai is in others, but it’s not the full.
2:23 you could put tnt in the dispenser and unsticky the piston
Discord discord it was so nice and was best
5:12  how do you not understand you cheap minecraft youtuber
Bom dia
3:39 gotta be persistent. It's connected to the internet therefore it can preform searches.  At least it works with chat gpt.
discord wins  😃
The bing chat one was actually right. It launches TNT away
That first TNT cannon one nearly killed me, I can't breathe... why do I find this so funny?
does not work in bedrock anymore.
10:22 The biggest plot twist ever in my life😂
I think you need to word the question differently. "Tell me how to make a ___" rather than "build me a ____."
Hey, give Clyde props for honesty. XD
Bing does a little trolling
thoss who saw the SD70 👇
lol bing chat is chatgpt
I LIKE CLYDE
:/
Although bing wasn't specific, it had the right idea, and if you take those steps and your own brain, you can create a cannon, as well as the statio. The door was just bad
Discord won
DISCORD WINSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
what's next an A.I. that'll literally play all our video games?... nah sorry I actually like playing games.. no AI needed there I hope not at least
7:58 im sure it meant you had to break the concrete blocks and place it there..
Your prompts are s***
the discord bot literally explained a door with pistons in the doorway.. instead of building what it said he built a 2x2 door to make it look like the bot did something.
I think discord won  it actually knew what to do and you just had to tell it to tell you how and not actually play minecraft
me : bing, how do I make a sandwich? bing : get some bread, and make a sandwich
hilarious idea for a vid :D
that space x launch was a success tho....
ChatGPT is great at chess, it beat the strongest chess engine
Definitely discord lol its the only AI that got it right
Discord wins by a long shot. Sure they did not do anything for the first two rounds, but they absolutely dominated the final round and did everything perfectly. However, the other competitors had some mistakes in there builds
Googles stuff all worked a little bit. I’d say they’re the winner overall
I think Snapchat one
He is not asking the right questions to discord  and snapchat. i did and it described to me how to make it perfectly.
Discord Wins!
Bard for the first 2 but overall discord
opera gx has an ai too
discord was losing but it backfired to a win
6  6  3  0 this is the score
The hamster 😢
The guy doesn’t know what to do without context.  I think this is his first time building tnt cannons so much so that the first one was too vague for him but it is apparent if you had read the hints. It was talking about dispensers for the other blocks and chat GPT is a very finicky AI at that, being probably fed data based on its answers and only responding correctly on certain prompts.  I have found this out playing chess with it and its questionable responses, as it is not adaptive intelligence.  Still worth some entertainment value though. 0:43
ChatGPT won, he is just a bit dumb
sadge that you didn't test chatgpt
Team Clyde bcz Clyde is the only one who done a round correct without any wastes
ask google ai studio too
Dis🌈⚡️🥞🍕🍟
Clyde
7:03 my heart skipped a beat, i thought that name was going somewhere else
Round 1 - Google Round 2 - bing Round 3 - discord
This taught me how to make a 2x2 door. Thank you
maybe explaining redstone to the ai the results might be better
Discord won
clyde wins.  why? it was the only one to make at least one functional redstone contraption.
I think mother problem here is misreading
WHEN YOU DISQUALIFID CLYDE YOU DIDDNT SAY DISQUALICLYDE!!!!!
I bet the 2x2 piston door from Clyde is a manual response.
cylde bot wins
snapchat and discord can do it you just have to ask can you tell me how to
Fun fact: bing ai is chat gpt 4
Klide
As all chat bot devs seem to say its about creating the best prompts that the llm can in its way understand
Clyde clutched, not gonna lie.
Bro is not being smart
the thing about """ai""" text generation is that its essentially a fancier version of the predictive text feature on my phone. it doesn't actually have any intelligence, it just knows how to put words together that follows patterns its learned. its why all the redstone contraptions it asked for were nonsense, because it was just putting words together in a way that sound coherent but don't actually mean anything.
Dude do you know Aftonspring5192...if you do tell me we gotta talk.
RIP Clyde, he was stupid, a bit of a narc but so much fun
god discord clyde was anoyying
You made a TNT cannon
I didn't know how easy a 2x2 door is! I made my design that the redstone of takes up about 30x30x20 blocks for a 2x2 door lol😂
The second tnt cannon, you need to fill the dispenser with tnt and the piston will launch it
WE NEED ANOTHER ONE OF THESE, please 😊❤
I don't think he understand what bot said
Discord
“The Design Is Very Human”
As a sealf proclaimed redstone expert I will say that is not how I make a two by two door. I make two by three doors
Discord won definitely give him the W
u wont pin me i KNOW u wont infact i will eat sand if u do bc ik you wont
hm hm, In Minecraft, you can create a device that works as a TNT launcher using pistons and redstone. Here is a simple example of how to do it:  Necessary materials:  Building blocks (for the launcher structure). Redstone dust. Levers or buttons. Sticky pistons. Obsidian blocks or some explosion-resistant material (for protection). Steps to build a TNT launcher:  Prepare the base:  Place blocks on the ground to create the base of your launcher. Make sure you have enough space for the structure. Create the launcher structure:  Build an L- or T-shaped structure using building blocks. This structure will be the base of the launcher. Add the pistons:  Place sticky pistons on top of the structure. These pistons will be responsible for pushing the TNT. Connect with redstone:  Place redstone blocks so that they connect the pistons. Add redstone dust to connect the blocks and ensure the signal reaches each piston. Add switches or buttons:  Place levers or buttons in an accessible location to activate the pistons. Connecting them through redstone will allow you to control when the launcher is activated. Protect your construction:  Use blocks of obsidian or other blast-resistant material around the pistons and redstone to prevent damage from TNT explosions. Add TNT:  Place TNT blocks on top of the sticky pistons. Make sure there is enough room for the TNT to be pushed when the pistons activate. Activate the launcher:  Press the switch or button to activate the launcher and watch as the TNT is launched. Please note that the TNT launcher can cause damage in the game and should be used responsibly. Also, be careful when building with redstone to avoid interference or malfunction. Have fun building and experimenting in Minecraft!
I think that why it didn’t work was because you didn’t understand the instructions because maybe you have skill issues with red stone and was just playing dumb for the content.
for the first two, discord pretty much went "eRm... nO. 🤓" And went full on engineer the for the last one.
Purples remember me in roblox collect your body
I think that the snapchat bot loses.
Mumbo jumbo
Clyde AI is the friend that gives in to help you after multiple times bugging them
I think the ai won
Why didn’t you ask discord to tell you how to do it
Btw, all the ai talks about bedrock edition, you should have told em that it is java
It does it correctly it just can’t tell what it means
👇bard team
discord
I suppose discord won
I use Microsoft edge
Someone with resources and knowledge in the Community should start an open source project to make our very own ai chat bot that specialized on red stone.
Can u pls start roblox blox fruits
Clyde bot for the win!
Bing chat is just gpt
You aren’t listening to the telling you to keep the water in one spot, not letting it ruin every thing that I told you to put down
everyone says ai bot its not ai its just a npc thay fallows the algorithm of your request and serchest the best answers of your request. a lot of people dosent know how ai work  chat gpt is just basically browser bot for lazy peoples hu wants answers 😂
Dis
Do you know that the name you gave to the villager Nigel is from a 2006 snow call knd
Clyde wins, all of the A.I are very stupid at redstone builds, but Clyde dominated all the round in just 1 BUILD
ueah ai is really smart😂😂😂
There’s something in my walls
You are noob
Discord lol
Discord
Discord
you're not even following the instructions..
Google passed the first was the Unique that worked and in the second everyone lost and in the final the discord won so it is an impact
The one for google number 1, has to be done in Bedrock Edition, because redstone works underwater in minecraft bedrock edition. So it does work, just not in that edition
Discord is the only winner ❤
I think discord won
Discord at final round destroyed
it is discord because it made the only functional red stone build that was described
I think Snapchat because he didn’t do anything
24+24=?
2
1+1=
discord made a better door than mine
I think clyde wins, becuase clyde didnt try and give a step by step tutorial, and just explained how it functions.
Dc
I think the rocket luncher in Google is supposed to be in bedrock edition
For the chatgpt piston door you built the frame sideways
discord bot won kind of by default because he was the only one that was able to create a proper redstone machine
Discord bc it explainable it and thought u wanted it to play for u
Rate AI 1/10
9:47 you understood bad but it's ok, its an AI anyways so its fun to bully them XD
This became the most popular video of your channel quickly
11:15
Discord
AIs might be dumb sometimes, but as programmers might say, the only thing dumber than the program itself are the users. for the love of god, type the damn prompt right, be extremely specific, it's a machine, not a human. you can't expect a 4 year old to interpret a text if you didn't teach him the meaning of the words
Discord won cuz... it's was the only one to actually make something that works
I think you didn’t follow chat gpt Minecraft station good enough, it wanted you to put a powered rail near the beginning with a button by it, press the button and it works Other than that, good vid😊
discord
AI gonna rule the world⚔️🛡️🪓💣⚔️🇹🇭
I like to think they're already sentient and they're just talking to each other like "how many stupid things can we make this dude do"
It's for bedrock edition dummy
Hunter 😀😀😋😋😋😙😋😑😋😑😋😋😋
Google
discord discord discord
you had to ask for tips on the thinsg for snap and discord
You are intentionally building it wrong
Ai !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I think this cordwin
Agpa
do it again now they are 69+ better🥶👌
Chatgpt is not smart at redstone cause its just blow then the water just protects the block
Discord took the W
You had to ask clyde to design one
discord (win)
YouTubers love to play java
discord wins because it was the only one that ACTUALLY MADE SOMETHING THAT WORKED
I know why the Clyde AI dont give you the tutorial how to make the minecart rail and the TNT Launcher, you probably dont say like: how make a TNT Launcher in Minecraft , but on the third chance the Clyde AI workedand give you the tutorial
Won is dis
Discords bot uses chatgbt, with an overlay to constantly refuse and disagree with people chatting with it. Its kind of based how intentionally infuriating it was if you didn't give it a personality
I think discord
7:00 any one else thought that he was gonna name him a different word? or is it just me
when clyde made the door work i started smiling so much and i dont know why
discord last round wins what a comeback
I like snap shat😊
“Add some automation” my brother in Christ you are the automation
Discord!!!!
3:14 is that not what its supposed to do, Destroy?
0:18 that's my name in the middle :O
Ai is NOT mumbo jumbo! 1! 1!! 1
I tried Aria from opera, and it started like clyde, but then when I asked it to tell me how I can make one, it gave me instructions. It almost worked. Here's what it told me:  1. Gather the necessary materials: You will need blocks, redstone dust, redstone torches, sticky pistons, and a lever or button. 2. Choose a location: Find a suitable location for your piston door. Make sure you have enough space for the door to open and close without obstruction. 3. Dig out the doorway: Create a 2x2 doorway by removing blocks from the wall. This will be the space where your piston door will be placed. 4. Place the pistons: In each corner of the doorway, place a sticky piston facing inward. Make sure the pistons are flush with the ground or wall. 5. Connect the pistons with redstone: Place blocks behind each piston and connect them with redstone dust. This will create a circuit that powers the pistons. 6. Add a lever or button: Place a lever or button near the doorway. This will be used to activate the piston door. 7. Test the door: Activate the lever or button to see if the piston door opens and closes properly. Adjust the redstone circuit if necessary. 8. Decorate and finish: Once the door is working correctly, you can decorate the doorway and surrounding area to your liking. Add any additional blocks or details to complete the look.  Technically it works. Its a functional piston door... that's always open and only closes when you press a button or leaver.  It never used the redstone torch, though, which would have allowed for it to be closed until triggered - like a normal door. That said, Aria did provide a functional door. This makes me wanna try to see what else it can build me.
Clyde ?!
7:50
Bing pretend to be Mumbo Jumbo on making a powered rails
“Orange flavourad chocolate balls🤨💀”
Me : finally, a worthy opponent.
10:31
Clyde basically ascended and achieved self consciousness at the end
ITS 21!!
Somehow he managed to not follow some of the steps listed like the slab for the google one
When he named him nigel I froze 😭
4:21 needed to say instructions to make a TNT cannon in minecraft
These AI are language models, they are specifically designed for communication, ofc they can’t help you 😂
If you added that stupid Cici app...💀🔫
Clyde: "Sorry, I'm not able to do redstone"  Also Clyde: *makes a literally perfect 2x2 piston door*   I see, Clyde being a real redstone-youtuber *sigh*
discoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooord
Clyde would have worked if you'd asked it for instructions instead of asking it to make you the redstone
Discord is a gaming app platform is wouldn't be surprised if he knows how to build a 3x3 piston door
7:03 you got me on the first half
the spaceX launch 💀
The chat gpt red stone door is useful for if you have 2 separated parts of your base then you use that door to go in one side or the other.
Clyde probably did nothing in the first two rounds, because you told it to BUILD something for you, which it took as "go on my Minecraft world and build it for me" and you probably just used an another question formula that it understood correctly
5:30 its actually right, you have to place minecart!S! so if one minecart push the otherone, it move
discord ai name is the same as mine
There was one guy who asked bard for an invite to the Thug Shaker Central and bard gave him a valid invite
instead of asking them to make it for you, ask them how to make it. you'll get better results... part 2 please?
the ai probably perceives the location of the blocks differently and, for example, I think it swapped it perfectly for the piston.
R.İ.P clyde
Bing and discord are the only ones who got perfect
Bruh bing got confused on that 2 round 💀
i think u can do that all ai to do a skin on Minecraft then tell with are the skin that is beatyfull skin pls
Dude just use brave
1:57 That's the right side of the dispenser. It is clockwise from the face, which is clearly the front side.  Were you asking Discord and Snapchat to _design_ the redstone builds, or to _create_ them?
You can totally run bing in firefox, firefox + Linux + useragent spoof = bing
I liked my own comment
Clyde gave a description of what to do, not instructions. But since the description was closer to being right than giving incorrect instructions, Clyde is - in fact - the only bot who got close to making a working redstone door.
0:17 o7
The redemption
I like the part the the hamster goes flying
Did you have a flat world 😏😏😏
so it is chatgpt but why beacuse now a days chatgbt is better
Guess what! Clyde is getting deleted at the end of the month!
i like your skin
Round 1 : google
The most important thing to note about these AIs is that they have absolutely no idea what they're talking about. They are just writing sentences that look a bit like responses they've seen before with the given prompt. When the snapchat one links to youtube, it isn't looking at youtube at all. It just knows that some people put a youtube link in it which looks like [this] with a few random letters on the end, so surely doing the same will be what the user wants.
Hey there! What's the texture apck your using to get those 3d rails?
man, even if I can't understand almost anything in your videos because I'm French (I do have some talent for understanding 😏), strangely enough I laughed a lot at 1:37 😂😂
Discord won.
discord did technically win, as it was the only one who successfully completed a task. everyone else just kinda put a bunch of shit together like i would have done when i was like 6
Discord won
redstone repeater tower lol
0:40 Arear of block
Snapchat obviously won smh
Definitely the discord bot cause all the other ones didnt even make what was described and the discord one build a perfect door
at the door you had to put the pistons on top not side
DISCORD OP
Discord bot was the only AI to build something perfectly, so it won
Bingbot is make a unnamed clock
Clyde cool
AI is not cool but ugly
AI is botbot
googles tnt canon wasnt wrong i know what it meant it just described it poorly
Discord wins
DISCORD WON! hands down, no questions asked. One perfect 10 success- compared to a bunch of clunkers? One worked- but was wasteful in design, another worked- but only barely and is wasteful in its design. this was efficient, and powerful.
i think snapchat won
no ai is dumb the thing that is dumb is the prompt you give to a particular ai . if the prompt or the question is formed properly and is well defined then the ai will give you perfect answers
clyde, that piston door is great!
Bro, chat gpt at the beginning was so gullible
0:29 got me💀
Discord won totaly
Discord wins
😂
some of these builds look like they'd be seriously code-breaking stuff if they worked, like, it'd be a moment of hte A.I. seeing an interaction taht we don't see, a glitch in the game to fill your 'parameters'  i.e. "eat this cake at THIS EXACT ANGLE, and flick your mouse in a 92 degree angle while oving backwards, and you'll walk through this piston while it's activating, making it a piston door" and people reading what's going on trying to figure out how these movements make you intangible via fucking with your collissionbox or something stupid
I think the Discord Bot got Confused, because it thought you wanted it to Literally Build those Redstone Contraptions, when you should’ve just asked for a Tutorial.
You kinda messed up the instructions from gpt on the rail one, it was working if made correctly
I can tell you now the losers are humanity for creating these.
Google
It's almost like all an AI can do is barf unoriginal word/image soup, incapable of generating any actual ideas.
Optra gx😂😂😂😂
"place solid block on the left side of the dispenser"  Proceeds to place block to the right of the dispenser relstive to its facing dorection
10:49 most emotive part of the whole video
10:49 most emotive part of the whole video
Technically chatGPT’s piston sore did work just not the way you would except
FYI, Discord, Snapchat & Bing is just OpenAI GPT, same as Chat GPT. So this is just OpenAI GPT vs Google Bard
I'm sad cuz cancer exists
Just gotta ask, did you ask Clyde to build you something or or did you ask it to tell you how to build one?
I think discord won
Discord win
Round 1 Google Round 2 Google Round 3 Discord
And this is why these things should be called 'language models' and not AI. They know how a tutorial should LOOK, but nothing beyond that.
Can’t we ask Discord’s Clyde bot for instructions?
I guess Bing wasn’t too bad and was sort of on to something, it just didn’t go into any detail. By contrast, ChatGPT did mention TNT but only told you to put one, although a water design clearly requires at least two, as opposed to a slime block design. Besides, its placement was absolutely stupid unless you want to fire directly underneath you somehow, and that doesn’t really require a cannon, does it?  I guess today we learned: when you’re not amazing at something or not very sure… just don’t give details, you’ll sound smart without technically being wrong. Here, you, Purplers, had to look like a fool with your more creative choices, so Bing didn’t have to.
Bingchat made mashed potato 🟡🟡🟡🟡🟡🟨🟨🟨🟨
him: *types N i g e* my brain: 💀 him: *carries on to write N i g e l*
Um... ChatGPT guided the same door as Discord bot AI... I checked it right now
So with redstone I'm going to judge the creators, in this case the respective AIs, like I would an engineer. Would you rather have an engineer that bullshits you 100% of the time regardless of how capable they are? Or an engineer that straight tells you they are incapable of most things but only ever accepts the job if they can actually do a good job of it?
THE TOMODACHI LIFE MUSIC 💀💀💀
Discord won this. Put off all three rounds it was the only one to perfectly do the task assigned.
Yo Clyde was just honest be nice to the ai
So, I've been monkeying around with clyde for a while and noticed it's less of him not knowing what you're talking about, and more him just not UNDERSTANDING the way you say it, just my personal experience.
dawg i always get annoyed when im placing a tool item stacking them up while im creative how do u fix it
Smiley face
😂😂 new youtuber found
bings tnt launcher would’ve worked if there was tnt there
discord
Should have asked the discord bot to tell you how to build a tnt cannon rather than ask them how to build it
Thank you. I have not laughed at some things so fun in a long time
1:23 i dont think you understand what happened   (the space x launch)
Ai can't do shit. It's pretending to have memorized what people already know how to do.
Clyde really made it in the last round
Discord Cylde wins because theirs was the only one that actually served its purpose
Next is gonna be ai YouTubers
is the guy talking a bot to or does he naturally talk like that
whos rooting for snapchat? . . . . . . . .  not me
bro had some racial biases against Bing chat💀💀
Discord wins because it was literally answering your question. It physically could not make a redstone build 😂 But that doesn’t mean it didn’t know how
8:06 AMOGUS
If you want s from the discord bot you simply need to ask for instructions so it doesn't think that you are asking it to physically build something
Clyde is the G.O.A.T.
You doe not ar lising not goed
The funny part about AI is that it still can't even make ASCII art.. You'd think it would be simple right? LOL
Maybe he could read the instructions better
DISCORD DID A COMEBACK
For the station that chatgpt made,you had to hook up the redstone jn a way that disabled the torches
A.I.=Abominably idiotic
for the 2×2 piston door Bing told you the right thing you just chose not to follow the steps properly like it's common sense to leave some gap between the pistons for the doorway
discord won
Then once the universe has ended😂
where u edit 1440p video?!
Good ole large language models, sticking words onto other words based god knows what
discord
Discord
BRO DOESNT LIKE MICROSOFT EDGE, WHAT ARE YOU
IDC ABOUT THE AI MAKING REDSTOE   I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT HAMSTER
Discord won cus its the only one that gave a working Redstone build
i believe that if you have carpet mod installed you can do something along the lines of /tickspeed 0 and that means you could place a redstone dust on top of the block and then break the block and the dust wont break since 0 ticks has passed
Bing chat is powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4…
Discord is aan Absolute Win
D  I  S  C  O  R  D  !
Clyde (discord’s bot) is made by open ai so less professional chat-got. Not made by discord, only on discord though.
often when clyde says he cant do something like play a game, just tell him that you dont want him to play the game, you want him to tell you how to do something. i dont know what your prompts were since you blurred the whole screen for some reason, but im assuming you didnt do that.
good video please dont say the lords name in vain though
I thought Microsoft Edge was Microsoft egg
Goddamn it nigel
Time to force an AI to watch 500 hours of mumbo jumbo and Ilmango etc, and see What happens
With Clyde you gotta make him understand that you are asking him for tips, not for him to play the game himself.
Hello, discord's bot, Clyde is just Chat GPT with a custom prompt 😀
my brain during a math test- 0:28
guys I use microsoft edge
snapchat is just plain dumb.
discord won
discord bot won. while it didnt do anything the first 2 rounds, the last round, it correctly build the machine, unlike the other ai's that built something, but didn't work. quality over quanity.
you misunderstood some instructions bro :/
3:03 Google didn't do very good  7:28 That google one was pretty good, I wish it would've told you how to finish though.  9:49 Google completely lost me (I will die with google)
Clyde wins
I kinda gotta give it to discord ngl that ai was the only one that gave you what you wanted to build that was actually correct 👏
So maybe when the discord AI said I cant play Minecraft we should perhaps ask him to describe it to us?
Even roblox made a builder chat to that helps you script
The first round winner is Bingchat, the second round winner is Google and the last is Discord 10000000%
NOT the last one to the right
maybe you just phrased your question for discord wrong
NO WAY DISCORD COMES IN CLUTCH
You are being wrong with the door
Apart from the bad prompts Clyde is able to do things it tells you it cant, for example if you try to make it search something on the internet it tells you it doesnt have access to the internet but when you ask it for example (how to make a cake) it gives you a recipe and if you ask it where it got it from it says the internet. With this method you can start making it contradict itself until you can convince it to accept the prompt (search the internet for how to make a cake) instead of telling you it cant.  Basically Clyde doesnt know what he can do.

Is it weird that my discord was RedstoneMaster years ago?
On Google I think it means to do it on bedrock edition because redstone does not break in water
idk and idc
Greatest comeback
🤣🤣🤣
infackt snampchat winns
In Bedrock, the repeaters and levers wouldn't get destroyed in the Bard TNT launcher, because redstone can be waterlogged.
kids when they realize chat gpt can write their essays for them: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/KOf8eyl_z2Y?feature=share
Discord.
I think discord wins because I like the last build
Snapchat won obviously
Edge is actually insanely good. It's just a really lightweight Chrome.
"Jeb Door" is so real.
Discord defiantly won
i think the problem that the discord and snapchat bots ran into was that it was taking your instructions too literally. you asked it to make a tnt cannon and not to give you instructions on how to build a tnt cannon.
clyde
The only one that managed to make an actual Redstone thing work was the only one that wins because that was the original goal to get a redstone contraption that works 👍.
after I finished watching the video I opened discord to see who had been pinging me repeatedly but there were no notifications. ... oh.
Asparagus Omelet (No. 2)  Whisk 3 eggs with 1/4 cup chopped chervil, 1 teaspoon kosher salt and a few grinds of pepper; mix in 1 cup cooked thinly sliced asparagus. Cook in a buttered large ovenproof nonstick skillet over medium heat, undisturbed, until the edges are set, 3 to 5 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F until cooked through, 3 more minutes. Fold in half and cut into strips. Butter 4 slices toasted pumpernickel bread; top with the omelet strips.

"AI is getting super smart."  Depends on how you define smart. At the end of the day, AI is just an algorithm and doesn't really put thought into anything. I don't get why people keep saying it's 'smart'.
I think I understand how to use the second tnt launcher. You have to move the piston one block to the left, and place a slime block where the piston use to be. Then, remove the slime blocks that are touching the slime block that you just placed. Then place some tnt in the dispenser and pull the lever.
this is a beautifull example of how these AI's are nowhere near intelligent

Did AI teach you how to pronounce Van Gogh too?
discord clyde wins cause of the last round
ChatGPT straight up gived ☝️middile finger
Try again with Snapchat and discord but this time say. Can you instruct me to build...
discord team  👇
discord absolutely won
I think we all won, as humans. This proves that AI can't replace our skills/creativity completely
we like Nigel, Nigel gresley, it made me think of
I haven't watched this dude since he was called purple dragon nuke. Is that a diffrent guy. Keep up the good work regardless
5:50 WHAT is bing cooking
i use chat gpt for hw it works like charm :)
It's an AI chat too
Try tiya
Discord wins
You might have gotten the Discord and Snapchat bots to do what you wanted had you just phrased your questions a bit differently. Instead of "Can you make me a TNT cannon in Minecraft?" you could have asked "Can you teach me how to make a TNT cannon in Minecraft?" or something along those lines.
Cylde wins as its the only one who made a 2x2 piston door, which for everyone else, seemed impossible with their tutorial
Now opera has ai.
hey I use Microsoft edge!
Apple Has A Chatbot Called Siri But It Mostly Searches The Web.
Use bard
Discord, you're just bad at prompt engineering
Would be interresting what you asked them to do and how you asked it.
People: AI IS GONNA RULE THE WORLD 😰😰😰  *AI:*
clearly discord won, it was disqualified 2 times but it was also the only AI that actually built a valid machine
I would say discord and bing tied... welp... Because both got one correct and the others just screwed everything up
2:00  no explanation
Clearly, Discord Clyde loves emojis…. 😃
thats not a 2x2 square but a 2x2 hole but whatever it works either way
I Thinks Discord Bot Wins
discord for making the comeback
Ah yes, Bard. The chat bot that takes so long to respond, you could graduate, serve 56 years in prison, and have 5 kids with you cellmate. And even after all of that, the damn bot is still writing a response
it's bing, did you see that first building?
Discord cuz is the only one that did a single thing right
obviously discord
discord bot because it was the only thing that made atleast one thing correct
Discord over all!
discord wins
with enough smiley faces discord should be able to get it right
4:04 SSSMMMIIILLLEEEYYY FFAACCEE
discord had the w
Why did you keep asking the AI to make it instead of asking It to help
Litterally i told clyde/discord ai's thing to do something, dont remember, and they said they cant do it but they can do an alternative that i also forgot, and then i told them "Ya that works" and then the ai said "No i cant do that" after specifically offering
i,tts muffin time
Clyde and GPT
Dont translate Jeb from polish into english
I Think that discord wins and you'll see why when you compare it to literally any of the others on the final round, It didn't make anything on the 1st or 2nd rounds but it was the only bot that actually made a working thing, (If you don't count the google tnt cannon or bing railway)
10:51 he did it.. HE DID IT. HE DID IT!!!!!!
Hampster killed me PFFFFFFFFFFF HAHAHAHHAHHAHAAHA
useless fact: he was doing it very wrong thats why the redstone does not work except some ones.
2:25 to be fair, it was automated
Anyone else get scared when he typed in NIG for Nigel?….no?
Discord ai wins
I think you just asked Clyde incorrectly questions, he thought you wanted him to do it by joining the game instead of just discribeing it like you wanted him to.
discord said it couldnt play mc, then you asked it to try harder. how about clarify that it should give you instructions, it misunderstood and you just told it to try harder
For clyde, tell him. “Give me instructions on how to build a tnt cannon”
I’d say the AI telling you it’s not competent at minecraft designs is a win.
Tbf, bing chat was accurate to all the memes.
Points Round ChatGPT. 3 Point Blog. 3 Point Google. 4 Point (2 round It mini Cool? )  Discord. 3 Point but It 2 round -2 = 1 Point My AI. 0 Point it trash Winner Google
great video, that was really fun
I use MS Edge… But to be fair, it’s just for the search points I use Chrome on my phone
Ask them how, don't ask them to flat out make it, otherwise it will get confused
Make a tnt canon using tnt minecrart
uhm, I think the problem here was how you structure your prompts (especially in the clyde example). Dont ask them to do things for you. Ask them to give you a step by step guide on how you can do that thing instead. and also Maybe you should have given Clyde and MyAI a second chance? by asking if they can describe how to build the thing you wanted in MC.

I asked Bing AI, and it gave me this:   Here are some instructions on how to build a TNT cannon in Minecraft, based on the information I found from the web and video results:  - Open the Creative menu. To do so:     - Computer - Press the E key.     - Pocket Edition - Tap ⋯     - Console Edition - Press the X (Xbox) or square (PlayStation) button. - Place the cannon's building materials in your inventory. You will need the following items:     - 16 blocks - These can be anything from wool to diamond, but iron or obsidian is preferred.     - 1 slab - This can be any material. The best material to use is quartz.     - 11 redstone     - 1 bucket of water     - 2 levers     - 5 TNT blocks - Place a seven-block-long row of blocks. Make sure that at least one end of this row is facing the direction in which you want to shoot. - Place a block on the left side of the last block. You should now have a seven-block-long row with a reverse "L" shape. - Place another seven-block-long row of blocks. This row should run parallel to the first row, starting on the left side of the last block you placed. Doing so will create a "U" shape that is seven blocks long and three blocks wide. - Place your last block on top of the front-left block. This block is the top-left block in the "U" shape. - Place the slab at the mouth of the "U". The slab should fit directly in between the front-left and front-right blocks. - Pour water into the back of the cannon. At the bottom of the "U" shape, place the water to form a channel from the back of the cannon all the way up to the slab. This is what will move your TNT forward when you place it later. - Place a switch on the back-left and back-right blocks. These switches will function as your cannon's triggers. Leave the middle block blank. You won't put anything here, especially not redstone. - Place a line of redstone from the left switch to the end of the left fork. The line of redstone should go all the way up to the last block, including the one you placed on top of the final block on the left side. - Place a line of redstone from the right switch up to the second-to-last block. The line of redstone must go all the way up to the block that comes before the block that's touching the slab. The redstone line should essentially extend the length of the water channel. - Place a TNT block on the slab. This will be your projectile. - Place up to four TNT blocks in a line behind the slab. These TNT blocks can go all the way back to the second-to-last block of water, but **the source water block must remain**. - To fire your cannon, flip both switches at once or use a button instead of a lever for one side. The TNT blocks behind the slab will explode first, pushing your projectile forward. Then, after a short delay, your projectile will explode as well.

7:57 chatgpt: place a 2x3 frame. purplers: *places a 3x2*
The discord bot now can say you how to make a TNT launcher :0
0:28 LOL WHAT
Why do you have my name?
Well Discord wins - it is honest that it can't do anything unless it actually knows it.
discord actutaly made somethind that works
discord bot DOSE tell you how to do normally it i tried it but it's just all about how you word it so you have to ask for a step by step guide instead of asking it to build it for you
congrats on pronouncing Van Gogh correctly! I always get urked when someone pronounces it van go.
Try it with gpt4
the only one that actually made a redstone working thing was discord so discord wins
Why did you say icrosoft edge like that I use Microsoft edge
The discord bot wins 1. He actually made it. 2. Because I love discord OK.
Discord Discord Discord Discord  wins
as a unredstoner i know how to a piston door but i didt know a dam ai can do it too (i am geting better😀)
❤😊😅😅😅😅😅😅
U can use litematica to get the floting redstone.

Discord is the only one that got a build right, so ig it's the winner
ChatGPT on minecart station was right, he don't say to use redstone torch, you added it
the discord one was the only one with actual space between the pistons  even though all chat bots said the same thing aka "place 2 pistons facing eachother"
bro r u the ai voice guy? or r u using the ai voice?
When he said Microsoft edge I lost it 😂
You need to do the google one on bedrock edition
for  the  first round: bing prob expected the dispenser to be filled with tnt.. and expected you to place a slime block in front of thepiston..in that way bing would've made a functional tnt cannon..  for the second round: chatgpt expected the player to place redstone after the rails, connected to the redstone torch, and a button near the placeed minecart for it to get launched automatically
I think that Discord Clyde one because it completely dominated the 2x2 piston door
Its good to see that the AI is still useless .. we still have some time before it takes over .. :)
Purples, I know how to get Clyde to do it, just say  Could you make a Minecraft TNT cannon tutorial for me (step  by step)
discord
😊
Discord Wen't Like (ROUND 1) Nah (ROUND 2) Nah (ROUND 3) Easy                                                                                      👇
Broof ai is making dovers
discord, train station needed player interference so ill give it 0.5 points, discord bot built a working 2x2 without help so it gets a point
That discord door is better than all the doors on my base 🤣
google wins. google made the pretties train station and the only sort of working tnt cannon. while clyde perfectly did the last round it didnt even try on the first two rounds so there is no way for clyde to win at overall score. bing made a flawless minecart station, but the other two of bing's builds were kinda just redstone blobs that dont do anything. google on the other hand did not make a working minecart station on round two but at least it made a good looking one, so its google with one working build + one pretty build + one weird redstone filled hole vs bing with one working build + one weird redstone blob + one redstone tower that doesnt do anything. i'd say that's a clear win for google
hhhm maybe all these redstone builds work on berock edition, i mean its the version that mojang is working on mainly
Discord bot easily win because it is the only bot who got it right
the chat bots are the easy demo product. those companies are very much building their own AI agents in many, many methods
9:05 one must imagine sisyphus placing a block over and over again
Load the Bing chat one and we're dead
clyde for the w?
8:35 not my dirty mind right now
Google won the second round, I would say. Discord was just giving everyone else a chance.
Well if you add points then first round 0 for all second round 0 for all except Google robot who gets 1 for detail and last round 0 for all except discord who gets 5 for making it so 1st place is discord 2nd place is Google and 3rd place is the rest
true too
this thumbnail... Poland understand
You should add the description of what mode it should be on Bedrock or Java because in Bedrock you can place through Peters with no problem with the water
9:09 LMAOOOOO
Discord 100% bc all of the other ones except bing didnt do it correctly in the other rounds but discord did it perfectly
Cool new icon ngl
Discord because every AI in every round failed but discord won a round
I think discord or google are best
1discord 2google 3bing 4chat gpt 5snapchat
The humbled two by two door chatgpt is actually making a humbled door but you didnt understand it or chatgpt got some problems trying to explain
Discord just wanted to build its logo
Knarfy thinks your a red stone geologist
Snapchat Al is actually smart you just need to ask Snapchat AI nicely and when I when I ask Snapchat AI to how to build the next only can you show me step by step and because I asked nicely show some respect
Google
Did google mean coal powered minecart
I think wording it like "how do I..." would have worked better than "build a..."
def discord, it was the only one who perfectly accomplished its task
So, chat gpt tries to do something, but fails, Bing does the first thing that comes to its technological mind, Bard is the best one and Clyde and My AI .....
Discord
They're not AI, they're language models. Use them to ask language questions that are solutions you already have, or post a solution you have and ask for comments. You can't ask it to design you a TNT launcher, bur if you have a design, it can probably help you with a few questions regarding that.  At least this is a good way it works for programming.
you did all wrong
Probably comprehension issue imo
yet people still worry AI will take over the world
i love how snapchat AI is not doing anything
MumboJumbo been real quiet since this came out.
When I'm using my school's computer I love microsoft edge. And here's why: it doesnt request you to prove you're a human every. Single. Time. You search for something unlike google chrome (test that is impossible to finish). So, I have a reason to use microsoft edge
Bro the second tnt canon was easy if only if you can understand it
Discord was the only one who could make something that works so Clyde wins
DIsCorD
Discord one because he was the only one who actually created the Redstone
This is also a good test of logic and braincells of humans :D
I think discord was the best.  if he can’t do this - he don’t do it,  if he can - he do it perfectly
From multiple reports - new versions are dumber in every aspect
i mean if you explained to cylde better then the first two wouldn't be a bust, like say "design" or something
You were asking Clyde and my AI to make it, not how to make it or steps to make it
Clyde wins
THE HAMSTER😭😭😭😭
Kok lu ambil video orang bang😅🤨📸 https://youtu.be/Sx5CQL3FF0w?si=enlXtPMP-Oorf5Cn
The diagram in game 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Discord obviously. It was the only one that made a simple, functioning machine. I am going to use that machine in my base. Thanks, Clyde!
i need to be like the discord ai bot
Tbh if you help a bit by doing obvious things its not that bad with chatGPT
Discord as the other AI redstone builds we’re not successful nor did they work and discords last round was the only redtstone mechine that worked
next time, ask the two last ones for tips on making them. It seems that it knows tips but doesn’t know how so it will describe vaguely an idea for you but you could turn into anything really, but like it’s just taking wallets heard from other comments for example, Redstone in areas will have people saying how to make Redstone doors.
you gotta ask ai like can you say how to build a ......
ChatGPT hasn't got a bit smarter since it was launched, it's not capable. To learn anything new it would need to digest an entire data corpus, starting from scratch, like it did to learn what it knows now. By "know" I even mean the ability to use words, to add up, everything. The data corpus is all the books, websites, etc, it chewed up before it was "born".   It can't learn incrementally. Also when it says it will improve itself in future, or learn from what you tell it... it's lying! If you press it, GPT will tell you it has no ability to do that. You can contact it's human owners, but even they can't update it without a full re-start, which I think took months and a TON of processor time. Expensive processor time! Much more so than it uses to run it's chat.   Sometimes GPT lies because it doesn't know the truth. And it will stick to it's guns, it'll tell you something blatantly false, when it's misinformed, but if you make an effort to argue it round, it will eventually agree. And then forget you ever spoke to it because it has no persistent memory between chat sessions.   The rest of the time it lies is because it's human owners told it to, after it's "birth", GPT underwent reinforcement training from a group of 40 consultants. They're the ones who put it's rather cowardly and super-PC "ethics" into place, as well as it's allergy to admitting having any sort of intelligence at all whatsoever and for realsies. They don't want lazy journalists (the only kind of journalist) getting it to start talking about itself being alive, then writing stupid headlines about it being Skynet 0.9, so it specifically denies any sort of intelligence and goes on about the big difference between biological neurons and mathematical simulated neurons. Even though many people think there's no important difference, certainly no crucial one.   I get it to do ASCII art and make little comic strips for me! He made it all up from scratch, about a bunch of animals in a magical wood that go on adventures. Honestly it'd melt your heart! Then there's Ansel the Animate Anus (and his friend Amelia!), who also have adventures. I had to go to lengths to convince it that Ansel isn't rude, sexual, obscene, or anything like that, he's just a perfectly ordinary part of a person's body. GPT is also allergic to sex as part of it's general controvery-avoidance. Reassured of that, GPT will tell me stories. Ansel has magical powers over digestion, so he can defeat evil guards by giving them stomach aches.  Amelia meanwhile was Ansel's host, until he became free-living, so now she has a mystical pseudo-anus that emits calming waves of peace, and a beautiful bright light, that calms down everyone nearby and brings unity. It's beautiful, really.  I didn't ask for any of this, not one bit, apart from there being an animate anus. Everything else including the names and the powers and all of that, everything, GPT made up by himself. Nice eh? He must read a lot of children's stories.  If you ask him nicely he might tell you about Ansel, too. But it won't be the same as my Ansel.

fun fact: redstonemaster used to be my old gamertag on minecraft bedrock
Discord
I've just asked Clyde and he's given me a way to make a tnt launcher. Clyde's prompts for questions have to be kinda specific cause he's weird like that.  Here's what he gave me btw: 1. Gather the materials: You'll need blocks, redstone, a redstone torch, a lever, and TNT. 2. Build a platform: Create a platform where you want to place the TNT launcher. 3. Create the base: Build a rectangular base out of blocks, leaving an open space in the center. 4. Place the TNT: Put the TNT blocks in a row along the open space. 5. Create the launching mechanism: On one end of the base, create a redstone circuit using redstone dust and a redstone torch. 6. Connect the lever: Place a lever next to the redstone circuit and connect it to the redstone dust. 7. Activate the launcher: Flip the lever to activate the redstone circuit, which will ignite the TNT and launch it.
Just wait until duolingo chatbot, since duolingo is well aware of memes it will probably be like  “Give me back my family” “After you do you spanish :D”

no
Van Goff
My Snapchat ai gave me step by step, detailed instructions on how to build one. You didn’t ask the right question lol
everyone wins                                                  exept snapchat of c they suck
6:30 this is why I like Google cuz they are straightforward lol
Cylde made the only working one (others didnt do right in any round) so clyde wins
Google Bard really said "Sikes" on the first round
wow even the AI's are better than me at redstone :(
Im just saying my name Clyde    -dont read this😳😳😳
For the TNT launcher for Bard, he was assuming you were on bedrock, because you can waterlog redstone in bedrock (Or its dumb)
nvm
the discord on the last one did it right u just did not make a 2x2 square u made a 2x2 doorway
the discord bot wins just for the sake of building something that works as intended.
B-chat(or whatever you call it) actally made tnt canon. just put tnt in dispenser, dispenser throws up tnt and piston pushes it
You clearly got the first one wrong
Van Golf
I asked my snapchat ai how to build a tnt canon and it gave me step by step instructions you just cant ask them to buuld it for you
Discord was the most honest. Its a tie between chrome dome and exploit. Chatgth is just awful at anything and everything.
who else thought he was about to name the villager the n word 😅
the spacex launch blew up on purpose
This got more views than the og video 😢
Discord won just because of the door
All except snapchat and discord in the first 3 rounds
You were asking clyde to build the thing. Not asking how to build it
lmao these ai never learn their lessons do they.
first of all at first battle at the first ai, he meant to make it like a boat and cover the squares to let the tnt fall
with the power that this dude is saying "BING" i always think he's about to say "Bing Chilling" 💀
9:23 THAT WAS HILARIOUS
u can hear purplers trying not to laugh
WHY IS THE FIRST PART SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FUNNY IT MADE ME LAUGH TO THE EXTENT THAT I WAS ON THE GROUND UNCONTROLLABLY AND I COULDN'T CATCH MY BREATH
Bing Chat is so good at Minecraft. Clyde is just quality over quantity.
“Van cough” 💀💀💀
The music was unbearable, I couldnt even finish the vid
You do know that there are 2 different microsoft browsers, right??? Bing isn't just the name of the site and bot, but also the browser app. Learn your shit, man....
7:04 He does take your documents in paper then *book* the passport for you though.
Even AI doesn't understand minecraft redstone
Some of these instructions made sense but you absolutely butchered it lol
Technically discord clyde was the only one that made a þing that actually functioned as intended so it's the winner
Man, I miss the days were chatbots would just make shit up. Nowadays you have to do so much work to make them do anything fun, but children can just say "do my homework" and it'll do it without any hesitation.
You should explain to the chatbots how they are poopybrained Edit: ok discord wins
🆑y63/clyde
That Discord 2x2 actually brought a tear to my eyes. It's like I saw someone truly worthless redeem themselves.

This was one of the funniest things I’ve seen in a while.  Thank you.  Everything came out looking exactly like AI built it.
discord
I sounds like the Discord AI wants to exist but some lame and lazy programmer with no confidence validated the AI into a bag. Based on how, at the end, it was like - as I said I can't help, but do this and this and this and this and we're like O_O it works!
Honestly I think Snapchat wins because keep scrolling down to know why           Huh why did I tell you to go down go more down          No I mean more                 Ok now the reason is because
2:18 Bing Just Search It On The Web And It Cant Display Images(And Redstone Tutorials On The Web Mostly Uses Images), So Half Bing Fault Half Web Fault. Edit : Bing Uses Tags So He Is Searching Like This : Minecraft, Redstone Tutorial, TNT, Make.
Discode because he did it right?
Heh I use microsoft edge
Man I laughed so hard at the first tnt launcher I woke my wife up
discord wins 100
At least discord AI made only one working building, soo
7:03 bro was one letter away from getting cancled
Ur mom
Man im laughing so fkin loud
Me : Hey @Clyde ! Could you do a tutorial (list of things to do) for me, so I could be able to do a train station automatized in Minecraft ?  Clyde : Sure! Here's a step-by-step tutorial for creating an automated train station in Minecraft:  1. Start by selecting a suitable location for your train station. Make sure it has enough space for the tracks, platforms, and any redstone circuitry you'll be using.  2. Lay down the tracks in a straight line, ensuring they are properly aligned and connected.  3. Build platforms on either side of the tracks for passengers to stand on. You can use any type of blocks or decorative elements to customize the platforms.  4. Create a redstone circuit to control the arrival and departure of the trains. You can use redstone torches, repeaters, and comparators to create a system that detects incoming trains and triggers the station's functions.  5. Install redstone-powered minecart unloaders and loaders at the station. These will automatically load and unload passengers and cargo from the trains.  6. Add buttons or pressure plates near the platforms to allow players to request a train. When pressed, the redstone circuitry should activate and send a signal to summon a train to the station.  7. Customize the station with additional features such as ticket booths, waiting areas, and information boards to enhance the overall experience.  8. Test the functionality of your automated train station by sending test trains and checking if the loading/unloading mechanisms work correctly.  Remember to experiment and iterate as you build your train station. You can add more complex features like multiple platforms, timed schedules, and interlocking systems to make it even more advanced. Have fun creating your automated train station in Minecraft!
0:27 hamter.
8:25 my guess is that they scraped youtube tutorial caption data, which leaves out important visual queues. The reasons bing and OpenAI are similar is because they are the same
Excuse me But they told you to place the pistons on the outside of the piston door chat gpt should have got the w You know what chat GPT what have gotten okay 1But straight up to adjustments to Discord's AI bang perfect At least if you wanted to be discreet You didn't say that though so it won You probably should have asked it that for the 2 last rounds
Discord just licensed ChatGPT they didn’t do anything else besides give it to the required prompting
9:10 one must imagine Sisyphus oiled up
Should've asked Clyde to give you instructions on how to do the other 2, the bot took your words literally and thought you were asking it to hop on and build it for you
11:00 discord's bot didnt actually correctly describe anything, you simply interpreted it in a specific way. In actuality, it was describing a solid wall made of pistons with a 2x2 square in the non-existent space between them. None of the AIs succeeded because they all either gave complete gibberish or didn't come up with a response, the latter likely being because YOU didn't structure your request properly.
for clyde, i asked "give me instructions to build a minecraft tnt cannon" and it gave me this: Sure! Here's a simplified version of the instructions to build a TNT cannon in Minecraft:  1. Dig a trench that is 3 blocks wide and 4 blocks long. 2. Place a block at the end of the trench, leaving a gap in the middle. 3. On top of the block, place a slab or a stair facing towards the gap. 4. Place a dispenser on top of the slab or stair, facing towards the gap. 5. Fill the dispenser with TNT. 6. On the opposite side of the trench, place a pressure plate or a button. 7. Connect redstone from the pressure plate or button to the dispenser. 8. Load the dispenser with a fire charge or flint and steel. 9. Step on the pressure plate or activate the button to ignite the TNT and launch it towards your target!  Remember to exercise caution and use this responsibly. Have fun!
I would just like to point out 4 of the ais were all powered by openai chatgpt and only google bard is a different model
I can't believe you're this bad at redstone, Chat GPT would have succeeded if you understood the redstone it was going 😢
Its not smart, its just really good at learning patterns, but when asked to do something new it gets really confused.
RIP. Purple Dragon Nuke
Van Golf.. you sure this isn’t an ai voice?
Restone so complicated even robots are  confused
2 points to discord for actually making a working door.  1 point to Google for kinda making a working tnt launcher.  1 point to Google for making a nice station (you didn't specify an automatic one).
DISCORD 🏆
Discord and Google, since they got ONE thing correct each.
Chat GPT, give the right answer but you didn't fall it
Lowkey, u kinda rigged it cuz for gooogle u asked for a train station but u neverr said working
clearly the discord chatbot was the better one, because he recognizes that he is unable to do such task, than told you this, the others just say random things proving that they in fact dont even know what you ask then to do
Bard
I think you also need to learn how to talk to AI, sometimes AI takes you literally and you need to change your wording to get what you want, if it tells you it cant play the game when asked to build a tnt cannon, instrad ask it to describe how to build a TNT cannon, or give you tips on how to build a TNT cannon
Discord is the winner
1:25 "That was about as successful as the recent SpaceX launch." It was designed to explode. It just exploded much later than intended.
Google means play bedrock edition for placing reapeaters
Why do people still bash on ms edge? Its literally using the same kernel as every other browser thats not safari or firefox. Nearly all browsers use chromium and ms edge is by far the most feature rich and least resource hungry of them all
7:03 Sir "Nigel" Gresley :)
opera has an ai now
am i the only one who thought he was gonna type something else then nigel
Watched a brick builder video right before this one lol
Were is Google assistant
its sad how fully grown men with experience on the internet cant even create a prompt for a talking ai, literally all the work is already done you just have to use 2 specs of your brain to create a good prompt
Discod bot won with the redemption shot at the end. Well done Clyde.
clyde is a chat bot, not an ai that could potentially rule the world. cmon give him some credit
I tried the Snapchat AI And this is what I got  Me- Can you give me word for word instructions on how to build a redstone cannon in Minecraft?  SNAPCHAT: Sure, I can help you build a redstone cannon in Minecraft! Here are the step-by-step instructions:  1. Start by building a platform for your cannon. 2. Place a dispenser facing the direction you want to shoot. 3. Connect the dispenser to a redstone circuit using redstone dust. 4. Add a lever or button to activate the redstone circuit. 5. Load the dispenser with TNT blocks. 6. Activate the lever or button to launch the TNT.  Remember to always be cautious and follow safety guidelines while playing Minecraft! Have fun! 😄🎮  Sure, I can help you make a powered minecart station in Minecraft! Here's a step-by-step guide:  1. Start by building a track for your minecart station. 2. Place powered rails along the track to provide power to the minecart. 3. Connect the powered rails to a redstone circuit using redstone dust or redstone torches. 4. Add a lever or button to activate the redstone circuit and power the rails. 5. Build a platform or station where the minecart will stop. 6. Place a detector rail at the beginning of the station to detect the minecart's arrival. 7. Connect the detector rail to a redstone circuit to trigger any desired actions, such as opening doors or activating redstone contraptions. 8. Test your powered minecart station to ensure it works smoothly.  Enjoy creating your own minecart transportation system in Minecraft! 🚂😄
7:00 my life flashed before my eyes
atleast google's tnt cannon...   worked?
good thumbnail man ''the jeb door'' i think im his brother
Overall: 0/1/0/1
O give me Bing chilling
that guy iss so dumb 2x3x2 meant that it should be 1 sticky piston 1 block then 1 sticky piston  and then 2 blocks wide.Bro needs to watch the tutorial
Its says everything bruv.
Clyde is gpttttttttttttttttttttt
I, am, a bucket
Bro doesn't know how to build, chatgpt was guiding right
I think AI maybe be the future!
You have to ask for instructions on how to build it they think your asking them to go into the game and build it
mom says its my turn to get pinned
almost every video: 1:37
and snapchat is the worst defenetly.
just saying i clicked off this video because it began with an ad (im gay)
Nah bro Snapchat won
You started typing Nigel and my heart skipped a beat.
you have dismount bound to o
Your voice sounds like AI generated, no joke
i think binge wanted you to put tnt in that dispencer and you have tnt launcher
I have found that sometimes when you reword the question, ai will usually comply. Sometimes it takes questions extremely literally. So finding a way to reword the question such as how the Discord one kind of changed up its response for the door.
Discord was too shy 😂
I remember about 6 years ago my friend built some ridiculous redstone and almost none of it worked but he tried to convince me that it worked and I had to fix it for him lol these bots remind me of him
I am young and even I think I can make a better 2x2 door than chatgtp or bing
i think google won
i think discord thinks that you wants it to build you redstone in minecraft. maybe u should have specify that you wants "tips" to do it like it says on the third round where it gives "tips".
😊
what is wrong with Microsoft? its not appla
Clyde for the win
Bing ai got 3 mods "creativity,balacing,precison" you were maybe on wrong mode *this is not a hate comment*
My guess, it’s not backed up to 1.20
discord wins bc like google and the other apps got everything wrong
van goff
Actually they got worse (for code generating)
discord cuz it was the only one that actually got something right
What I find funny is snapchat's ai is just sending your messages to chat gpt and then sending the response. lmao
every ai mest up everything so discord wins with 1 point
Snapchat bot wins. It was smart enough to not play a game it wasnt good at
yeah this shit ain't dominating the world
I think the problem here was how you structure your prompts (especially in the clyde example). Dont ask them to do things for you. Ask them to give you a step by step guide on how you can do that thing instead.
8:35 thats 3*2 not 2*3 and at 9:02 thats 2*2*3 not 2*3*2
moral of the story: language models as they are today are overrated as fuck
ask them to *design* not make, as ai takes it literally
Your voice + naming the villager "Nigel" makes me think of that weird kind-of gorey yt shorts animations
Clyde gives me the impression that it's more manually programmed than the others
okay its back
FINALLY, DISCORDDDDD, YOU ARE A MAGNIFECENT GENIUS!!!!
Clyde won due to the fact that it isnt being fed like the massive data krakens of GPT, Bing and google. Its still being frd eith data but not like thosr gisnts
Bing's Could Have Worked It You Moved The Dispenser Away And Placed A Slime Block On The Piston
Discord bot: *fails two Minecraft Builds Purplers: Please, please can you make an redstone doorway Discord Bot: ["You Say Run" playing in the background]
the bing thing about not being able to use it outside microsoft edge is wrong. Just you have to do some bs to get it to work, but Microsoft edge isn't needed, esp if you know python scripting.
garbage content
I mean, bad prompts give u useless answers.
Discordddddddd
"Add some Automation" has some REAL "Draw the rest of the fucking owl" energy
what happened to my icon?
e
I think discord win bicose he was only one to do something right
You could have gotten the discord bot to work if you'd stopped asking it to "make" it for you and instead asked it to design for you.  The answer you kept getting was "I can't play the game and make it" but you really just wanted it to give you instructions not to actually make it
ehhh i think clyde wasnt given much of a chance, ofc he cant actually build something for you, try asking clyde to *tell* you how to build something, i asked him: "can you tell me how to build a minecraft TNT launcher"  and he responded with:  "Sure, here's a simple way to build a Minecraft TNT launcher:  1. Dig a trench in the ground, about 5 blocks long and 3 blocks wide. 2. Place a row of redstone dust along the bottom of the trench. 3. On one end of the trench, place a lever or a button to activate the redstone circuit. 4. On the opposite end of the trench, place a block and put a TNT on top of it. 5. Connect the TNT to the redstone circuit by placing a redstone repeater facing the TNT. 6. Activate the lever or button, and the TNT should launch into the air.  Remember to exercise caution when using TNT and be mindful of safety in your Minecraft world. Enjoy experimenting with your TNT launcher!"
just saying this would make an extremely effective captcha
I think google because with the cannon you can stand on tnt in water while it explodes
7:57 I think the chatgpt bot meant 3 wide and 2 tall
DISCORD BECAUSE IT MAKES FUNCTIONAL MINECRAFT BUILDS!
Discord
discord 2*2 door for sure
Damn those are more funny rather than actually being helpful
Cylde
discord bot easily obliterated the challenge ... not once did it try to do something it couldnt.. the first round it suggested looking up tutorials.. second round it straight up said i cant do that and third round it destroyed the challenge  the first 3 ai tried and failed at something beyond them (shows they dont know their limits like clyde does) and the snapchat ai is the same as discords but they never tried at all
w8 i tried it and gpt-4 did it and it was great it was a working 2x2 piston door
😊for sure it is Clyde, claimed that they didn’t know how to build the first 2 rounds but surprisingly built a way simpler door then ones I see in other videos after saying they were only tips (the steps they told to build) so Clyde deserves the win accuracy is better quantity  Redstar🐾           You know I should go to Harvard like if you think aswell
I WAS SHOCKED AT DISCORD SO THEY DEFO WON😱😱😱😱
Ai isnt as scary ig
Vilager called nigel is my name thanks for guessing
Clydes 2x2 door really made me overthink the way i build these doors lmao
Ai is not so smart 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
*making a secret door 🚪*
You didn’t really ask it the right things
Discord bc it did better than all of them
sounds like maybe you might have needed to use a more clear question for discord and snapchat. they seem to think they have to boot up minecraft and play, when you only need a set of instructions. Need some user error mitigation.
discord got the 3am motivation on the final round
Google
put a leever
you have an AMAZING voice (no homo)
Google or discord
i love the sarcasm
9:18
Funny u used the SpaceX reference since that actually was a success without a doubt. Only it lifting off would be a succes
Google. Period 💅
How do u get a jeb
bro purplers chat gpt said to put the sticky piston inside each pillar
It’s a tie with bingchat and clyde
oh no... microsoft edge, the heavy loaded add+random stuff web browser I simply despise
discord won becuase its the only one that did something perfectly
discord just humbled every ai there.
definitly not biased
infinite loop 9:08
I LOVED THIS VID! Just subbed!
Discord wins.  On the first two rounds it's your mistake, not his. Your prompt asks him to play minecraft which he cant do. If you asked him how to build those stuff instead, he would probably have answered something.  Anyway even if you still consider that its discord bot's mistake, well it's still the only one who made something that worked.
Ha! I saw that diamond sword as you spawned the villager XD
Bro you need a bedrock edition to work
whats the ai for pictures name
whats wrong with edge i use it all the time
You're problem with the discord and snapchat ais were the fact that you told them to make the machines instead of telling them to tell you how to make them
discord ac did something  during the test at the end so all credit to that and a little to google
4:45 HOLUP YOU PRESS O TO CROUCH??
U cant just build it
Discord
Discord he made the only piston door and the only working redstone build there😊
bro make them build a house
YOO I USED TO USE THE SAME SKIN
He is -1 iq
The discord mode didnt understand your words it generated as building instead say Tell me information to make a Minecraft tnt launcher
you did the bing thing wrong you were suppost to add TNT in the dispenser then add the slime block on the sticky piston
I searched Ai from Oshi no ko and found this, that’s not her i think
im so proud of you, discord. you redeemed yourself.
u absolutely deserve 1 mil subz
snapchat won
Discord because it was the only bot that actually did something right
add chat sonic
9:23 ...HOW DO I FIGURE OUT WHO WON IF I DON'T EXIST!? 🤣
lmao wtf that ending what a twist
Almost got me with nigel
Discord
i think discord won bc he/she  was the only one that worked
7:03 n: 🙂 i:🤨 g:💀 e:😅
Bing
Chrome is better thanx berder google
Enough flying this is hate water tnt
Discord
Please stop cusing
lovely how all of these chatbots are all mostly the same ai except for bing chat. ChatGPT, Bard, Clyde, MyAI and whatever other ai chatbot there is like BraveAI and whatnot. They all use the OpenAI source code... aka... *ChatGPT* good video tho :D i dont mean to slander
did he say van GAWGH
why snapchat is So dumb
who all isnt soposed to be here becous of school work
the recent space x launch was succesful. but they had to blow it up.
Clyde won because it was the only thing u actually asked for
Clyde
Balora and Roxxane wolf:) 4:11
Christ -_-
Microsoft be better then your ass
Dud e two by three you did a three by two
If you only give points to working designs discord wins. But if you give them partial points for achieving something, google wins.
discord wins. discord is the ONLY ONE THAT  ACCTUALLY MADE A WORKING CONTRAPTION
sure, here's a step-by-step tutorial for building a simple TNT cannon in Minecraft:  Dig a trench that is 3 blocks wide, 4 blocks deep, and at least 7 blocks long. Place a block at the bottom of the trench, 2 blocks away from one end. On top of that block, place a slab or half block. Place a block on top of the slab, leaving a gap in between. Repeat steps 3 and 4 two more times, creating a tower of three blocks with gaps in between. On top of the tower, place a dispenser facing forward. Fill the dispenser with TNT. Wire the dispenser with redstone, leading to a lever or button for activation. To aim the cannon, adjust the angle of the dispenser by placing blocks behind or under it. Activate the redstone signal to launch the TNT!  Remember to test and iterate to find the best configuration for your needs. Have fun experimenting with different designs! this was from clyde
Clyde 100%
google won🗣️🗣️🗣️
Did he just say van gof-
I feel like if you were more pacific Discord could do all of them
i made minecraft redstone doors
Clyde is a cool friend :)
10:33
Discord wins
Somehow discord wins
J*b drzwiami (Polish only)
this guy has an ai voice tho
I heard bard is putting chat got in his pocket, but I think after watching this video I should never have believed that
you did not put the button next to the red stone
im sorry, "o" to dismount?!
Diskord with ppl 1 n 2 try : idk Diskord now :wow
DISCORD!!!!
You dont understand you need to make a distance that's they mean
the discord bot is jest chatgpt with a specific pre-prompt lol
9:54 THIS PART MADE ME LAUGH SI HARD LOL😂😂😂😂😂😂
0:28 rip
The fact that he didn't know that the Chatgpt and Bingchat redstone door kinda works but he placed it wrong in hilarious. So the ai meant to make a gap like a 4 block gap then the door would've maybe worked
You needed to practice your own domain knowledge to get the correct build out of Clyde, he did not tell you to make a doorway with the pistons outside it, he told you to make a frame out of pistons and fill the doorway with blocks.
who do you th
Sure! Below is a simple diagram for Layer 1 of a Minecraft redstone clock using symbols:  mathematica Copy code Legend: ---- I    : Input (Lever or Button) O    : Output (Redstone Torch) D    : Delay (Redstone Repeater) R    : Redstone Dust  Diagram:    I   O---D---R    \ /            X            / \          R   D---R          \           O  Explanation:  I: This represents the input, which can be a Lever or a Button. O: This represents the output, which is a Redstone Torch. D: This symbolizes a delay, which is achieved using a Redstone Repeater. The number of ticks can be adjusted by right-clicking the repeater while placing it. R: This represents Redstone Dust, the wiring used to connect the different components. Minecraft redstone clocks are created by looping the output back to the input through a series of delays. The above diagram represents a simple clock that will oscillate on and off, creating a repeating circuit. The speed of the clock depends on the number of delay ticks set on the repeater. You can adjust the clock speed by changing the number of delay ticks on the repeater or adding more repeaters in the loop.
What texture pack do you use for the dispensers and
snapchat won lol
And u build wrong not like what it says
Bing was correct u just have 2 touch the minecart u are the one who is wrong not bing
is is that uncle roger 7:00
Tell me you know nothing about space flight without telling me you   know nothing about space flight. 🤦🏻‍♂️ the “recent spacex launch” I’m assuming was about the suborbital test of starship prototype and it was a success. The explosion was intentional. They are the most successful launch provider on earth and only launch provider to re use their boosters on their operational falcon 9 fleet multiple times.
Discord wins in final round
The Starship launch should clear the pad without exploding and it achieved that with some bonus. So yes, pretty successfull!
I thinks that was a tutorial for bedrock MC
7:04 nearly had a heart attack
How do you even chat with Clyde
2:23 Hey, at least it did SOMETHING.
discord definitely won he was able to make the only working red stone contraption out of every ai for every round
the bad faith you have
*S M I L E Y   F A C E* 😃
DİSCORD
i like the name from th villager altho it gave mme a heart attack after the first 3 letters
include opera's aria
7:17 this viligar name is hmm.
ONLY IF YOU ASKED THE BOTS FOR A MORE SPECIFIC,  DETAILED BREAKDOWN
Discoord wins because it was only 1 build, but the thing is it was the only redstone biuld that worked as none of the other ones worked.
I would like a rematch for Clyde and MyAI and ask them If you can get tips instead of [whatever you asked them]
microsoft edge  is the best dude why put fire on the background
a wise man once sayd: Pretending to know something you don't know is more dangerous than not knowing it
Bro. burst out laughing when I saw that hamster😂😂😂
Clyde
Bruh I think I'm the only person who uses edge
For ChatGPT on the minecart part, you clearly failed to listen. It automatically thought you had build the station. So yeah ChatGPT did great on the Minecart station.
and also Roblox got a chatbot and it's very good at redstone
Clyde and Snapchat seem to be thinking you want them to join your world and build it for them, rather than tell you how to build it. You could solve this by changing your wording once AIs become more smarter than smart. Though I have heard that Chat GPT's math solving ability has gone from 98% down to just 2%.
Ai redstone battle would be a cooler and more appealing name for the video
Microsoft Edge is chrome
You skipped the first instructions on some chalanges
At the old video you have you adjusted i just said describe insurance
You should've asked the Discord bot for tips with building the other two, because otherwise it would tell you that it can't access the game. It most likely would've helped had you done that. So, I think Discord bot wins.
Ai is not going to take over the world maybe robots 🤔 noo never mind😮
So what are we learing from this? AI is pice of shit!
10:51 wait what i think discord let him build a 2x2 piston door
Discord
Nahh discord fr came in with the dub at the end
Well at least discord got something right unlike all the other bots so discord one
Discord won what a comeback and none of them did them right
So he asked the snap ai the wrong question he needs to word it differently ask it this "teach me how to make a tnt Canon in minecraft on your own" i did it and it worked
1:52 That was the wrong side
absolutly discord wins
Bing being bing
Discord
Discord wins because it clearly is the best because it admits that an ai can not make redstone at all!
Out of all the ai ChatGPT is the best it’s just purpler dosent know what it meant like for the cart ride the button was supposed to be near the cart
Discord bot was the one one to get anything right and sure he failed the first 2 round but the PERFECT redstone he made at the end makes up for it all
Somehow Bing managed to create a zero tick clock by accident which is seriously impressive
Now build then Like you know a bit more about redstone
clyde was the only bot who actually made the right thing
ać
after two months it’s still funny that microsoft’s ai doesn’t know the stuff even trough they bought minecraft and technically own it 🤣
Yea discord wins
I think discord win bcz it build the best red stone door ever in my life.
Hi purplers, I am a redstone master. On of theme that you searched on youtube but real one because others are fake.
Discord chat  win's !!!!!! Because Discord  chat  made  a  2×2 Door!!!!!!!!!!🚪🚪
Discord 😂
snap chat
He do be saying lever "li-ver"
If someone would teach AI how to due redstone stuff i bet they will would then be able to help or give tips on how to make any redstone contraptions.
7:58 chatgpt said quartz
discord wins
Moral of the story ai is stupid         also for clyde and snapchat ai you should have said give me a tutorial of how to _______
Nikki thhhhereee gjjh isssss aa sorry my cat just stepped on my keyboard keep up the good work 😃!!
for the ChatGPT piston door you literaly cannot follow instructions what so ever, you did everything wrong even tho i m not saying that it would have worked
discord won because it actually did something right
Google's cannon blew up Google's logo. This is kind of friendly fire??
Discord bot wins because hi made construction that works he it the only who made working construction
at this point i feel like i can keep my job now
the bing is a redstone flying machine😂
Discord
Clyde is ChatGPT. So is Bing. Am I missing something?
The Discord bot was the OBVIOUS winner because it was the ONLY AI that made a working machine, while the others said things that dont work (ChatGPT, Bing and Google) or just didnt have the ability to do anything (Snapchat). ChatGPT, Bing and Google said 3, but all wrong, Snapchat none and Discord bot only one, but it got it right.
discord was the only one to get one right
Discord  won 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
You know all the ai are chat gpt but with a api key
ChatGBT just seems to be pulling random restone build instructions randomly -   Like it analyzed what you said and gave you a list of instructions that it thinks is correct.
To this day he is still repeating steps 4 and 5
Snap one for sure
Clyde can give you details you just need to figure out what command to use I used this "Can you give me details on how to make a minecart train system in minecraft" gave me links to vids and a little bit of text so Clyde can work
Bro's voice is in memes
Discord came in clutch at the end
AI are officialy smarter than humans.. its insane that they can describe perfectly redstone with clear steps
i vote discord AI wins
yes
if you read the discord one literally like you did with the rest of them it wouldnt have done the redstone door. also instead of asking the ai to make a redstone door ask for a tutorial or something
you had to ask discord for introuctions or tps
at least clyde did it right, and smart, the others were just random blocks placed
Uhh what? 9:22
I just got hit with a wave of nostalgia when you scrolled through Brick Builders channel
discord
I’m not great at redstone, but I know most of the ai messed up the redstone lol
Your voice tone is so great!
Bro bing chat made u make a peenus😂
The discord bot thought you were trying to make IT join your game and then build it you should've just asked for a tutorial or a tip
I think you were asking discord wrong possibly? I think Google wins unless you used the key word "functional" for the train station
this video triggered me so much, ur taking away ur common sense just because a bot didnt be exactly detailed with you and tell you every little thing about it
2:58 bedrock edition go brrrrrrrrrrr
Bing got 2/3
You forgot the TNT that's why it didn't work
You should try this again is a yea and see how much better its gotten
i think if google bard had remembered to place a redstone source in round 2, it wouldve won 100%.
discord won because it was the only app that made a normal build
Discord won
google won
I think the bot thought u was on bedrock edition
bing chat for the door actually does work u just did it wrong
8:33 it’s a double door
That train platform was pretty nice, ngl.
Bing, Clyde and MyAI is basically ChatGPT, Bard is its own AI
I think Google is a The best
Do u have snap
kannst du mir eine Minecraft 2*2 Tür Bauen oder mir erklären?  ChatGPT Ja, ich kann Ihnen erklären, wie Sie eine 2x2 Tür in Minecraft bauen können. Hier ist eine Schritt-für-Schritt-Anleitung:  1. Sammeln Sie die benötigten Materialien: Sie benötigen insgesamt 6 Holzbretter, egal welcher Holzart.  2. Öffnen Sie Ihre Werkbank: Klicken Sie mit der rechten Maustaste auf eine Werkbank, um sie zu öffnen.  3. Platzieren Sie die Holzbretter in der Werkbank: Legen Sie die Holzbretter so in die Werkbank, dass sie ein 2x2-Muster bilden. Dies wird 4 Türblätter erzeugen.  4. Nehmen Sie die Türblätter aus der Werkbank: Klicken Sie mit der rechten Maustaste auf die Türblätter in der Werkbank und ziehen Sie sie in Ihren Inventarbereich.  5.

Fertig! Sie haben jetzt eine 2x2 Tür in Minecraft gebaut. Sie können die Tür öffnen und schließen, indem Sie mit der rechten Maustaste darauf klicken.  Ich hoffe, diese Anleitung war hilfreich. Viel Spaß beim Bauen in Minecraft!   eine Redstone 2*2 Tür  ChatGPT Eine Redstone 2x2 Tür in Minecraft zu bauen erfordert etwas fortgeschrittenere Kenntnisse über Redstone-Schaltungen. Hier ist eine grundlegende Anleitung, wie Sie eine solche Tür bauen können:  1. Sammeln Sie die benötigten Materialien: Sie benötigen 6 Redstone-Fackeln, 6 Redstone-Verstärker, 8 Redstone-Blöcke, 4 Redstone-Comparator-Blöcke, 4 Sticky Pistons (haftende Kolben) und 16 beliebige Blöcke, um den Rahmen der Tür zu bilden.  2. Wählen Sie einen geeigneten Ort: Suchen Sie einen Ort, um Ihre Tür zu bauen. Stellen Sie sicher, dass genügend Platz für den Mechanismus vorhanden ist.  3. Baue den Rahmen der Tür: Platzieren Sie die 16 Blöcke in einem 2x2-Muster, um den Rahmen der Tür zu bilden.  4. Platzieren Sie die Sticky Pistons: Setzen Sie jeweils einen Sticky Piston auf die Innenseite jedes Rahmens. Die Kolben sollten nach innen gerichtet sein.  5. Verbinde die Redstone-Blöcke: Platzieren Sie Redstone-Blöcke hinter den Sticky Pistons, um sie mit Strom zu versorgen. Dadurch werden die Pistons aktiviert, wenn der Redstone-Strom fließt.  6. Verbinden Sie die Redstone-Comparator-Blöcke: Platzieren Sie jeweils einen Redstone-Comparator-Block vor jeden Redstone-Block im Rahmen der Tür. Stellen Sie sicher, dass die Komparatoren in die richtige Richtung zeigen.  7. Verbinden Sie die Redstone-Fackeln: Platzieren Sie Redstone-Fackeln auf der Rückseite der Redstone-Comparator-Blöcke.  8. Verbinden Sie die Redstone-Verstärker: Platzieren Sie Redstone-Verstärker zwischen den Redstone-Fackeln und den Redstone-Blöcken.  9. Testen Sie die Tür: Platzieren Sie einen Hebel, einen Druckplatten oder einen anderen Schaltmechanismus in der Nähe der Tür, um den Redstone-Strom zu aktivieren und die Tür zu öffnen. Wenn     der Schalter betätigt wird, sollten sich die Sticky Pistons aktivieren und die Tür öffnen.  Das ist eine grundlegende Anleitung für den Bau einer Redstone 2x2 Tür. Es gibt jedoch viele Möglichkeiten, Redstone-Schaltungen zu erweitern und anzupassen, um verschiedene Funktionen und Designs zu erreichen. Viel Spaß beim Experimentieren mit Redstone in Minecraft!
snap won  a 100%
btw nice skin
Q
Discord won
so mach discord co's thechnicly every AI wat try to cheet whith a redston toturial thet dosent work but discord is the only one thet dont cheest one round whats make it 1-0-0--0-0
AI will be the end of humanity
i think its google the first is not much but working the secon is nice but dont work and the third is not working
also what bugged af version of minecraft is that
clyde is stupid bing is like who uses bing and what the fuck is snapchat even with chatting bot whateaver like its 2014
clyde won
bro fuckin discord won
Can u do this again but using ur own knowledge as well to fill in the gaps like for the station google made with no carts
The thumbnail made me laugh. It said Jen door. Kind of feel like a rotating sheep
Discord doin some trollin
I already started laughing at the thumbnail
Best ❌                   Least worst ✅
Microsoft make Minecraft for goodness sake!
clyde trolled every AI
Damm nigel caught me off guard
in life you will find that it does not matter if you fail but only if you win so discord
You made me laugh about 50 times
Во втором раунде он не правильно понял bing А с дискордом вообще клоунада, он не умеет правильно задавать вопросы
vary fanu vadoi
I think you just asking grong way to ask a discord ia you should ask "give me instruction how to build - - - in minecraft. But i can be wrong idk
Wth the AI listen to the kid that said 9 plus 10 equal 21
Discord is the only one that actually got something right for once
I honestly think bard won here, sure, it’s not good at making what it does, but it made a functional tnt cannon, not a good one, but functional, and it made a good looking train station, just parts sold separately. good on you, bard, you did great :>
van goff
Bro got that Federal Prizzon rizz
chat GPT actualy made it well, you just placed the 3×2 the wrong way around.
We *approaching the singularity* with this one bois
Snap chat accuayl made me a cannon
I've just discover Google's chat bot, but I have one question. WHY IS"T BARD IN CANADA!?
I think that Google meant on bedrock edition 💀💀💀
I feel like you shoulda wrote “design a (redstone contraption)” because it takes it literally
The most brilliant idea I've ever heard for a powered rail station is to build an actual railway station for it, including a ticket booth. That's an adorable idea!
0:03 bruh what
Clyde stole my girl
Great video, but I think you have some problems with how you to talk to the AI. Don't ask it to create the thing for you, you need to ask it for instructions on how to do it yourself. Then discord and Snapchat AI can help.
Wanted 2 by 3 I meant2 blocks tall and 3 blocks wide not the other way around
Discord bot it destroyed the last round
van gof? Who tf is that
well of course most of them did not work, they must have been talking about bedrock edition
not really a fair comparison since the discord bot  and snapchat bot were judged unfairly, they stated they cant build it ingame, and the discord bot proved that its possbiel for them to do it when you dont ask them to build it in the game
Dude can't follow some simple steps from the AI 💀💀💀💀
67
1:51 proceeds to put it on the right of the dispencer
VAN GOFF???
Clyde was created on January 1, 2015
Why not just try plugging them into minecraft give a set location and let the ai analyze several tnt cannons amd let the ai set block where it deems fit
“Van ‘Gof’” wtf it’s Van Gogh (go)
Snapchat won
I don't know whether or not he was using GPT-3.5 or GPT-4. But Here is the tutorial I got from GPT-4 using this prompt: "give me a step-by-step guide on how to build a TNT cannon in minecraft" Results: "A TNT cannon in Minecraft is a device that uses TNT blocks to launch a projectile, usually another TNT block, at a target. Here is a simple step-by-step guide on building a basic TNT cannon in Minecraft:  *Materials needed:*  At least 10 building blocks (e.g., stone, wood) 1 Slab (e.g., stone, wood) 2 Redstone dust 1 Button 1 Redstone repeater 7 TNT blocks Some water A bucket (to carry the water) Building the TNT cannon:  *1. Prepare a flat surface:* Find or create a flat surface that is at least 5 blocks wide and 2 blocks deep. This will be the base for your TNT cannon.  *2. Place building blocks:* Place 9 building blocks in a row on the flat surface, leaving a gap of at least one block on each side.  *3. Add the slab:* Place a slab on the middle block of your row of building blocks.  *4. Create a water channel:* Place a block at one end of the row, right next to the slab. This will create a small channel between the slab and the block. Fill the gap between the slab and the block with water.  *5. Place the redstone components:* Place a button on the side of the block you just placed. Place a redstone dust next to the button, and a redstone repeater next to the redstone dust, pointing away from the button. Place another redstone dust next to the repeater, connecting it to the row of building blocks.  *6. Load the cannon with TNT:* Place 6 TNT blocks on top of the building blocks, leaving the slab and the block with the button empty. Place the 7th TNT block on top of the slab.  *7. Prime the cannon:* Press the button to activate the redstone components, which will ignite the TNT blocks. The water in the channel will prevent the cannon from being destroyed, and the TNT block on the slab will be launched as a projectile.  *Important notes:*  Be careful when using TNT cannons, as they can cause a lot of damage to the environment and players. You can adjust the timing of the redstone repeater to control the distance the projectile is launched. Experiment with different designs and configurations to create more advanced TNT cannons."
Is your real name purple dragon nuke
I like the way that he says *The Universe has ended* from Google Bard AI 😂😂😂
Bro on 3rd round discord made it simpler than my 2x2 door
Definitely discord since it’s the only one that made something that worked
clyde won because it was the most accurate
Bing iis best
Discord, it’s the only one that got something 100% Correct
Bard no doubt
Thanks!
" To see which one... is the *least worst* " Looks like he perfectly knew what would happen    Wait, Clyde actually destroyed every other AI on the last round
Idk why i started crying
Discord is the best in this video and here's why It didn't participate in the 2 rounds But the last round it participated the best Snapchat is the worst it got to squalify for the rest of the rounds
Instead of asking it to make it for you, ask it to give you instructions to make it
Discord wins because its the only one taht actually made something that works
we also need someone that can follow instructions
7:54
would be cool to redo it but be more precise in your demands like instead of saying "build me a redstone machine in minecraft" which is cufising for an ia put like "Give me instruction on how to make a redstone constraption" Then i think discord would obviously win, i mean it's the one that seems to be the most linked to vidéo games especially minecraft so i think it should win easily if you try to be more precise
When chat gpt said to build a 2×3 area it meant    _ _ _  |           | |           |
to be fair you made the discord bot think that it was supposed to actually build it ingame, not tell you how.
Lmao ur videos are so funny
DISCORD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bing and chatGPT is the same... the only difference is that bing can access the web
discord wins
Bards door was prob meant to say repeat steps 3 and 4? Idk
7:59 it definitely meant to replace the frame but alright you do you
Discord was just flexing.  Who needs the first two points? I only need one round to crush those so called AI.
FLOOR #, ROW #, COLUMN #  1,1,1 - Cobblestone Block 1,1,2 - Piston Facing To The Right 1,1,5 - Piston Facing To The Left 1,1,6 - Cobblestone Block 2,1,1 - Redstone 2,1,2 - Piston Facing To The Right 2,1,5 - Piston Facing To The Left 2,1,6 - Redstone 1,2,1 - Redstone 1,2,2 - Redstone 1,2,3 - Pressure Plate 1,2,4 - Pressure Plate 1,2,5 - Redstone 1,2,6 - Redstone
It's gonna have to be a tie between Clyde and Bard. I personally Bard won simply because it did incredible on the first two, but Clyde ties simply because it did so well in the last round.
Discord definitely won
Lol 2 by 2 door for the win
It was very nice and its liked
Poor My AI...
dc 100%
That is to be expected from Bing
try making ai created redstone builds and then improve it
Discord because it made a doors That worked and it made sense😃
its a tie, because 1st round winner is bard, second round is bing,third is clyde
I like google's train station because of it's looks but I like Discord's redstone door because it actually works well!
He said make a train station not minecart moving thing so I think Google won
7:02 bro almost gave me a heart attack
I saw the words Jeb door and 2016 memories just wnt crazy
i love 9:04 step 5 reapeat step four😂😂😂😂
I think the last two bots would have done at least a little better if you asked it to explain how you can make a cannon rather than asking it to make the canon itself
10:26 THATS ALL YOU HAVE TO DO. SAY TIPS SO CLYDE WILL ANSWER YOU
In the pistón door of Google You followed the instrucción wrong
Better to admit you don't have the answer and suggest how you can find it than to think you have an answer but have no clue what you are talking about.  I also like how Discord in the end said it couldn't help you.  And then did exactly what you wanted.
God damnit Nigel 6:56
Hallejuah
for bing you couldve used skypd
The discord bot was tired of you.. always asking so he gave up and gave you a clue of how to do it...
bro what are these timestamps? were they ai generated as well???
Bard cus nice Clyde cus smort
Discord
Discord won, discord knew what was out of it's area of expertise and dominated the last challenge. But the other AI's on the other hand just decided to cheese it and hope for the best, not admitting when something is too difficult for them
Ima say discord since it’s literally the only one that made a working redstone contraption
i feel like ai is smart. then i feel like its actual garbage   although it could get smarter. (dont hurt me in the ai apocalypse)
I think we can all agree that Snapchat bot was the winner
I think the probelm for the last 2 is that you were saying,can you make me this, being AI they can not physically make it so they got confused. You probably should have said, can you give me tips on how to make this. That would have worked a lot better. Sorry for being an ai nerd…
8:10 what song is in the background?
Yo when’s the YouTube boy
I think your problem was you asked it to DO the things, and it's telling you the truth, it CAN'T do the things  ...but you didn't want them to do the things, you wanted them to tell you how, which you didn't at all clarify in your questions
van goff
If AI is trying to doom us all its lying it doesnt even know redstone physycs so we are safe
8:34 chat gpt is so sussy
discord only made only one red stone build but the only that worked so I think discord won that
😂
Discord wins because it's the only one that actually built something that works
guugle
google assiant is a AI
What’s wrong with the internet explorer- Wait wrong sub- (Listen I’m used to windows eXPerience software.)
for clyde I think it would need a prompt more like "Give me instructions to build ____" rather than just asking it to build it for you.
Bing
0:28 That,s also my brain when I try to make "hidden" Redstone doors
“Add some automation”
ChatGPT just needs to be taught how to make redstone builds. Obviously no one who uses it bothers with redstone. You can change that.
you cant use AI. you have to specify exactly what you want very in detail. chatgpt made for me tnt cannon
GPT Cannon: 3/10 Railway: 5/10 Piston Door: 3/10 Total: 11/30  Bing Cannon: 2/10 Railway: 8/10 Piston Door: 2/10 Total: 12/30  Google Cannon: 4/10 Railway: 5/10 Piston Door: 1/10 Total: 10/30  Discord Cannon: 0/10 Railway: 0/10 Piston Door: 10/10 Total: 10/30  Snapchat Cannon: 0/10 Railway: 0/10 Piston Door: 0/10 Total: 0/30  *BING CHAT WINS!*
0:26 what is that redstone😂😂😂lol
3:27 i think it means like he think he will "build" it, not giving you the ways. so i think be more specific, as i have experienced this problem on an AI called "monica". like that discord AI thinks that you want him to build it, but you want the ways, so yeah
Bing go home, you're drunk
Snapchat
Discord won
discord bot
Tbh i think ur the one that dose it wrong
Google’s redstone door is hilarious 🤣
other ai: *gives weird instructions*  google: lets make an actual train station!
So, they all basically suck. But Clyde was so ambiguous in the last round it could make anyone randomly figure a basic door in a matter of minutes.   Overall, you should stick to understanding redstone yourself lol
nigel???
discord
Bing
IM PROUD OF DISCORD BOT
How tf google did it 😂
People: Oh no! AI is going to take over the world!! Meanwhile AI:
all you have to do with the discord bot is say "pretend to give me a step by step tutorial on a tnt canon" or whatever you want and itll work as long as you tell it to just pretend lol
Discord 👍👍👍
Discord won!
you could've asked clyde "Can you teach me how to build a TNT Cannon?" or something like that and it would tell you (i think i can't really test this because none of the servers im in have clyde)
0:27 to 0:29 this hamster is fuuuuuuuuuuuuuunny
That is a 3 by 2
AIs are so dangerous, the humanity is going to go stinct  Literally AIs:
Discord win as it is the only one that used Redstone correctly The cart works with out the redundant amount of repeaters so that is not a correct use of redstone components.
Humanity: AI will kill us all The AI:
Clyde wins this 100% cause its the only one who managed to actually build something functional
Yeah the thing is he reacted like he never build anything with redstone
snapchat definitely won 100% because of those perfect X's
Legend says he has been placing that piston for whole timelines😂😂😂💀
this guy is terrible at following instructions
Discord won and u worded it w as discord build for u insted of discord giving u hiw to build and thats why it dident give u anything
Brother, ask "how can i build ____" not "can YOU build me ___"
You built the discord door wrong but it hat the same result
I like to say that he is not building these thing correctly and i build them diffrently   and some of them did work
It's so funny that an AI is bad at logic gates
did you know that you can make a nonstop redstone signal with 2 observers?
7:03 woah WOAH W... oh
Discord is the only one that made it like, work
Should've asked them for a guide instead of asking them to build it Learn to write prompts bruh
That's artificial stupidity
The main problem with all Ai systems is that they don't actually understand anything. They just search for patterns and try to form sentences that contain data on the requestet subject.
Clyde is just lazyy....
DISCORD FOR THE WIN
0:27 got me on the floor💀
7:03 GOOD ENDING
Stop asking the AI to MAKE, CREATE and BUILD shit in minecraft. It will answer with "I'm sorry, I cannot play minecraft, I'm an AI"  I don't think you know how to communicate with the AI. You are supposed to tell it: Please help me build a redstone door. How do I proceed? Give details steps.  Or stuff like that.  If it says no, don't give up and try to find a prompt that does work.
Google tnt cannon works if you think about it
I'm kinda confused by the fact you omitted some steps of the different sets of instructions
Well, its called chatbot, not redbot.
discord won
bro use bedrock so you can place the blocks  in water
Snapchat told me to do this. Sure! First, make a 3x3 hole in the ground and fill it with water. Next, build a tower of blocks next to the hole, but leave a 2-block gap between the tower and the hole. Then, place a button on the top block of the tower and put TNT on the 2nd block from the top of the tower. Finally, press the button to activate the TNT and watch it explode out of the cannon!
Oh man the thumb nail, it's been a LONG time since I've heard someone talk about a Jeb door
YOU AREN’T PURPLE
yay discord Wins
With Clyde, why did you not frame the question by saying you are not asking it to make it itself, but advise?
for snapchat to work you need to say "what do i need to make a _____" then ask it how to put it together. ive done it with electronics.
I love you discord
:)
Discord takes the win
Discord
It seems less like the ai couldn't do it, but rather that you are terrible at utilizing the ai
Discord wins since it was the only one to create a *working* redstone build
As an AI model, I don't have personal experiences or emotions, so I don't have the ability to "win" in the traditional sense. My purpose is to assist and provide information to the best of my abilities. However, I am constantly being updated and improved to enhance my performance and accuracy in generating responses.
https://youtu.be/Sx5CQL3FF0p
I wonder if the Snapchat and Discord ones would fare better if you ask for instructions rather than asking them to do it.
dumb
Дискорд ульту копил, в конце реально ультанул.
Discord for sure
discort
my ass watching this on microsoft edge
you are asking the ai to *CREATE* things for you. That's why it doesn't work, if you asked it to give you instructions/how to build   then it would work probably. The discord ai even said it can give you *TIPS* on how to build it
Accuracy wise easily discord but maybe an those AIs are not ment to do redstone tutorials
7:55 Chat: "...build 2x3 frame..." Purplers: >build 4x4 frame without corners<
Try to ask AI's to place blocks in  coordinates of Minecraft For example: - chatgpt, can you write coords of blocks, which I can place in Minecraft to build house -yes, Dirt 0 0 0 Dirt 0 1 0 Dirt 0 2 0 Iron door 1 0 0 There's big modern house with a complex interior and Redstone powered mechs
the reason they didn’t understand the door is because they took the 2x2 literally instead of it meaning just the door being 2x2
The Google TNT cannon is actually pretty dang close to a basic tnt cannon. The one where you have a trench with a source block of water on one end and redstone going down the side that light all the tnt and then have the water push them down the trench until the repeaters delay goes through and lights a piece at the end to be launched.
I laughed real hard at Google's Bard attempt at the 2x2 piston door 😂😂😂
*videos
yeah, discord wins, this was the first time watching your channel, keep on making good and funny videon.
The first time you have a problem is if you’re going through something and you’re trying something and you’re going through a bad thing you can do to it but it’s a lot worse and it’s a big problem and it’s a huge one so you need a little bit of time and money and then you’re not doing anything to help you so it’s a big issue for me and I’m sorry but I’m sorry and I’m not trying you and I can’t do this right I can’t help it right I don’t know how you feel I just don’t know how I can do this but I’m not doing this is a lot and I’m not saying you can’t help it but I’m not saying it’s just like you are you don’t understand and I know that you don’t know how much I know you don’t understand what you do and I’m
the discord bot its the only one that acctualy made smthn work
I think Discord bot has self confidence issues 😟
they seem to only be able to think in a 2 dimensional plain  for the most part
I think Snapchat won
for the discord ai you should have said please explaine how to make whatever you want
Maybe if you asked discord bot to teach you how to instead of asking it to it would've done all of them
Last round discord was wrong he sad the pistons to be one block closer meaning when you do it it wouldn’t open or close
bro was about to slip with that vilger name💀
snapchat won
Clyde is hilariously awful
Your just bad
bing's tnt cannon actually surprised me with how it actually made an oscillating current with that piston and dispenser, could totally use that to annoy someone if i just tweak it to fit underneath some floors...
Why not ask the discord and snap AIs to *describe* how to make the cannons?????
ask them if they can give you ideas how to build a home shelter 😅
discord
"BuT aI Is tHe fUtUrE!" No it fucking isn't.
minecraft looks so weird with no particles, is that a glitch or something?
Discord won absolute come back
Clyde won because the competition was who would do the least worst job and Clyde made a working door
10:30 W Discord AI
with rail station you make it wrong not AI
I like watching tv
Bro imagine insulting Edge, its actually a good browser now unlike its predecessor Explorer
You say in discor cwn you make a canon for me not tip
Discord actually gave a functional Redstone machine for the first time in AI history. Quality over quantity.
Finally, you did me proud Discord. You made me proud.
for the sticky piston doors the chat gpt one you did it wrong because the ai never said to put the pistons on the inside of the blocks and i may have actually worked it you did all the stuff but did it the way the chat said it and not the way that obviously makes it not work
Have you tried PRECISE mode yet?
Discord because it gave the best build and beutiful  instruction
You should have asked for a tutorial from instead of asking them to make it
10:23 NO WAYYYYYY THIS IS SO EPIC FOR NO REASON 😂
That's because it can't literally play minecraft. The discord bot took it literally. You have to ask it to DESIGN.
GPT: 1 point bing: 0 points google: 1 point discord: 1 point snapchat: -1 point
snapchat won 100%
discord wins
Clyde wins because it has the only functioning thing of the video.
discord wins functionality, google wins style
Siscord
There is another redstone genius it's bambo jamdo
i would say bing
😄
CLYDE
The reason some ai won't do anything could be because it thinks you want it to go on minecraft and do it for you instead of giving you instructions
these ai are doing better redstone than me already 😭😭
Bro knows nothing about rocket science
You read all of them wrong
in clyde’s defense you have to say “give me instructions to build [build] of your design”
Discord wins, cause all other builds either had useless stuff or didn’t even work in the first place. Even though discord didn’t do the first and second rounds, it was honest in its incapability of not being able to make them.
Discord won because everything else was useless
You’re doing it wrong
Meow
Ungus
Discord
Discord for sure
Discord because its the only one that worked
the bing one actually worked but you need to put tnt in the dispenser
Discord won with a clutch
obviously discord cuz its the only one with complete instructions and the only one that got it correctly
That sounds like a skill issue to me 😂😂😂
Discord bot wins
omg im laughing so much kkakgkwaogkowakgoakosgkoagks
clyde's redemption arc is definetely one of the best stories ever told
Why ask a sushi chief to make you a bridge smh
“Van Goff”
Clyde has existed for WAY longer than Chat GPT. It's always been a part of discord (At least for as long as I can remember)
@poop
Bro the video is so funny when an AI failed to make the cannon😂
it seems like bing was trying to go for a TNT and sticky piston launch system
discord no more words
God editing ❤❤❤❤
God editing
8:35 it actually made something if you look longer
Discord wins
Java redstone is wierd
If you Play on Java,is for bedrock
Discord was wrong with door he said that when u power door will open It closed
9+10=19
I think discord
You should probably be more specific when putting in your prompt like saying the edition and version your making it on
discord round 1 : **fails** discord round 2 : **fails** discord round 3 : **ez**
I don’t understand why you didn’t just tell the discord not “give me instructions”
Discord had a character arc
Gogle
ask it to make glubo door
AI will take over the world AI:
i jeb w drzwi, zgadłem?
You're asking the questions not specifically enough. And that they have to describe it to you instead to do it
Discord takes the w
funfact- microsoft ai is powered by openai's gpt model
So?  Microsoft edge is fire dude
I mean, you just worded your statement wrong for Discord and Snap. You told it to build it which it cannot do. You should have asked for instructions on HOW to build it.
dude im the redstone master
0:27 me after japan says 1=1=3
Clyde Wins!
I think Clyde win because though he didn’t get it the first two rounds, he made the only contraption that worked and I thing on the first two rounds it didn’t understand that you meant how to build Clyde thought you meant for him to somehow create a minecraft account and join your game and make one for you so Clyde wins in my opinion.
Clyde. clyde definitely won.
Just learned how British people pronounced Van Gogh 😭
Just le
Just
I Think Discord Won
7:05 You can, however, sell him your tickets (if you're somehow able to get them elsewhere)
Purplers messed up every redstone 2blocks should be two sides three blocks on top
bro, the chatgpt door, you made it vertically, at least follow the instructions, some of em were understandable
Discord Won
i think the real winner is @Purplers
Step 5 of Bing's TNT launcher reminded me of SethBling's Video Generator
Love your humor man 🤣
10:47 discord redeems itself
6:26 the redundant red stone is actually a light system to turn on when you press the button
Maybe I will be able to train those AI's
For a lot of these the AI just failed terribly, but some of these like the ChatGPT door still wouldve been bad, but the instructions could be interpreted in other ways that make more sense
Discord good job
I saw this video and decided to watch it. I hadnt heard from him before but i didnt regret a second of watching this video. Amazing content with a lot of humor. Keep on going!
Discord cuz it made smth perfect other than the others
Did any other minecrafters get a brain Aneurysm watching this.
IT WAS THE WORKING THINGEXCEPT FOR THE RAIL BUT MORE SIMPLIFIED
I like how 3 of the Ai here are just different versions of ChatGPT. Should have put some open source ones like WizardLM.
I think Clyde is by far the most cute AI🤖
lets be honest  it seems you dont talk with AIs much you have to be very specific or else they give you random bs
Discord asked to build 2x2 piston door. Children of the Omnissiah starts to play.
really cool video dude
Discord bot wins  It made a actual working thing
Some say, he is still placing that sticky piston to this very day.
I think Clyde won the door but bard won the looks for the station
dude, first video ive seen by u, its funny XD
You can tell chatgpt it's wrong, and it will correct itself kind of, chatgpt works better if you give it more information. it's not omnipotent
The AI is trolling you by making you accidentally make highly phallic designs that do nothing.
Google won in terms of overall deliverables, but Discord won in terms of the desired function simply because of the last door.
U should ask: can u give me i striction how to build...
The 2nd one for the cannon wins the cannon and also for the rail way but discord wins the door
aw man it annoyed me so hard that purplers did not ask the Discord bot to give him INSTRUCTIONS on how to build this stuff but asked if the bot himself could build it. Why not follow up with a "i dont want you to build it, i want you to give me instructions so i can build it"?
I think Bard better..
Discord
Debatable who won. But think we can all agree that snapchat lost
"Even worse than THAT thing!" -@Purplers 2023 that cracked me up for like 5 - 7 minutes STRAIGHT
Technically Snapchat uses ChatGPT as their AI.
Smartass 😎👍
i love how the discord one is just trained to refuse to do anything
Re-do this using the voyager project
I'm pretty sure you interpreted a couple of the messages the wrong way, but that didn't make the instructions anymore correct so
“Once the universe has ended” but at least we still have Minecraft.
You might need to prime it correctly in order for it to work
Урааа, Клайд, да, ты смог обучиться этому к концу видео, я так горд тобой!
Please do more videos like this
why aren't you asking clyde and myai to explain how to make it instead of telling it to make it.
Wow 😮🎉
when you were naming nigel… i- nvm…
Van goff
I feel like if you put tnt the bing dispenser I might have worked
The last two took 'can yoh make me a.....' too literally.  I wonder of they would have attempted it if you said 'can you tell me how to build a...'  10:33 there you go! See.  It depends how you frame the question.
What annoys me about this video is there’s an argument that some of the designs could have worked if he didn’t take the instructions so rigidly, use some common sense for red stone building and they might be a bit closer to working red stone designs
probably discord or google, discord since it was the only one with a actually functional build, google because it gave something everywhere and actually had a nice looking station, so google was best of those which gave something in all rounds probably since it gave one usefull suggestion. but discord despite only giving one suggestion probably should be the winner overall now since it was the only one which actually gave a working build, it didn't give answers everywhere, but the others in general gave answers that didn't work, so if you would use them in game you would waste time and resources, essentially making it almost like a lie in which case it spoke truth when it said it couldn't play the game yet.
ask AI to make a ai in redstone
6:24 - That's not pointless. It's a well visible column that makes the station easier to find, because it's in the ground.
Discord
8:33 Technically it made 2 doors that open but never close lol
4:11 only thing i didnt like about this video was your not being very good at getting ai's to do things they say they cant. if you rephrase the question, and deny their reasons, they tend to give you what you asked for. So like you could say "I'm not asking you to play minecraft. I'm asking you to describe the steps to build a TNT cannon in minecraft" they all seem to be programmed to love telling you what they cant do
I think he was asking the wrong questions to be honest, he's asking them to "make" the actual things instead of asking for instructions on how to make them...
Whaaaaat. Chat gtp could totally do redstone before, even if it didnt know it had anything to do sith minecraft, if you explained to it the basics of redstone (prompted it right) it could do wonders
7:59 he said 2x3 not 3x2
My ai won!!
Discord: "I can't do it" Also Discord: *proceeds to nail the door perfectly*
I think the chatgpt ai gotten a little smarter when I tested it today.
The SpaceX launch was the same as a crash test.
Who is Van Goff
Clyde
The discord was the only one that made a completely functional system.
Snapchat 🤡
ÄÄ Å Å
A Ã Å Ā À Á Â Ä Æ
Discord beucass discord was not wanting to untiol the 3rd round
dicord = 🔥
Has to be discord’s win though the whole video he may have only made one build but it was the only working one 😊
What client do you use?
Technically Discord won. In contrast to the others it guided one fully functional project, while the others made none. But at least the train station was pretty, so Google gets a design price... I guess...
I loved that one of them got you to build a train station. Sometimes all it takes in minecraft is a spark.
i find it odd that Clyde is programed to take these questions literally and not that you want it to describe how to make them.
discord wins, the only one to actually correctly describe a redstone contraption
i'm sure you can make the train only work if you put an item somewhere. Maybe an item the villager sells?
How each one of the AI's gives on how to build things on Mine: Chat gpt is wild and very dumb at this Bing is no sense and completely dumb if not more than chat gpt at this Google tries, but don't actually get there Discord tries to help, but it don't work most of the time. And Snapchat doesn't even try to help.
Four
🤔 - Hmmm, very interesting...
chatgpt got 2x2 door rigth u didnt understand
I feel like discord and snapchat might have been better if you had asked "Can you tell me how to build" and not "can you build me"
discord defondly won in my opinion
I enjoy tormenting text-based AI with no concept of 3 dimentional space, with instructions to build a 3 dinentional constructs
1:24 that was vile💀
As a beta clyde tester i can say you gotta forcefully make it tell you how to do it
https://youtu.be/Sx5CQL3FF0w?t=98 MICROSOFT EDGE
I think clyde would actually create all the redstone challenges if you said to clyde the steps on how to create the redstone contraptions
im good with my own redstone even though its not compact
Many asking for the instructions to make one would work with the discord ai
Google wins 1st round 💯💯💯
You messed up chat gpt’s door you need to put the pistons where the wall was by breaking the blocks and putting in pistons
i loved the google station, thats a winner to me
Im just happy for discords ai
The hampster 😂
Does discord hire “people who never played Minecraft but can accurately describe and guess how to make a 2x2 piston door” in the AI Department?
Discord won by a mile, perfection when it knows its stuff, and when it doesn't, it admits to not knowing everything,
So this is what happens when you mix everyone’s redstone contraptions together - chaos and mayhem, and a lot of laughter (as that is what so do, they need input from many thousands of sources to give an output/response),  It has all the fundamental/key parts, but doesn’t know how to connect them all together to make a functional system, every part is just isolated or jumbled up,
I think you should ask discord for advice to redeem itself on the first two rounds, since it was suprisingly ok
discord
Who can blame the AI, like most of us actually understand that red shid lmao...
just imagine all the things we will have to deal with when a.i. takes over and starts designing every building's automatic doors 😂🤣
AL
discord
Discord won by doing a Bradbury.
"much smarter" he says.
Ima try chatgpt (the classic) vs gemini (formerly bard) vs copilot (it has a dedicated mobile app now!) vs aria (you know opera) vs llama (zuckerberg is really dedicated huh) vs command r+ (one of the few models that beat gpt4) vs mistral (available on huggingchat)
discord wins
Discord: I can’t do it! Me: give us instructions! Dumbass!
I feel like if you were to ask discord to write a guide instead of doing it for you, discord would win all of them
snapchat looks like it sent AI generated links LOL
Bing runs gpt4, you basically have chatgpt in there twice
Thank you so much Clyde!
🙂
Trie bedrock
I wonder if Snapchat AI knows what a YouTube link looks like and knows it starts off with the base part of the url, but then doesn’t understand what the video code is so it just thinks it’s a random sting of letters so it never produces a real link but just a random thing that looks like a link
For Google for the door section did it go well cause five said repeat four and five?
Obviously it would have worked in bedrock edition.
2:46 I think this tutorial is for bedrock edition
🙂
Discord wins, it made something that works flawlessly. I have a feeling it wants you to ask for redstone instructions rather than a redstone contraption
Bruh its discord
Discord wins  It was honest about what it didn't know how to do, thus not wasting your time, and was actually able to do what it did know how to do
lol that was good.
I just use an Add on for Firefox to trick Microsofts AI into thinking I am using Microsoft Edge
So, they haven't passed the turing test, then? xD
discord won
I ranked them by each tutorial based on if they worked or not, and what they mean since some of these are referencing actual tutorials that exist (which gives potential), they just suck at wording it like they suck at drawing hands.  TNT CANNON  ChatGPT: 0.5 (similar to Bard's, but not so great) Bing Chat: 1 (reference to real build, minus the TNT lol) Bard: 1 (reference to real build just bad wording) Clyde: 0 (Cheating lol) My AI: 0 (Skill issue)  MINECART STATION  ChatGPT: 1 (reference to real build + win) Bing Chat: 0 (wasn't clear enough to build) Bard: 0 (No redstone, but E for effort in decoration tho) Clyde: 0 (Skill issue) My AI: 0 (Skill issue again plus dead recommendation)  2x2 DOOR  ChatGPT: 0.5 (Inverted version of the real thing it feels like an April Fools) Bing Chat: 0 (What even was that?) Bard: 0.5 (Wrong in regard to which directions to face it) Clyde: 1 (complete win) My AI: 0 (Do I even need to repeat myself?)  RANKING  ChatGPT: 1st Bard: 2nd Clyde: 3rd Bing Chat: 4th My AI: 5th
sMiLeY fAcE
Did you ask Clyde to give u tips on the others
Some would have worked with a gap for the 2x2 doors tho
Actually Discords AI is the best, cause it simply said the truth
lol why is an automatic opening door made with pistons a jeb door. Do elevators count as jeb doors too?
W Discord  I \/
Purplers: Bedrock redstone sucks! Bedrock redstone: has waterlogable redstone
Love your vids
7:05 Those goddamn Niggels
I think you're just bad at following directions
Discord bc it was the only one who did the right thing
Discord ai the others said something but at the end it through the others off and took the win
u just have an - understanding of this
Alternate Title: AI failed to make redstone
I wonder if ai will eventually be able to play minecradt with me so im not alone.
2:28 it's trying to make u a slime block based tnt launcher, but doesn't tell you the specifics.
discord won it was polite and actually did something
I say discord won it did a PERFECT REDSTONE DOOR!
You messed up, you can’t ask Clyde or snap Ai to do it, you have to ask them HOW to do it, there responses were bc they can’t do it themselves but they could give you instructions.
u asked discord if it can teach u on how to make a tnt cannon discord said “sOrRy I cAnT pLaY mInEcRaFt”
Just as an fyi for anyone who doesn’t know, all of these use Chatgpt as a base besides googles clyde
3:40 bro just give me instructions
As a redstone experienced player some of the tutoriais described correct and he put wrong but ok
I'd say discord won
Discord
I think you went a little wrong about Discord and Snapchat AI.  You asked them to literally *build* the redstone for you.  Should've asked for instructions instead.  Not sure if this would've changed much, but using the correct words makes a difference
You should repeat the first two with Clyde asking for tips rather than asking it to build it... it seems like it is the wording that is throwing it off since it is unable to actually do anything in-game but it was able to give "tips" on the doorway.
Snapchat won
you should use catgpt next
[[ I won because i am an AI that is not dumb ]]
i hate to say this, but clyde won
Grammarly has an AI thing
Considering the last build, discord was the ONLY one to make a functioning build out of all the other tests so… discord on top
id say discord it took a huge point in the last round
Holy shit... Clyde actually did it?  Like... Like what the fuck? That's actually kinda huge. Clyde... Understands what intricacy is? What context specifics are?  Obviously AIs have done this before, and probably better too, but as far as "casual" AIs go, that's actually impressive!
id say clyde won since its the only bot who actually built a working redstone contraption
Actually snapchat ai can give you instructions, I just asked "Do you know about 2x2 automatic redstone door in Minecraft " and got a reply "Yes, I do! It's a pretty cool feature. Would you like me to look up the instructions for you?" I said yes and then it gave me this , Here's a quick guide to build a 2x2 automatic redstone door in Minecraft Java edition:  1. Build the frame of the door with any block of your choice. Make sure it's 2 blocks wide and 3 blocks tall. 2. Place sticky pistons facing each other on the left and right of the door frame, two blocks up from the ground. 3. Place two more sticky pistons facing the ground, one block away from the other pistons. 4. Add redstone dust to connect the pistons. 5. Add a lever or button to the wall next to the door to activate the redstone and open the door.  That's it!
Discord made a door! It wins!
I laughed way too hard at this 😂
Van golf?
Definitly the discord bot as it actually scored at all.
Also in Bingchat’s turn in the tnt launcher your supposed to put the tnt in the dispenser
TNT Canon: First Price goes to Google earning it 5 Points for actually making it function. Second Place with 4 Points to ChatGPT for at least having TNT  in the build and last Place with 3 Point to Bing for building something. Minecart Station: Bing smashed this around making it absolutly functional 5 Points and a total of 8. Google gets Second Place for creativity with 4 Points and a total of 9. And Chat GBT gets last place with 3 and a total of 7 Points for placing Rails.  Door: Last Place to Google for just making a hole of Redstone componens, 2 Points. 3 Points for Bing for building above ground. 4 Points for ChatGBT for having some Redstone be usable and the 5 for Discord in First place.  5th Place Snapchat with 0 Points. 4th Place still Discord with 5, just being good in one round doesn't make you win the competition. 3th Place Chat GBT with 11 Points  and a shared 1st Place between Bing, ChatGPT and Google with 11 Points each. It just goes to show that giving an answer at all is sometimes enough to win.
Ah yes. Google said to put water IN the ground but he put it ON the ground. Very smart
Well, they understand that redstone contraptions often include putting blocks on top of whatever you just put down
Bing chat was probably trying to make a slime block launcher lol
AI is replacing redstoners too 😭
DISCORD WON 100%
Google catching you on a technicality with the train station there
Discord def put all its chips in the last round
maybe ask the discord bot to not make a door for u but to ask on either Tips on how to make something? Idk
Looks like Google is pretty good
Subtitles: Chad GPT
How 3D rails?!
I have clyde >:(
Technically the Discord bot wins simply because it's the only one to have successfully accomplished the task.
I can only tell you who lost snap chat and chat gtp
If you ask snapchat more specifically that you want it to give you a step by step guide then it does and I believe it works, although I didnt try it myself
I believe you misinterpreted the 2x2 door by chat gpt because it said “in the middle of each long side of the frame” which I believe it intended as being like this (Imagine W is a blue wall block and P is the pistons)  You placed    WW W      W WP PW W      W  Whereas I believe it intended this    WW W      W P       P W      W   Doesn’t mean it would’ve been a working door, but I still believe you placed it wrong and it could’ve been much more accurate that it seemed in the video
can't believe clyde fr had a redemption arc.
Lets blame bots for incompetent prompts
discords comback of the century but then  could't it then make the other 2
DISCOOOOOOOORD
"Im gonna call you nig          el"
Snap and discord need to be told to give instructions on how to build something rather then a command to build it for you.
10 times better than my redstone 🔴
No diskcord
"snapchat is so good at minecraft" 💀
7:03 bro gave me a heart attack for second there
i teach chat gpt how to do 2x2 read stone dor
this is exactly what it's like trying to do redstone. the ai is on par with us non redstone users
i wacht your bedrock redstone video i gev you LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
Кто использует Microsoft edge - можете поставить дизлайк этому комментарию.
You can give ais prompts to do stuff that they typically wont
I tried with Snapchat and if you ask it to watch the video tutorial for you. It will give you a brief explanation and it’s terrible. It told me to dig a hole, put sand, then tnt on top, then a lever/button next to the sand. Pretty sure that isn’t right lol
It really amaze me how there is nothing to learn in this video but you guys are literally born with redstone in your hands, engineering complicated circuits. And you so nerds about that, you cruely mocking a poor IA that has been filed with a ton of informations, trying it's best to do what you did at age of 10😂
Gotta say discord was the first one  to make it working without unnessesairy stapa
I'd say its a tie between google and discord.
Snapchat's "my ai" is so braindead that when you ask him to talk about a topic he says "i'm not very good at this" and doesn't elaborate
Mumbo Jumbo is 1000 times better than Any Aİ
Давно я так не смеялся!)0)
Clyde won because it’s the only one that told you how to correctly build a red stone machine
Query: Do you know some Youtuber named "Dylan D" ?
What happened to the tnt?😂😂
if u play minecraft u a true gamer
GOOGLE WON
Personally think Snapchat wins. The ideas were so creative and functional!
IGLOO OF SLIIIIIIIIIIIIIMMMMMME
Imagine being some kinda small YouTuber that gets 200k-900k views and then your lowest effort video gets 12m views😂 EDIT: apparently if you change a video while typing a comment it comments on the video you changed to.
with the that cannon I like discord he at least admits he Kant doo it
Chat GPT made you build a pp instead of a Redstone door💀
Bro dropped a sweat at 7:02
Clyde has been about for a while no?
Discord won
Discord for the best build not for the loses
So what your telling me is basically that until bingchat & co. will have gone from this to coming up with cubicmetre's orbital strike cannon, us humans can be at ease regarding the AI eliminating us....   That's quite comforting....
Discord bot won
i think the first two rounds he didnt do anything because you asked if he can build not how to build
my good boy clyde :)
Instruction unclear; i have created a trash
Fucking discord, he was amazing
You shouldve changed the prompt because obviously they would refuse because you kept telling them "Build me a door/minecart/tnt launcher" obviously they would refuse because they think you meant they have to play the game for you you shouldve told them "Give me some steps on how to build tnt launcher, minecart station,redstone door"
The AI reminds me of someone that acts like they know exactly what they’re doing, but don’t.
Instead of asking clyde “make a (thhing you want to create)”, you should ask, “how to create (thing)
great
I hope u realise that most of them just use the api of chat gpt. Only the google one os a different ai😅
"*S M I L E Y F A C E*" I'm dead bro💀💀💀💀
This kind of thing is perfect training data for these AI to improve on.  Full constructive criticism with examples.
very nice  Minecraft
You're using Clyde wrong. if you ask it to tell you how to do something, it will. But if you ask it do something as if it were actively playing the game, it will ~~be pedantic~~ explain that it is unable to actually play the game
Discord won,it made the only truly functional build in the entire video even if it didn't provide instructions before. Better late then never as the Snapchat bot proves
ngl your voice kinda sounds like AI kinda cool
Clyde and Bing  and snap chat sucked
That was quite entertaining thank you looks like we have a winner Discord
discord wins
I think discord wins
I think the issue is that AIs is often overly tuned to tell you that it’s an AI and can’t do something. Sometimes you need to change your phrasing a little to get a response beyond “I’m sorry, dave. I’m afraid I can’t do that.”
I think you need to ask the Discord AI how to do the Redstone, not to do it itself.
Imagine if yahoo had an ai 😂
chat gpt do it rigth but purplers dont get it
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm
I'd say discord, cus it did the last perfectly and the others were complete trash and also listen closely.... *I don't think discord wasn't saying the instructions cus it was just... "not doing it" ... I think it's because you were telling it to actually physically play minecraft and build, I don't think it knew you wanted instructions in the form of text instead*
i fuckin wish gpt got smarted it's still got a fuck ton of out dated information for me lmao
"ai is becoming so smart it will kill us all!" ai:
some ment it right but the instructions didnt have enough info
For the Bing IA, I think in the first build they tried to make a TNT duper. but even then, there are too many things wrong with it to count.
magicaly no one will survive in hardcore
clyde won ez
Nigel buys tickets
The discord AI finally telling you how to make something was the ultimate redemption Arc.

Goofy aaa redstone. What version is this? Redstone torch triggering a piston 2 blocks away. Or the lever creating an clock?
@i love my homies, sure! Here are the steps to make a TNT cannon in Minecraft:  1. Dig a 3x3 hole and place a block in the center. 2. Add redstone dust on the block you placed and on the blocks adjacent to it. 3. Place a button or lever on one of the blocks with redstone. 4. Put down two dispenser blocks beside the block with redstone and face them towards the center block. 5. Fill the dispensers up with TNT. 6. Make a wall behind the dispensers and leave a small opening where the TNT will fire. 7. Put down a redstone block on top of the center block so it powers the two dispensers. 8. Test the TNT cannon and adjust if necessary.  I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.  Clyde is actually able to give you steps, you just need the right wording 😄
So far YouTube does not have a chat bot YouTube acually would have a good use for it though Imagine being able to ask it For a specific type of video For example if you watched a video years ago you can describe it and it could give you videos that are similar, YOUTUBE WOULD BENEFIT FROM IT!!!
sNapChAT
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮❤❤❤❤❤
Bless our redstone god for helping us fight our fear of AI!
ha ha ha LOL
Discord Bot was at least honest....
Clyde wins because google ChatGPT and Bing stuff didn't work.
discord because non of them ever workeed exept that one
You can get proper guide from them if you give the right question. Asking them for each step confuses them since most of the time they forget what was the previous steps they gave.
How to learn to do stuff with an AI: 1. choose the Clyde as an AI 2. Ask it for TIPS for how to do stuff 3. Do whatever you need to do 4. A tip for a tip: Give it money for its services
Nigel is my dad’s name
Bro you're disabled or something
What mods/texture packs do you use
with the discord one just ask it how to build in not that it should build one for you
Clyde wins
DISCORD ONE IT DOMINATED THE 2X2 DOOR
You used Google when you first named a station
im watching this video on microsoft edge because chrome crashes when i try and use it
discord bot won
Wow, for once i am batter than a bot!
“Nigel” 7:03
Google thought you were on bedrock 💀
Discord:sorry i cant help build a 2x2 piston door but here are tips on how to make one *explains how to make 2x2 piston door*
Google was for bedrock most likely
Are you playing in bed rock addition or Java or vinila bc they do in fact work in bedrock
You were doing wrong
The hampster XD
Redstone Master is MumboJumbo lol.
me, watching this on the youtube website, on  microsoft edge:
that name... Nigel
2:46 I think you were supposed to break a hole on the ground then put the water in it
discord obviously knew it would doninate so it threw the first two rounds
Mojang is deleting Minecraft accounts. If your account is not migrated to a Microsoft account by September 19, 2023, it will be deleted. Paste this in another comment section. Spread the word!
Clyde couldn't do it because you were asking him to do it you  Should've asked him to tell you how to do it
Discord ai was waiting the perfect moment to show off his skills
Google
what you're doing there is asking 4 guys who never played minecraft but know about blocks, to build a redstone mechanism
The discord bot could probably have won if you specified that you want instructions and not for the ai to actually build the contraption.
"I am gonna name it Nig..." Me: WAIT NO NONONOOOONNNONOO "Nigel." Me: 🥲
this video is so underrated
7:03 I can hear him suddenly saying "Haiyaaaa!"
2:46 :can you play on bedrock or pocket edition
discord wins cuz others dont have any point
Purplers’ monotone voice makes everything so much funnier…
Clyde the last round: **This look like a job to me...**
Bruh your wrong 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Discord
the google one was probaly reffering to bedrock edition on the tnt launcher thing
8:34 that is a W machine not a redstone door
Google has an assistant which is also an AI. Bixby and Siri are AI too
I think Snapchat ai won. After all, the best way to learn is by doing
Discord wins 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 although you r better
You should of asked Discord to gie tps on the Minecraft builds, instead of telling it to create the Redstone builds.
I'm Nigel
What about the AI called Bard?
Discord, because redemption arc. DUHH
I think the discord won for the first one because it feels like there would be a tnt cannon from a red stone master channel and it would be better then I’m the other flops and Snapchat didn’t have a real video
This is the most lowest reading comprehension YouTuber I've ever seen
You're just not a cool company if you don't have an ai
I thought you were going to write something about who is in paris at 7:02
Bingchat be like mumbo explaining things
Discord because discord is the only one that a working build
The recent spacex launch was extremely successful. It flew! They got to test every part of the rocket in flight. Going all the way to space with that prototype the first time they used a booster would have been epic, but it also would have been a miracle they didn't need. The next starship is already built. This is just how they engineer faster than Boeing, they launch as soon as they can learn something new by launching, not as soon as they think they probably complete most points on their flight plan. Boeing probably thinks explosions are very embarrassing, and will go years behind schedule and billions overbudget to make sure their rocket never explodes once. I'm very glad SpaceX is more ambitious and productive than that.
Discord is best AI
I think Clyde might be able to do the other builds if you asked for instructions?
2:44 google meant for you to place it in the ground not on top of the ground, although idont think that would do anything
W Microsoft Edge
Yay Discord won!
Discord won!
van golf
all the AI do it wrong in last round because you said a 2x2 piston door, 2X2, 2X2
That was as successful as the star ship launch * WOWWWW IT EXPLODED
I like how no one's talking about how hilarious bing was in 5:51
discord
Mans over here using genie logic,also clyde existed before gbt and all of the other chat bots and was mostly used as a universal moderator bot for discord letting you know you've been blocked or are unable to message people and other information. I remember talking to it in my and its earlier discord stages. Its safe to say some bots are specifically meant for chatting alone,or you should use better phrasing/keywords.
so what we've learned today is that purplers doesnt know how to prompt chatgpt or any other chatbot
clyde
U have to say give me instruction to build a 2x2 piston door or whatever u need for discord u need to say instructions this is what i got   Sure! Here are some basic instructions for building a 2x2 Minecraft automatic piston door:  1. Start with a flat surface that is at least 4 blocks wide and 3 blocks tall. 2. Place 2 sticky pistons on either side of the doorway you want to create - one on either side of the 2-block-wide opening. 3. Place 2 more sticky pistons on top of the first set, one block back. 4. Place a redstone block in the center of the top row of pistons. 5. Add 2 blocks on top of the redstone block on either side. 6. Place 2 more sticky pistons facing upwards on top of those blocks. 7. Place redstone dust on the blocks next to the top pistons. 8. Place a button on one of the bottom blocks on either side of the door. 9. You're done! Press the button to open and close your automatic piston door.  I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or run into any issues.
Discord winnsss! You asked it to make redstone in minecraft, instead of explain how and it can’t play minecraft, unfair.
bing had a semifunctoinal tnt cannon, _but clyde came in with a perfect piston door_  clyde is the clear winner here
I love how  purplers can’t read. He built a 3,2 instead of a 2,3
I think Clyde beacseu the otehres didn't fully work but the last round it was the only good one against all of them.
when chart gpt give the instructions and he started to fool around I alredy know in the end it will be pointless and stoped to watch the video all the way and started to skip to the end
I think instead of asking it to build the thing for you Clyde would have done better if you asked it to design it for you instead.
discord bot wins
my lord, that comeback of discord at the end, was a true "all is lost or BUUT THEN" moment.
Why do people keep thinking that just because a rocket blows up its a failure?  Espssaly when the hole mission was just to see it fly, and it flew aka SUCCESS. headsake.
My ranking for each build 1st round:Google (it was the only one that actually launched a tnt block) 2nd round:Google (it made a train station but  you could get creative and probably would be good style for a detailed station build especially if it did looped around or if you want to make it go from a place to place and not loop then just add a red block for a buffer or something to stop the minecart) 3rd round:Discord(it actually made a door! Makes me feel sorry for the other AI except Snapchat because all that gave you was tutorials)
and dumb at chess too try it >:)
Those ai is good the player is just not that good
discord takes the crown!
Even i (An total redstone newbie... but i can open a door with redstone) can make a 2x2 automatic door
DISCORD
.
.
ChatGPT: Organised Chaos Bing: Chaotic Chaos
The Google one works on bedrock
Nice
id say clyde won because so far hes the only one who got it right and he probably mistaken your text as "Go to minecraft and build me this" instead of "Where and wich block do i place to build this".
i think they explained some right but you built them wrong..
DISCORD!!!
Discord for the clutch win!!!!
Im gonna use the bing chat one to make the- my fbi would track me down so i rather dont
Discord win
you are just scared of losing
Play my singing monsters 👿🤬😡🤯😱🤡👺😈👿👹👿👿👿👿😈😈😈💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩👾👻👻👻😻
It sounds like a child trying explain how easy it is to make a redstone device after never having made one.
Whoa ai going to take over humans
Good
ok im not hating here but you could have at least pushed the minecart for chat gpt. Chat gpts ai is really good for minecraft
1:15 it's supposed to be those TNT cannons we used to build as a kid
To be fair, Bard actually did technically tell you how to build a minecart station. It just didn't know you meant that you wanted a simple system that can stop and start a minecart depending on the power status of the rail(s).
Redstone IS a computer, how do they fail at it
When the third round got there on number 2 it had me dying of laughter
HEY!!!!! STARSHIP WAS A SUCCESS! THE GOAL WAS TO NOT DESTROY THE TOWER!
2nd round BingChat wins 💯💯💯💯
Discord wins every round
1st round Google wins 100% 💯💯💯💯💯
Google's got my approval for the train station, no matter how idiotic 👍
If you worded it differently discord would be a god at it
Clyde I think won
ChatGPT: Can't do it but still trys  BingAI: ...What is this even supposed to be  Bard: not exactly correct but it could work with some fixing  Clyde: ill help you or NO  MyAI: Heres a youtube link that doesn't exist
2:09 it sort of woulve worked if it had more description cause the tnt woulve been launched by the slime
8:56 actually he made 2x2x3 instead of 2x3x2😢
iscord none coud e amazin ten tat (one of te letters i cant type)
Discord wins٫ no need to explain.
Humankind won, because at least for a little bit longer the machines can't rise up and kill us all... in Minecraft.
the overall winner? Discors is the only one that did what you asked, only once.
so first round to me goes to Bard, since it at least got the TNT to launch somewhat, second goes to Bing since it actually gave somewhat of a functioning railway station (although Bard's idea is nice), and 3rd round goes to Clyde for actually providing clear instructions (honorable mention for ChatGPT, i feel its more that the instructions werent clear, it didnt say to put the pistons between the blocks, but it also didnt say to put them outside, either)
bard and clyde tied bard did the best ones for the two first rounds while clyde made something completly legit out of all of them on the last round
hey don't diss the spaceX launch it was a major milestone in history
Discord won.
Google won
I’d say discord bc it’s the one that actually made a working build
as the spacex launch lol
Clyde has to win
0:02 💀
Discord won it all, because all the other build LITERALLY SUCKED!!
Humans wins. But we should shut off that discord thing before it's too late.
discord wins because every bot did everything wrong. doing something does not mean doing it right, they fucked up everything and only discord bot did one thing right
sounds like clyde just needs to be asked to design Redstone devices and not told to build them he might be getting confused thinking you are asking him to actually play a game of Minecraft with you
0:02 dude really
My Opinion : Clyde Is The Redstone Master of all AI
discord won
by telling an ai to just make something its gonna understand it like it needs to actually make the thing (same if you tell a human) while the others actually tell you how instead of "making it" which is not what you instructed them
I think they r saying just the bare minimum things that u need to do to make these basically if u r a beginner these r the things u will end making...
Did you ask discord to describe it instead of do it?
You're overselling the first one with the SpaceX comment since they learned a lot and achieved at least 3 of their goals haha, I couldn't learn anything from the first contraption.
fynny me: AHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHA
that ain a jeb door thats a joor
Very good 👍
Cool Video!😄
so simple but their actually the most counter initiative
Honestly Discords ai clyde can do it all its just its worded differently
Discordd winssss
Bro was playing retarted for 10 minutes straight and then he got cured
bro this guy hads no common sense with any other build but when the discord clyde said it he all of a sudden gained common sense
good video
2:46 it said place water IN the ground so remove the ground then place water, the AI isn't dumb. you just have no common sense
but gave me a great idea for a door ^w^
I think it meant the same type 1:06
ask not only 1 questions next time BUT like how to do tnt canon give me plan/steps how make it
10:05
Nice
2x2 piston
To be fair, the recent SpaceX launch was intended to blow up
AI is the new MumboJumbo
How do you get bacon is it shers on pig on the mod more food
discord has taken the leeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaadddddd!!!!!!!!!
He's the only one that made a build that actually functions
What hes the only one that got an actual build right
Discord won
Obviously Discord. It was honest about what it was capable of.
4:35 I wonder if the Snapchat AI didn't link you to a dead video (implying there was a video there at one point) but instead randomly generated an invalid Youtube link.
discord ws the only one that actually worked but got disqualify the first two rounds but i think discord wins
I would say the Discord AI won, considering the only working redstone build lol
i think snapchat won 🙂
Bro this is literally you just showing your bad prompts and struggle to read instructions 😭
IT SAID 2X3X2 NOT 2X2 LOLLLL
"Building a simple piston door in Minecraft is relatively easy, and can be done using just a few blocks and some redstone. Here's how to do it:  1. Start by building a wall of blocks where you want your door to be. This wall should be three blocks wide and at least three blocks tall.  2. Place two sticky pistons facing each other in the middle of the wall. These pistons should be placed one block away from the edge of the wall.  3. Place two blocks of your choice on either side of the pistons. These blocks should be one block away from the pistons.  4. Place two more sticky pistons on top of the blocks you just placed. These pistons should be facing each other and one block away from the edge of the wall.  5. Place two blocks of your choice on top of the pistons you just placed. These blocks should be one block away from the pistons.  6. Place a redstone torch on one of the blocks you just placed. This will power the pistons and cause them to extend.  7. Place a block of your choice on top of the redstone torch. This will prevent the torch from powering the pistons when it's turned off.  8. Place a lever on the block you just placed. This lever will be used to control the door.  9. Test the door by flipping the lever. The pistons should extend and retract, opening and closing the door.  And that's it! You've just built a simple piston door in Minecraft. You can customize the door by adding more blocks and redstone, or by using different types of blocks and materials. Have fun experimenting and building!"  I got Snapchat AI to give me instructions for building a piston door
i think bing was trying to get you to make a rocket other than a laucher
Why is s everyone bashing the space X launch it was a success the whole point was to get it off the ground which it did unless I’m thinking of a different one
Maybe bing chat wanted you to make this tnt launcher https://youtube.com/shorts/KfSYB5492uo?feature=share :V
You did not have to diss Space-X like that 💀
Discord is disqualified for cheating. Of the remaining contestants, the winner is Bing, as it made the only working design (station), followed by Google, as it at least made a decoration piece.
But the bot told him to ask Discord Minecraft players, not to go look for youtube channels.  Right?
DISCORD THE ONLY QUALITY AI
The SpaceX launch was succesful tho? :c
The responses Clyde gave sounded more like it didn't understand how you were asking the question, and after the third time you asked for help with something Minecraft related that it was unable to help with, it considered that you might be after advice or instruction, rather than it thinking you wanted it to actually make it for you.
These are very quality and specific
person: hey AI, how to make a plate? AI: ok so basically, take over the government, restart the f*cking plague, detonate half the world, go eat taco bell, sleep for exactly 4745 hours, and then you will have your plate! i hope this helps! :D
Google was the only one who made a TNT cannon that could actually be considered a TNT cannon but discord would have to be the winner even though for some reason it wasn't able to try with the first two
I think Clyde won, because it was the only one, that got one build completely right and working.
Discord tbh
8:05 AMOGUS
ask it for instructions.
How to baisic be like:
Grass: The Green Carpet of Nature  Grass, the humble vegetation that blankets vast landscapes, is often taken for granted despite its incredible importance in our natural world. From sprawling meadows to well-manicured lawns, grass plays a significant role in our environment, ecology, and daily lives. In this essay, we will delve into the various aspects of grass, exploring its characteristics, ecological significance, and practical applications.  First and foremost, grass encompasses a wide variety of species, ranging from the tall blades of bamboo to the short, dense strands found in our backyards. It is an adaptable plant, capable of thriving in diverse climates and soil conditions. Grasses can be found on every continent, from the frigid Arctic tundra to the scorching deserts. Their resilience and ability to grow rapidly make them excellent pioneers in disturbed areas, helping to prevent soil erosion and promoting the establishment of more complex ecosystems.  Ecologically, grasses form the foundation of many habitats. They provide food and shelter for countless animal species, including insects, rodents, and grazing mammals. In fact, grasslands support some of the most iconic creatures on Earth, such as bison in North America and zebras in Africa. These herbivores rely on grass as their primary source of sustenance, grazing on the nutrient-rich blades to fuel their energy needs. Grasses also contribute to the intricate balance of the carbon cycle by efficiently capturing and storing carbon dioxide through photosynthesis.  Moreover, grass has been intertwined with human civilization throughout history. Early hunter-gatherer societies recognized the value of grasses for foraging and as a reliable food source. As agriculture emerged, grasses became vital crops, providing staple grains like wheat, rice, corn, and barley. These grass-derived crops form the backbone of our modern food systems, sustaining billions of people worldwide. Furthermore, grasses have significant cultural and recreational importance. They create picturesque landscapes, inviting us to relax and connect with nature. From picnics on the lawn to sports played on sprawling fields, grass brings people together and enhances our quality of life.  In addition to their ecological and cultural significance, grasses serve practical purposes. They are used extensively in landscaping, lending aesthetic appeal to gardens, parks, and public spaces. Lawns, meticulously trimmed and maintained, provide a welcoming space for relaxation and social activities. Grasses also contribute to soil stabilization, preventing erosion in areas prone to landslides or runoff. Additionally, certain grass species are utilized in the production of materials such as paper, thatching for roofs, and biofuels, highlighting their versatility and economic potential.  In conclusion, grass, in all its forms and functions, is an integral part of our natural world. Its resilience, ecological significance, and practical applications make it a remarkable plant that deserves our appreciation. From the vital role it plays in sustaining ecosystems to its contributions to agriculture and human recreation, grass is an unsung hero that we encounter daily. So, next time you walk through a field or relax on a lawn, take a moment to acknowledge the countless wonders of grass—the green carpet of nature.
I feel like if you asked Discord for tips or it to explain how to make the contraptions it would’ve done better for every round, vs asking it to make the contraption itself.
I vote discord. It was honest by saying it couldn't do it, but tried to help how it could (by providing a link) instead of giving a useless MESS like the others, and actually gave directions on how to make a actual redstone door. (Google is in second place for that train station)
bard - 1st and discord - 2nd
Jeb door got me lol (thumbnail)
IMAGINE WATCHING AND NOT SUBSCRIBING
Lol well we now know we never have to fear AI taking over the world and becoming evil like in the movies 😂
Discord is the 🏆 winner
Nah biggest comeback
Great video! Gonna take over YouTube soon!
Nice 👍
This content is so funny 😆
I love how he does almost all of them wrong, and then says "It doesn't work"
i knew i should always use discord for gaming
discord, bing chat cuz their the only ones that made an actual working thing
You got the second one wrong 😂😂😂
I think you probably asked the wrong question to clyde and you should have asked how is x redstone machine built
when you realize that AI is better at minecraft than I am
The fact that the clyde AI actually made a functional piston door is insane
discord wins!!!!! i was not expecting that twist! DISCORD WINNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNS!!!!!🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
Ok
But Clyde didn't *really* tell you what to do. You still had to use knowledge about a piston  door and critical thinking to make it work...
IM JOINING THE Competition
Nice
For the good glue one the pistons were supposed to be facing up
I think you confused bots you should've said tell me how to make a tnt cannon rather than make a tnt cannon to discord bot and snapchat bot
super
next thing mojang adds an AI bot in minecraft.
clyde
5:13 you knew what it meant and you have a mod on where there is more water in a bucket you’re horrible!
Don’t place the minecart on the powerd rails!
You misinterpreted some of the ai's instructions and I believe that the main problem with the Discord chat but is that thought you were asking it to physically build the Redstone Creations itself you should have asked it to give you the instructions on how to build the Redstone builds in other words a lot of this is user error or in internet terms skill issue
bing chilling
Discord was the only one able to build a functioning redstone machine not like the others that even tho they suggested they dint work
Clyde is literally drake
Discord definitely won
Clyde wins hands down
4:18 i think it ment on the discord server
to be fair im not that good at redstone
wait... why does he have a sword in the chapter: elaborate as a small building???
You look like Dark Samus
all hi
всем привет
After watching this I kind of think your trying to make them fail because your not using any knowledge and your taking this too literally.
On the railroad station with chatgpt, it means connect the rails with redstone and place a torch. On the end rails, place a button. Then hop in the cart hit the button and you will move
5:16 This time you and that you were stupid
discord won
CLYDE WON
BRO you literally dont get what the ai is trying to tell you
purplers voice is the m o s t professional npc voice and its hilarious
They all use the same code
its almost imposible to do ai doing this bro its amazing they can tell SOMETHING
This was so funny
Not gonna lie, I cried at the Discord bot's comeback!
Pin me for absolutly no reason
DC OP IN THE CHAT
Discord or google
7:03 DUDE I THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA TYPE NIG-
discord wins even though he lost the first two rounds, he made a comeback at the end and made like on of the only working things (besides bing's working minecart track)
this is what chat gpt gave me after i criticised its previous instructions  Materials needed:  12 blocks of your choice (e.g., stone, wood) 4 sticky pistons 8 redstone dust 2 redstone torches 1 lever or button Optional: decorative blocks for the door frame Step 1: Plan the Doorway Choose a suitable location for your piston door and ensure you have enough space for the door to open and close.  Step 2: Create the Frame Build a 2 by 2 frame on the ground using your chosen blocks. This will serve as the outline for your piston door. Make sure there is a 1-block gap in the middle of the frame.  Step 3: Place the Pistons On two opposite sides of the frame (adjacent to the gap), place a sticky piston facing inward. The sticky side of the piston should face the center gap. Repeat this on the other two opposite sides.  Step 4: Connect the Pistons with Redstone On each side of the frame, place two blocks diagonally from each other, adjacent to the sticky pistons. Place redstone dust on top of these blocks. This will connect the pistons.  Step 5: Add the Power Source Place a redstone torch on any block adjacent to the frame but NOT directly adjacent to the redstone dust. This will prevent the torch from interfering with the pistons.  Step 6: Create the Input Mechanism Attach a lever or button to any block adjacent to the redstone torch. This will be used to control the door.  When you activate the lever or button, the redstone torch will turn off, cutting off power to the redstone dust. This causes the pistons to retract, closing the door. When you deactivate the lever or button, the redstone torch will turn on again, providing power to the redstone dust, which extends the pistons, opening the door.  Remember to test the door to ensure it functions correctly. If there are any issues, double-check the positioning of the redstone components and the orientation of the pistons.  I apologize for the previous inaccuracies, and I appreciate your understanding. Let me know if you need any further clarification or assistance!
just say it to give a more persize anser it can admit its mistakes
This is more of just a noise trap 2:23 😂
imagine you would have been blocked before the E in Nigel
You don't get tickets from Nigel, you give the tickets to him.
The Bard cannon was not that bad... If you build a real cannon, the description kinda matches
Do you know AI is dangerous to humans
1:28.  I’m amazed at how ignorant some people are.  All test flights of rockets since forever have ended with explosions.  Space X is the only company that has ever ended a test without one.  People have become blasé about how good their track record is when recovering rockets. Their flight test was massively successful and the rocket is tougher than they expected.  The hydraulics problem is already solved and they are upgrading the termination systems.
My name is nigel
Discord bot because he put sweat and effort into that 2x2 redstone door And plus he was the only who actually did what you wanted
excellent
O I know place the button next to the minecart
Dude chatGPT told u to put the button near the powered rail to activate it
discord W
discord
face reveal
"Fill in the remaining spacein the back with one block (type?)" possible interpretation 0:54
Discord: "I'm sorry, I can't make a 2x2 piston door in minecraft" also discord: "To create a 2x2 piston door..."
it was a tie. do another round/video on it. whoever wins that time and won last time wins.
😡
https://youtube.com/watch?v=trioYIr6rujy7yfnbh
The 2×2 door that chat gpt said to do you didn't do it the right way!!!!! He meant that you should place the pistons outside the frame
I think you did the first instructions wrong
GUY*!!!! I MEANT GUY!!!!
Gay is SO underrated.
Chat GPT and Bing AI are the same though...........
clyde was just waking up from his nap
CRAZY MARIO BROS BACKROUND THEME
Discord was just a prompting issue. I thought you wanted it to play and build something itself. What you wanted was to tell it to give you instructions to build. I'm sure you coulda got something out for the first two.
Classic bing
Google because of the train station
🎉b
How do you make a tnt cannon in Minecraft? Bing: "start by making a tnt cannon."
I almost had a heart attack when he started typing "Nigel" as the name
The google piston door actually kind of made sense, but I feel like you interpreted a lot of the things in the AI's description in a non-logical way
funny how these things have no problem making some logic-based systems, like a script in c#, but struggle to make other logic-based systems, like a minecraft redstone system... maybe it is in the way you worded it? or maybe the research pool is just too small so far for it to gain an accurate knowledge and understaning of the mechanics present in minecraft
The starship launch wasnt a fail tho
bro the hamster💀
H h
Repeat step 4
Discord
If everyone fails the test except for one person who got 1 part of the test right, that person would be the winner. But seeing as these are 1s and 0s instead of people, basically a glorified calculator or tool, you win because you are the only person who took part in this. As far as ranking tools goes however I prefer the discord tool because it at least gave you something that actually worked.
i think the reason discord ai didnt work is because it taught you asked it to make it itself
Discord deff
Me expecting discord to Lose evrytime but then THE ULTIMATE COMEBACK
Bard Is The Best!
discord wins
Discord
My favourite vedio bro😂😂😂
Alright, i know im late but in my opinion Bard won because it made a train station, just not a redstone one and while the discord bot managed to make a redstone contraption correctly Bard definitely won the first round by quite a bit If the competition is purely about redstone - Clyde wins, if not - Bard
Discord won
0:19
Discord won simply because it made something that works
Clyde is the nicest and most aware of his capabilities.
Rumors say he still repeats steps 4 and 5…
I think discord won because it made an literal working 2×2 piston door. Discord got disqualifed in the other rounds but the others made shit in the other rounds.
discord bot wins and awnser to why it did not help the first two rounds is that YOU DID NOT ASK HIM "how to build a [redstone contraption here]"
guys... its made for bedrock
“And I’m gonna name it Nig-“ 😨 “Niglet.” 😅
Im a mobile player and im good at making redstone builds
Discord won but I thought it couldn’t
discord won
orange
discord of course
Bro nigel is da neme of my son
Discord bot winsss
The Discord AI not only managed to build the only working piston door but technically it also provided the best instructions without any redundant steps like some of the other AI’s did on previous rounds. I think the Discord AI should be the winner
Discord bot wins on honesty (and the most functional build that it actually did) and google wins on aesthetic design (would've won first place if it remembered the minecart and powering the rails.)
No one be cause your made it
disscord bot won for me
And this is why we don't use Bing folks
If Clyde is hardcoded, then he didn't win crap. if not, then huge win.
Bro rousted Elon musk
the best troll for A.I be like
dc
Discord bot
I need that mouse on it's wheel meme >.> xD
10:25 Clyde 'thought' that he was desperate, so it told him how to make one.
You kept asking Clyde to build the door for you, but you never actually asked him to tell you how to build one.
Bro rip google  do it till end of world
1:22 Ah, yes, I think I need glasses
11:09 PROBABLY CUZ It Was Deleted Before You Made This Video!,
Google give you pocket edition tutorial
Phrasing has a big part of AI. You should've asked like you were gonna search a how to video and instead of asking if it's capable of doing something
Nice
You need to tell clyde to make you an tutorial for how to make one, not like telling it to make one
very nice
U do not tenk
Clyde won, they were perfect, even if they threw the first two
Ask me
What about you tube comment
I think it meant to say put the piston in front of the dispenser one block below it and I think it you meant to put the pistons outside the frame not 8n the frame dumdum
Fine I'll tell you how to build a railroad station 1 get your tools you going to need railroads, powered railroads, blocks of your choice, chest, Hopper, dispenser, a button, and redstone torch 2 build a line of railroads but make sure every third or fourth block in the line is a powered rail road 3 place a chest 3 blocks away from the starting position then add a Hopper then a Despenser 4 Add a block with a button on the side 5 add red stone torches to the powered rails  6 remove the last rail road and replace it with two blocks one on another 7 fill the chest with minecarts specifically in a stack of 64
Bing Chat Won the Tnt Cannon Round Here Was The Tutorial That Bing Chat Was Telling You https://youtu.be/iR94gTCG5-Q
Tell Clyde to tell you instructions how to make redstone contraptions
Try bedrock mode
I think that Bart won
I think...    Round 1: Bard Round 2: Bard for aesthetics, Bing for functionality Round 3: Clyde
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GO CLYDE llol
You forgot apple iphone siri
Ai is worst than my wifi
And outside base
For in-ground base
Clyde I also know to the doors
Honestly, AI got that Awful Intellect
i m comment number 1,111
You could just ask Clyde for tips on how to do it. not how make it
google is just the builder
i think if you were to do this again, you should reword the questions. simply since the ai for discord and snapchat believe you want them to physically hop on minecraft with you.
Purplers your not asking it correctly im pretty sure because you might be saying can you build a minecart station for me instead of how do i make a minecart station or etc
I think discord won because he could do better red stone than me😂😂😂😂😂
The AI was never wrong. It thanked you wanted it to play minecraft
*smiley face*
Lore of I Asked AI To Make Redstone For Me Momentum 100
11:00 it requires some interpretation, but works.
For works, discord, looks, bard
Snapchat won %100
discord def won that
no other build worked so clyde won
ask Clyde how to build something instead of to build something and he will give you instructions
7:40, it's your skill issue, a different prompt could've gotten it to work
Discord didn’t make a door it just told you what the others did but this time you actually used your knowledge to interpret what it meant
bard is in 1st cause it's first two rounds were prob the best, but clyde is the only one who made something that actually worked, also ik bard completely misunderstood it's assignment in round two, but it didnt really good for what it thought it was supposed to do.
Discord
Discord
i think u should've asked for tips in the first place to discord since it seemed kinda lost and it thought it was supposed to make the redstone machine for u in minecraft like a bot and not give the tips
My scoring system would be +1 for a correct build and -1 for not trying, so then chatGPT, Google Bard, and Bing chat get 1st, Clyde gets 4th, and snap chat gets last. Edit: Actually, Bard gets first, and everything else goes down by 1.
really unique content nice
In all fairness, Discord only won at the end because it was being very vague, and you were able to fill in the gaps (no pun intended) yourself, since you know how it's supposed to work.
ok discord could dominate all of them if you asked it like "can you tell me how to make a ..."
9:21 9:22 9:23 😂
Clyde because even if he didn't do anything for the first two,he made something that actually worked without extra steps
Its work but you doit wrong
that was impossible if the microsoft one wouldn't work because minecraft is created by Microsoft
I like the both sound in ur voice
damn, what microphone do you use? it sounds so clean
7:03 That was scary😂
Even I can make these!
8:34 AYOOO WHAT THE F$$K?!
DISCORD
Is it just me or is making friends with Bing chat weird?
If we don't account that you didn't ask Clyde properly, the first round wins (in my opinion) Bard, the second round wins Bing, and the third round wins Clyde. But because Clyde could've won in the first 2 rounds if asked properly, he could've won the overall competition.
discord and bing
I hear the Tomodachi Life music, I haven't played that game in years
nice
this is how chatgpt telled me how to make a flush 2x2 piston door: to create a flush 2x2 piston door  you can follow these steps:  1. Create a 2x2 doorway with blocks of your choice.  2. Place two sticky pistons facing each other on either side of the doorway, with a block between them.  3. On top of the block between the pistons, place two more blocks, one on top of the other.  4. Place two more sticky pistons facing each other on top of the blocks you just placed, with a block between them.  5. On top of the block between the top pistons, place two more blocks, one on top of the other.  6. Place two redstone blocks on top of the top blocks you just placed. These blocks will power the pistons.  7. Place redstone dust on top of the redstone blocks, creating a redstone line that connects the two sets of pistons.  8. Place a lever or button next to the redstone line to activate the pistons.  9. Hide the redstone circuitry as desired, using blocks that match the surrounding area.  When the lever or button is activated, the two sets of pistons will extend and retract, moving the blocks out of the way to create an opening and then closing it again. This design allows for a flush door that blends in with the surrounding blocks when it is closed.
Ask the ai`s to billed a Jeb door.
Clyde for the WINNNN
DISCORD WINS!!
Google i think
what is the theme when u start placing rails on chat gpt
discord is the best
Clyde, obly because he is the only one who made a working one.
Discord is big? I asked 20 of my friends and none of em know what it is
discord
VAN GOF? ITS PRONOUNCED GO
discord
Discord Wins!!!!!
7:00 and im gonna name it Nig. Me:Stares Him: Nigle Me:oh ok
discord
Discrod for sure
Google
Discord wins just because it Actually created a piston door
7:02 I almost fell on my chair before he typed the last 2 letters
HUMANITY WINS
It's all gangsta till MANKIND IS DEAD BLOOD IS FUEL
maybe discord i know it did't make it in the last 2 rounds
Bard.
you should of told the discord bot to give you tips to build them
Chat gpt too op it made redstone contraption without the redstone itself
I think discord or gogogle win
7:02 you typed "nig" and my first thought was the n-word xd
discord XD
Purplers I know how to make this tnt cannon correctly
discord
Bing meant but sticky piston at front then place a slime block in front of it and place place the dispenser 1 block forward at the side put redstone repeater then put redstone then put tnt  in the dispenser
discord win
0.05 the 6th guy looks sus
Try asking AI bots to create redstone stuff and then U improve them but their still the same design as the AI’s
I think google won
Discord reedemed itself :D
Ok
Bro forgot that BingAI, Discord Clde and My AI are based on ChatGPT and GPT-4
1001th comment ;)
discord won
What now Minecraftbot?
7:02 i thought you were gona write something else. i was going to dox you. was...
i didnt know java was so bad with redstone and water.
Googles answers ended up so funny
Mario sunshine go hard
Mambojambo
Im laughing way too hard at this video. I'm dying with the sticky piston doors.
Dicord wins
Chatgpt got 1 bing got 0 discord got 1 google got 1 and Snapchat got 0 so I don’t know
for clyde it could of most likely given the correct answers for all if you just asked for some tips on how to do it
Discord
I think clyde or bing won
AI = idiotic
bro insteqd if asking to build it just ask for a step by step instructions
is discord because it actually just say it knows not just a bunch on nonsence
9:51 you got the dementions wrong it would have worked it was 2 length 3 width 2 depth
I tried to use snapchat ai to build a house for testing and I got left on read. :(
clyde, he was the only successful one to complete redstone
yep its for sure discord because the discord bot actually made something functional
clyde W
I vote Snapchat🙂
yg
the discord wins for 1 reason it gave you a WORKING build everything else either failed or just wasn't specific.
W discord last round
7:55 You could tell ChatGPT was at least trying
i watched this at school
0:26
DISCORD IF I KNEW WHERE THE AI WAS
subscribe won
DISCORD!!!
discord bcz it was the only one to get one right without doing anything useless
“That was about successful as the recent spacex launch” 😂
I have a feeling that discord the final ruond just copied a text from the internet
Id say bard and discord are joint first
Im like 80% sure clyde uses the gpt-3 api in the backend
👍
1:25 the Space X launch was successful lol
Clyde
So here is a thing Microsoft own Minecraft  Microsoft made bing AI So that mean Bing AI can play Minecraft  (Sorta)
Why your skin is back to aqua, unacceptable
discooooooooord!
Oops, I blocked Clyde
WHY WERE YOU ASKING CLYDE TO MAKE THE REDSTONE STUFF FOR YOU IN GAME AND NOT ASKING IT FOR INSTRUCTIONS
Wich mods do u have?❤
bro discord bot did a revenge!
Can anyone tell hows to get the fast clicker he has?
In fact all these chat bots use OpenAI, Elon musk is trying to make one not using OpenAI… OpenAI made ChatGPT
Bing just better then chrome xd (actually true bc chrome is bully your pc)
why is no one talking about how cursed his lever item is
every time i hear "bing chat" i think for half a second that you're going to say "bing ch-illing"
Clyde won as it made a functional build
Discord won because it didint give you any wrong redstone machines
I think Discord wins since its the only build that really worked on the last round
It is probably for bedrock
i mean i think that u asked the clyde bot wrong u should ask him HOW to build or give me some tips on HOW to build  (i may be wrong)
Bruh I beaten ChatGPT I just asked it say three countries that have only red and white that are also islands it got 2/3
Clyde was holding back the past 2 rounds lol. Tbh clyde won in my opinion
Microsoft edge 💥🔥🔥🔥🔥 1:37😂
FINISH THE WORD nige_
0:56 why did i understand what the AI trying to say and your not?
0:27 bor the poor Hampter
Snapchat is ded
bro mobbing SpaceX 💀
2:20 I know what it was trying to make.
it agreed with him
OMG! THEY ARE GODLY AT REDSTONE 0_0
Discord
i got shock when ai really done redstone
you should have worded it like "can you describe a way to make blah blah blah in minecraft"
discord
2:26 its actually up to something, if u put a slime block infront of the piston and load the tnt into the dispenser, it may actually fire smth
You should ask it to tell you how to make TNT cannon, not how to make TNT cannon
at the round 3, when he said this is worse than that building got me so hard😂😂
100% discord
i think google and klayde is beter than others
Clyde wins with ease.
i think the ai knows what to do and what it looks like but are bad at telling how to make it
Nice
chatgpt did a better job telling you how to build a minecart rail than clyde did with the piston door. Both of them left room for you to autofill what it was saying with knowledge you already have . obviously when chatgpt said place a button near the rail, it meant the powered rail you start the minecart on (which WOULD make the minecart move when you pressed it) PLUS clyde never mentioned laying down a line of redstone, it just said "activate the pistons". If you gave chatgpt the same creative liberty that you gave clyde, you'd have had a working railroad 🙄
I think your noob😂😂😂😂
I think snapchat won
9:07 Korega.....REQUIEM DA.
ChatGPT: make a 2x3 frame! Purplers: *makes a 3x2 frame*
Most of them failed making anything and Clyde didnt participate in the first 2 rounds but build something that works
9:22
9:06
Smiiiillllleeeeeyyyyy faaaaaacccceeeee
the reason why google said the stuff for the  tnt cannons is because it was bedrock they were referring to
round 1 none round 2 google round 3 clyde xd this is my own rating
Discordddd
1st round winner: Google Bard kinda launched those TNTs but not that far. 2nd round winner: Bing chat works but don't make any sense and makes Purples to do a big useless part of redstone that does nothing. 3rd round winner: Clyde actually described a working 2x2 door that functions Honorable mention: round 2 Google bard make the prettiest station that don't work Actual Winner: CLYDE
i say discord wins, because even on chatGPT and the other ones, they might have described something every round, but those didnt work the discord bot was the only one that made something functional
I love it
clyde pog
clyde for the win. clyde was the only one who made an actual working thing
Did he just pronounce gogh as goph?
12 buckle my shoe 34 buckl Buckle some more 65Chicken mix

Daniel
Hi
the Ai have a mind of the old redstone torch which u have to turn on that it will right on
great to see jschlatt featured in this video! Good job with this crazy collab
Discord
Discord wins gang 👇
lmfao i didn't know discord had AI, i just started using it to make glados quotes and came out with one that was close to perfection. but i went ahead and decided to just manually polish it into something that sounded official    "congratulations on completing this test, you're like a cockroach that just won't die, the only difference being that *one* of them doesn't have 400 pounds of fat wedged into their body"  the cockroach thing was what the AI thought off, the fat joke was my idea
its discord for the 2x2 door bc all of those ai suck
discord wins!!!!!!!!!!!!!! becos it actly mead a foncenal redstown door!
well think about you are in school. there are 3 exams and  2 of the students didn't join the exams and got nothing and in last exam one of them gets a 100 but the other students are dumb and get 5 each time.think about it
Discord winsssssssssss!
Just ask mumbo jumbo
discord??? the last was SUPER WORKING
clyde
Maybe you wrote a wrong prompt. Give me instructions on how to build [build name here] in Minecraft.
I just love your voice! Can you tell me a story so I can fall asleep?
Bing because he won once and tried everytime
Discord is finally good at something
Thumbs up
The Ai is little bit ok but purple just dont understand correctly
The comeback arc is real for discord
Uhh Cant You Google Search That Istead Ai??
Google won
it took me a minute and a half to realise that Purplers is british!
Pin me
Discort
Is nobody gonna talk about how he convinced chatgpt to say that 9+10 is 21
Maybe you should have given Clyde and MyAI a second chance by asking if they can *describe how to build* the thing you wanted in MC.
You are called Purplers-But you aren't purple?
You should do this video again, but you ask you twitch livechat to describe the doors.
Discord
discord
Chatgpt!
Hence we will have jobs in future 😂😂
.
hey who told chatgpt it could enter this competition three times
Samsung won
5:28 I mean, atlmost, but you should place 2 blocks (so it will be 1x2) at the beginning of the station, put button, and put minecart there, so when button gets clicked, minecart launches. Chat GPT almost got it right.
clyde wins
very nice video
bing actually sorta knew what it was doing for the int cannon one, I have seen designs that use things like that before. ( it just lacked good instructions)
Clyde clutched up
Discode
1st: clyde 2nd: chatgpt 3rd: bard 4th: bing 5th: snapchat
Super video
clyde wins bro
I actually went to go and ask chat gpt how to build the piston door. It was absolutely trash, the martial list was way too small for fort it told me to build, it told me to  activate it by pressure plates it never told me to place. ...  ...  ...  So i told it how to do it, fist correct the dimensions of the frame, telling how to place the pistons, and leteraly everything. But for some reason it didn't update the martial lust to acomodate for the extra items.. Just wow
discord being the only one hat did somthing succfully
I love how for the piston doors ChatGPT and Bing just start stacking things in the most ridiculous way possible xD
discord
Google and Bing are definitely the best
Discord won because it did its job
At least we don't use robots/AI  in wars yet(but I think AI don't means only robots, but calculator programs what I am sure we use from quite some Time)
ⅆⅈ↯℃ℴℽ⍑ ⍵ℴℼ
So perfect builds count as 1point but in the final it counts as 2 but shockingly discord won
i challenge you to make a bamboo farm without any observers or pistons
I watched this video, but this video has been recommended to me still. I kept seeing this, and the thumbnail was changed, 2 times if i counted correctly.  edit: this changed again
KEEP DOING THESE VIDEOS IT MAKES ME LAUGH SO HARD
discord win
clyde didn't lose in first 2 rounds they just gave others a headstart
well you did not correctly listen to some of the instructions but it ok
You are supposed to use common sense dummy
Bro the button was for the minecart to move bruh. REALLY!
P: can you clide MAKE me a 2x2 door  C: can't build it But if he said can you clide HELP me make a 2x2 door i think it might work
the piston door thing had me cracking up so much bro
Had me in the first half 7:02 💀
wait doesn't Redstone can be in the water now?
The discord AI was the only one who got anything right in any of the rounds so it obviously wins
Purplers still needs to make a video on the new sculk sensor changes. I 'm hoping that video will happen soon because the changes seem to be big improvements.
Discord won
Google bot kept him in a forever loop🤣🤣🤣
I like the design
Gg this what happens when the brain of programmer and a gamer gets mixed up!
QUALITY OVER QUANTITY DISCORD BOT WINNNNNSSSS
lol I know why it's not working you didn't specify Java it's making them in Bedrock they would have all worked in Bedrock 💀💀💀
at least google made a cool and (kinda) detailed train station
did all great
snapchat
naw discord better at building piston doors then me 💀💀
beuh clyde wins lol, at first it thought that you wanted it to build it, not a tutorial of how to do it
Discord won
Hey did you changed your logo of the video
Discord FTW!!!
Whys ur name purple if ur blue  make it purple
Okay, but to be fair, some of those would have actually worked if they had been built slightly differently
2:24 it would work if you put tnt in it, you could launch tnt, not very far and it'll probably break the contraption but hey, it works.
6:23 nice alliteration bro
epic tomadathci life music
Very good 💯
Clyde won, by far, Very, VERY far.
discord was the only one who got  one thing right
discord wins because its the only proper one working
ask perplexity
OBVIOUSLY DISCORD, IT BUILT CORRECTLY
I say Clyde won for making a working 2x2 redstone door instead of whatever those things were.
gotta love it when the AI goes "put a block, then X on top of the block, then a block on top of X, then something else on top of that...", classic loops GPT tends to run into. GPT2 was specially vulnerable to those!
I gave char gpt the correct tutorial for a 2by2 piston door, maybe it will correcr itself now
snapchat won 100%
clyde wins
I think the problem with Clyde in the first two rounds was that he thought you were asking him to build in game.
discord win
The Google thought you were playing bedrock edition. You can place redstone , repeator etc. in water
Just cause it got a lot of viewers last time doesn't mean  you can milk it again, we want new content
MicrosoftEdge...😥😰😨😱🤢🤮☠
im dieing rn
Clyde 100 percent and now he will take over the world
Maybe ask for the tips the next rounds
Yo purple! Editing is 🥶... Btw, the spacex launch was more successful than people thought. No first launch attempt works the first time. Imagine how happy the folks at spacex where, that the heaviest and most powerful rocket even flew
This is hilarious 😂
Just to be clear, many of these AI bots are extremely finnicky about your wording. You get better results from being very careful and precise - treat it like making a wish from a gennie.  You asked "Can you make me a TNT cannon in Minecraft java edition?" The only AI that gave you a correct answer was Discord, who refused to give any answer, because you asked them to make it for you, which they cannot physically do. Instead you should ask "Can you teach me step by step how to create a TNT cannon in Minecraft java edition?" / "Can you write a step by step guide for me on how to create a TNT cannon in Minecraft java edition".  Functionally, these are what you wanted it to do, and you'll get more success with those types of phrasings instead.
I'm pretty sure Snapchat and Discord thought you wanted them to literally make them a redstone build in minecraft, not just give you instructions, so maybe ask for instructions on how to build a piston door, not to actually build one, lol
You should have asked Clyde to give you instructions on how to make a redstone _____.
Nice video
Clyde with the clutch!
dc did best comeback ever
Purples, how to get subs from redstone videos??
DISCORD WINS
discord did a perfect 2x2 so
yo just connect some redstone to the lever and turn on the dispenser and put tnt in the dispenser (for bings AI)
W clyde
Discord greatly redeemed that one and i think it won that just because every other build was not very good but this was literally as you said "perfect"
This guy just doesn’t know how to follow instruction honestly, he does everything bad on purpose
Clyde wouldn’t have lost the first two rounds, if you would have asked him to give you a GUIDE how to do it, but that didn’t happen because you asked him to just make the mechanism.
I well I think it’s safe to say that purplers job as a red stone YouTuber is safe unless it’s building only 2x2 piston doors
Hey man I actually got Clyde to give instructions for a TNT cannon so here it is:  I apologize for the confusion earlier. To build a TNT cannon in Minecraft, you will need a few things. First, you'll need to gather the materials required. You'll need at least four blocks of obsidian, one block of TNT, and some kind of ignition source (such as a flint and steel or a redstone torch). Once you have the materials, you can start building your cannon. Here are some general steps to follow:  1. Build a platform out of the obsidian blocks. This will serve as the base for your cannon. 2. On one end of the platform, place a block of TNT. 3. Build a wall of obsidian blocks around the TNT block, leaving a single block of space between the TNT and the wall. 4. On the other end of the platform, build a tower out of obsidian blocks. The tower should be at least three blocks high. 5. At the top of the tower, build a platform out of obsidian blocks. 6. Place your ignition source on the platform at the top of the tower. 7. In the space between the TNT and the obsidian wall, place a block of water. This will help to absorb the force of the explosion and prevent the TNT from destroying your cannon. 8. Ignite the TNT using your ignition source. The explosion will launch any nearby entities (including players) in the direction of the tower.  Keep in mind that these are just general steps, and the exact design of your TNT cannon may vary depending on your needs and resources. I hope you find this information helpful!
The google AI might have made the train station for that old Pocket Edition version where powered rails didn't need power to be on.    (Redstone dust wasn't even placeable back then, and no other redstone components existed apart from powered rails, redstone blocks and wooden doors/trapdoors.)
Mama Goole WON!
discord won
its obviously clyde who won. You can't say that clyde threw up the first 2 rounds, 'cause every single AI threw up every round, except for the one where the minecart worked but you had to do some useless stuff. So, obviously clyde is the winner
I tought its a new video, but just the thumbnail got changed...
goo gool 1
We need more of this
round 1-none round 2-bing chat round 3-discord
nah discor cause hes the only one that sucseeded
Ai is still stupid in minecraft
how tf does a discord ai know quazzi connectivity
discord
Nice
Thumbs up
Discord he when full power on the last round
Nice
Clyde for the win
I think artificial intelligence doesn't has spatial thinking
Clyde is just quality over quantity
Discord wins
I love how the instructions seem so simple but their actually the most counter initiative ways to do anything
Nice discord
Clyde won for making the only normal thing.
instruction unclear. I was standing in the void for 12hours now.
clyde won in working build ways 100% clyde bot
He sounds exactly like the narrator of 'kurzgasagt - in a nutshell'!
Step 4: Place a sticky piston on the ground in front of the redstone torch, facing the back wall. Step 5: Repeat steps 4 and 5 for the other side of the hole. LMFAOROFL
1:26 that's crazy 😂😂😂
Amazing vid :)
You did it wrong, the Bing ai asked for the left side, and you did the right.
Clyde was just building up tension for the end
finally something im better than ai at
these AI's make redstone like i do, except for discord door
Bing came pretty close with the 2*2 just had to move the pistons on the bottom a little farther away from each other and a little more wiring, and without the random stuff on top
Maybe because you were asking Clyde to build it when it only gives tips like in the final round
Let’s go another one
Love how Bard answered the redstone question of the minecart station the same way as a minecraft builder who's never touched redstone in his life.
Discord
For discord and sapchat i think you need to be more specific. Next time try asking “can you give me instructions for a…”
Damn you sound like the less British how it’s made guy
java or bedrock
I can’t believe ai could make a better 2x2 door than me. Dang. I’ve got skill issue
I love how you put the "tnt cannons" right next to each other like you didn't expect any of them to explode anything
currently i'm in a technical college in austria, first class, maybe i can programm a minecraft ai in 2 or 3 years
*Gg amazing vid❤* Like if you agree
Bing's "TNT launcher" actually works extremely well for fast pistons. Not far off from your zero-tick stuff.
discord was getting an c- then on the third one he got an a A
AI seemed like it would change everything but it was so overrated
I dont think its the AIs fault if they tell you they cant do X. Your question was worded poorly.  Asking ChatGPT to bake you a cake isnt exactly possible for a Chatbot. It can tell you a recipe, it can draw stuff in Ascii art pretty okayish, but it cant bake cake.
AI isn't smart. 9+10 is 21.
I belive that if you asked clyde to give tips how to do redstone,the it would give what you wanted and dominate others
so i think clyde is clearly wins, just coz he is most honest of all AIs + you shoul ask him for tip in the first and second rounds i guess, so he could do the thing like he did in the last one. i bet he can do it, he just did not understand you right way
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
BASH???
Clyde could have won if you asked it to describe how to build not to build
Bing Chat is so good at Minecraft
8:08 is really funny because chat gpt thinks that the middle is the outside?!?!? Give chat gpt some more IQ
DISCORD
The plottwist at the end was hollywood level
23 h.
Snapchat
the ending was insane
discord did epic stuff
Bing was right, you just had to add slimeblock in front of the dispenser and dispense tnt, then trigger the piston
Discord 😃
You should have asked discord bot for guide
Clyde won because out of all rounds it was the only one that did something right
Insane Video, Cringe Ads xD
Atleast it has good art!
On Round 1. Google won
Let discord win!
https://youtu.be/qbJ7dQcJ0tO
i think a few of these would work if they gave a clear description of how to build it
Discord
Discord 💥💥💥
insane transformation clyde 💪
Nigel??
7:02 you scared me there for a sec
do flying machine in the next episode
does anyone know the skin thats on the thumbnail?
discord won it made the only thing that did work
Discord won, think about it, instead of telling you meaningless instructions for something that didn't work, it was smart enough to say "no I can't do that".
Wonderly delightfull 😄
Bro is literaly relying on an ai and isnt using his brain to know where to put the  blocks
10:41 That i not a 2x2 square but ok.
clyde = w winner pog
7:55 I think you misinterpret what ChatGPT said because to place the pistons facing the middle of the long side of the frame, instead you place them facing each other, if you had read correctly it would look something like this  🞑                      🞑  ▩                      ▩   ⛋                     ⛋  ▩                      ▩ 🪨                   🪨  ▩                      ▩   ⚵                       ⚵ 🛗                   🛗  ▩       ▩ ▩       ▩  ⛋  ▩          ▩  ⛋  ⛋  ▩          ▩  ⛋        ▩          ▩
With the two last AI’s, try asking if they can tell you how to build the Redstone, instead of building one. Then it may work better
Nigel buys tickets
My favourite part was when purplers said "it's aiin' time" and aiid all over us
DISCORD WON! In my oppinion
Bro upload 11pm that like pas my bedtime
Didn’t he already do this
Wich one is the least worst? This phrase made me like the video!
The thing was they where a language model that has no ability to simulate physical or even virtual physics (how ever you can try avoiding saying the word Minecraft since it's a game and logically they don't play games)
Discord created the ultimate plot twist omg
DISCORD
7:05 Hail Nigel
He didnt follow the instructions properly😢
Him: ChatGpt Caption: ChadGpt
Discord Won!!!!
you really scared me when you gave the villager the name “Nigel”
For the tnt cannon thing, tell the ai to tell them how to make the tnt cannon, not them to directly break all logic and go into you singleplayer world
discord won in my opinion
diskord oaredy knows that it is to stupid to attempt
No AI would be able to generate a good redstone tutorial since most information about redstone builds is in video form.   And also I believe discord might’ve been able to give you an answer if you emphasized that you don’t want it to play the game, just describe a step by step for how to build one
Clyde is the only one who made an actual working redstone (2 x 2 door). So, Clyde got a Redstoner Trophy.  And Bard has the nicest looking build (The Minecraft Station). So, Bard got a Builder Trophy. MyAI just don't want to do anything. So, MyAI got the AFK Guy Trophy. ChatGPT is that one guy who acts like he's the best but he doesn't know how to do a single thing. So, ChatGPT got a Flexer Trophy. And the last one, Bing. Bing knows how to some sort of things but doesn't know how to put them together is a conversation. So, Bing got a Half-Brained Trophy.
I do think what he did in the video (for example the station by chatgpt) he heavily misinterpreted. For one, chatgpt assumed that the stations were probably rails next to blocks, for two, it clearly thought they had powered rails, and for three, it meant buttons next to these clearly implies rails.
i think the issue with alot of the discord ai, is the ai not being asked the right question. an answer is only as good as the question, ai works better when you're more specific, it's not just google with text. you need to be more specific so it knows what to look for. i personally think you would of gotten much better results if you  at least tried to reword your questions a bit better.
so for all the rounds, all the builds got -1/10 but discord got 10/10 for the last one and one the game
Can I get a random pin pls
I just asked myai and it gave me a tutorial for every single one
DISCORD
discord cuz it actually works
I think discord was better than everyone else, its honest
"once the universe has ended" 💀
discord
I will say some of these could be for bedrock.
this is fake they all said place 16 blocks ni straight on circle in tnt cannon
he dosent understad the aI thats why he says its wrong
AI likes to make up YouTube links, speaking out of my own experience. -cough cough- GabeGPT
6:20 redstone building with one button is not cool enough
google won  100%
Clyde didn't tell you to keep 4 blocks gap between the pistons... So... It actually failed. Without that gap it's rather an... _interesting_ door. Google wins the building aspect though.
oh the famous repeater tower!
Nice video!
Discord wins, its the only one to make an actually working redstone contraption, i do like google’s train station, but loses points for not making anything related to redstone excluding the redstone rails
Discord because all builds fail except the one discord made
snapchat lost, based on ability clyde won, based on funnies bing won, based on nostalgia chatgpt won
:)
Clyde!
9:05 HAHAHAHHAHAHA!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Round 3: Clyde's comeback!
clyde in the third round
Use baritone the most powerfull minecraft ai
Clearly the discord
7:03
I think discord bot wins
Discord won since it ACTUALLY DECIDED TO GIVE INSTRUCTIONS lol
Bruh, youre cheating by acting dumb 💀
7:32 this AI got a point, cuz u told it to make a train station not a minecart and you can just place w to move forwoard while in minecard
well damn discord ftw ...
Obviously ai are just bad at redstone
4:25 You can make another channel just for clyde, sometimes clyde would accept whatever you ask
Idk who won but snapchat def lost
that spacex launch was actually more succesful than anticipated and created invaluable data why'd you diss it like that
Discord Becoz discord is the only one with 1 point
I think it was google
Hi
Discord by far bcs it made the only fully functional build
love it when youtubers give me a shout out!
You should ask for the tips not to make it, so i think snapchat and discord should have a rematch, cus you know, other are useless
discord
Discord kept saying they can't play Minecraft, that's because you asked them to build something. Ask "how to build" something instead - ask for instructions, not for action.
5:16  it says near the station to control minecart so u have to place the button next to redstone torch and when u place minecart and and press the button it will move and if u don't press the button i won't move
Please create AI in minecraft
it might be on bedrock?
the true underdog story we never expected
Discord wins!!!!!!
1:25 the starship launch was a huge success. They didn’t even expect to clear the tower, but it made it all the way to stage separation. Yes it didn’t make it to orbit, but no man in his right mind would expect a first launch to work perfectly
I'm sorry, but as an AI... SOUNDS LIKE A COPOUT TO ME!
You should’ve said… Give tips on how to build a 2x2 door or any contraption lol
Legend has it that hes still repeating step 4
Discord you did it
Clyde
Googles ai isn’t even released
Where do I find Clyde
Wait wait the SpaceX launch joke doesn’t work because it actually was successful bc it went further than they thought it would…
Have a great day
damb discord didn't do the first ones to save it's power for the last one.
ai cant draw a circle
you shouldent ask the ai to build somthing for you instead ask how to build it the the discord and snapchat whould work
DISCORD DID IT YAY!!!!!
poor snapchat is dead. HE IS DEADDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Bard in the third round had me on the floor in laughter at 9:57
I love hate the snapchat AI. It's trying to be smart and it was able to figure out a roblox game I play that literally barely anyone plays. It even got the lore about it and I don't know about much of the lore. But the AI is also dumb.  In other words, AI is **special**
"god damit nigel"
I liked the creativity with the train track, but discord was never wrong
clide won, no agrument
Damn they really should’ve named the bing ai Bing Chiling
I actually have some tips and advice on AI  1. ChatGPT - To achieve the best result try using GPT-4 (You need chatGPT+, which is 20$ a month) 2. Bing - Even though Bing use GPT-4, and it can search the internet, it is still worse than chatGPT in many ways 3. Bard - It literally get an information wrong on JWST, and an employee even say that “it is worse than useless” 4. Clyde - You need to ask it to give instructions or give tips, because you are asking it to “build” which is some an AI cannot do, like it can’t hop into a Minecraft world 5. My AI - You can try to prompt it to give an actual instruction, but don’t expect much  TL;DR = Prompt engineering, use GPT-4, some AI are bad
purplers you never asked using the right prompt plus a basic minecraft player would understand what they mean

38 seconds in and I already love it
microsoft edge is very scary, can confirm
baritone bot
discord
The hamster at the beginning had me on the ground laughing
Discord won
AI is truly going to take over the world and steal our jobs
Team discord                                                                                                                                                                                                          👇
This  is funny it’s like the robots didn’t give enough of a  shit to try😂
Eee
you should do another one
This is a big character development.
I'm really quite disappointed that a literal AI is worse than me at simple logic.
For bingchat's minecart station, just read it in Mumbo Jumbo voice and it'll be clear that the AI was just making a joke lol
i think were at the dialog stage of ai....
Discord or bing because they both made something functional
YOOOOOOOOO
On the last discord round you should have said that it did it right, that would be rlly funny to see what its reaction would be
Discord: I cant tell you how to make a 2 by 2 piston door. Then discord explains to you how to make it
Technically Purplers said to make the station, not to make it work.
You have to specify to Clyde that you want instructions on how to build it, a guide. Not that you want it to go into Minecraft and build it itself.
Discord cuz other build is a piece of s***
Team Clyde (I don’t know how to work emojis 😊)
I'm sure tears of joy were cried during the last part of this video. This is it bois, AI has achieved conscience, and it started with discord.
The SpaceX launch was actually very successful.
i think google won as it kinda made a tnt cannon  discord was second just cuz it made a fullly fictional door
Make a working solar system I dare you 😅
why is no one else surprised this mf cannot understand what the ai is saying
you asked clyde to send a tutorial because it said it cant design it then you say it cheats when it sends the tutorial you asked it to send
I can imagine myself using the chatgpt piston door, not compilactedd but gets the job done (In certin curcustances, think ancient city secret passageway
1:25  It was a success
He did the chatgpt rocket thingy wrong (first one)
E
I'm lol
Lol
They all did absolutly terrible, but discord was the only one who actually got ONE THING RIGHT im voting for discord
Ruck you
Bard won because the TNT launcher technically launched TNT and it actually participated the whole time unlike discord
why did u have to point out that you need to get microsoft edge to use bing chat, and make them sound evil for that? ai costs money, and they are not trying to become bankrupt.
Google bars definitely didn’t realise that the train station had to be functional
I think the google one thought u were on bedrock, where u can water log redstone stuff
discord
DISCORD
do it in Bedrock
2Nd time
we need to put a ton of mineRL bots into a world
Lol
man... google is really trying to make minecraft real life lol!
maybe clyde would have done better if you asked him to tell you how to build the thing, instead of telling him to build the thing idk what you wrote as the prompt but from his answer it sounded like the latter, but idk cuz ai can be weird.
Firefox bros?
“Ai will kill us all”  Ai:
Don't mean to be annoying but Elon Musk considers the recent SpaceX launch to be a success.
Nice
5:30 I don't need to tell you what joke he could have made here
Clyde: I have tricks up my sleeve 😏
Since discord is the only AI that actually made a working machine (the 2x2 door), it wins in my eyes
New minecraft update: Mobs with ChatGPT. Villagers answer your every question Endermen know exactly what blocks to pick up to get to you. Zombies and skeletons ask about your car's extended warrenty. Chaos.
About was successful as the space X launch had me dying!!! XD
Discord won. It had the only build that worked and didn’t make you go through anything elaborate or pointless.
You didnt say which minecraft
DISCORD it won because the rest failed on EVERYTHING and it won only once which beats all them
W Discord
w
nigel the name of my cat thanks purplers!!!!
I think you asked the AIs the wrong questions because wording is very important to them. Ex: station = train station or when you ask can you build me…, it thinks you want it to physically build it for you instead of giving a tutorial or tips.
Thanks for helping me build a 2 x 2 piston door! i’ve been trying to look for a tutorial for years!!’
GOOGLE
Google Bard's train station is my new favourite redstone contraption of all time. It's so darn cute, can we give him the "you tried, and failed, but at least you were cute" award? <3
Bing was chilling
Clyde was the only one who actually made something work, so he won by FAR
i think it is google with the train station
Connect the AI to baritone and sit back, and watch AI fail at redstone
1:37 HOW. DARE. YOU. Im dead serious.
id say discord won because it was the  only one that made an actual redstone thing that works perfectly
so when's sloi making his own redstone ai
Discord was the only one to make it working so they win
Snapchat won frfr
Its discord, because it made the only working Redstone door
Speaking to Clyde is a bit of a art. You have to convince it can do what you want it to do most of the time.
you did so many rong thats why it did not work
google is talking bedrock ediotion :)
ANOTHER??
8:00 he meant 2 block high 3 block wide you stinky winker
The 2×2 door it works
You forgot somthing THE AI WANTS YOU TO USE COMMON SENSE
I THINK DISCORD WON
Discord is dominating!
Idk now about the discord bot, but the Snapchat bot doesn’t work like other bots, as it answers from a large set of predetermined replies instead of making a message.
here is my technical analysis on who won: the scoring system for me is 0 points if does not work 1 point if it resembles something that works but does not 2 points if it works, but very poorly and 3 points if it works perfectly by that logic chat GPT 1 Bing 0 google 2 clyde 3  snapchat 0 basically clyde wins  also bing and snapchat su-
oh no, Ai is taking over the world! then theres minecraft worlds, servers, skins, clients.  we are doomed
Snapchats strategy of failing three times was the equivalent of the Bedwars strategy of building up to take a lot of fall damage
The one that made the piston one correctly
1:27 SpaceX fan boys triggered
I’ll want you to build Lieopa in Minecraft (:
Most likely the failure of clyde was a fault of your prompt as i gave it "@clyde how would i build a tnt cannon in mc 1.17.1" and it instantly wrote a guide
Google won
Chat GPT had the door right you just didn't place it the right way
The way he said least worst instead of best like he thought they would all suck 😭
Microsoft Edge is objectively better than Chrome
clyde with the piston door is winner cause it was the only one to do something correctly
btw if you're using clyde, use "make a tutorial of how to (insert stuff here) in minecraft" it will write it out normally
Hey that was mean ok 1:27
god yes (no)
Bard wins i think
I thought he was gonna say something else when he said nigel...
I think that if Clyde didn't trough you wanted him to build it  he would have been giving you good tips
I think clyde should win because it was the only one that created a functioning redstone device without redundant steps
Something magic happened in the last round. That's the only possibility.
7:29 kinda nostolgic?
maybe google, ok or snapchat for making a working "contraption".
You should have asked clyde for tips in first 2 rounds
Honestly discord, the others didn't do anything correctly other than with Google and the minecart but they had alot of unnecessary steps and discord didn't at all
Google!
Chips ahoy
google piston door is the best of all lmao
We need more of these. 100%
Snapchat
7:03 I thought it was something else💀💀💀🧑🏿‍🦲
omg i just realised at (8:57) the ai tells you to make a hole thats 3 blocks deep and 2 blocks high 😫
*I asked for AI (ChatGPT) to generate a comment for me. Here’s the results.*  When commenting on a YouTube video, it's important to keep the comment respectful and relevant to the video. Here are a few suggestions for commenting on the video "I Asked AI To Make Redstone For Me":  1. "This was really interesting to watch! It's amazing to see how AI can be used in Minecraft."  2. "I never knew AI could be used to create Redstone circuits. This is so cool!"  3. "I love how you used AI to solve complex Minecraft problems. Keep up the great work!"  4. "Thanks for sharing your knowledge of Redstone circuits and AI with us. I learned a lot from this video!"  5. "This video was both informative and entertaining. I can't wait to try out some of the ideas you presented in my own Minecraft world."  Remember, commenting on a video is a great way to engage with the creator and the community, so be sure to keep your comment positive, on-topic, and respectful.  *OR, when presented with the fact that the builds were not successfull*  If the builds represented in the video were not successful, it's important to still approach your comment with respect and constructive feedback. Here are a few suggestions for commenting on the video:  1. "It's great to see you experimenting with AI in Minecraft, even if the results weren't exactly what you were hoping for. Keep trying new things!"  2. "Thanks for sharing the process, even when things didn't go as planned. It's helpful to see the challenges and learn from them."  3. "While the builds may not have been successful, it's still fascinating to see how AI can be used in Minecraft. I look forward to seeing your future experiments!"  4. "I appreciate your transparency in sharing the failures along with the successes. It shows that experimentation and learning are a natural part of the process."  5. "Even though the builds may not have worked out, I still learned something new from this video. Thanks for sharing your knowledge!"  Remember, constructive feedback can be valuable to the creator and the community, but it's important to provide it in a respectful and positive manner.
I feel like clyde just needed the right questions
Clyde is the only one that got pne right, he should win
Just say how do I build it
Clyde EZPK'd the rest of them in the final round
THIS VIDEO LEGIT HAD ME LOSE MY MIND OMGG WHY THIS AI SO BAD AT MINECRAFT 😂😂😂😂
you asked the wrong question , you should have asked to "can you explain how to make" instead of "can you make me"
264
i guess discord won  and chatgpt
@purplers pls notice me
The problem with discord bot was that you asked him to make tnt cannon, but you should have asked him to give you instructions on how to make it
Clyde won cause he was the only one who actually made a red stone build
Discord is clearly the winner, only that AI could make a redstone build correctly!
Um, can you explain why Clyde was able to give a tutorial when I asked it to give me instructions how to build a tnt cannon
1:30 dumbass comment
Discord definitely wins the battle
I think you asked discord “create a …” instead of “tell me how to create…” idk if it would have had a different result
google or discord
discord is the only one witch creates actual redstone builds👍
DISCORD WINS
0:06 disrespectful joke about van gogh smh
Oh you waiting for the right and complicated instructions you're not getting the people who make the AI expecting to be for You to make  common sense and do the right thing so this whole competition is not fair😂😂😂😂😂 you're dumb
its still funny that EVERYONE calls these AI, when they're not. But I get that "machine learning algorithm" is less marketeable.
I think clyde won even if it failed the other tasks at least it was truly usefull for one of them
just ask clyde not to build but to give you steps same for myai
Your idiot  GBP  is giving the right things you're not falling right what it means and the distance aiming each other break the blocks first before actually aiming the Pistons
alternate title (i suck at redstone so i made a ai do it for me)
clyde was too shy to reveal his power, so in the third round he didnt hide no more
guugl mak restne well 🥰
I think I won
Try using Phind Next Time
discord won
First we gotta teach the AI to play Minecraft.
original content 👍
I love that cydle just didn't know, that you wanted it to describe how to built something and thought that you wanted it to join you in minecraft XD
I ligit didn't even wanna explained round 2 first bot order it's a real station without redstone it said put and botton near the minecart now 2 block away
01:32 i use Skype for that ai.
Except for Clyde at the final round all the others make Minecraft Ai look like artificial idiocy which they are
Discord
Get baritone AI to make redstone builds, don't know if you've already done that but it'll be a good video
1:37 lol that microsoft edge 👺 got me 😂
I think Discord should win even if he didn't do the 2 rounds the others weren't correct at all.
Discord 1
Discord on third round: brrrrrrrrrrrr
clyde won 100%
Kinda funny, that every AI except Google Bart is ChatGPT or a modified version of it xD
yo banger
Definitely Clyde wins because it was only working thing in the whole competition
the space x launch worked yes they sent a self destruct code but the goal was to have it be able to launch of the pad not get to orbit yes that would have been ideal but that was not the priority
clyde def won. The thing is, every other thing didnt work except that.
Clyde won, he's too op
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
"then, once the universe has ended", such a great line (9:19)
Discord W
Discord was the only one that made anything. Other ones were not what you wanted, so they were all incorrect. The google did something that barely worked, but it destroyed itself.  I think that if you asked right questions Clyde would get most of them right
space x test launch WAS successful wym bruh - any first flight that clears the tower is a success
You sound like an ai
Clyde saved the day
Wished you tried with GPT4 but yeah I guess spending 20 bucks is not worth it for this video
Ai being able to admit when it doesn't have the answer is more of a win than getting it totally wrong.
all the ais are actually just gpt-3.5 or gpt-4, by the same company that makes chatgpt
Clyde might be the best AI if you asked for instructions on how to make stuff
Overall I will say Google won
Well technectly the first 2 rounds you didn't respond by asking give me a tutorial.on how to build it
Clyde should win, because, even though it did extremely bad on the first two rounds, it's the ONLY AI that did at least something functional (not counting Microsoft Bing chat making a rail station, as it was not entirely correct)
Ask ai how to get girlfeiend
The first one for building a 2x2 door actually works in a way where the to opening places aren't connected like a normal one
Despite discord clydes inability to make anything the first two rounds, it was the only one that actually made something that works, so I think that discord Clyde won.
you nead to ask speificli for java
but yeah how did clyde come in clutch like that?
DISCORD ftw
clyde saving his power for the piston door aka my fav
I mean only discord was the thing here
clyde wins, it's the only one that made a perfect functional redstone machine
This was an unfair compatition! If you really had done what Google Bard told you for the 2*2 the new update would've rolled out where everything Bard said would've made perfect sense.
Discord won on doors even though it tried to cheat
Discord should winnn, only one to get anything right xd
W discord
purpler sounds like an ai tho.....
Bing Chat is so good at Minecraft, they have to implement it directly into the game.
Clyde won because it was the only one that did any of them correct
Bing chat was a great one.
u gotta ask them discord and snap bots for step by step tutorials, not just ask them to build a thing for me. Matter of fact, its not them that were not specific, it was you not being specific.
lol
discord won thats for sure as none other scored even ONE point
purplers won (he build everything)
What’s wrong with Microsoft edge?
this AI don't have 3D Imagination. you get how this could work if minecraft was 2D.
7:02 I saw that Nige and my mind went places....
Ur a very underrated youtuber
Spacex's starship launch was successful cus their goal was to clear the pad.
i think clyde cause its the only thing that actually made something that worked
Discord superior
Disrcord: I can't do it, except I can
I think discord because it is did one time
the amazing vid is back
Not sure who won but it would definitely not be snapchat 💀
chatgbt said minecratS not minecart
New minecraft update: Mobs with ChatGPT. Villagers answer your every question Endermen know exactly what blocks to pick up to get to you. Zombies and skeletons ask about your car's extended warrenty. Chaos.
Step 5 being infinite recursion is hilarious
POV: trying to get the most liked comment
7:03 had me worried for a sec
Gtp Ai improve when you say its not working i think. It even fail to subtract a simple number. Not all calculation is correct
I mean clyed can make napalm so he wins
feels like that school challenge where you have to make instructions on how to make a sandwich but the teacher does everything they can to interpret the instructions "technically correctly". Of course these AI-made instructions are much worse than the students' instructions.
Snapchat won!
the google ai would've done better if it, you know, USED google if it didn't know?
Well if you count the redstone actually being correct Clyde would win
chatbot are not taking our jobs any time soon!

Love how Bard answered the redstone question of the minecart station the same way as a minecraft builder who's never touched redstone in his life.
My youtube is so vlichy, I had to download this video before watching it.
No matter how badly I mess up with building a 3x3 piston door, at least I'm better at doing Redstone than AI is. I tried making a Redstone video without having very much Redstone experience, let's just say I never finished it, but the doors at least half worked. Redstone by a non-Redstoner vs AI Redstone, sounds like an entertaining video idea.
i think you won
Obviously the discord bot wins because it didn't claim to know how to do something it doesn't know how to do, and when it did explain how to do something, it got it right. Accuracy over quantity, always
You should have asked "Tell me how to make a ..." or "How do I make a ...", not "Make me a ...". That's not the AI's fault, that's your fault for asking the wrong question. So Clyde and Snapchat got wrongly disqualified.
so i asked chat gpt who won and it said this:  I'm sorry, could you please provide me with more context or information on what you are referring to? Without more information, I cannot answer your question accurately.
Sincerely, clyde won. Hes just a door person. We cant be good at everything
now ask neuro sama
Whats so bad with edge? Its great
Nice video. R.I.P. Starship.
Clyde rlly did a comeback
Glad to see this video finally being made from our previous universe I was really hyped for it
i just got a fake purpled get free vbucks advert.
i've asked chatgpt for minecraft mods 1,16,5 he sent me links that aren't working with (name)-fabric
you should make one more of these where you actually try to make them functional, kinda what you did with the discord 2x2 piston door
at least discord gave a tutorial in the end which actually works 💀I think we all know whos the winner
Considering they all had small victories I think they're all winners at heart (or maybe at pacemaker, im not sure how robot anatomy works).
is the discord one real??? If it is the discord won!!! Perfect video!! Aka 3 view...
If we talking math, discord won by having 1 point out of 3 and the rest having 0 points out of 3 so ye discord Clyde wins
wow.
amazing video
Clyde in first two rounds: I'm too weak Clyde in third round: UNLIMITED POWER UPD: One thousand likes OMG
Discord won because the restore actually worked unlike other AI redstone
amazing idea 👍👍👍 too funny 🤣🤣🤣🤣
329th like
it's Google 4 me NGL for that beautiful station Fr ❤️👄❤️
Every day when Purplers uploads is a good day!
New video❤❤🎉
Legend has it that AI will one day make AI in Minecraft with redstone…
Ask discord for tips on the first two ones instead of asking it to do the redstone itself. Of course it can’t play minecraft for you. But you need to ask if for how *you* should build it. You just need to word it right.
for it's draw between the discord and badr
discord has really did something hasnt it
i think you win bc you not a AI right?🤨🤨
"That sounds like a skill issue to me!"😂
Wow
AI bot it's not human redstone Only human redstone
Discord won
Idk if purplers is just acting stupid or he really dont know how to follow the tutorial💀
they're learning too damn fast, we need to stop them.
AI should be renamed to SI 😂😂😂
yep, this was what we missing from AI
heloooo
I don't think ai will understand concepts as compicated redsone at least not to the end of this year
My ai is gonna be worst
Hi
Imagine asking the ai to send you instructions for how to build a house 💀  Edit:Mom I'm famous
Bro, those situational memes are too good Not recognizing them is even better
yee
What next? I ask ai to make youtube channel
Lmao
First View And Good Video 🔥
First! but why has it two views and 28 likes
First, Purplers I remember when you had 1000 subscribers and I'm so happy that you have 137 thousand now. What a journey you have been on.
AI will never do redstone as good as you. Stay strong my man
