Played sims for the first time in three years, infants are soo hard I miss just having toddlers
the baby scared me when it was hissing , was it just me or 🤣
I’m pretty sure I’ve never read the description for “Intense” out of pure avoidance of the whole thing. I am not a baby person, so “Intense” just felt frightening, especially with the cries of alien babies
You look so cool
I love your background and thank u for making the video in sim 4 I only love make family's like how u did❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊
May i ask what house that was im new to the sims 4 and i love it please tut witch house it is❤
Hey how can you click on newborn on sims 4 because it wouldn't let me
can you use the rocking chair with the infants and have them fall asleep in your arms?
"BABY PRIZON WOOOOOOH!"
The "TEEHAA" at 15:28 🤣🤣😅
Just getting into this baby stage 🙄, looovveeddd the video BTW 💯❤️
I died at the, "It's hissing at me." (and the hissing noises) and, "I hate you."
it’s kinda annoying that the stuff from the toddler stuff pack (and other packs that added stuff for toddlers) didn’t go to infants. Maybe EA will add it.
The tittle name is a little sus
WHAT IS THE GAME NAME I KNOW SIMS 4 BUT WHAT ONE
I loveee this update but I wish they were a tiny bit smaller
I'm soooo happy we have infants even tho it's prob gonna be a menace
Man now I’m extremely sad I’m on PS4 😔
Hi I’m a new fan sims look so cool
"ITS HISSING AT ME "GOT ME DYING
That project zero is actually boo from monsters ink 😂
I hate you  ahaha project feeling rejected
My infants never sleep in the crib, it's always sooo glitchy
I was wondering why the children I made looked so tall, guess I know now.
wait so does this mean my toddler cc will be messed up or can i just download new cc for the infants?
y’all confirmed, sasha is prone to diaper rash
I thought this pack came with a changing table, I'm sort of disappointed now 😅  edit: I looked it up and apparently it's only in the pack. that's disappointing but whatever I guess lol
I got a sims infant add before the video started 🤣
Please do 100 baby challenge
are they out yet?
Sasha you're probally not going to read this but amazing cc creators like jellypaws have infant cc
They all look taller
First thing i did when i got the update was remake my nursery cause my sim was gonna have her second baby
She look like she the baby from monster ink
I’m pretty sure it was a pack n play
For the infants, you can like make them try all the baby food and then you can age them up
Please send me this game😊😢😢
Omg I did this yesterday…..let’s just say my infant only likes. The father the only one who’s gone at work 24/7 ….She hates me also they get sad/mad at everything….😅
Sasha: “These sims are more prone to diaper rash…yep that’s me!”
So u don’t have all the clothes,furniture or all options, that’s why u could not find the changing table so ur gonna have to find a way to get. All the stuff!(I would tell u but I forgot how to do it Srry!
Can u show us how to get it which one is it I’m trying to get the game but I don’t no which sim
“i hate you😘🥰😍” - project zero AHHSGAH
❤I love it i love it the infants are so cuttttteeeeee ❤
I made newborns from the infant update its adorable eeek
I can’t wait for a random genetics 🧬 video ft. Infants !
It's the chunky lil' legs that get me~ ;w; <3
I just wanted to say you are the reason I got the sims 4 and you always make me want to play i made a family and i have 1 toddler and a baby and 2 young adult
Are you prone to diaper rash?
That "i hate you" killed me lol
This update broke my whole game and I don't know how to fix it 😢
“It’s me, the whole thing is me”  *so you are prone to diaper rash as well eh?*
I LOVE THE FACT THAT PROJECT ZERO SAID "I hate you" when her sister was aging up
12:43 BABBY PRISON!
I love playing the sims and I have watched here for along time love you vixela
cute
IM SO EXCITED FOR THIS PACK
THANK YOU for disabling Growing Together and showing off just the basegame content!
they could have at least have a basic changing table for base game. and for GT, i wish stay overs could happen from your house to like grandparents or aunts and uncles and you could send the kids
Vixella + the sims 4 = favourite.
Shall you have the Pick to get the infant
wow i’m actually impressed this is base game!!! thanks i love ur videos xoxo
The baby looks like boo from monsters inc
Here's an idea! what if you did a random genetics but for infant! I think it would a good idea.
It hissing at me SOMEONE GET THE BOTTLE 😂😂😂
I don’t care if all my cc builds  are gone I NEEED
The infant update is so amazing  Also just to say they got star fairy lights in the update
Hissing scared me bc it happened in gameplay
Toddler’s legs are definitely longer and i’m glad i’m not the only one who noticed that lol
I had the funniest glitch with the infants, so  I was just playing like normal, and my infante just stood up and grew the glitch legs and for a few secs was as tall as the child life state, I literally just froze in my spot my mouth wide open thinking wtf just happened lol 🤣
omg its so cute it better becomes a update and hurry up coming or is this a mod?
You had me weak at 3:22 🤣
How tf is this an EA title
God and Jesus loves you so much! Have a good blessed day <3
Once the pack comes out, for my 100 baby challenge, I'm either going to age them up on their birthday or when they hit a certain number of milestones.
Ima hop on my brothers Xbox now🏃‍♀️💨
When will the update come out? I can’t wait
They are so cute I’m waiting for the game to update atm but so excited. Also why dose some of the clothes look like cc like the bear suit
Sick satanic pedophiles.
-Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near:   (Isaiah 55:6) -For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him.   (Psalm 32:6) -Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.   (Psalm 32:7) -For thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye shall live:   (Amos 5:4) -Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.   (Romans 10:13)
ITS HISSING AT ME PASS ME THE SPRAY BOTTLE 😂😂😂😂😂
and i dont have the infant button when im in create a sim
How do you get the infants my sims give birth to babies and I cant figure it out for them to become a infant
I'm disappointed that most things didn't come with base game and is behind a paywall but overall I think it's ok even though it's a lil glitchy
Its sad to watch bc i can't play Sims anymore! It says it doesn't exist so my Sims life is over🌊😔😭😭
14:18 Dang Project How Dare You Say That
Dyingggg for a let's play with the new pack lol
Is it just me or is all my cc deleted I am so sad but I love the infant update
669
Is this a pack or something or is it just an update for free?
I have too subscribe because you are amazing❤
i js updated it a couple hours ago and they baby dose not go into the crib she lays on the floor I'm so confused. help ANYONE?
Some day can you make a sim of you
The infants in my game have the demonic looking eyes, and I can't change them. I don't know what to do😭
I like how Project Zero said "I hate you" while aging up the baby Alexa 🤣
Is it a pack? Do u have to buy ut
the baby looks like boo from monsters inc! she's so cute
All is fun and games until you see them with vampire eyes...
I thought we could do tummy time but there’s no option 😢
Not going to lie I was going to watch this earlier but decided not to then I can watch it when I play
.I have homework and i failed my last science test so i study. ❌  .Watch a vixella video. ✔️✔️✔️✔️
BASSINETS!!!!!!!!!
I got this update TODAY and... IVE NEVER BEEN SO HAPPY IN CREATE A SIM AND BUILD MODE MY GOD
What’s the mod called
Maybe for the 100 baby challenge if you have growing together you could have to get your baby to have all of the necessary milestones? I’m sad that it’s locked behind a paywall though ;-;
I don't see how those look like moccasins-  Those are formal shoes
The toddler legit sounds like they’re saying uwu 😂
Definitely taller,but I hope teens are taller or shorter then adults
I did the same thing with the changing table 😂so excited for the game and pack!
MINE HISSED AT ME TOO💀
Sasha is telling Zeus something  😂😅🤣
Is it free?
I tried to do the update today but my new borns just look like before, can someone help me? Is the update out for everyone today?
I've finally gotten the infants, they are adorbs, but I can't change the eye colour!! Plus every eye colour that is randomizes to is for vampires!! I don't know what to do!! T-T
I just updated it and did it and it is realy cool.
You should do a let's play ❤️🩷❤️
is it just me, or did that one swatch on the small rug look like animal crossing villagers?
Right now I’m waiting for the update. It takes so long omg
Vixella you should go cc shopping for the infants!!
Anyone having an issues with the update? I create a new family with an infant, move them to a house and then start the game the infant isn’t there it’s just the adult sim? Anyone have an ideas as I want to play!
Watching this while waiting for EA to fix the app so I can download the update. Uuugh. Love your videos!
Eliza through the window with the fruitcake sent me into orbit
Why is it not on my Xbox? HALP PLS
I’ve been trying to update origin but hospital wifi sucks so I haven’t been able to play with the update yet 😭
“Its hissing at me some one give me a hiss bottle🫢” LOLLL
3:51 IS THAT A UNDERTALE REFERENCE?
I was intense and wiggly when I was a baby 😂
WHAT YOU GOT IT EARLY IM UPDATEING IT NOW
Pls play Cat Cafe Manager!! Its on Steam and such a cute, cozy game!!
I’m gonna have to get new family poses and baby cc 😩 love the update but it’s gonna be a while before the game has function mods and infant cc
The infants are so cute. I'm also very excited for the infant update as well
So freakin excited for a growing together series!
im so excited for the update but I'm disappointed that changing tables are in growing together. we shouldve had a base game alternative
Isn’t the base game update today? (March 14)
OUR LORD AND SAVIOR WILL BE RETURNING SO I ENCOURAGE YOU TO REPENT OF YOUR SINS AND TURN TO GOD! GOD BLESS YALL! (sorry if this offended you!)
OUR LORD AND SAVIOR WILL BE RETURNING SO I ENCOURAGE YOU TO REPENT OF YOUR SINS AND TURN TO GOD! GOD BLESS YALL! (sorry if this offended you!)
Is it FREE
I loaded up my game but it doesnt show the infant in cas?? Is it free without the purchase of Growing Together??
Omg I’m gonna go straight to my Xbox and update my sims when I get home
How come my sims 4 didn’t have my baby update
I had just stuck a pizza roll in my mouth when the baby hissing started.  I've never had so much trouble holding in laughter so much in my life.  Sasha reaction was priceless!  😂
It’s out now right? So how do I download it? I live in Sweden so are there different time? When does it release? Does it update in the EA app?
So excited, I work nights so I’m going to try and go to bed a little early so I can wake up and play a bit before I have to go to work again
The way she said "Huh! The Whales!"
i can't wait. in my country its coming in 2 hours
So this is going to be an update? Or do you have to buy it??
Amazing
"I hate you"
14:19 HAD ME DYING
do you plan on doing a growing together let's play? i would love to see one, i love your let's plays and i think it would be really exciting to see a story let's play or even a generations lp
I am going to scream when I make my first infant.
Toddlers only look taller cause the babies  are small
I'm actually so annoyed that the changing table is in Growing Together.....  like why...?
OMG. I AM SO EXCITEDD
i don't have the infant update? how do yall get it?
wait are the quirks not basegame 😕 i thought they were they still look super cute tho
Now that infants are there, I have a idea she could do sims 4 but every room is a different age groups
OMG the chair in the background looks like the chair in high school years lol 🤣
The sims 3 is better everyway just needed to be kept updated
As a mom those infants are the basically the size of younger toddlers their more like toddlers than they are infants and the newborns are actually infants and infant sizes sooo yep.
i didnt get the updater
Hey Sasha, how do you turn items without using “,” or “.” I was wondering. Like, I mean into any direction with your mouse as I saw 9:48
I mean.... Yeah babies hiss, although that sounded like breathing while someone is sticking their fingers in the kids mouth to look at their teeth for an extended period of time..... And I still hiss. Almost made my brother pee himself when I vaulted over the couch and hissed to get the tablet and stop him from playing with it.
Hola does anyone know tell me when it comes out for mobile
do we need to like update the game cause I cant get them..
Hola
the wiggly trait is so much like a person with adhd I love how accurate it is to mine as a person with adhd
I'm a bit confused why Project could crawl and sit up from the beginning? Isn't she supposed to have to learn all that first? Or are milestones a Growing Together thing and base game infants just get delivered knowing all that stuff already?
Next we need pre-teens and the lifestages will feel complete
Theres a really cool cc pack called Tiny Twavellers by Felixandresims & Harrie which includes a LOT of nice furniture and stuff. It also has (alsthough not functional) a baby changing table.
Sasha- cc creators do your thing   Me- yes please I can’t live with clay hair 😂  Also me-downloads maxis Mach cc😮
"They can't get a job..." You gotta start early😅
Are infants in basegame
When Sasha said "look at that LiTtLe PiG" I canttt got me cracking up
Bro, I just uninstaller sims and forgot about the update cause it took up so much storage. Time to install ot again and take a million years to download new cc
try go night night 🥺
Is this house on the gallery?
Sasha’s toddler first look video was the first video of her’s I ever watch. This video means a lot :)
I wish I had a computer so I could play the sims😭 I mean watching other people play is fun but it seems soo fun to play, and I can’t play it😭
Really can't wait for a modder to give us strollersssss
I cannot wait until 6 pm UK time. I cannot wait. I cannot wait  I NEED INFANTS. I have a family who have a child in each age range
I just know Clare is punching the air about not having this for her series it would have been adorable to see her sims at this age 😂
wait its out???
If you have growing together the toddlers can get milestones for sitting up and crawling so maybe that would work in place of skills for the 100 baby challenge?
Why do i dig the name "project zero"  "Its hissing at me, someone get me a freaking spray bottle ch ch." -Vixella (2023) "I hate you," -PZ OMG The new world in growing together! PLSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSZ
Sadly in adalalide or however you spell it lol it comes out at 4:00am!
It’s a mad cat
I find it stupid that theres no changing tables for the base game.
Omg ❤so cute
I cant have it until wednesday because Im in Australia
You should do the 100 baby challenge with the stuff that came into base game and pack growing together
So cute
Omg their little voices!🥰
i learned in doc's video that infants do have certain not really skills but things they have to do. Like they have to do tummy time, learn to walk, learn to talk, etc.
omg it really said "i hate you" O.O
They definitely look taller like everyone does the toddlers look like they have longer legs and I don’t know if it’s like the jeans or what
Buy a diaper Genie thats for the dirty diapers, they showed it during livestream
I'm so glad that the infants are coming out today
We are gonna need a rags to riches with growing together. On twitch or not we just need it
The infants look like literally the toddlers but sitting down, then the toddlers look a little more grown up. I think it would have been better to keep toddlers the same and make infants even more baby-like because they still feel too old for infants... idk
“Sasha is literally an icon.” - me after watching this vid
We need pre teens moreeee!!!!
This is so cute
im so excited for this to come out
I noticed the difference my niece is 1 there so is a difference
i feel like the infints are way to big they are like toddler size
The “i hate you🥹😢”
I can not wait ❤❤❤
When it sounded like project zero said I hate you I lost my mind ahaba
LOL “Eliza and her freakin fruitcake” GOT me
First 1:30 in and I'm cackling 🤣
Better get used to those bars kid
nope nope take em back.
They are ABSOLUTELY taller😳
Dose it come tomorrow?
I wish the babies didn't sit in the "M" shape like that or they would add an interaction called "fix your feet." My "sensitive" son's therapists were always correcting him saying "fix your feet" when he did that and made him sit cross legged. I guess it can cause hip dysplasia. Oddly enough, my son slipped on water in his food therapy and fell like that and broke his leg near his knee. I guess that's why it's bothers me lol.
I’m really disappointed that the changing tables are only in the growing together pack
I need to get me sim pregnant NOW
When is this coming out?
I can’t wait for tomorrow to play with these infants ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤. Hurry up with the game pack😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I feel like toddlers are gonna be the middle child now 🤣 but am so excited that we’re getting it tomorrow! Btw that sim mom you got is very pretty I think they changed the sims a lot! I love ur vids!❤
IM SO EXCITED!!!!!
The first crib looks like a pet pen 🤣🤣🤣
The fucking hissing and “I hate you” is killing me
I’m sorry but why is changing tables exclusive to the pack. CHANGING TABLES ARE HELLA IMPORTNAT. I’m so mad but at least the babies are so cute
I love how Sasha’s editing has gotten funnier.. good stuff 😆
Isn't Project Zero another name for the Fatal Frame series? Now thats an interesting crossover.
When does this come out
12:11 for the 100 baby challenge we could do it like: if you don’t have growing together you need to wait 2 days to age them up and if you do, you can only age them up after they got specific milestones or a number of them 😁
I have a question, Will the infants be free
The sims are taller
Now I’m going to have to have a household with like 6 infants because I want to wear those clothes
NAPPY CHANGING STATION ISNT BASEGAME WHAT?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
😭😭😭 I can't believe this is what's going to convince me to get the kids pack. It's too cute!!!
CC creators boughta step up, and even tho these are cute I need cuter!!!!! (thats were the cc creators come in)
i wonder if this update will break mccc. ima have to use tray importer to check all my mods lmbo
I've never been more excited for a sims pack! I squealed through this entire video
I'm watching this to study what the infants are like and what they'll need.
I think this update is going to make me cry I'm so happy
The infant just started crawling right away. So without the expansion they don't go through the whole process?
“I hate you” 😭🤣
I just realized that you could make a time out for the toddlers and infants
I hope they include some of the hairs and clothes from other packs to bring them to the infant life stage
I CANT WAIT FOR TOMORROW I JUST LEFT SIMS 4 BECAUSE MY SIM JUST GOT TRIPLETS SO IMMA NOT AGE THEM UP TILL TOMMOROW
As an aroace person I am SO HYPED to have my Sim have a science baby as a single parent!
I chew on my glasses
can you please do a let's play?!
i can't waittt! if any has made some infant cc can someone let me know pls and thank you! Love your channel btw:)
Not matching furniture for once in almost ten years lmao
people who didn't get it early get it tomorrow!! :))) who else is excited??
My computer died out on me before the update
I honestly love the diapers and the bottles being everywhere I know it sounds silly but I missed it so much from sims 2
I think the clothes that’s toddlers got from previous packs should be made for the new babies also 😊
"It's hissing at me :I", Vixella 2023
is this for the new base game when it comes out
why do they still have the object baby to age up into the infant? seems a bit redundant to me
HOW COME YOU GUYS GET IT!!
I might change my toddler sim to a baby tomorrow thanks to this
AHHHHHHH TOMORROW IS THE DAYYYYY FOR BASE GAME. AND I HAVE A SNOW NAME TOMORROW AHHHHHHHHHHH
You know you play with WW too much when your immediate thought about the "science baby" is that it could be modded into either IVF or a sperm donor mod.
THE EDITS IN THIS ARE IMMACULATE HAHAHAH
I was mad excited for this,, but 40$$$$$ is  too much😕😕😕 Like why do you have to pay literally as much as you payed for the game originally,, for that you could buy a whole separate game fuck an expansion pack
Her:  * Looking so shocked *  Also Her: * Continues Reading Like Nothing Happened *
Are they gonna make a like newborn kitten and puppy thing? Cause I will cry if they do it will be amazing to make it not that the puppys and kittens are born and their just like ✨IvE aRiViEd!✨ And just start wandering around like they were not just born 2 seconds ago.
Hi! Did you know that Jesxsus Christ died on the cross for yours sins? Well, if you are just hearing this I hope you will accept Him into your heart and believe that He really did die for you. All you need to do is pray this prayer: God, I know that I am a sinner, I know that You died on the cross for my sins then rose on the 3rd day. I want you to come into my heart. Amen. I hope you will pray this so you can go to heaven!
Wait is the new infants base game or do we need the pack?
the second the update releases im making a watermelon themed infant bedroom 🏃🏻‍♀
AAAHHH I love this!!!
But if you have others packs do you have more clothes and stuff? Not the new pack just other packs 😮
why is nobody talking about how beautiful the mother sim was 😭❤️
Is this a pack? Or update
1 more day until it comes out
"its hissing at me"
So there is no  changing station in the base game Me:base game? She is playing on the base game...THIS IS IN THE BASE GAME plays sims
I wish they had kept the toddlers as is and made the infants look much more like newborns, also a lot of the toddler clothes are now infant clothes.... I think they could have done a lot more with this but that's just me.
LMFAO THE PART WHERE THE BABY WAS HISSING 💀🤣 I showed my mom and she was so confused 😂
I absolutely loved this and will be playing the update tomorrow and start a new save for the pack Thursday! 😍
10:03 Me to my beautifully fried bacon🤣
So something to know what they did with infants is pretty cool, they made it so that they actually are like real people. They can't go upstairs on their own, they need to be carried for a long time ,like the whole infant stage, because they can't walk at until they're toddlers.They are just crawling around and flailing like actual infants ,which I think is pretty cool. I'm super excited! I can't wait for tomorrow. I love your channel ,you are super funny and love your aesthetic.💗💖
honestly this is a game changer for rags to riches
-I hate you” project zero 2023
I'm so excited for tomorrow
WHAT DAY IS IT FOR YOU?? ITS ONLY MARCH 13
IM DYING LAUGHING 💀💀😭😭 NOT THE I HATE YOU - project zero
It's the 14th for me but it's not out what???
omg im so exiteddd
So excited that you showed the base game updates! It was so cute to watch, and I'm so excited to see what you will do with Growing Together!
OMG
infants?!!??!
Honestly this is amazing I love this <3!
“I hate you”
im actually surprised its only 4 days
Hey I hope you had a Blessed and great day!!
Wow
I’m c try omg I thought it came out…
Should be asleep but here I am lol 😬😅🙈 cheers vixella 🤗💙 I never watched the livestream was going to go in blind but couldn't wait lol and the hissing noise that infant made am scared now lol 😂 also I feel like the infants are going to be just as annoying with stairs as puppies are oh god and if dealing with 9 sims on my 3rd gen and also playing with my 4 at the same time all in the same household it's already chaotic and now this ahhhhhh I love it 🙌😂🙈💙
Omg hi vixella I love ur vids
I hate you -a baby zero  on their bday
yea they all look taller to me that is sop good for roplay
Will the family dynamics only appear for the Growing Together pack or will it be included in the base game?
So where do we get ifants do we download it if where
Omg when she hovered over the stats in the sims panel it reminded me of the fire emblem meme of “what are its stats”😂😂
Mt mom thought I was dying because I was in my room screaming the crap out because of this video and she came and thought I was dying
I wish they added a base game changing table
Did you not get early access to the new pack?
I really needed this in my game! And those traits for these little ones are soo cute! Can't waith! 🤗🩷
They basically just used the design from the old toddlers and probs edited them a bit
As someone doing a 100 baby challenge rn,, id say since they cant learn skills you’d just do what you do with the bassinet babies, wait til their birthday-
I think they should have made the infants look more babyish because they look like toddlers just shorter but still an amazing update
im waitng till tomarrow and i cant wait my sim got pregnant so i dont want to open it until it is updated
I can’t wait for this to be in my game!!
my sim literally just had twins and I can't wait for them to turn into infants..its gonna be so crazy
Wait, it’s tomorrow❤😳
4 hours ago woohoo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111111111111111111111111111!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111111!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11111111!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11
The sims are going to be more fun now !
this video is so hilarious lmao 😭 i loved the infants they are adorable
So question what pack is the infants?
i think it’s dumb how they won’t put a changing table into the base game
1:18 no that was WILD 😭
Ahhhhhh I’m so glad your able for review it for us your my fav sims YouTuber
I think we all need a infants cc shopping video 💕:D
i’m seeing a lot of people say they’re just smaller toddlers, which is stupid to say, babies are more fussy, and harder to take care of than toddlers. i feel like you guys don’t know much about babies and toddlers in real life, cause you guys don’t know the difference here💀 and this is basegame!! so it might be little washed down .
I love how there was the science baby named Alexa and how her sister is named Project it's so funny to me for like no reason lol I'm dead 😂
i never ever want kids irl but any time i start to doubt myself i need to just pull them up in the sims, will immediately change my mind LMAO
you didn’t play with the base game babie interactions lol
Idk. They just look and act like smaller toddlers
Project looks just like boo 😭😭😭😭😭
Y the changing table don’t come in the base game tho🥲 i really don’t got all this money for these packs 😭😭
a lot of the outfits and animations being the same kinda makes me feel like we could've gotten this WAY sooner
14:16 the i hate you got me🤣
What time does the update come out???
i’m patiently waiting for baby cc lmao
I'm kind of disappointed that the milestone thing isn't base game, and I also don't like a majority of the base game infant hairs, but other than that the base game babies look good, I can't wait! 🥳
Sasha's grand return to the realm of gameplay. I can't wait to see how this turns out! * puts on opera glasses *
I’m more excited for the free update then the pack as it comes out tomorrow sjsndndndndn I just want to play with the infants ok - however I am still excited for growing together but HELLO A NEW AGE FINALLY SJSNSNWB
I’m wiggly 100& wiggly prob just because I’m a young adhd queen🙄🙄
I thought it was just the angle in the trailer but the tots definitely look taller!! That's awesome. I was worried the infants would look too similar to toddlers but you can definitely tell the difference. Omg I can't freaking wait
Oh my god I wish I were at home with my computer rn!!! Ima update when I have created a new sims 4 family and had them have their infant!!!!!
I am in Australia and like the update hasn't came yet ????
Not the wiggly trait literally being my new kitten
A lot of the outfits and hair styles are just the toddler stuff. I don't know how I feel about it. Hopefully they'll come out with more.
ANYONE KNOW WHEN THE UPDATE IS AVALIABLE TO PLAY!?
This is making me more excited for the update
The toddlers are definitely taller and idk why that makes me upset because the Sims 4 toddlers to me were the cutest creatures ever and idk the taller ones don't hit the sameeee they look, at least in CAS, like 5-7 year olds as opposed to 2-4 🥲🥲🥲 🥲🥲🥲
THIS IS ADORABLE, im so excited!!
1:17 the infant turnned into a baby zombie
every time i see ea members with the infant update i cry
You can make it your goal where the infant has to try all the food or if you get growing together they have to finish all the milestones
I lost it at “try go night night” 😂
THERE OUT ALREADY?! I NEVER GOT TOLD WHAT OMG!
This update soooo good!!
I’m so excited for tomorrow
Ahhh!
Im a sensitive wiggly baby 😂😂😂 that’s so cuteeee
Out?
I’m really excited but I’m a little disappointed in how similar the hairs and clothing are to toddlers. I understand it but at the same time I was expecting different items. Oh well, I’ll just wait for CC creators to do their magic lol
I haven't watched the video yet but I was wondering if anyone else had a similar concern as me with the "science baby" thing. I'm so hyped for this update, literally it's all I've been thinking about, but the one thing that I'm kinda disappointed about is my lesbian sims won't be able to go through pregnancy.   Like...when I found out they were making a way to make the baby genetically related to both moms I was so excited but like, I don't like that it's at the cost of actually watching one of the moms be pregnant, because I love that stage!  Previously I've played with mods and I love having my sim looking after her pregnant wife. Cooking her food when she gets cravings, them talking about first parenting classes, them talking about decorating the child's room, I even love watching my sim give her wife a back massage because her wife is hurting. I love the bounding that comes with being pregnant and I'm really really sad that they're not going to have that anymore.  I guess I just...I feel like...if I wanted an instant baby like...I'd rather just adopt one.  I understand the point was to add inclusivity for same gender couples, and  surrogacy stories but a part of me feels like taking away the getting pregnant aspect takes away a very important milestone from queer relationships.  Does anyone else feel this way or is it just me?
Tomorrow literally can't get here fast enough 😍
Personally I'm going to use infants as like6months - 2years while toddlers are 3-5. I'll like change their hair out so it gets longer and all that cus child sims I swear are like 8-12years old
I'm so excited
the OG toddlers seem like they became the infants just sat down, and the new toddlers just taller, I wish they made the infant look a little more babyish lol
It’s all fun and games till you have an actual infant irl and this update feels too real. 🥲 Have had early access for 6 months. 🥴🤪
Is this free?
The sensitive trait was just me when I was younger and me now 😭😭😭😭
Soooo excited for this update and the new pack omg! Also does anybody know which apple watch band does Vixella use?? Cause it looks so so good and comfy ❤❤
Why do they hiss? I think they get mixed up with cats and dogs😂
Now we just need preteens
14:59 my sims 2 heart🥺
I'm so glad they did the glasses my daughter is more glasses   since she was 5 months old
cannot wait for cc for babies
the way this convinced me to preorder
The "it's hissing at me" and "i hate you"  really cracked me up😂
14:17 IM SOBBING LMFAOO
" I hate you " - Project Zero 14:09
5:49 this animation is so me I love it
Pffdft starting my new 100 baby challenge rn so my 1st baby will be birn soon
1:23 I'm dying 😭😭😭😭
Is this a pack I can get? I have ps4 an idk how to get this
The update came early?
HELP THE "its hissing at me"
Fun challenge idea: being creepy and having science babies with a bunch of townies and famous sims and seeing what you can do
Why this and not… preteens
Project zero look like the girl from monster ink 😭
I'm so sad! How come the FREAKING CHANGING TABLE isn't basegame????
I wish they would’ve made a Jimmy neutron hair for the babies in the Sims Since Debi Derryberry is the voice of the babies, I love Jimmy neutron! And Debi! And the Jimmy Timmy power hour! Or just a Jimmy neutron reference! Like a toy that looks like Goddard!
yes they are taller they said that they where going to look de baby's younger so i think that the rest wil look older
why does a pack come w it, can’t we jus have something realistically normal in the base game update w out having to pay 🤦‍♀️
Just watched James Turner doing a 7 infants challenge (everyone almost died!) so thought I would check out some sensible gameplay....
"i hate you" Project says as baby Alexa grows up lmao Project wants to be the only sibling
Very cute! I love everything even the dirty diaper on the floor!
I definitely didn't expect this. Lol.
They are boss baby
When does the new update come out?
They’re definitely taller
Has the update come now
The cc for infants are gonna be so cute
So basically infants r just little toddlers?
im in a class but when i saw this i put myself on mute and watched it aaa
Glad you enjoyed it I really loved seeing it even tho tomorrow people playing Xbox and stuff will get it but just masterpiece of this update 👌
Alright, people keep saying that the toddlers are taller, but they definitely are not. They are the same size as before, it's just that when the toddlers are skinny, they look abnormally lanky for no reason.
the toddlers are 100% taller xD
They need to make a elementary school pack next
I am so freaking exciteddddddd
I don't think toddlers are taller. I think now we've got something smaller it makes them look bigger. I also opened up another toddler create a sim video and their knees, hands and shoulders were still in the same place when I swiped from one screen to other?
Cuteness overload! I can't wait!
Heya question to anyone is Sims 4 worth buying in 2023 or should I wait for the next game or something
Imagine the infant cc,  LITTLE INFANT BATH LITTLE. INFANT. BATH.
Plz pin this comment idk why but if you do tysm AND HIIII
I can't wait for this infant's update
NOT THE HISSING *splashes holy water*
I noticed the baby hissing in urban sims video and i was so confused if it was part of the game or not😭
omg love your vids!!! you should so do a rags to riches w/ infants!!!
today I learned I am not actually an adult with ADHD, I'm really just a sensitive and wiggly infant in disguise
Do you know what really sucks I’m going to California on the day the update comes out for everybody
THE WAY PROJECT SAID “I HATE YOU”
We need pre-teens not infants
YESSSSS INFAAAANTS And toddlers r taller
Considering I was up all night with my hybrid alien toddler who's now about to age up.. yes. That does definitely look taller! Hold up!!! Nope!!! Same height, just looks slightly skinnier... The toddlers have not changed height, I have comparisoned!
I absolutely LOVE this new update coming I can't wait! But.... Why don't we get changing tables in base game??? Seems kinda weird if we get clutter but not the thing the clutter is for lol just something that made me confused
1:50 omg she looks like boo am I the only one???
“I hate you” SENT ME 😂
OMG YOUR SO LUCKY I CANT WAIT
"It's hissing at me... 😰"    I'M DYING 😭🤣🤣😂😅
PLEASE DO A SHORT LIFESPAN LEGACY OMG
Wow....
Yeas
Everyone who has something to complain about the update and pack should do it in hope that EA/Maxis see’s it so they can change/add things in next update 😌
"I hate you" reasonable response to new sibling after already existing and being ignored
This update is amazing I need to get me a pc so I can play
aww so cute i was confused by the hissing lol but other than that we will get a fair amount of things with the update and the outfits are so freakin adorable too
The I hate you lmao
Okay but the cribs look SO un-comfy 💀 I swear Maxis almost never makes comfortable looking objects, especially beds and sofas, they could at least have added blankets, pillows and maybe a teddy bear inside the cribs , infants and babies do sleep with something on them😭
I think I’m the most excited I have ever been for an update rn (pre watched)😅
For the science babies, you have to get to know the Sim you want to have the science baby with and pretty sure you have to get to a certain amount of friendship to do the science baby and when you do it will have that as an option! I hope this helps TYSM FOR ALL THE LIKES
Lovely, another life stage to torture the hell out of 😍
Oh! Early access? I thought they weren't doing this, this time.
The way the second baby is named Alexa (like Amazon Alexa) so this feels a very computer-like family lmao
Hello its my bday tomorrow and I love you bye
" she elasta-girled right over the fence"😂😂😂😭
That’s a baby who wants to be a snake lol  “Baby prison WOOOOOOOO” the energy in that WOOOOOOOO i am here for it, I love a good old baby prison
This is seriously not helping with the baby fever I've been feeling lately, but I don't care, this is so freaking adorable.
i thought that toddler sound was edited in oh my god what WAS THAT
Maybe the infant will have to learn one milestone or 2 , or 1 milestone from each category in order to age up for the 100 baby challenge?
Oh my god, i CANNOT wait for all the adorable cc 🥹🥹
"I hate you" 😂
Why does the baby look like boo from monsters ink
Was I the only one who thought it would be the first baby that was getting updated not the options after aging up
No, you definitely right, the toddler look taller 😂
I forgot they existed
so cute
