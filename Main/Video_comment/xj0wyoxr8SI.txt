Can’t believe it’s been almost five years
Rip
This is f*©king nuts
Wakanda forever my brothers!!🙅‍♂️❤❤❤💪🙏
Rip Chadwick I looked up to black panther and I always pretend to be him rip 😢
0:16
He looks skinny
I like to think the universe had bigger plans for him… he made his impact in such a profound way
2020 sucked
Life is like a garden, when someone asks about the one you want it’s always the “beautiful ones”
Don’t be sad he’s gone be happy that he was here 🙅🏿‍♂️🙅🏿‍♂️
IT’S BEEN A MONTH ALREADY?
Where are all the people that had convinced themselves that he was slimming down for a role? Particularly, those that condescendingly said, "It's called Method Acting".
This is sad 😢 that Chadwick Boseman pass away rip Chadwick boseman you are our kingdom.
Wakanda Forever!
I’m still in complete shock. I wasn’t a huge fan but I remember when I watched black panther and fell In love with his role. His acting was seriously off the scale amazing. Prayers to his friends and family, I am honestly so sad about him. He was such a blessing on this planet. NOT FAIR! 🙏🙏🙏💔💔
Shocked that Ryan was shocked.  I dont know how I feel about  not telling his coworkers.  I guess he felt he could beat it.
He was about 39 years old when he was diagnosed. AT STAGE 3. Unbelievable.
Chadwick Bozeman (1976-2020) May the King Rest in Power✊ WAKANDA FOREVER..✊
'In My Culture,Death Is Not The End' Rest In Peace!I Hope Stan Lee Is With You Now!..See you again...
You young man,  is a viable replacement,  in my honest opinion,  I have watched plenty of your reaction videos and I can clearly see that you are a Marvel fan,  that is good enough for me so in the future, should they decide to recast the role,  perhaps an auditions is in order for you?  I know Chadwick is not easy to replace but you may have that "it" factor.  Please consider this request and perhaps I would gladly subscribe to your channel should you consider my idea.  Just a thought.
Now we have to wait another 10 years to see another black superhero  on screen🙁😢😖😞😖
Man, I heard the news Friday Night and was so devastated. As if 2020 couldn't have gotten worst
“WAKANDA FOREVER”
He'll never be forgotten.
RIP king 🙏🙏🙏
He is in the Ancestral plan now. Chadwick forever man.
WAKANDA FOREVERY !!!!
The worst news. I watched endgame the day after and teared up , when Black Panther came out of the portal at the end.
I don’t want him to be replaced. :(
Its gonna be ok hes in a better place
I kind of thought the same a few times, but you don't want to say things like that out loud...right?
Dammit man 😭😭🥺🥺
Is anyone gonna being up the fact he passed at age 42. Tchalla in gematria equals 42. Operation 42 raised 4.2 million dollars. And played Jackie Robinson who wore 42.
He was  a good man. God bless
It’s crazy how people was bullying him for being sick the world is so cold
WAKANDA FOREVER!!!
I can't shake this one, man. It's going to take a lot more time. Still trying to cope with Kobe and GiGi.
its a stepping off point
🙅🏾‍♂️🙅🏾‍♂️🙅🏾‍♂️
WAKANDA FOREVER!!!!
He is with Stan lee
Yes
😭😭
Keep him in your hearts ❤️ and in all you do.Wakanda isn't just a place in imagination it's a place in your heart ... We are the new heroes he was telling the world about ..It's time now  Wakanda Forever 👑
Wakanda forever!🕊
🐾🐾🐾. /// ♥️♥️😔😔😔🙏🇧🇷 BLACK PANTER FOREVER CHADWICK BOSEMAN FOREVER
Rest In Peace Chadwick Boseman.
You and him same age? Dude that's crazy. It bothers me too man. He was a hell of a guy.
💖
Even years ago I thought something was off. If you look at him in Civil War versus Black Panther he looked a lot more tired and slightly less well. He had looked like he aged rapidly. I thought it was due to the stress and burden of playing this iconic character. He was too good for this world. Like a lightning bolt he came and left his mark on this earth and soon after went. Thank you for everything Mr. Boseman. Rest in paradise your highness. 🖤👊🏿
Let 2020 end!
Chadwick Boseman 1977 -2020
So nuts, but thank you being so honest and providing your genuine commentary. Thank you for your thoughts. As a guitarist performing originals for bk trailers that included Black Panther and as a follower of Chadwick Boseman, I too lament his passing and yet wish him a hymn. Chadwick will be dearly missed as an actor and as a representative for various peoples. My personal favorite films with Boseman will always be "Get on Up" and "21 Bridges
Remember the words “Wakanda Forever”  🙅🏿‍♂️
All we can do is be grateful for the time we had with him. He did more in 43 years than most, and he left his mark on all of us. Forever our King. Wakanda Forever. Chadwick Forever.
Yes , me to . I the same age also.
I remember when you said that. It hard to swallow this . R.I.P CHADWICK our King Black Panther. You be miss and always be remembered to all your fans.
Yes he is gone
Wakanda forever! <3
The fact that he kept his illness private all this time says so much about the man. He wanted to be defined by his life, not by his death.
💔🥺😭
It just feels so surreal.. I haven’t felt this way since Christina Grimmie.. Rest in power Chadwick
I knew something was up on his SNL appearance... I knew it.We love you Chadwick. King T'challa
I hope Chadwick says hello to stan for us
This year is not it
I remember you calling this when that picture went out.
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahah
God bless Chadwick...............
Wakanda forever! Always remember.
F 😟
Rest in peace
Way too soon 💔

Great Content brother! You got yourself a subscriber from Cincinnati, Ohio. keep up the good work.

He will now go to the heaven of legends
My heart hurts. WAKANDA FOREVER!

So sad. It was a real shock hearing about it the other night.
*CHADWICKFOREVER*
May he rest in peace along with the other legends we have lost over the year
Legit shed a tear for Chadwick boseman cause he was one of my favorite actors and black panther is one of my fav movies may he Rest In Peace
All around great actor. Very sad to see someone so young lose the fight .
Don’t be too upset with anybody just trust the Almighty God for your life sake Amen. He did not speak his health business to nobody because he did not wanted for anybody to say anything to him that he will not want to listen to them too.
He packed on major movie victories in his career,great choices to leave behind  knowing he was dying.RIP
WAKANDA FOREVER!! BOSEMAN FOREVER!!
God and Jesus Christ accepted his soul in your good keeping 🙏❤
so sad, was hoping to see him for years to come
May he Rest In Peace

I had no clue something was wrong. I didn't know much about him. I loved his acting in Infinity War and his Athletic ability. As Black Panther. This year is the worst...
So damn sad... any time it happens to anyone in many ways like so. Especially when thriving
Rest In Peace my king!!
He's an avenger in real life
He was gone too soon. Wakanda for Chadwick forever.
😢
I just hate 2020

Sir, get your colon checked too, something good has to come of this
2020 is the worst year of my life . I will always love Chadwick Boseman and his legacy will be remembered for the rest of my life and others Rest in peace Chadwick Boseman .
Even two days later, I’m still having a hard time accepting it. It almost doesn’t seem real. Absolutely heartbreaking. I cried the night I found out.
Tears is ripping throw my heart.
Rest in peace king,you were loved by millions.
Same here I saw that he wasn’t healthy so I looked it up. I really wish we were wrong 😔
Tragic I had no idea he was sick
I swear 2020 be to quiet and this is why it scares me... He will always be the king of wakanda
It's amazing that he didn't show this struggle, this battle he faced everyday to us his fans but continued to give us a amazing life performance, captivated us in every film right up until...that is no easy feat, to say that's incredible it's a understatement, he's so truly inspiring.
I feel you on the age front man. I was born less than a month after him. Scares the hell out of me!
Nooo 🥺❤️❤️❤️🙏🏻
He just wasn't done. The performances we saw were but the tip of a very large iceberg of where he was headed.
😭😭😭😭😭😭
My heart, as are all of ours, hurts today.  Such an incredible human being!!  Rest in power king 👑!!
I can’t believe it!  I didn’t even know he was sick.  Really loved him in 42 and of course Black Panther.  Rest In Peace.
This literally broke my heart. I cannot help but ask why him.
Get a colonoscopy atleast annually, it may save your life one day

It is so sad 😭😭😭😭😫💦💦🖤🖤💙💙💘
Rest in peace 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Just when I thought 2020 couldn't get any worst. I hate this.
I think the best thing the black community can do is fully unite and focus on bringing happiness, wealth in the community like Chadwick wanted and was saw when he released black Panther and the movie about Jackie Robinson
This one hurts.....
Hit me hard that's why he was so skinny in that picture I seen awhile back
He gave us the best of him while in pain.   True King.   Wakanda Forever.
😥 😥😞🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏
One word: Legend.
I said the same thing. I was wondering why he was so skinny months ago. I'm so upset
Yo 12th in trending in UK, Tyrone my man

Really sad.  I was shocked to hear it.  He had such a bright future.
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
F😭
Pls tell me
Wakanda forever !
Is he black panther?
1:23 Infinity War and Endgame were filmed back to back, the same time. He didn't look smaller in Endgame.
He is not with us anymore but he will remain in our hearts forever❤️
Wakanda Forever!  Rest in peace Chadwick.
Still can’t believe it...
He brought a lot of happiness to me and others with his films. This hurts.
The man was going through surgeries and chemotherapy BETWEEN filming. What a god damn fighter and Legend. And he did that for us dude. Thank you Boseman.
This man brought Black Panther on the big screen for us, even when he was going chemotherapy. May you rest in peace Chadwick Boseman, WAKANDA FOREVER!

Chadwick really became the Heath Ledger of Marvel 😞
It hurts more when your the same age. Blessings to you
PLEASE men... Please get checked.  He was an amazing man. Thank you.
Everyone's claiming that Chadwick was pushing through the pain for the fans. Nah. My boy just didn't want any doctor putting his fingers up his cornhole.
This is so sad
Did y’all know he was in his forty’s I thought he was in his 20s he looked so young
and he was my fav person in black panther
i heard from the news
It's always the people that deserve it least I swear
Rest in peace.Chadwick😿

😥😫😫😫
💖REST IN PEACE DEAR SIR💖
Just think about that, he was sick, but don't stop working. Continued acting, continued coming to the awards show, and other things. And even friends from Marvel set didn't know anything. It's really sad news. Shock and sad. Rest in peace, the King.
Such is life.
Sometimes I wonder why I'm still here and others like Chadwick, who have so much to offer and have brought so much joy to other people, have passed way too soon.
Like I am so mad and sad at the same time because this is crazy he was like the only black American well I don’t know if he’s American but he was the only one that was black that was a superhero so like my mood is off like he was my favorite in the movie Black Panther he did the accent right my God😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Legend after Legend 😞
I was a huge fan of his role in Black Panther and he always seemed to be so full of life. I legitimately thought he was slimming down for a role, but when I heard the news, I cried all morning. Such a promising young man with a major career ahead of him. His legacy will remain strong forever, but today is definitely a sad day. Rest in paradise, Chadwick Boseman 🖤
No one can replace him as Black Panther. He is Black Panther. 🙅
May you rest in peace. WAKANDA FOREVER!
He Nailed James Brown . He was Hilarious in that Film.
absolutely crazy. i was not expecting this at ALL
Rest in peace my king wakanda forever🙅
May he Rest In Peace the man who brought encouragement to all the world and love I hope you  have peace in your lives peace out I’ll pray for the man and you

So sad
Hope he's looked after in God's home and his family recover stronger and healthier. My condolences to his family.
😢🖤✊🏿
What an absolute legend of a man.
That’s a real tough dude.  That was a gut punch.
I new something was up when I saw it to ty sad 😔
He is in a better place. Just imagine that dream scene in Black Panther.
Whilst some say its the end in my religion its the beginning of a new chapter in his life everlasting life, he's in a much better place now.
I'm over 2020. It's taken too damn much from us.
If i could do something, i wish i was gone instead of him
Wakanda Forever
One of my only favorite Marvel movies he was a power house in shock may he rest in Power and peace.
I saw this on my phone this morning. All I can say is 2020 is the worst year by far. 😢
Dude brought alot of happiness to people in the world may he rest in peace
May he RIP...a beautiful soul gone too soon.
No black panther 2
2020 has really taken a lot from us. I hate it hoping it gets better.
Well, said!! I feel sick over this, too :( Rest in Power, King T’Challa
Wakanda foreva. 🙅🏽‍♂️
I still can’t process it
So if he was diagnosed 4 years ago. He did Black Panther sick. Thats determination
I Blame COVID-19 For this

Very upsetting Chadwick accomplished a lot and had more to do. But no opportunity now  to do it. Thank you Chadwick for such a heroic fight on and off the screen. Now let me speak to 2020 directly. What is this! GO TO HELL 2020!!!!!!! I am done with you.
Pray for Chadwick Boseman Family
Hopefully the MCU does something to honor him, and don’t recast him, just don’t
Chadwick boseman rest in peace you will be in our hearts forever
Rest In Power King 🙏🏾🙅🏾‍♂️🖤
Rest  in peace chadwickbossman 😭😭
Rest in Power, King.
I am in deep shock.
He was the black panther, nobody can fill his shoes ✊🏻😭
I’m absolutely devastated and in complete shock. It’s just so sad that we didn’t know he was fighting this.
I feel the same,Tyrone.  I'm the same age. It just turns my stomach around.
I’ve gone through chemotherapy because of leukemia so I know when I see someone sick.
Rest In Peace 😭
This is sad man... Really sad...R.I.P
He was actually 42, dont know why media switched it up
Wakanda Forever!
You will always be remembered Boseman.......

After all the things in 2020 , this one hurts the most .
We will remember him 😞😞😞
Rest In Peace Chadwick Boseman 😔💖❤️
I don’t want a new Black Panther movie if he isn’t Black Panther.
*MAY ALLAH GRANT HIM HEAVEN, HE WAS SUCH A SWEET AND BEAUTIFUL MAN, I KNOW ALLAH WILL GRANT HIM A HIGH PLACE IN HEAVEN. MAY ALLAH GRANT PATIENCE TO HIS FAMILY MEMBERS (AMEEN) HE WAS A FIGHTER IN THE MOVIE AND A FIGHYER IN REALITY*
Can’t believe this..
Rest in peace Chadwick Boseman and Wakanda forever.
I'm really sad
WAKANDA FOREVER
Rest in Power Great King!
Tragedy... Doesn't feel real. Just like the Kobe death it was too soon
I'm beyond devastated and to find out he was making all of these films while he was ill rocks my soul. REST IN POWER Chadwick Boseman
I thought he secretly was battling covid, I didnt think it was this worse. May he rest in peace, brother.
2020 needs to chill the f up
Wakanda forever
2020 Me: lets pray, might be next
Kobe now him. He was a great person who brought love from his movies 😞
Why this year, GOD JUST WHY
wakanda forever...
My heart is so broken!💔😓
What did he do to 2020
Wakanda forever ! :<
Man I just read this this morning..... Wow. I didn't even see the movie yet
This really bothered me aswell 😢
🌹 R.I.P🌹  🌹Chadwick Boseman🌹     🌹Wakanda forever🌹
Da 5 bloods is a great movie y’all. The brother was a leader and left behind a powerful legacy.
It's funny Tyrone was the first one I thought of because of that video. This sucks alongside everything else in 2020.
Was this necessary
This is terrible news! 2020 strikes yet again! Rest in peace Mr. Boseman, WAKANDA FOREVER!
😭 💜
I just want to forget 😥😥😥😥 forget 2020 😭😭😭😭😭
I've only just found out, it's absolutely sad as hell. My love and condolences to his family and friends. X
WAKANDA FOREVER 😔
Like wow bro I was shocked man poor guy
😥😢✌🙏😭😿😰💔🖤✊😩😖Chadwick boseman goodbye 👋 ♥
Rest In Peace Chadwick Boseman, you were and still are a true King.   "In my culture, death is not the end.”  - T'Challa  WAKANDA FOREVER!
Wakanda forever ✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿
None of us thought he was that sick.
Rest in peace.
I knew something was up.  Losing weight through dieting looks totally different to dropping weight due to a disease sucking and ravishing the life out of a person’s body.  Chadwick looked totally different to actors that were deliberately losing weight for a role.  Maybe it’s because I worked with elderly patients in a hospital  - Rest In Power Mr Chadwick Boseman - 👑 King T’Challa 🕊 🙏🏾
He prayed for the role and brought it to life. Now the lord's waiting for him. Thank you Chadwick and we love you 3000!
I didn't like the Black Panther film, but he was a beast in Civil War and Infinity War. His career was only just starting to take off too. I hope he's in a better place.
Wakanda forever He gonna be in our hearts forever
U said it..
Boycott mcu
Wakanda forever.
Rest in peace bro✊🏿😔
🙏❤️Rest In Peace Chadwick Boseman❤️🙏
2020 just keeps raging on with more depressing news , just make it *END* already !
Wakanda forever
For black ppl this guy was inspirational ppl were surprised with how black panther was blowing up in the box office
Even in his infinity war/endgame suit he looked very ill. Smh RIW
Farewell Young King 👑
OMG, I had no idea.
I am absolutely shoked. Absolutely shocked.
Ebombay ebombay ebombay ebombay
WAKANDA FOREVER!!!
Have no idea he was even fighting this disease while he was making Black Panther....😒
nobody even knew he was sick. what a trooper.
He looked so young and healthy two years ago. Rest in Power Chadwick.
Sad day
God giveth, and God taketh..
"Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince, and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest." Too young, way too young. He fought the cause of his death while living his life, this is what heroes do. Costume or no, he's a hero. T'challa lives!
Don’t be sad he’s gone, be happy he was here and gave us such amazing performances that we will remember, for years to come.
Bothers me too man
Can 2020 just go right for once
He knocked over little groot.
I think he was older than Tyrone. He was born in 1976 and Tyrone was born in 1977.
Unbelievable
I still couldn't believe this.  Did he even tell anyone about his true health condition? This is too sudden 😭
I say we get all marvel and DC actors to do the chant from endgame where the exit the portal in honor of Boseman with Kevin fiege leading the stand
Wakanda forever my friends 😪
2020 is taking everything from us😭😭😭
This is so sad. Definitely gone too soon. 😞💔
I must say what a class act to keep it to himself. So many people go for sympathy.  Loved him in 42
NC double A, NCAA, NC.. Lawyer 🤣🤣  R.I.P to Chadwick Boseman.. man tragic year. This one definitely hit
May he rest in peace.
Do you know why I subscrib to you..... because of your humanity. I love how you give a damn about all races and creeds.  God i hate this year RIP Boseman
2020...
I remember when you made a video about that picture of him looking sick. And now this. I am so upset
He was 43?! Damn!!
الله يرحمة 🌚
This is sad, is Black Panther 2 still happening
He was on of the good guys...
Man U called it man. I saw the signs and it reminded me of my stepmother. I assumed he was doing a film and getting ready for Japan. They yasuke film was in the works. Smh RIP

💧👁💧💧👁💧💔💔💔
2020😵😭
Wakanda  forever
I been a fan of Chadwick since I saw him on Lincoln heights . Rest In Peace ❤️
Wakanda Forever!
😨😰😱
2020 has been a rough year to say the LEAST... and we still have 4 months to go......
James brown, jack Robinson, and the king of Wakanda rest in piece 🙅🏿
This awful year just got even worse. So sad.
2020 is not a meme anymore
This planet is falling apart I hate it 😠 we can't just do it for everyone else it 2020 is a dangerous year on the planet 😭 right
2020 really is worse
Rest in Power.
I was looking forward to the next sequel to Black Panther movie.
I knew he had something.
Wakanda Forever ✊
Wakanda Forever!
I just broke down in tears for a man who give a true hero to movies and loved by everyone from every nation and every country he was my hero!!!!!!!!....
This is terrible  look at Celine Dion also😥
Wakanda forever! ❤
✊🤲👑🖤👑🤲✊
Its a shame some dont even know his name .
2020 is like the app that always fails when you start it .
Man I can’t go in any platform without seeing this and shedding a few tears
No no no no no no no no pls no no pls no no no NO PLS NO
Now he is with Stan lee
This one hit me hard bro
Farewell Black Panther.  Wakanda Forever. Amen. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I’m heartbroken. I will say only one thing: “Fly high my King! Wakanda Forever!”
He's gone,but not forgotten 😔😔 R.I.P man.Wakanda forever.
Mr. Boseman dedicated his life to making people strong and united. So let us be strong, for him. And let us be united, for him.
One thing to take is if he could do all that he did while battling that - we got no excuse.
Wakanda forever my king
Did he already film Black Panther 2?
Well congrats that u knew it, but thats not gonna bring him back
2020 haunts us yet again!!
Wakanda Forever!!!✊
DAME 😭
2020 is fucked up and im not looking forward to 2021 idk what else to say other than he is in a better place now
i cried a little when i heard
R.I.Power CHADWICK BOSEMAN. You will always be our black panther.
Chadwick was a real life superhero. Rest in power king
It kind of explains why he looked so awful over the quarantine
Hes in the ancestral plane now.
🙏
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Death is a new meaning to entering another universe.
life is so unfair man...
I was one of those fucking idiots who thought 😞he was trying to get ready for a role, rest in power king 💔😔😔
He kept silence since 2016 about this, keep working, interviews, etc. Dude, what an example.
Too many deaths idk how to feel
Heartbreaking.
Just remember the great mark He left in history! Rest up king!
*Rest In Power King*
Wakanda forever 🙏🙏🙏
2020  Enough
May he Rest in Peace, Boseman forever !
Good night, King T'Challa. ; _ ; Wakanda forever!
2020 is such a rough year famous people kept on passing away 😭
How do you dislike this video. Shame on everyone who disliked it. Wakandaforever.
I bet he wanted to go out with a bang
HERO.....WARRIOR....KING......LEGEND......
What is there else to say but thank you
Chadwick Boseman, I tip my hat to you as respect. Prayers for his family.
This is the worst thing to wake up to, I'm in shock
what he did most people can't achieve in a lifetime, that is gold
WAKANDA FOREVER.....😔😔
I’m really devastated after finding out he passed away. Rest in power and everlasting peace, Chadwick Boseman. Wakanda Forever!
Our king t challa, the black panther
WAKANDA FOREVER  BLACK PANTHER FOREVER  CHADWICK BOSEMAN FOREVER REST IN PEACE OUR KING THANK U
WAKANDA FOREVER
😢😢
Seems strange.
Rise of peace King T'Challa
Rest in Power, King.
WAKANDA FOREVER✊🏾
Everyone talks about him in Black Panther. When in my opinion, his best performance was playing Jackie Robinson in "42."
I saw this report on TV and literally yelled out WHAT????? I couldn't believe it. I had no idea he was even sick. So sad.
😔 🙏🙏🙏 This year's is outta hand, yet ithink it's getting more worse and worse  ⏳⏳⏳⌛⌛⌛
Death comes for us all, are you ready? If you don't have Jesus you better be scared. Hope that guy was saved.
WAKANDA FOREVER
I'm in absolute shock
You called it Way too soon. Cadwick endured  treatment while working, he really was a super hero.
😥............
Death isn’t the end- T’challa
😐 Chadwick Boseman
Wakanda forever.
YIBAMBE! / Hold Fast.
No matter what he is still on our hearts ,wakanda 4ever.
He was sick I knew it when I sae him 21 bridges
I can't believe this
I'm so saad  for him
Death is not the end rest in peace brother 😞
I just heard the news and I am deeply saddened by his passing.
Chadwick Forever!
WTF is going on this year?!?! 😞
Just literally found out this very moment that this man has passed away. (BBC News). God rest his soul. Best wishes to his friends and family from here in Scotland.
True legend Wakanda, forever
When Black Panther 2 will be released they need to start with memorial for Chadwick Boseman.   "The movie is dedicated for Chadwick Boseman, the original Black Panther.  Wakanda Forever!"    T_T
Why is there adverts on this?
I thought he was sick when I say the Da 5 bloods. He didn’t look well.
This can't be real
I woke up to this news and i'm heartbroken. Rest In Power, Chadwick! 💔
😫😫😫😫😫
May he rest in peace😿
Youuu i hate this 2020
2020 still going strong.
Hol up Hol up dis is extremely sad but he said they tha same age? I refuse to believe Tyrone is 43
Now it makes sense why they wanted Shuri as BP.
Wakanda Forever
Still can’t believe he’s gone
2020 took everything from us.
This is just sad...
May our King rest in peace
Rest in peace Chadwick Boseman. We love you 3000❤

Chadwick Boseman Rest in peace ☮️
🙏🙏🙏
I thought he was suffering from anorexia or he was depressed  but I knew he wasn’t ok.
Faked his death like pac😎
I kinda hope they don’t recast black panther in honour of his memory but they probably will
Mourn him, remember him and honor him. May his transition and arrival to the next realm be as impactful as your departure from this one. Shine king!
Hit me like a ton of bricks. Rest In Power
Yibambe! Yibambe! Yibambe! Wakanda Forever!
Can't believe this can't be!
I HATE 2020!!!!
Wakanda Forever
Wakanda Forever 🙏🏾😭🥺

cant wait for 2020 to be over. 2020 sucking for alot of people
just when you thought this year couldn't get any worse
Lol
I’m so done with 2020 🥺
This hurts bro. Crazy him and Kobe in one year😢
“With being black you gotta extra extra try” - Big Sean.   Only some will get it.
Im devestated by this
Yes Tyrone Magnus you called it ages ago. I cannot believe he passed at the age of 43. Wow..
2020 has just been one disaster after another.
Why!!!!😢😢😭😭😔🙁☹
I was not expecting this one bit! what the hell man..
Yibambe!
I hope that the suffering ended, and he was able to pass away in peace god bless him!
To go through that and carry on working what a legend. Rest in peace Chadwick 🙏
21 Bridges was a top film 👍
Okay big guy calm down
Life is quick. Don't let it slip by.
Reverse this please
Wake me up when 2020 is over
Rest in peace, Chadwick.
This year man...
Alllll the money and you couldn't do dr sebi diet to fix your body omg man i wish we could all tap into our true potential and get away from the lies aand illusions
I’m so heartbroken
Wakanda forever...
: 😥 😥 😥 😥 😥
May he rest in peace Wakanda Forever.
😥😭😭💔
💜🖤
2020 is so horrible
Boseman forever.. 😢  Rest In Peace...
May He Forever Rest In Peace
I think I'm in pure denial. I can't accept that such a great human being left us.
I really can't believe it. 😢
WAKANDA FOREVER
Respect goes out to you for making this video, rest in peace
You can see the difference in his weight the further along in the MCU the films went.  He looked fuller and healthier in Civil War compared to Endgame.
2020 ain't the year dawg 😔
🙏🙏🙏🙏🖤🖤🖤🖤
a moment of silence.... 😔
He was more than Black Panther, he was an example of what a great man is. This year is too much. I won't go any further.
PLEASE!!! LET 2020 END AND FAST
This has just destroyed me 😭 R.I.P Chadwick Wakanda forever
Anyone remember that meme that said “Wakanda sometime??” I always hated it because I knew something ain’t right. I hate it sooo much now. Rest In Peace King 👑
Very shocking and sad news may he rest well 😔
😢 R.I.P. Wakanda forever!
He was 10 years younger than me.  ☹☹☹☹☹
2020 wtf have you Done man
Only Michael B Jordan can replace him as the Black Panther(and I'm well aware of Killmonger)!
ALL HAIL THE KING! They will be playing the Wakanda national anthem for him when he arrives in heaven with Stan Lee waiting at the gates to greet him.
Alright the joke is over someone just tell me it’s a prank
Losing The Black Mamba (Kobe) and The Black Panther in the same year is indeed a downer.
He is in a good place now ❤️
Fuk 2020
WTF.... What The F*ck!!!
F 2020
This year just keeps bashing everyone to the ground man...
Why you are all so sad about his death? He is in good place right now.
Thank you for everything you have done Boseman
He did not look himself in endgame either. He didn't look okay
2020 somehow just keeps getting worse and worse, FFS.
You srs? 2020 just stop killing ppl... 😡
Wakanda Forever 🖤🖤🖤
When you realize all the silent struggling he was pushing through these past few years, you realize that Chadwick was truly a real-life Superhero.  Rest in Power. WAKANDA FOREVER
He did have more to give but what he gave us was a hell of alot may he rest in peace
This truly hurts. He is such a shining light. An inspiration. A dream. WAKANDA FOREVER
As if 2020 couldn’t be worse 😞😞😞
I hate this year
2020 its the worst year of my life
😢😢😢😢😭😭😭😭
WAKANDA FOREVER!
WAKANDA FOREVER 😩😩😩
"That's Life"
Wakanda, Wakanda forever 😔
I guess he froze after all.
He was an inspiration to millions through the characters he played, all while dealing with his own battles. Rest In Peace.
This is terrible news.  One question though isn't the NC double A a college sports thing?
♥️⚫️
King forever
Idc
We were all scared when he was so thin man. Rest in peace to the King.
Im overdue for a scope, makes me a little nervous.  He was a trooper, Rest in Heaven Chadwick.  .
When your time comes , its time my friend . Thats it
Wish there was a sad button rather than like/disklike because this was truly sad news :-/
A true warrior & a humble young man. Brought excitement & joy thru many hearts of fans & the world. Thank you for love may you  ( R.I.H). Chadwick prayers to the family🌹🌹🙏🏾🙏🏾..

what a legacy he left behind 💔💔
Taken too soon, god bless his soul x he bring joy to so many people, we will remember him!

Requiescat in pace. May you walk freely in the afterlife.

I'm literally heartbroken.
Just when you think 2020 couldn't POSSIBLY get any worse...
Rest easy chad  Wakanda forever!!!
I just woke up to this news. Please tell me I’m having a nightmare 😭😭😭😭
2020 is some bullshit man 😣😔
I was not ready for this news😢
Such a shame
Rest in peace our King, Wakanda forever.
Make your own WAKANDA up there sir 🙏 Rest in Heaven KING  WAKANDA forever💪🏿
Nothing to say, this is just so sad.
If u knew that then WTF could u have done???
😭😭
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no 😔😔😔
Chadwick Boseman,Rest in Claws🦁
It's a sad today and it hurts to know that he is no longer with the living. It was an honor to see him cast in the roles he played in.
WAKANDA FOREVER
Chadwick Boseman Forever !!!!
Wakanda forever 😥🖤✊🏽
I’m devastated
He touched so many people, everyone, no matter their country or color. Already on social media I see he’s healing unhealable hurts and rifts. That is a superhero.
I said the same thing when I saw how he looked.
Yeah you were saying he wasn't looking well, it's painful to say 🙏 Rest in peace
The craziest thing is he was cast as T'Challa in Civil War, which came out in 2016. He would've known about his illness when it dropped. He was such a humble soul, that he didnt let that get in the way of becoming an idol for everyone, and being an example of a Hollywood not dominated by one ethnicity.  Yibambe. Rest easy, King.
PRESS F.
Rest in paradise
Rest In Peace my king  Wakanda forever
Marvel better not replace this legend, he is the true king and may he Rest In Peace
Wakanda Forever. Always in our heart
always remember,WAKANDA FOREVER!
Bothers me too. I could hardly believe it. I’m taking this harder than Christopher Reeve’s accident and death. And he had the same impact.  Rest in peace Mr Boseman.
I couldn’t believe this!!!!  I had to go to imdb to check im devastated!!!!!! Very sad news just ruined my day 😢😢😢😢
I can feel this man through the screen. It hurts man. This one feels...
Rest in peace 🙏
I cried a few seconds ago and I am not ashamed to admit it.
Rest In Power King 😔🙏
2020. Let's go dude. Best year of all time.
😭😭😭😭😭
He looked like a really nice guy in real life. 2020 is really fucked up year man...
It's not fair I wish god could have extended his life a bit longer maybe God had plans for him but they do say that our body is just a Shell but our soul and energy still lives on
Wasn't even having a good day today, now this bullshit.... I'm beyond upset... REST IN POWER, BOSEMAN ✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾
Noooooo!!!!!!
I've been up all night because of this
well no more black panther movies hehe
2020 ladys and gentlemen... 2020
I am in shock! Gutted...this is so sad.😢
I wish I could wake up and 2020 was a dream and 2020 is amazing
his portrayal of james brown and jackie robinson were some of my all time favorite movie rolls
😭😭😭
Tremendously sad only.  Way too soon is right.
Men thats so sad.. Rest In Peace and Rest in Power Chadwick youre a hero and a big fighter 💔💔💔💔
so sad man it’s a shock to hear about it today big fan bro
I'm actually done with 2020 y'all
He was a true warrior. Rest in power wakanda forever
🙅🏽‍♂️Wakanda forever
🙅🏾‍♂️🙅🏾‍♂️🙅🏾‍♂️🙅🏾‍♂️🙅🏾‍♂️
Wakanda Forever 🖤💜
Super unexpected 🥺 !!
I hope marvel do a tribute that would be so nice
Four years.  He didn’t go down without a fight.
He wanted to keep it secret, I guess he wanted to spend the little time he had left in private with his loved ones
💔💜💔💜💔
This is very sad indeed but what happens to the black panther now ? Its not going to be the same but IDK they may surprise me.
I just can't believe this....I am in shock
😭
Wakanda forever! :(
Yup,he was talented
Kevin Durant!
Bothered me too
His soul going to wakanda world i wish happy in wakanda forever rest in peace
This guy is the next actor of black panther
I feel like I keep saying this but I’m going to go ahead and tempt the devil. 2020 CANNOT GET ANY WORSE!
Heavy heart bruh. Me too. Rest in Power brother Chadwick ✊🏾
Rest in peace. WAKANDA FOREVER
Brother you hang on to jesus
Can’t believe this man, sooo sad. Such a hero on and off screen
Still can't get over it and it is like kobe and gigi again. It is sad beyond sad. May his be with the Lord forever. 🎥🎬📽🕯💃✊✌👊👑📿🐾
💔🙏🏻 amen
May he rest in peace.
Wakanda forever :(
It dosent feel the same without him 🥺💔
I cant belive this. 💔😢
I didnt know,this is just so sad 😟😟😟
Damn, and wasn’t there talks of black panther 2?
The man stood as if no one stood against him... a true role model... way too soon... Rest In Peace.
I literally just woke up to the news and I'm still registering this.
What going to happen to black Panther ?
😢
Just glad he's no longer in pain, and now is in the best place possible 😭🙏🏿👐🏾
His soul rest in perfect peace.
Man.......2020............2020 just keep getting worse and worse man.................
i feel like i'm dreaming this can't be real
Wakanda Forever rest easy king 😔🕊💜🖤💔
Darn praying for his family! God bless rest in peace..
The man who literally has Chad in his name lived his life as a true Chad.  May he Rest In Peace. God Bless🙏
I can’t believe it. He will be remembered as one of the all time greats and he was barely getting started.
So heartbreaking. Much love and prayers to all his loved ones.
Geez he didn't look ill at all
This year is cursed
Sad news 😪
Within our hearts  He will always be the rightful king of WAKANDA   WAKANDA FOREVER
2020 is the worst year in modern era.
Very sad news 🙏 May his soul rest in peace 🙏
It doesnt feel real. I hope 2020 is just playin with my head
WAY WAYYY TOO SOON 💔💔
I knew he was sick. He didn't look well indeed. There's a different between someone who's just skinny (like I was in my college days), someone who's on a diet, & people who's skinny ill. Boseman was skinny ill. He looked pale & his eyes looked tired. I knew it but I didn't know what caused it. The worse thing was, some people made fun of him being very skinny. Rest in peace, King.
Rest In Peace Chadwick 🙏😔
MY son told ME I just broke 😭😭😭down Mahnnn. I'm done ✔
This year needs to end Its taking to much from us.☹😢
2020 is the worst
Am heartbroken 💔 😭😭
Can this year get any worse
This is nuts brother
😣 dame it I knew sumthing was up
Wakanda forever!
W A K A N D A   F O R E V E R
Rest in peace king tchalla 😢
God rest his soul. God Bless Tyrone, take it easy man.
Rest in peace Chad... Rest in peace
I am same age too Tyrone! Sad!! Makes me think i need my colon checked!
😔
Wakanda forever🖤
2020.... just go already..
Damn... 2020, good lord...
i blame the cops
Rest easy now King T'challa
I'm just Shocked!!
“To be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord”  He’s in a better place honestly
:C
Rest in peace Boseman. You will always be remembered.
An ICON . Rest In Peace KING 💖
I CANNOT BELIEVE this man is GONE.... Rest in power... 2020 took a king from sports and acting... Who else is next?

:(
My heart is very broke 💔
This made my family sad
May he rest in peace! 😞
He passed on Jack Kirby's birthday anniversary (created black panther w/ stan lee), Jackie Robinson Day, MLK's "I have a Dream" 57th Anniversary, and Emmet Till's 65th anniversary of his death. Just strange. What a hit.
Still in shock.
For real Tyrone.  He was getting thinner and thinner.  🙅🏾‍♂️🙏
Bro wtf is actually happening in 2020??? There's literally something crazy every other week.
I cant believe it
Im in shock.  Kobe and Chadwick. Devastated.

Wakanda forever 🙏
Just think of him entering heaven.  You know he walked in through a glowing portal.  Just like he did in Endgame.  Looked over at Stan Lee and just gave that subtle nod of the head.
Just if 2020 couldn’t go worse
Bro why
The dude fought it for 4 years damn he was a true warrior  I mean a legend
Nnnoooooooo
They better not recast bro
To be that skinny being able to see your skull is not normal. I don’t a person who would do that. I was concerned and didn’t think this was gonna happen. I’m actually sad. Can’t stop thinking about it. He was such and icon in 42 and black panther
May the King rest 😔🙏🏽
If he was born in November 1977, would he be 42 until November this year? IMDb and others have the age at 42. Ironically the number of Jackie Robinson in whom he masterfully played. Could someone check my math cause either me, imdb or most of the news agencies are wrong. Just a testimony how inaccurate the media can be with a simple date. We all remember birthdays don’t we?
2020, is the worst year of our lives.
Guess it wasn't Wakanda forever
It hurts huh... Everyone noticed his weight..... that was so painful just to see him like that
😪😪😪😪 this is sad
Black panther love you 3000😭
Rest And Peace Chadwick
Yeah you called it, I remember.  He looked like Charlie Murphy is his last days and I heard the same things about "he just lost weight" etc
I remember you saying something back then!
My heart hurts man. Wakanda forever
It hurts so much.
my friend told me and i thought he was joking...
WHO EVER THE FUCK DISLIKE THIS VIDEO YOUR A PIECE OF SHIT AND I HOPE YOU DIE A HORRIBLE DEATH !
I feel like screaming right now. This can't be true.
😪😪😥😪my favorite  super hero  has passed
My day was going so damn well..
I was wondering when he did the snl skit. I thought he looked unnaturally thin and wondered if something was up. Really shocked and sad to hear this
I’m absolutely shocked I really can’t believe it.
Rest in peace, Chadwick. WAKANDA FOREVER!
You called that shit foreal
You did mention it when the rumors came around about him giving up the BP role.
On Jackie Robinson day, and he was 42.
My heart is broken for his friends and family.  I have no words to describe my pain. It just hurts.
I...i don't know what to say anymore. I just woke up from this Morning only to see that he passed away.  2020 already is a tough year but this is just Cruel
Yep I said the same thing!!!! I knew something was up too!!!
Rest In Peace  Chadwick  Bossman
So sad
This guy played Tchalla very well. He's like Hugh Jackman wolverine. It's hard to replace him.
2020 is getting worst and worst....
I'm speechless
I don't know how much more of 2020 I can take.
Our Heavenly Father putting us through greater trials and pain this year that get worse and worse.
This is by far the worst year man..

“In my culture, death is not the end.” - T’Challa

There's no black panther without Chadwick prayers go out to his family he will be forever remembered  rest in peace
REST IN PEACE, CHADWICK :(
Michael b Jordan as Erik killmonger to pick up the role of black panther
I am shocked
He probably just couldn't take the pain 4 years smh man that's insane
He's our Knight in a shing Black Panther Armour and a fighter you would always cheer on, We love you Chadwick Boseman, Stan Lee will tell you how proud is he of you. ;)
May he Rest In Peace
*Wakanda Forever*
I really don’t wanna believe it I’m so heartbroken
Brother Ty, I feel the pain also. I really dug the hell out him playing James Brown, he had it down!!!!!!!
😪😦
nooooo waaay nooooo
You will be forever be remembered rest in peace legend Chadwick Boseman.
Now you can be the next black panther.
whay to soon... Im devasted ;(
I had no idea he was going through this. I feel ashamed for not knowing. At least he's not suffering anymore. Of all his roles, he will always be the King of Wakanda to me. May he rest in peace. Wakanda forever!
Wakanda Forever 😢
Tango down
Rest In Peace King T'challa.
He's not just a hero     He's a super hero 😢
Rest in power
Rest In Peace King !
Rest in peace and I swear to all that is holy Disney better not dare try to even make a sequel or recast him as Black Panther that would be so disrespectful and disgusting of them to do that.
Ya i was the same way as you man. I knew he was sick
He brought a lot of happiness to me and others with his films. This hurts.
Pretty crazy when I found out, we had the same birthday, Rest his soul 🙏🏼
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 It’s not fair! Everybody please give a Wakanda salute to everyone you see! Wakanda Forever!
Just to know he’s with the legend himself...Stan lee...R.I.P the kings
WAKANDA FOREVER❤️💔  CAN 2020 SERIOUSLY, SERIOUSLY GET ANY WORSE
May he rest in peace.
I’m beyond upset when I heard the news😌😢😢😢😢😢
He didn't know he was sick
2020 is insane. 😔
Nooooo.😭 R.I.P. Chadwick Boseman.😭
Rest in Peace, sir. I really hope they don't recast the role in Black Panther.  I think it would more honor his memory if they didn't, but at the same time I know the character means a lot to so many people.  If they continue with Black Panther I hope they find a dignified way to pass the mantle to a new character instead of a new T'Challa. I hope Marvel comes out with a big tribute for him.
✌...
I said the exact same thing.  When I said it every was telling me he was preparing for a role.
What’s crazy is that MLB celebrated Jackie Robinson Day today.
Rest In Peace, Chadwick Boseman 😢😢😢😭😢
The man was going through surgeries and chemotherapy BETWEEN filming. What a god damn fighter and Legend. And he did that for us dude. Thank you Boseman.
I can't believe this 😥 R.I.P. Chadwick Boseman WAKANDA Forever ✊🏾
This was too sudden man.... And he looked fine and happy too! God bless to Mr Boseman...
I still can't believe it.
He was the real Black Panther! Rest in peace Chadwick Boseman.
The king is with Stan Lee and Jack Kirby and with God as well
2020 for September 😭
This is really sad. Rest In Peace Chadwick
Rest in peace Mr.Chadwick Boseman.Why God is taking so good people I am an Indian and this year 3 legendary people passed away and now Chadwick Boseman .Thank you for all the memories
No way
He was a inspirational man. A idol in the African American community for sure. I really hope they don't try and do a Black Panther 2 it would insult his legacy
Can't believe this, 2020 really is unbearable 😔
2020 taking all the good ones......
Nooo
It’s fucked up that some dc fans are saying there happy he’s gone just stop it’s not time for marvel vs dc
I cannot believe this is happening. I feel absolutely broken. Rest in peace Boseman. You will forever be remembered.
And so the King reunites with his ancestors on the immortal planes. My his journey home be peaceful. My we mourn with his family but shed not not a tear. For it is not good bye but the beginning of the next journey. A journey where the reunion will be joyous.
42 not 43 nov 29 1977 do the math.
Sad no one saw this coming
I just watched Black Panther couple days ago 😭😭😭 R.I.P  WAKANDA 4EVER
The man was a king, in both marvel, and real life. Rest In Peace, Wakanda Forever.
It kills me to hear how much pain is in your voice. It took my breath away hearing he passed away. He seemed like an amazing man and my god his talent was undeniable. No one else could’ve worn the mantle of the panther how he did.
*Wakanda Forever*
May the good man be at rest............
May his soul rest in peace
Wakanda Forever!
I wish he did not have this he had more movies ahead of him
This hit me out of left field.  I had NO idea he was even sick.  Too young.  Rest in eternal peace.

Many iconic characters and people he played
One word...heartbroken!!!
I'm really underweight myself, and even I could tell that he wasn't ok. But it was completely in the back of my mind until this announcement.
I was just searching for Flash Movie news, then I found out about Chadwick. Really changed my mood, man.

He is an absolute legend.  Irreplaceable.
F
Of course it would have to be the black superhero that is taken too soon in 2020. Just the year we are having. Tragic stuff, I respect his legendary strength though to keep working through all of it and to keep it hidden. At least we have his career legacy to look back on but untold sympathies to his family.
There goes another legend 🤦🏿‍♂️...
WAKANDA FOREVER 😣🙏🖤💜🕊
Damn kobe Bryant gone, now black panther ! 😥
He"s with his maker now

no one can replace Chadwick boseman as black panther
Rest In Peace my wakanda Warrior
Please tell me it's not true please😢
Don’t worry he’s with Stan lee now and Gabe will protect him up there❤️
I had no idea. I remember he looked thin earlier in the year but I had no idea. Damn
I still have goosebumps over it 😳
Honestly Tyrone, I tried to be just positive and not deal with the possibility that he was severely sick, however.....that wasn't the case.  Just a dark day for Chadwick fans and marvel fans.
YIBAMBE!!🥺✊🏿
I was having a semi good day  as good as it can get in 2020 anyways and then my brother came and told me this...I can't believe this
You saw it coming brother.

I agree about his health, im a survivor, after graduating boot camp in the Corps, i was diagnosed with Muscosa Carcinoma. Treated for 5 months at Balboa, I went from 185lbs, to 120lbs. I knew he was sick, when i saw that live stream...crazy, he truly was a great soul, a great talent.
Amen...
Rest In Peace to KING T’Challa, the Black Panther
i may not be wakandan but he was still my king
I remember him looking different in endgame😔💔
RIP, Wakanda Forever!!!

Just when this year couldn't any more worse

It was too soon
Wakanda Forever
WHO'S NEXT 2020!?
You were the first person I thought of after hearing the news. I remembered your reaction to the video that was circulating a few months ago and how you said you were very concerned, something to the effect of how you felt the same way about Charlie Murphy. Your intuition was right,, Tyrone. A shocking loss none the less. Rest in Power Chadwick Bozeman
May he Rest In Peace. He was a true king and superhero.
Love you Tyrone. Stay strong big bro. 💪🏾
Noo I can’t believe this nooo
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
I remember you said that
Black panther 2 better say "in loving memory of Chadwick Boseman" at the end.
