Instantly added this to my bucket list! Looks absolutely incredible!
The worlds longest zip line is also the zip line with the worst view.
Omg! Lmao!!!!!😂😂😂😂
Wow its really high! My you I parachute jump 13 years ago 😮
I would be petrified it would stop halfway
That's "oh my God" is in arithmetic progression 😂
Oh my God oh my Jesus 😂😂
Simon every second: omg
Who else is here thinking, please don't befriend the guy and ask multiple questions when he's fitting you with a safety vest/harness. "Anyways, see you later mate, have a good one" ARRRRRRRGHHHHHHHHHHHH splat.
I love you simon
Just watched this again, Oh My God!
9:19 Your Face 😂😂😂
Nice to see Simon as a religious man! :)
Long story short… Oh my god
Oh my god +19
Imagine getting stuck halfway with a failure
New sub---watched your current videos of Antarctica, Copenhagen, etc....and this one!  LOL This was GREAT!! Not sure i could do it!!
Simon at a loss for words 😂
Oh my god counter please
That is incredible 👀☺️☺️
Lollllhaha o my god lol
Hahahahahahhahahahahahahah
Just watching this im getting butterflies
Funniest video you made
Nope. No way. I would poop my pants.
“Mate” lmao!!!!
Drove to the top of Jebal Jais a while ago, still on my bucket list to do the zipline from the top
i think you would love costa rica, ive never been but watch documentaries
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It was 24 oh my gods and one oh my jesus
I couldn’t stop laughing!
There is nothing special about the landscape there to have a zipline in UAE, it's totally boring!! I highly recommend the south American and the south Asian ones!!
That was awesome!
OH NY GOD !!! LITRELLLLLY !!! ΗΑΗΑΗΑΗΑΗΑΗΑΗΑΗΑ
Props for doing something you were afraid to do! I think I would just love every minute of it. That feeling of flying, and that fast! I don’t know why I never did this! At 72, I think I still would ...
It’s so much better to see somebody’s face than some stupid animation. Much more interesting to see someone on screen interacting.
I finally found your collab vlog video with @Dale Philip 😍😍😊 he's always looking very handsome and kind.👌😎💯
Always wonder who can thumbs down a video like this. Got to be some sad people out there. I love it anyway. Thanks for making them.
Oliver said ok boss like pink guy
how many times did he say o my god
i live in dubai, i did the jebel jais zipline about 2 years ago! it was incredible
The wales one says longest zipline in the world too way better scenery tho, over beauitful sparkling blue water
From the front view looked like a green screen in the background auditioning for new superman role oh my Jesus 😅😅😂🤣😂
Didn't see any emiratis doing it...
Plot twist: Mr beast gave you $10k to do this
Where is this Zipline ?
Oh my God 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
nice
Hahaha
I must do this!!!!!!
How many gods…then a Jesus at the end 😆 go Simon
One of your best videos just by Your expression🤣 I would die lmao

Simon bricking it lmao
This was GREAT Simon! OH.. MY.. GOD..

I have always had a opposite fear of stuff like that I enjoy the adrenaline rush
could someone comment what he said on the zipline? was it "oh my god?" couldnt quite hear!
Y
Swear you voiceover the Google Chromebook adverts 😂
Hi Dale👍
Looks like fun 👍🦜
I laughed so much
Why don't you show Dale Philips ?
Fun Fact: This Zipline was located in Ras Al Khaimah
Good habits gentleman you sir  Siman Namaste
baby face @ second line :-)
About time you done something apart from scabbing free food. Well done.
THAT WAS COOL simon.
Colab with dale! Awesome stuff
Where was this?
Shot everytime he said omg 😂😂
Wow so amazing . Watching from India
Oh My Jesus!
Brilliant mate!!!!!!!!
I’m just saying this guy when’t to Nortg Korea and not to Costa Rica
Wow, can't believe you cut Dale Philps out of the video as much as you did, maybe if he had 2m+ subs like Harald and Bald has, Dale would have been worthy of being inlcuded?   Or maybe you are worried what Bald would say with you spending time with him, poor show Simon, no need to be a sheephead, you've gone down in my estimations....who am I, a nobody subscriber, just like the rest of your subs, you may want to pay attention.
Looks like my Aunt Mildred with that shower cap.
Simon! I'm a big follower from Cheshire and love your personality, but your editing style, please have longer shots of more than 2-3 seconds! the viewer feels a 'jerk' every time you edit like that sir. Let us relax into the place.
O MY GOD 😂😅😂😅 can't stop laughing
OMG counter : 58times 😂in 1m world record     Simon's in the Guinness word record"
Man I haven't laughed that good in awhile.
We are all belivers when in AWE!!!
Did know Simon had such a strong prayer life
Oh My God
Imagine simon got stuck half way I think I would piss a little
My hands got so clammy watching the whole of this video 😂
Leave God out of this 😄
tldr - 4min of "OH MYY GAWWD"
TaKe a  shot every time Simon says oh my god😂😂🥂
This was very funny to watch. I Loved it that you lived this out.
😱OH MY GOD‼️ You use “Oh my God” too much‼️
Your God didn’t hear you 🤣🤣🤣 must have been on his break.
I'm glad son of God got a mention
I don't know whats better... this zipwire or you "eating" street food with bald and baldr. You sir are a legend no matter what!
Gotta invite Dale next time with you harold and bald..
Awesome
Simon please upload a new video
Oh.    My.         God.
I want a tenner for every time I had to hear our Simon grunt: Oh my God. (And a fiver for: Oh, my Jesus.)
I’m still waiting for you to post a new video :(
Simon, tu amigo J... Es un matos😂
What happened to Simon?
Love your vids could you do homeless in london
We need a new vid
I don't think I would do that.
did you shit yourself Simon?
Don't think I ever want to hear the phrase "oh my God" ever again
Whens the ethiopia vids :(
I like British accent
The one time he pays the guy is like LOOK AT THIS BRACELET must have been like thank fuck I never sneaked in
I seen this zipline video together in Dale's channel before and I am wondering why didn't he introduced the man with two strong legs before in this video instead he was shown in last part of the video.😆
Sat binging Simon and it just felt wrong until I ordered a sausage and egg mcmuffin 😂
simon are u guys ok in ethiopia
Good stepping stone for you Simon next Bungie jump?

If i get 1 Penny for every oh my ... I would be a millionair
What's going on with Simon's channel??? I mean, I haven't seen a new video on sooo long. Which is kind of strange, considering I just saw a new clip of a new Bald and Bankrupt video in... Sorry... Was it Ethiopia? Anyway, my point is... Where's the new videos my brother??? Hands down, Simon makes THE best content
hey there hope your doing great  id love to see more muckdonalds tours below the equator
I'm sure he lives in Manchester, Pussy
DEFINITION OF CRINGE
Zip lines are extremely unsatisfying and boring..... 👎
Top 10 oh my god
You are just too cute. I love your accent & watching your videos. The only thing I didn’t like about this video was the end when douchey Dale showed up. Your such a considerate, and polite guy. He’s the total OPPOSITE!!!, lol.🤣. I am dying for your next adventure & I hope you can come visit me on Cape Cod someday. You will def have a place to stay & I think you would love it here!. 💋
Please tell me ur now in Ethiopia with the balds? I’ve been waiting for this since Mexico
I am  missing your video
SO any more Vids or have u retired ? Need more Mc Donald freebies
Are you ok ?. You despaired
Boris Johnson should NEVER do this

On the song "Local Scammer" simon is in the beginning and he doesn't know LOL
By the way me and you have the same name so that's cool
Why you give up on YouTube? The point is to make a living doing this not do it till you make a certain amount of money then fall off the face of the earth 🤷🏼‍♂️
Gets onto zip line: suddenly the only words I can say are oh my god😲
When is the next video?
Bro, be good to see a new video from you. I know your channel is mostly based around travel which is restricted right now, but the truth told we would all like to see you again. Change the content on a temporary basis...your subscribers will be understanding.

Hey Simon  Huge fan from Melbourne Australia , Ive got a question I recently subscribed to surfshark thanks to you, would you be able to give me some details because I've also downloaded shopback, do U know if shopback would work while surfshark is connected ? Or do I have to disconnect while using coupon discount apps. Btw next time your in Melbourne Australia be sure togive me a buzz, I'm a 35yo male born in Melbourne. I've lived a rough life and can defiantly show you the dark sides of Melbourne without having to worry being robbed if your with me. I can take you through Richmond , Footscray , tell U bit about Russel st in the 90's I lived through all the gangland war and can tell really mad war stories lol. Anyways stay safe Simon

Simon i miss ya buddy im from the USA and hope to see another video soon
I'm afraid of heights and I went skydiving once. The plane ride up was more nerve racking than when we jumped out. It was amazing the fears just wasn't there, it's hard to explain definitely a bucket list type of deal. I would do it again! I've done the zip line in old Vegas same thing it was the elevator ride up that got my nerves but as soon as I was strapped in the fears was gone, and I didn't make it all the way to the platform so I was just hanging about 30 feet from the platform and a worker had to make his way to me clip on and pull me in.
Hi Simon, are you stepping back from your channel?  I adore your videos but noticed you have only put out 2 this year! So, does that mean you’ll only be doing about 8 per year or less? I found you through Bald and Harald.
He looks so afraid hahahha
Amazing i want to do
Oh my god!
Man....or should I say little girl
800k!!!!!! Finally 1 Mill 🔜 Covid lockdown has us binge watching all ur vids!

Nice ps5 in the background Simon

I did the zip line in Wales and it was soo good. This looks even better
You're getting fatter Gothmog, I guess meat is back in the menu, am I right?
This is so bingeable
When you can, the lower 48 in 48 days would be absolutely epic
We miss the “Honey,honey” good all days when Simon did videos by himself and Also the Free eating and sleeping✌️✌️😀
I really enjoyed watching this. Greetings from Marbella.
god bless
👌
I wish you can visit the Philippines, highly recommended
“Oh my god!” “OH MY JESUS”
Dale Phillip gotta love his content  Simon you Literally said Oh my God so many times.....
Hey simon,  are you interested in rat race india challenge?
9:25 simon shitting his pants 😂😂😂

Would've been quite a sight if Simon's body smashed into the side of the mountain.  It'd be a ketchup moment.
There is nothing funnier than seeing Simon absolutely brick himself. I'm absolutely howling hahahaha
Hi Simon Why not do Manchester or wrexham mate that would be great keep safe
You can come to Bosnia, we live normal here in middle of Europe, everything is open, until 23 tbh, but still hotels, restaurants, gyms, coffee shops, all is open whole time and you can hang out like in normal times... and yes...no money challenge is easy because we all live without it :D
Hey Simon. If you wanna come and see the beautiful state of Oregon, USA I can direct you to some awesome places.
I am so excited to download the Stereo app to catch your next live conversation.  Enjoy your travels.  (from Oklahoma, USA)
How many subscribers he has is how many times he OH MY GOD
Where is the OMG counter?🤪
How is Sweden treating you?
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 U look constipated on the last part
I do this for a living
I love how in the lobby, Simon says he's from Manchester. Once he gets out on the launchpad he says he's from Wales👧 when facing death, we all go back to our roots.
6:48 - That ‘AHHHHH’ sent me over the edge. Couldn’t stop laughing
I would of left little brown parcels all over the valley if i did that
OMG OMG OMG
Oh my god!
Wheres the next trip simone?
Has anyone noticed since Mexico simon moans alot
Name of this video should be "oh my God"
Plug dales channel?
Guy pushes Simon off-platform without harness attached. Simon falling to his death "what a lovely guy"  😂😂😂
That was brilliant
Oh the crossover with Dale.
Imagine if we all got a free beer every time he said “oh my god”.
great video man! you was flying for a while man..
Just finished binging NYC to LA. Do you have a charity that you are raising money for now? I see that fundraiser is closed.   Thanks for the epic journey👊👊👊
I thought he was gonna puke...what a baby.
The guy with Simon is a youtuber called Dale Phillip.
Where is Harald mate?  Disappeared from YouTube.
Great vid
Great video Simon! I was thinking when all of this blows away you could visit Luxembourg. It's a very beatiful country with many landscapes.
Just unsubscribed from this channel. After seeing how he acted towards the Mexican culture in Balder and Bald’s videos gave me second hand embarrassment. Stick to sneaking into hotels and eating Big Macs u Big Mac
Bald and Bankrupt collab please!
Oh my god 🤣
OH MY GOD.  LOL
Você é corajoso. Rsrsrsrs😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲✔️🇧🇷🌍🙏😆
I thought I heard dales voice nice collab man
Viva la Wales!!!!

Ah Simon you big fanny. That looked immense.
Why on earth did you do that? You crazy Welsh legend
"Simon I got Red Bull on line 2, they want to make a special." "oh my God."
Came over here from Harald Baldr's channel. Simon's such a laugh! Subbed and ready to binge!
New drinking game, we drink every time Simon say "oh my god" good luck
I'm surprised he didn't say "Oh My God" 🤦‍♂️
Bro you deserve 10 million subs
MENTAL!
You are my biggest inspiration sir. I hope you to meet you back in kolkata and do a challenge with me it will be amazing!
Been subbed from the start! love your videos mate!
Drinking game: Have a drink everytime Simon says "oh my God"....... knackered.....
At 5:42 I swear someone says oh no the lines not attached
New drinking game, down a shot every time Simon says 'oh my god'
the amount of oh my gods just started to turn into a beat
oh my god count pls
I felt your fear bro LOL
I don't know how you don't have millions of subscribers. I just got done  watching your US trip in one whole day.  If you're ever in Phoenix, Az. I drive rideshare and you've got a ride from me anytime on the house.
Oh My God!.mp4
Bro the longest zip line is in Puerto Rico....
The longest zip line is in North wales I thought?!
This guy remembered God all the way until the calamity ended.
Nearly had a heart attack watching that your crazy man great video tho
You need to do Costa Rica....Indigo Trabler just did CR.....I want to see your prospective.

Brave man I'd had shite myself

Howling, absolutely howling 🤣🤣 "oh my god" hilarious!
OH MY GOD HAHAHAHA YOU'RE KILLING ME SIMON
I've done it too! Number 10,428 back in July 2018. I'm from Neath originally but lived in the UAE for 7 years. Can still remember the scream of the wires and the whiplash at the bottom - looks like they've softened that now though ;-) Good on you!
One of the most Underrated Youtubers
omg
9:17 pure fear 😂😂😂😂
Take a shot every time he says “Oh my God”
Alot of blaspheming
You experience how Superman fly!!! 🙏
fix your damn face mask... faaaak!
Masks are useless and are only signage of the New World Order.
Simon, you should do the fastest zip line in the world which is in Penhryn Quarry (Wales). I've done it last year, I was bricking it a lot but the views and everything..it is just breathtaking experience  .
Can i get pinned simon please seems you aint got one 👍
You’ve got to re consider the design of that mask mate
i cant wait for some no money challenges or anothr rat race
Superman theme going through my head.
I swear zip world in bethesda was
Bro bro bro PLZ listen to the man and go to Costa Rica - most beautiful nature in the world
Every time he says OMG take a shot
You been to come  north wales mate that is much faster more like 120mph!!
How many omg you said in the video 😂
First time I saw Simon scared for doing something 🤣🤣
I think I have on loop
Oh my god
Simon should have added "OH MY GOD" to the title 😂
Buy a better mask and keep it over your nose 👃
Simon I hated you with the mexican trip and your comments but you won be back. It's so hard not to like you with the new videos and the good old ones. The ice hotel and this one maybe it was hanging out with those 2 mean racist guys. Stay away from them to be yourself a nice mate ☺
Ong, I want to go next! And I would to. If only I could afford w! That was so cool! I'm 57 ,and I would kill to do it!!
OH MY GOD..  Oh my God... laughing...hell no.. ok maybe.
Guess what .......    "Oh my God "

Thanks for this vlog Simon it was hilarious!

Even after finishing the zipline ride he still continue saying oh my god oh my god😝🙃🤪
Now you have to get Bald doing it🤣
Of course 'The Welshman' beat 'The Scotsman' : Momentum = MASS x Velocity. [ Did you not pay attention in your 'A-Level Physics', Simon? ]
Wow so scared looks realy and šį funny simon reactions how many times his said oh my god 🤣
How would you rate that? Oh my god Seriously though that takes balls so well done
When someone asks you where you’re from and you’re Welsh. You should always say WALES not the UK come on mannnnnnn
Think more people from uk in Dubai At moment than in uk I wonder why😁
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. You now qualify as a American using your complete vocabulary.
Oh my... *names every word in the dictionary*
If I where you don't think about skydiving while going of the zipline. Just saying because you don't have a parachute
My missus says whos that saying "oh my god" constantly Its just Simon flying through the UAE sky dressed as a pokemon!
Me: I swear if he says omg one more time! Simon: oh my... Jesus
Simon on zipwire......OHHHH MY GOOOOOOOD
I have been on it too.  Was an incredible experience!
Oh my god
Nope not me.
Mate I thought at the finish when trying to stand you had literally shat your pants 😀
Simon: 'OMG' Me: Can I punch him in the face?
Omg at 1:55 I thought Simon went to give him a fist bump, and the dude just left him hanging.  Then I saw the scanner and I was like :P *idiot* 😂
The camera setup for that was bang on. Nicely done.
Oh my god! Haha 😄
This should be called the “oh my god challenge”
Seems so fun!
Do you think the millionaire behind this new app will make the app successful by throwing money at various Youtubers, I think the app is shite and its clear to see how much cash he is throwing at it.
Oh my god the comments 🤣🤣
that looks so fun lol typical british behavior scared of anything outside the comfort zone
👍
OHH MYY GODD
covid everywhere.
Amazing  .....Seriously thinking of doing it
You was shook Simon 🤣 how many omgs 🤣
OH MY GOD

Take a shot every time he says  “OMG” ...you’ll get LITTT I swear .🤣
How do you feel about this Simon? right
Did you say OMG, yes about a fucking zillion times! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
When are you gonna give away your PS5 to me? :O
What part of National Lockdown do YouTubers not understand?
He said oh my god like over a million times
Oh my god, oh my god 😂 😂
Repent from your sins. We do not know the day we will die. If you die today would you go to Heaven or Hell?  Repent before it is too late. Jesus Christ is coming soon.✝️🙏❤️✝️
Wow simon , that was super scary
Loving your hair
Looks like fun.
Oh my God 😂
Is it just me that is getting scared by just watching

I noticed at 6:18 you can see his Monopoly guy tattoo has a monocle. His tattoo wasn't effected by the Mandela effect of no more monocle! Lol
Off to Wales with you lad, to do a shorter one but still an "Oh My God!" ZipLine ;-)
New drinking game everytime he says oh my god u have shot

I went to the 2nd longest zip line in the world in Wales and it was SURREAL!!!
How much was it?
Let me hold your man card for a moment.
I went on the longest in Europe, Croatia. It’s so sick
Won't eat a prawn in Mexico but will do this...😅

Oh my dog? What's wrong with his dog?
Hahaha we have a winner in the "Oh my God" competition 🙈😂
Yes excellent.  You and Dale, two great youtubers.   I have watched loads of videos from You Simon Wilson, Dale Philip, Harold Baldr, and Bald Bankrupt.  Great stuff..
Somehow Simon managed to make the worlds biggest zip line look boring 😂
Mate you need to start doing no money challenges again. We're starving for them 😂
Feel like it's going to be a new meme 7:00 🤣🤣🤣
I'm very surprised you haven't done the one in Wales as that is great fun.
That is some significant potential energy being converted to kinetic energy right there mate
Haha oh my god!! That looked cool
That "Oh My God" sounds so sarcastic with that face lol
Fucking wimp, all my GOD!!!!!!!!
Oh my God 😆😆
Simon: Ziplines down a mountain **religion intensifies**
Yet another "influencer" travelling during a pandemic.
I wanted to see the view not your face
It's so weird watching someone doing something fun without smiling once during the whole ride.
A Costa Rican, eh? As we ticos say, there is a Costa Rican in every corner of the world...
This is how we should all travel, they should set up public lines above cities!
I CANNOT STOP LAUGHING AT THE BEGNINNING OF THE ZIPLINE HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Love the content!! Keep it up my guy ❤️
He's on the way to jeresulam...to meet oh my god Jesus an Mary 😂
8.20 realising you have a heavy warm mess aboard ....9.20 squelching down with a straight face ....
We could have used a few HOLLY COWS in there Simon! I'm NEW started with NY to LA w no $
OH MY GOD!!!!!
Oh my god...... oh my.... Jesus

FairPlay Simon, fantastic mate
Oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my JESUS

OH MY GOD!!!! I swear!
Flying scotsman lol 😆 still came last haha
Favourite YouTuber absolutely love the vids keep them up 👍
My download limit is 25 omg's per min...System crashed " 7:48 into vid....

Why are you even there? Just because your a YouTuber doesn’t put you above the rules while the rest of us are stuck in lockdown.. and not even wearing your mask correctly, your so selfish.
A fresh pair of underpants for Simon please.
Oh my god Oh my god  Oh my god  Oh my god  Oh my god  Oh my god   Haha this is one of your best videos ever mate.    I am English and I relate to you so much. I am similar age and I love traveling but obviously cannot as much as you. I admire your confidence which is unreal how you talk to random people and go crazy places.  I admire you mate.  Love your videos

Every video ‘oh my god...’ on repeat. Does Simon enjoy anything except junk food???
My heart is racing rn

O my god O my god O man god O my Jesus o my god lol 😂 you where sh¿¿ING bricks Simon 😂
Oh my God, there are no atheists on that zip line.

You looked so calm on the zip line 😂😂😂
Great video but this is in Ras al Khaimah completely different emirate to Dubai.

Love your content
Oh. My god counter 1000000000000
This isn't in Dubai, it's in another Emirate, Ras al Khaimah.  There are 7 Emirates in total. I know most people haven't heard of it but to say it's in Dubai is like saying Mt Snowdon is in England. It's not.
Insane ! I enjoyed watching this !!! :)
Oh yes I didnt realise until the end that dale was with you :D and I thought the longest zipline was in Wales haha
Oh my god
Oh Simon’s God
Would you do it again tho?
Bravo
Nothing beats that moment of pure tranquility when your brain can't think of anything
You not hit zipworld in UK? Definitely need to hit it close to home they have 3 sits definitely worth a visit
A few too many “Oh my gods”
Omg omg omg......
not enough "Oh My God"s
longest zip line and the most number of Oh my God or Jesus (27) in a single video.
For a moment he became an airplane making a landing
You didn't have a second go ?

(... a few more OMGs later) Simon: OMG God: That's it, you call me 1 more time, I'm going to snap that $**t so we can have a proper talk. (Simon arrives safely) God: oh brilliant! It's over! Simon: Omg God: ... ... you wait for that next time...

I've never laughed so much at "oh my god" before. I can still hear it now 😂😂😂
Longest zipline in the world.... But still won't eat Mexican street food.
I went on the zip line park in Costa Rica, Monteverde and it was absolutely bonkers!!! You need to hit up CR, Simon!
This would be Even more spicy if bald and Harald is there along with you in this adventure😂😂❤️
Hey Simon:  Superman much?  Glad to see you back.
This guy is more like Rita Wilson
I've never try zipline in my life. That was so scary to watch and goodluck to u mate coz u did it. Keepsafe. Cheers 🍻
🇨🇷🇨🇷🇨🇷
when hes on the zipline he looks like he has no arms or legs
Nice
Simon: "Where are you from?" "The UK" Simon: "Wow, that's crazy. I've never been to the UK"
Cool video but the title doesn’t make sense
Simon, I live your videos but, please mate, pull up your mask!!!!
Oh my god counter please
Oh my god...I'm literally watching this at 3:30 am.. 🥱
Jesus. Shut up. Why did you even post this. Omg omg omg omg omg omg omg and 30 more times. Annoying as hell
hahahaha elite content
You will do this but not eat some Mexican food? You represented your people real swell
6:52 When she says it’s her first time and she’s tight, but you actually just fall right in and realize you’re the hundredth victim added to the vaginal abyss.
How much McDonald’s and burger kings’s have you ate on this trip? My unhealthy Simon.
Think you lost a good bit of subscribers/viewers after the Mexico trip. 😂. Oh my god I’m a baby Simon
surreal
Omg
Simon “your nana’s got a lovely kettle” Wilson.
HONEY HONEY HONEY fuckin missed that my man. Glad you're back.
Respect Simon, you zip down a line at shit yourself speed & height, meanwhile Mr Bald is walking around a village in Estonia
Zip line dude: “Simon how was the ride?” Simon: “Oh my god”
Legendary
Simon turned religious really quick 🤣🤣
Green screen
Oh my god... oh my god... oh my god. 💀
Lets get this man to a milli already 🔥🙌🏻
God called. He said to stop calling him.
Some of those people on Stereo had very strong accents, so it was harder to understand than if the questions were written.
So what it is the longest zipline of dubai or the world? Besides that you are amazing
Simon keep the content coming let’s gooooo
17 + 6 "OhMyGod's" Lol.
Holy smokes.
WOWWW
Double the speed every time Simon says Oh My God
Everyone on lockdown...Simon not
Oh my god count 23  Oh my jesus count 1
Hey you didn’t even mention Dale, he’s a cool vlogger just like yourself, it seems like you tried not to film him.
Man like Dale 👌
Love From Bangladesh
I visited that beautiful place - didn't manage to go on the zip line though.. Looked mad
Simon no offence mate but you need to man up
7:06 👁️👄👁️
Simon great vlog. Can't wait like everyone for this Covid to RAM IT. You Mr Bald and Harald . Will be free again.That zipline looks Mental.
That looked uncomfortable, thanks for doing it, now I dont have to 😃👍
omg omg omg omg omg omg omg 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wish you included more of dale philip in the video, it would be great for you guys to do more videos together great youtubers
Gotta be honest "oh my god" wouldn't have been my choice of words. If i had of been doin it it might have sounded like "beep, beeping beep, holy beep, ima gonna die a few more beeps, then some more just for good measure"  It didn't look too bad at the start a bit high yes looked longer than it was higher, but fuckin hell that is some height in the middle and by then its too late. Loved how it just slows down and you just coast in to the end like it was fine and dandy 🤣🤣
oh my god
Is that first time ever you’ve sworn in a video 🤣?
New drinking game : take a shot every time Simon says “OH MY GOD”😂
Thank you Simon, I threw my laptop out the window and now using my phone to type this out....
Oh My God 😂
this is how many times he said Oh mY Gawd 👇
Do not drink for every time Simon says Oh My Gawd!
dale philip..he is suck
Did he say oh my god!? I don’t think I heard😂😂
Mate love your content and ignore this if recorded during non-lockdown but why the fuck are you travelling at the moment? Again, think your videos are excellent but this just seems like selfish rule-breaking to me. No one cares about a zip wire if it entails potentially killing people.
OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY JESUS hahahahahahah
New drinking game = take a shot everytime Simon says "Oh my God!"
You've got bottle Mr Wilson.
OHHH MYYY GODDD 😂😂😂
how many time have you said (OMG) ?
2 uploads in 2 days??
OH MY GOD = 23 OH MY JESUS = 1  JESUS CHRIST = 2
Hahahaha
That “Oh my Jesus” caught me off guard 😂😂
You were quiet on that zip line Simon. If I did it I’d be repeatedly saying OH MY GOD.
Funniest vid i've seen haha
This is not in Dubai... it's in Ras Al Khaimah
His face when they first let him go, i laughed my head off 🤣
You need a English translator for the Scottish bloke.
Amazing experience...Thanks for sharing 💓
Why has the great Dale Phillip been edited out of most of it and not even a mention or link to his channel? A disgrace
Back-to-back videos from Simon, today’s a good day 🤌🏼
Seen this on dales channel about a month ago whats taking you so long
Simon's hair net...new merch.
I’ve seen this on dale philip
Looked like superman.
that looks so fun!
They need to collab more
Can't believe him and dale together
Simon: "I am sooooo glad this is ooover."  Guy: "There is one more zipline" " OH MY GOD "
O Are you ok G O D  o my Jesus
Hooray for two uploads in two days. Three cheers for Simon Wilson. Most underrated YouTube channel ever!!!
Yes another new video
I guess the zip line is not a “lovely guy” *Simon voice* 😂😂
How many times did Simon say...OH MY GOD!! .. I lost count.
Brilliant, so funny, OMG, ha ha 😂👏👏
Hah mint. King kongs balls
Simons mask is so bad 😂
That didn’t feel like 2 mins? This video didn’t even feel like 2 minutes lel
This is how many times he said ‘oh my god’ 👇
2 videos in 2 days! Am I in heaven?
Lol simon putting in same criteria as a sky dive .Fair play kidda xTHINK YOU FOUND GOD X
Worst thing to do is overthink it and panic mate 😂
People travelling during a pandemic ? Not very wise.
thank you Simon...i've just run out at premium videos at youtube! then you cam around....
Think it was an oh my god moment 🤣 looked brilliant well done
Oh my.....Sorry my internet cut out what did he say after Oh my?
OMG x 18 OMJ x 2 and a good spraying of brown smoke trail.... legend.
Take a vodka shot every time he says "Oh my god" have fun guys XD
I love zip lining wish I did that when I went to Dubai last year
"I don't know if I enjoyed that or not". I think we know the answer to that Simon!
oh... My.... Jesus
Is it me or did the first zip line seem really slow?
from 1 to 10 rate the zipline ride  Simon : OH MY GOD
YouTube getting real comfortable with these 15 second un skippable ads
is that a gopro hero 7 black?
Petition for Simon to go skydiving
3 days ago I said please release some content....  You released content 3 hours after.  Hahahahhaha
Great video and content Simon but the merch face covering you have is shocking! It doesn’t even fit you right 🤣
OH MY GOD
Cool video Simon
Omg....lol...
That was soooooo funny
When he said OH MY GOD thought my phone had broken and it was on a loop
Someone make his face into a meme.
So stuck in a record loop 😂😂😂 omg omg omg 😂😂😂
This is making my hands sweat watching this
Yet another youtuber in dubai..
There's a good one in North Wales
If you listen carefully you may just notice he says ‘oh my god’ once
*The man is back!*
Simon the hole video, O MY GOD 💀😂😭
Didn't like look of that 😕 not sure by your face you enjoyed it !
This should have been titled, "Oh my God!".
Great video yet again Simon
Hi bro

Oh my god.
We need an "OH MY GOD" counter
Take a shot every time Simon says “oh my god”
Another Great Video Brother

Wish I'd known about this when I went to UAE, a reason to go back it looked mint!
Oh my god stop saying that
Brilliant video yet again Simon, been watching for almost 2 years now and never get bored, keep it going when lockdown is over mate :)
Can we all appreciate the effort Simon puts into these videos, honestly incredible. Loving the content Simon! Keep it up mate! 🙌
A napkin stuck to your face would be more effective than your mask.
Yet another video lol
You are mega annoying as a ‘traveller’ so much wasted opportunity
Oh my god
Omg omj 😂 good stuff
At least show us your the view during the zip line not your face the whole time
Before 8 k likes—————-
Omg, the man has a vast vocabulary
Loved it mate
I love ziplining! If you go to Costa Rica, you have to zipline down the Arenal volcano, it's incredible!
ohh my god ohh my jesus haha.....grow a pair and do a freefall skydive
That was hilarious, the looks of fear realising what he just signed up to was so funny.
keep theam comeing  si
How much did this cost
NEVER CHANGE THE HONEY INTRO

Happy days another video to watch 😁
Worst skin fade i ever seen,,, what fade? Lol
OH MY GOD 🤣
man I miss those times where you went to ljubljana and stuff, simpler times.
Why the hairnets also what happens at the end? Do you get a free ride back or do you just get left in the middle of nowhere
Atleast we got “ oh my Jesus” looked good fun bro! Keep safe Simon
Watching Travelling videos is making me depressed especially with the Lockdown in the UK.
Loving the more uploads man! Still unsure about the new camera tho bro! So shaky Can’t wait for the world to be normal to get more Simon Wilson videos you’ve got such a class style man
Mate you looked more scared for the second one that the first lmao
Did someone omg I didn’t hear
did you use to live with the Armstrong family, in two mile ash ???
Zip lining is the most boring thing ever. I would rather take a shit in my hand and start clapping
On a hole new episode of i should never have gone ziplining 😂
Simon,  Es Hora De Una Nueva Canción Temática... Gracias,
Oh my gott counter broke after 10th time 😂😂😂
I enjoyed transfer from god to jesus lol
Mate firstly do not jump out of a plane ive done it its shi t. This was cool but they seemed to be more concerned about how long it is vs making it exciting or interesting. In that they could have zipped you through a more interesting course. Luv u and yr content as always though.
Olivers an absolute hero
Omg?
Oh! my God!!!!
STOP SAYING.. OH MY GOD !!!!!!!!!
Simon goes on zipline Simon: reapets oh my god 1000 times

Looks exciting
At least you advertised God and Jesus Christ.

He's right, you have to visit Costa Rica. I know for a fact you'll have a blast in the rainforest  And you're quite the mad lad for doing this crazy zipline
Was this filmed before lockdown?
