New to the fandom here...why are they saying it's season 1? Isn't it season 15?
0:10 See, this would've looked really good in the title sequence...
I can’t wait for this show again let’s goooo.
Why's it called 'season 1' when this is season 39 overall?
"vorldvide premiehr!"
We need more LGBT+ stories and characters in series, movies, animation and games! 🏳️‍🌈❤️
No not season 1 series 14 it's a British show not American
Where is todays trailer!?!
I know people younger then me have short attention spans but Jesus Christ that’s the shortest trailer I’ve ever watched in my life honestly disappointed feels rushed
God please let Ncuti be a phenomenal actor in this 😭.
May 11????? Come on! It’s 11 May! We are not Americans!!!
The UK drop should've been the same day as Disney+ (Friday 10th May 2024) at 12am evening time? Simple and easy!!
I want to see K-9 in an Afro.
Four and eleven are my favorites, but Ncuti might give them some competition.
That music is so spooky, I love it!
Ncutie does it again, he's stolen my heart. Don't you wink at me you handsome devil 😏
0:10 is that the new vortex
The 15th Doctors first season is honestly the most I’ve ever been excited for the show. His energy and charisma are going to take the entire story to a new level.
L doctor
Well, that was pointless lol
Stopped watching Doctor Who years ago just before Capaldi's regeneration, but honestly thinking of coming back to it this season.
Daleks? Cybermans? Where?
The fall of Doctor Who is complete.
wheres David tenant
you suck
So hyped
such woke crap - thank you for not making classic science fiction any more - now i don't have to waste my time or money on this garbage - leftists destroy EVERYTHING
Someone please reply I am excited about this new season but it is labeled in the title “season 1” aren’t we in season 14 RTD back at the helm outstanding never should have Left would like to see some SM episodes also Thank You Doctor
Why is it season 1? Are they making another soft reboot?
I saw the change over episode. It could have been leaps and bounds better.
Hooray!! I'm so ready!
11th of may damn🥲
OBSESSED with Kate Stewart's "here it comes"
Technically its not New Who it's New New Who or New New New Who
Dead show
Why is this being called season 1?
Go woke go broke 😂
Davies best decision ever was to use the hell out of Kate, she is one of the greatest elements of the 2005 reboot and her being carried on into the 2023 reboot is simply fantastic
Is it only on Disney plus?
TRASH! Let the next doctor be obese!! The soul of the series is dead....
The first time I heard Sia was through a song called Chandelier.  For the first time in a while, she was shocked as if she had been struck by lightning.  At first, I only knew the song, but after watching the MV, I was even more shocked by the dancer's unique dance moves.  thank you everyone.  Thank you for delivering such a wonderful song and MV to Japan.  Please take care of yourself.
Glad we're getting more Kate in it
For Latam, will be in Disney+?
Did you show all the good bits in that 10 second trailer?
'Been here from the start' 🙄
Wonder if this is gonna be a two parter or just two episodes.
Unfortunately, it will be released at midnight on iPlayer.
I can't wait to never watch this trash! Wokeness killed Dr. Who.
😍😍😍
Pls fix the broadcast time. Isnt this a British show? There is a massive timeslot that fits both American and British audiences
Omg, the sheer amount of cope coming from salty Brits who feel entitled to pandering from this show and are upset that they aren't getting it a whole day earlier than everyone else is literally palpable. 😂 I have a feeling I'm gonna love this era, so many wrongs are being righted.
Oh
Looks likes low level cr ap. It is completely not DR Who we love ...
I AM SO HYPED, CAN´T WAIT!!
🙌🙌🎉🎉
I'm so fudging excited!! Praying for it be a great season 🤞
The multiverse is coming and the daleks will be the main threat to doctor who and other shows.
Teal and Orange.  What fun...
This is gonna be fantastic!! 🤩
Season 1?
What is the 15th doing with so much clothing on? Ncuti more less please!❤❤ I'll watch even if does wear more.
Timelords have 12 regenerations, anything after the 13th Doctor is poorly written fan fiction.
I'm 71 years old been watching Doctor who forever the last doctor and the New one coming up I'm done watching Doctor who
What's with the season 1? this is season 14
I don't like his new look his big hair and suit doesn't work. Like his hair in the under pant episode better
Very suprised by the mostly positive comments, considering we only make up 3% of the UK's population too. I really thought it would be run for cover comments lol.
He's gay now
May  11  check  thanks bbc  director's  again.  Via BBC  I PLAYER  & Disney plus  rules.  Aka   early  episodes  as usual     & all episodes  too.  Thanks  bbc director's  or  appreciated it's..
I'll see if Disney+ is still working then.
no thanks.
There's more outro than video.
I'd like to try on Ruby's 60's outfit. It'd be interesting to see how I'd look in it.
Dah fak is dat even. Come on now. At least let me finish
Why black
No need to pay my licence fee anymore. The one show I am happy to pay for is now being produced for the us timezones so I won't bother.
Just hoping there's no more disney pop songs about a goblin king, I covered my face like the weeping angels of old during that scene.
What I love about his 60's/70's outfit is that this is what he might have looked like if he was the 2nd-4th Doctor.
Season 1 1963 to Season 26 1989  Then series 1 2005 to series 13 2021 a few specials now SEASON 1 2024 lol
The day before my birthday. What a wonderful birthday present 😄
May 11 WAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYY??? That’s a long time away
Still calling it season 1 huh ?
啊啊啊啊啊我的快乐回来了！！！
So he can change cloths now but I love the fresh air and direction this show is heading. Its beautiful
hopefully weeping angels 🤔
I allready like this new doctor
Showing jinkx monsoon on the day of Eurovision final is a genius play🤸
I got excited  for it
Full trailer soon….!
"Season 1", still can't get my head around that. Yay for Kate Stewart. Also, great for the date annoucement, thank you
SERIES 14 (not Season 1) HERE WE COME
I was really hoping for Tennent to come back ,what the heck
Who else just LOVES doctor who???! 👇💗💗
This is stupid!!!!!!!!! Midnight in the uk? Multiple episodes on iPlayer at once?
Why are they referring to it as season 1?
SERIES one. We're British.  We have autumn, not fall. Solicitors, not lawyers. Trousers, not pants. And series, not seasons. Breaks my hearts, and by the way count those ❤❤
I like the fourth wall break! I hope that Ncuti's Doctor will talk to the viewers in the same way that Capaldi's did!
I’ll give it a go but it doesn’t look anything like Doctor Who to me. This guy is just too cool. The Doctor should be a lovable, nerdy, quirky, eccentric. This guy isn’t giving off that vibe for me.
It's on Disney+
I’m hoping for a Day of the Doctor style crossover between Ncuti Gwata and previous Doctors.
WOW.NOW.
Not for me. Oh well
you mean season 14
I like the outfits he be wearing. 😎👏🏼👏🏼👍🏼
I’m soooooo excited. He will be my fav I can tell
Can’t wait to watch on Disney plus on may 10th
OMG so very very excited - he's going to be perfection
The day after my bday?? Best present ever
Let's goooooooooooooooo
Season 1? What?      What?      What!?
❤❤❤❤❤cole watching
That’s my birthday
rip doctor who
Oh hey, looks like it's gonna premiere on my youngest brother's birthday. Neat.
LOVING the vibes
Why is it saying season 1? Is it another reboot?
Season what is it 14 15 more like! Good luck with viewer count, I won't be watching whatever you call this 🙄
I was just thinking of re-watching DW when this notification came cross my screen ❤❤
Season 14*
服装めっちゃ変わるね
Daleks?
Let's go!
So excited for series 14!
Damn, late for my birthday!
Season 14
Like many recent UK TV shows, the BBC is going for a digital-first strategy for new episodes of Doctor Who, where they will drop new episodes on iPlayer first at midnight, followed by a BBC One broadcast on the same day in the evening. Its midnight release is simultaneous with its global release in 133 countries on Disney+, which holds the international rights to the show outside of the United Kingdom and Ireland (On RTE Player).  BBC One is the only TV channel in the world that's airing Doctor Who traditionally.
Yay so looking forward to the new DW season!
Or the day before, depending where you are. Time is an illusion. Midnight doubly-so...
This is embarrassingly cringe when watched straight after the new Classic Season 15 trailer, highlighting all that is wrong with Doctor Who today. Certainly gives new meaning to the word "trailertrash".
0:20 such a lovely looking logo animaton of the shows name slowly appearing.......so why isn't it used in the ACTUAL opening credits!!?? 😆
I CANT WAITTTT
Kate’s back
❤
Lets hope they don't start singing and dancing because I'll be hitting the off button
Mean beasties. Just 10 seconds???!! May the fleas of a thousand camels infest your armpits😂😂😂 Jane in New Zealand 🇬🇧🇳🇿
Meh!
Im already loving Ncuti as The Doctor since the special
So is coming on TV on the 11th or is that when it's going on iplayer?
Yeah... season one.
Want to see classic villains
i hope its not more woke drizzle realy writers need do better
Season 1? Isn’t this more like Season 40?
AHHH I LOVE HIM ALREADY IM SO EXCITED TO SEE MORE OF HIS WARDROBE
Has the wink From Ncuti been GIF'd yet? This going to be great!!
So how does he get an Afro? Is he gonna put a wig on?
James Bond and Dr Who. Both better with a Scottish accent.
May 11th let's goooooooo I hope we get the season premiere on cinemas worldwide, pls BBC, do it
I'm just here to say I'm not going along with this "season 1" nonsense. It's 14, period.
And starting the countdown at 57 days
I love how this will premier 1 week before I graduate from High School!
how much we wanna bet that 0:09 was a blooper and won't actually be in the show cause i'll cry if its not in the episodes
Ugh worst trailer yet , the show is noe just a streaming show now and America top priority ....I'm all for it adapting to the times but oh my days
Is that it?
Fans waiting for a doctor who announcement: Give me a number, Give me a year   Doctor Who: May 11, 2024
YAAAASSSSS QUEEN 💙💙➕🌈
Zueira
Wowwww I CAN’T WAITTT
Lets Go Bois
It’ll have a simulcast premiere (along with the rest of the world) at 12am for us UK peeps. After that it’ll be shown as normal on BBC One so everyone can watch  :)
5 FIVE MONTHS for the Next Doctor Who Episode and all I see is a teaser? The new episode is May? I am a paying subscriber of Disney and wait impatiently. Come on Already!
I just wish you didn't have to buy a subscription to Disney+ to watch it though- I have no interest in paying that kind of money just to watch Doctor Who, so this is the first season of Doctor Who since the 1970's that I will not be able to watch when it comes out 😢
Dr who should have ended when Jodie Whittaker left they have spoiled it now .
Shiiiiiiieeeeeet.
Leave it to the British to ruin something. I can’t believe what they picked for the next doctor. I’ll never watch it again.
At least it's back on Saturdays where it belongs.
Did he just break the 4th wall The Doctor winked at us
This was so long trailer. What they were thinking!?
I have faith in RTD for this new series, and even if the scripts wont hold up I think Ncuti will absolutely carry as the doctor. Love his performance so much, and I hope Jodie gets to return under RTD in the future- she deserved better scripts <3
It series 14. Stop being stupid. It's already confusing enough that it reset in 2005
TWO MORE MONTHS Y'ALL, WE CAN DO THIS
two episodes airing at midnight? the death of TV really is here and the BBC is digging their own grave
BRING IT NCUTIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!!!!!!!!!!!
How many times can a show have a first season?
Why call it Season One when it's like Season 14?
I wish those graphics were also used in the title sequence
Can’t wait 🔥🔥
Oh yeah!
*prays* "please don't suck, please don't suck"
NCUTI WINK SUPREMACY
So are we getting 2 episodes on BBC1 on the 11th May or will episode 1 air on 11th May and then episode 2 air 18th May?
❤
Hopefully we get more singing this season. It’s been a long time since we had a singing doctor.
i think i should watch doctor who when bleach comes out
Hint of a new title sequence??
Sooooo….we’re really doing this,huh? 😶
Honestly the epic looking cinematography is getting me kinda hyped for this series. I think Ncuti does a great job as the Doctor and I can’t wait to see what this mad man does with his box >:]
on my birthday squeeeeeeee
At that traditional family-friendly viewing time, midnight.
So glad Kate's back, I love her
Just please no more "Doctor singing Broadway tunes". I hate that this is my line in the sand.  But it's just so out of character.  Black Doctor, Woman Doctor, no problem. Broadway Doctor? NO!
I'm still calling it series 14
Why is this season 1???
❤❤❤
Ncuti's Doctor is weird but I'll accept it.
Four days before my birthday!
*screaming*
May 11th is the day after my birthday hell yeah
Como que "season 1"? Season 14! Si eso 🙄
THATS A DAY AFTER MY 8IRTHDAY IM SO WINNING
Looking forward to spending 48 hours off the internet to avoid spoilers for episode 2
I came only to dislike 👎🏿  this franchise is dead and they're descrating it's dead corpse.
I am SO EXCITED for this season
it looks fantastic…but lbr it’s season 15. Don’t try and fool us. (Plus you’re wasting the opportunity for 15’s first season to be season 15.)
Doctor Who fans are always eating good. I can't wait! We saw 14 have a good ending, so we'll see what 15 haves in store for us.
For those who haven’t checked out the release schedule. It releases in the UK at 12am GMT on iPlayer and Disney+ then is on tv BBC one in the evening. Everyone in the world gets it on Disney+ at the same time, but for those in the UK it’s midnight
First 2 episodes arriving May.
Why is it releasing at midnight in the UK... It's a BBC show, they should base the release date off of UK time.
For a show based around time travel. I always feel like I'm stuck in time waiting for a new season 😢
His first episode with the goblins was pretty terrible, but I’ll not judge the show from a single Christmas special. I will remain optimistic.
10 seconds THE AUDACITY
So excited for this. A two episode premiere that coincides with my birthday! My ego is at peak capacity
Will it be on Disney + on May 11th in the USA?
OH MY GOD. Don't wink at me like that. 🥺❤️❤️
LETS GO THE SECOND EPISODE COMES OUT ON MY BDAY
Series 14 is looking good.
When the outro is longer than the teaser💀
Am prould to say i have cosplayed the blue suit and afro 😁
Our favorite agent is back with Stewart yeah
Who ever made this 10 seconds will answer Cthullu
Can't wait to see more of ncuti gatwa in action
BBC   who?   All  episodes  via  BBC's I player's  or  DISNEY'S plus  too..  please  or appreciated  it's..
May  11th  check...
Is it weird that he looks like 10 with an afro?
Always takes me a while to get used to a new doctor. Can't wait to get to know this doctor better.
Oh, was that it? Wasn't worth putting my headphones on for that LOL.
I think,,,, this could be the best Dr who in ages ,,,,,, fingers crossed.
yes cant wait
Waiting for may 11
So may 11th doctor who is nack
Can we get Steven Moffat back please?
I don’t know if I will watch it again   I don’t like new doctor who
MAY 11th!!!
May 11th is perfect timing as I’m just about to finish my Doctor Who watch through (1st Doctor to present)
😮😮😮😮🫶🏼
Its gross that it drops on iplayer before bbc 1
May 11th sounds good to me.
0:01 this fit is amazing!
10 seconds that kills me 😢
I'm unnaturally excited.  It's uncomfortable.  Need booze. How am I supposed to last until May?
Are you kidding me?? Doctor Who and Eurovision ON THE SAME NIGHT?!!!! This will be the gayest gay christmas ever!!! 😁😁😁
Let’s gooooooo🎉🎉🎉🎉
YES!
Cool. A show I won't watch
A real shame it's only 8 episodes though. Huge drop from RTD1's 13.
Doc Peacocken Who is a bit of a pimp too.
SINKS MY HANDS INTO MY BED AND BEGAN GNAWING AT MY ENCLOSURE BARS..
❤❤🙏🙏😇😇 RESPECT BBC
I'm so excited for series 14
Midnight airing? Doctor Who just made a bad decision!
It's not 'May 11' it's the 11th of May.  It's not a season it's a series.  A family show shouldn't debut at midnight.  Calling it season 1 will confuse people with series 1 from 2005.   Stop trying to americanise it
Midnight in the UK? What are you trying to do to your UK audience?
So hyped on Disney Plus!
where is this gonna be avaliable? I live in germany and I Usually build my library in amazon. the doctor who season on amazon are already horribly organised. this being a reboot is gonna add more confusion.
😂😂😂 that's all you got 😂😂😂
In there attempt to sync the release of the season America gets it at7 pm Friday may 10th and the uk gets it at midnight officially marking it Saturday may 11th essentially hurting the only viewing figures we can look at since Disney+ isn’t required to make viewing figures know to the general public only to the writing staffs so the haters will have more fuel to claim the show is dead or dying due to this change
"It's gonna be a moment" -- almost sounded like "The Moment". Which sounds rather ominous...
Can't wait to see them in May I'm looking forward to the new adventures of the 15th Doctor and his new companion
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!1
Black Doctor
In disney plus will be May 10
Just come out already so I can have watched it and be waiting for S15 already, come on. May is so far away, this is the worst part of new Who, I'm antsy to see how he differs from 11, 12, and 13, I wanna see what new craziness Russel's got for us, waiting sucks...
Something big but confusing is come we have had Mrs flood break the fourth wall now we just had the doctor break the fourth wall
What’s the idea behind calling it season 1. Does this happen everytime a new show runner takes over until they forget about it 😂 Moffat tried this too
Er no thank you
AHHHHHHHHH I CAN'T WAIT!!!!
LETS GOOOOOOO!!!!! SEASON 1!!! A BRAND NEW ERA OF DOCTOR WHO!! NEWNUWHO!!!
Id love a new title sequence for Ncuti with this neon style, perhaps with the diamond shape implemented into the shape of the vortex
Season 1? I thought the last season was 13?
Did they intentionally pick the 43rd anniversary of Cats debut in the West End as this years premiere date??
Not happy or exited gang                                    👇
ANOTHER 4th wall break? What's going on!!
This has just got me even more hyped then I already was
it airs on my birthday!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm not liking how your putting episodes on bbc iplayer before putting  them on bbc one 😢 going to hate seeing spoilers
They picked a great person for the role, I love his acting and style and the energy he has.  But I've always enjoyed each Doctor having their iconic look in clothing (made them special), and this changing as needed while interesting feels .. wrong.  We'll see how the stories go as well.  If they focus on good stories and an adventure that can engross the viewer then it can work.  But overall I think the writers these days are too focused on messaging.  Skip the messaging and such things and it will work out way better than before.
Damn Kate's getting old ;-;
I typically prefer middle aged Doctors, but this one looks hella fun.
What a day it shall be. That wink at the end.
Regenerations 1-12 = "here we go again"  🫡🥹🥺😭💀💔😥🫣🧐😲🙂😏☺️🤗❤ Regenerations 13-15 = "here we go again" 🙄
I was just telling my brother that we were going to get a new teaser any day now!😂
Is it in 2024
Почему они опять рушат 4 стену.... Там в конце доктор узнает, что он просто сериал походу.
I can't wait ! It will be amazing !
I'm so excited!!
OMGGG
oh, this looks good. Can't wait!
Zero hype.  Give it back to the ABC.  Release physical media outside the UK.  And have it air at a decent time.  Streaming is evil!
give me a number, give me a (autotune) yeEAAR
He's not a full Doctor, just half a Doctor because of the split regeneration.
AAAAAA
OMG
We need a proper trailer 😂
I can’t wait!
Make trailer longer
SO EXCITED!!!
Wait... is the intro and logo getting an update again already!?
Fantastic. Give me a number give me a year. Then comes May 11. My daughter's birthday.
Go woke go broke
So the same day as Eurovision? Interesting...
Stopped watching Dr. Who after a subscription for money was required. Before it went woke, I would have gladly paid for it and I bought merchandise. Not anymore.
Ncuti Gatwa does seem to be in the spirit of the Completely Barmy Doctor. Good.
YAY 11th
SO SO EXCITED
I CANNOT WAIT FOR DOCTOR WHOOOOOOOOOOOO ❤
Oooh
Looking forward to the reboot💙  I wonder how past events like the death particle on Gallifrey destroying all organic life, And the flux destroying many galaxies, will be addressed. Hopefully they won’t just be ignored.  Universe is a lot smaller now😢
0:10 Why is this not the new title sequence for the show?! Missed opportunity right there.
Всего блин 10 секунд,уроды чёртовы,так не честно,из 30 секунд только ,а заставку с логотипом эту яркую я уже видела на Ютубе заранее показали уже,не дай бог именно такую в серии сделают,пуская лучше та предыдущая будет как в спец выпусках
When the DOCTOR FINALLY GOT SEXY ON US
Ah lads the day of the Eurovision Grand Final 😢
The Doctor: "Don't forget to click below to subscribe to the official Doctor Who channel"  Me: HE SAID THE THING
So looking forward to the start. I saved the date in my calendar. 🥰🥳
Wokism destroys everything by design.
why isnt this gonna be on Max like the rest? i dont want to give disney my money after what they did to star wars and marvel.
I'm so excited!!!!! 💙💙
💙💙💙
Kate Stewart is racking up the Doctors. 11,12,13,14,15, will she be around for 16/17 🤔
I am soooo excited to see more of Ncuti Gatwa, he brought back the 4th Doctor vibes to the the revival
Ncuti’s energy is next level
This looks so good! Ncuti and Millie work so well together, I've got a feeling they'll make us laugh and cry, May can't come quick enough!
That logo and vortex are gorgeous. Absolutely gushing 70s/Pertwee vibes.
Can't wait!!!!
Exciting!! ☺
As long as the rumours of Moffat coming back isn’t true then this should be a good season.
That wink! :D I am ready!
I love twinkle in his eye. A sign of a good Doctor.
Timey Wimey to be confirmed... 😂
At least we have a date now. May 11th. 🟦 This is where the fun begins!
I’M JUST KEN BABY!
This is two days after I finish my final exams so I’ll have something to look forward to!!!
It’s Series 14! Season 1 was back in 1963
Bro just casually breaks the 4th wall
Who is going to be the main big bad of the series I am trying to guess but idk
I feel this series is gonna DEFINE a new generation. We always know that one off specials give us a glimpse it A SERIES is where u flesh out everything. We always see Russell cook n serve so this is gonna have sumn SPECIAL BRO 🔥🔥🔥
let's goooo
I like the suit, but it is a bit joker
Something Epic is coming
Well I can certainly say he's got the style of the Doctor
I’m still disappointed that only Ncuti defended Millie when her name was getting dragged through the press a few weeks ago.
Marking the calendar.
Finally!!!!!!!!!
Season 1? So is this another reboot?
I can not wait for this, I haven’t been this excited about doctor who for a while apart from the 60th obviously 💙💙💙💙
👀
Dr Who is dead dies years ago.  So sad to see
Seriously?! Not fair man, that's when I've scheduled a cub scout camp... Ugh ! 😩 😂
Would love to see Gatwa go up against the 80s Cybermen but only if they bring back David Banks himself to voice the Cyberleader 😮😵‍💫🤯💥 Mind blown
Can't wait for May  allons y Give me more XV
Season 1?
Thank you  😭😭
Disney+, seriously?!
> British show > Uses American date format
Nice, 9 days away from my birthday, May 20th.
All these 4th wall breaks are definitely leading to something. Some villain is messing around with the fabric of reality or something
expecting great things from this doctor, looks like itll be interesting!
Welcome Kate Steward!!
Love what they did with the logo here, I really hope this season will be good 🙏
cool but now it's gonna be even more of a mess to clarify whether you're talking about old seasons, series, or new seasons lmao
did he just break the 4th wall???
Looking forward to see Ncuti as the Doctor in his first proper full season, not to long away, now that we have a release date 🙏🏻
Wait your premiering it the week before a lot of major sporting events on Saturdays for the next few weeks, which have a habit of overlapping other programs and when a lot of people will be in pubs watching them..... Smart thinking BBC!
“ give me a number give me a year “
2 days after my birthday ALLON SY
meh
Also rose is in the background  but judging by the looks of it and its in unit i say its the finale as it is a two parter
Is it weekly episodes or all in 1 shot?
May 11th meaning finale will air june 29
It's so annoying that they use this colorful vortex in all the promo but not the opening of the show
I thini its gonna be the finale
Whats kate saying tho about here it comes
F I N A L M E N T E !  ❤❤+🟦
YES!!! Can't wait.
Sweet
Yes I’m very Excited.
There will be a two episode premiere on iPlayer at midnight on the 11th before airing on BBC One that evening
So excited for this new era, seeing Ncuti Gatwa in the role of a lifetime (or 15 lifetimes)...
LETS GOOOOOOO
Missed my birthday by almost a week
Eurovision night? I AM IN FOR A TREAT ON MAY 11TH
Does the Doctor know our universe is watching him because of the Flux?❤❤
wow @doctorfaztrap predicted it
let's goooooooo! can't wait to see more new doctor who
Looks like a new title sequence
Question: will we see new episodes also on Disney plus?
Season One, lol. Ridiculous!
Youpi
What do they mean by season 1?  Is this part of their Whoniverse schtick?
May 11th. Like the doctor that a returning actor will play.
Nice! Can't wait!
Season 1? So we’re doing another reboot?
Honestly, I just watched the Barbie movie and I've seen Sex Education. Both featuring Ncuti Gatwa, and I am honestly excited to see what energy he brings to the character that we all know and love.
May 11th happens to be my birthday, so least I got something to look forward to on 11th May unless I got something planned that day
Doubling down on the Forth Wall breaks... Hmmm. We'll have to see how that goes, it rather it was just left to Deadpool and Deadpool only. But I'm still excited for this new series.
Please tell we’re getting a longer trailer tonight at the Red Nose Day telethon
Same evening as Eurovision, that’s a bold decision.
So excited bring it on
Yay ots coming out on my 24th birthday 🎉🎂. Yay 🙌🏻
NCUTI AND MILLIE ARE SERVING HARD!!!
0:10 New Title Sequence Confirmed!
!!!!!! The music !!! And the frickin vortex and logo !
WHO is this guy? WHO?    I just can't wait for the next season.
FINALLY!!! But why are they calling it season 1?
That's my Birthday!!! What a gift 😊❤
I’m still gonna call it Series 14 (or the 40th season overall)!
Is it weird that I like it when the doctor breaks the 4th wall? I also enjoyed it when Peter Capaldi's doctor did it as well, and we got entire speeches from him (and the occasional guitar solo)
Yes I'm waiting for this one
I loved when he said "I'm doctor who" and doctor who'd all over the place
His suit and afro are absolutely fire
Oh gosh, I've never been this early on a video.  I have always wanted to say that in a comment on a video.
😪😪😪😪😴😴😴😴
Yay!
NEW TITLE SEQUENCE?!!??!
nah this boutta hittttttttttttttttttt
Series 14*
I'M READY
YEEEEEEEESSSSS!!!
Why is it season 1?
I enjoyed Ncuti as the doctor in the couple of episodes we've seen him in so I'm absolutely down for this season. Hopefully it's better than the Jodie Whittaker series which, through no fault of hers, suffered some questionable writing choices
Series 14 premieres on the same day as the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final? 🤩
Nine weeks to go
Put him in fortnite for the laughs
WHAAAAAAAAAAAT OHH MY GOD
It's  nearly time not long now
10 seconds....???? you'll be hearing from my lawyer
Hypeee hypee hypeee
Isn't it now going to air on Disney+ instead of BBC America?
Less gooo!
Less than 2 months away! Lets goooo (:
