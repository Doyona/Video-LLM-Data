Make sure to leave your questions for our Post Mortem episode down below!
I LOVE RYAN AND SHANE, BEST DUO EVER! Also, who's team Ryan?
It's 4 years late but we sure with all the "Stop me" "Help Mes" and "I'm miserable" and the theory the killer is haunting it that the killer himself wasn't possessed or suffering from really, really violent DID and is asking people to oh I don't know...  STOP HIM?!
"Ghost" on spirit box: Switch. Ryan: *hands over to Shane.* Shane: *Speaks.* "Ghost": *Realises that the man on the other end is the demon king Shane, who wrested control of the Goatman's bridge from him, and gets stage fright.*
Iowa !!!!
9:29 😂😂😂😂
I prefer your disrespectful approach to communicating with the unseen.
9 gng
I don’t believe in ghost, but I do believe humans can be the most evil monsters. I can’t imagine this happening to children, and the fact that he was never caught.
I believe the people in charge of that town had something to do it that’s why it’s unsolved despite the sheriff  destroying evidence by letting the whole town in the house and playing with axes for all we know the sheriff did it!!
I don't believe the "spirit box" in any form or fashion.  I call fake on it.
Greetings from Brazil.
god, everything about this is horrific but ina and lena specifically really get me. they just happened to spend the night with a friend. horrible.
Just like the hentirkaifeck
1:27 that mask in the background gets me every time 😂😂
Jesus died on the cross for your sin so you can be forgiven just believe in him and repent
wankers
17:10 “I’ll go in there.” 🤣🤣 Shane cracks me up with the littlest comments.
Ok I don’t get it because of a racist comment you decide to go on shooting rampage that doesn’t make any sense
Those small quarter pointy eye looking windows look like the Amityville windows
Essa casa deve ter um proprietário. Como ele foi deixar entrar esses dois canalhas, fazendo no seu interior esse papel ridiculo. Dar gargalhadas-fazendo  papel de malucos etc----tudo canalhada pelo dinheiro-nem o sofrimento das pessoas essa canalhada respeita.
In school, I did a massive research paper on this event. One thing that wasnt mentioned was the possibility of the killer using the loud sound of a train passing by to cover up the noise of him going through the house and hitting them, cuz let's face it, its gotta be noisy. There was, might still be, a train track right by the house.
Watching you on the watcher glad i found you two on more videos ❤❤❤ YAY . SHAne doesnt even look at all different
The moment someone pulls out a ghost box is the moment I stop watching. It's like nobody actually tries to do EVP recordings anymore.  Those ghost boxes are total BS. You can make out anything with a bunch of random syllables coming together
11:49 going to go out on a limb and say the town Marshall did it or was protecting the person who did
@UnboxTruth-y3j 0 seconds ago I think it was most likely someone who done this sorta crime or close to it to just eat right after and put things around . It could of been a house guest who spent the night before because someone while they were in church smoke cigarettes in the attic and how was the house closed back up if the keys were still in owners pockets
Honestly I feel that the killer was probably a family member gone mad, lots of people get religious delusions and the fact that they went to church beforehand just feeds into that, plus the sheet over the mirror means there was likely some shame involved which only proves more that it was likely someone who had gone mad. Also only the family knew that the 2 little girls would be there that night. who ever it was probably killed themsevles in their bed or hit themselves hard enough to slowly bleed to death so that they could dispose of the axe. And the bacon was probably left to attract flies to help the bodies decompose quicker
7:53 i don't believe you dear 😂😂 sorry
Bacon is there producer tag
Midwest Ghost Hunter was there in the investigation
Why would they be talking to the murderers with the spiritbox in that location when they died elsewhere? Or at least they think one was caught and hung. They never had enough evidence to be 100 percent sure the men who did it.
Amazing video
9:28 (Shane angery scream)
I  feel like the murderer did not want to kill and as if something supernatural was forcing it to do maybe that's why at some point he said twice stop me
I live 25 minutes from there
The issue with the flashlight that Shane wanted to articulate is that there are too many variables for it to mean anything. The flashlight is intentionally set to be stuck between on/off. Making it randomly turn on/off apropos of nothing. It’s entirely coincidence of it going off/on when you say something.
It Was Frank Frendnio Jones Did Killed The Moore Family In Villsca Iowa He Was A The Santior Of Iowa He Was Really Jealous Of His Friend Joshia Moore
11:15😂
Was there 6 years ago and will never forget it
Comment never to be seen again but... I wonder if places like this are actually schmurd*er/smuici*es. That type of thing wasn't exactly a popular commentary in earlier generations. In fact, I could hardly find any references to them in any publications. What if some of these mass death events never had a killer at all?
I adore how Shane—well, he acquired a stache and his jeans are higher—and Ryan's entire body and style have evolved over this series.
I feel like talking and acting like that in a place where 8 horrific murders happened is extremely disrespectful. If you want to visit somewhere that supposedly has ghost activity because of something horrible that happened, you should consider being respectful to these unrestful spirits. That is where people died. Don’t act like idiots, and be respectful. There is no reason to make light of a terrible happening, even if it was in the past.
That bacon wrapped in a towel was definitely some kind of r4pe device.
Why would the killers ghost be in the house?
IL is everything IA is but worse 😂
I have a few worst fears 1. Being completely alone in a large vast such as the ocean or space 2. Being killed and having my death be a mystery
How do you know the person who did it wws a man?
So the whole lore about the bacon rapped in the towel is really sad. So when the Ax murderer killed the little girl they found her pulled to the end of the bed with her nightgown lifted up and bruises on her upper thighs with a chair in front of her. Basically the bacon was used to “self pleasure” the murderer while he was doing these HORRIFIC crimes 😢
Can I just say this is unlikely but doesn’t it seem a lot like the axeman? Like attacked in their beds with their own axe nothing was taken or stolen and axe was left behind could have been the axeman going on a trip and was like one for the road
Shane's "hey" like he's sleeping or sum is so funny ryan would be freaking out 😂
the bacon kinda makes it feel like a sacrifice or ritual or something like that tbh
I hate people who taunt the spirits. We spent the night there, had one of the best experiences of my life. There was never fear or evil but had moments with the children in the boys room, parents and even Mary was in the attic.
For a price, you can have sleepovers in that house.
I wonder if it is for rent
I strongly believe that the Moore family was killed by a secret society.
very creepy  it is  a few hours away from my city everyone heard about the house.
Iowa is number one
I think the guy on the spirit box said "clit". Jesus!
Out of all the unsolved cases, this is the most upsetting. Maybe tied for Jon Benet, but I think this house being a museum puts it over the top
Hit like for the people After 1868
Spirit Box: "Bo chic"  Ryan: *Stop it?*  Some of you have never heard the Laurel/Yanny audio and it shows.
Ax is axe
why do you guys just restream the stuff that made you money why not think of something new DESPERATION must be high
i love their channel but their visits and ghost meetings are manipulated ghosts arent real
As a resident I can confirm the entire state is indeed haunted, ghosts, ghosts everywhere.
Im curious who was the person responsible for this heinous atrocity?
Does anyone else think that the bacon could have been in anticipation of a dog in the house? I’m not sure, but if this was a serial/random killing maybe the killer wanted to make sure that any animals were kept quiet and distracted. That being said it could also likely be a personal vendetta.
Theyve should have stayed this way
29:28  me having a panic attack:
My theory is maybe it was the dad that did the killing and killed himself last?
23:05 the captions on my phone say “that was fun”
According to the investigators in 1912, the slab of bacon and towel was used for masterbation before he killed the last two girls. Not exactly sure how they came to that. Must have been some evidence of ejaculation or something on it.
We really do live in a dark time.
He pleasured himself with the bacon
around 18:20 you can see a face on the floor
Diz is all wrong.. There's no joking when this is going on .. This isint the way to do things.. must take seriously These were REAL PPL! CHILDREN!!  & GROWN UPS. LIVES WERE TAKEN .PLEASE TAKE IT SERIOUS...     IM UTTA HERE JUST KAUZ OF THE JOKES!!
I'm sure I have seen this before, but after Red Letter Media just released their video on it, I had to come back to compare lol
Hey! Us Iowa folk are nice as hell. We're very very kind.
17:52 you can hear the bed bouncing
Clues given in this video as to figure out who the killer is:  - Only the father got the sharp end of the axe so most likely the father was the main target, meaning the killer knows his target. - Putting cloth over a mirror is a sign that the killer has some guilt probably for killing extra people or they don't want to be seen as a bad person. - Using cloth to cover victims faces is another sign of guilt but can also be a sign of personal relationship, so again the killer is more likely to know the family well.  Also, that axe mark could be studied to determine the height of the killer and knowing the clues, it narrows the list of known suspects down to 2.
Rest In Peace ✝️🕊️
I feel like they had to have been drugged for this to happen. For all of those kids, and their (presumably used to listening for kids to sneak out of bed) parents to sleep through it even if the killer made no noise beyond steps and ax thuds. Especially since all the kids were in one room, and the two girls who were guests were literally in the same bed. You're telling me someone being beaten to death with an ax doesn't shake the bed?
Iowa born and raised, Shane Illinois has the worst Applebees and the worst roads and also Chicago
32:35
“Hey ya sick little weirdo”
Just went a week ago
“Putty in my hands” putty wasn’t invented until the 1940s so how would the killer even know this word or reference?
The bacon was used for... sexy stuff, unfortunately. This guy was a sick puppy.
I have the same doubt as Shane though. Cause why would the killer be haunting someone else's home? Wouldnt he have died somewhere else?
11:00 this is really confusing me, the flash lights are turning on and off tho. We’re the boys doing that or was that just ghosts?
24:42
22:10 so cute
Tell Shane he can come out of the closet, we all know what team he's playing for. Was always so obvious!!!
What the hell is wrong with you people none of this is funny!
Here's a summary of this video: "The family was horribly murdered while they slept" "Eat flame broiled Burger King!" "This is Ryan and Shane with our spirit box." "Skyrizzi will solve all of your problems!" "This house is a terrifying portal to hell." Ect., ect., ect.  WHY SO MANY ADS??!!
I'm so vulnerable right now, oh my god! Mhhh, choke me, daddy??
7:25 "Bootie scream"
how dare you i am an Iowan and that's offensive 💢
9:27 LMFAO
Something about that house just makes me feel so nauseous and sick. I felt heavy just watching this even with Shane and Ryan being silly 😅
In fact I live in Iowa
I love the balance between this duo! Like ying & yang ☯️
Somebody stop me!
I guess I never mentioned it but I am going on the basis of Supernatural the TV show that spirits mirrors are covered so that the spirit doesn't get trapped within them. Maybe the murderer didn't want them to be trapped in the house. Who knows.
I dont understand how so many people could be killed one after the other in the same bedrooms and not one of them woke up? They were probably drugged? who knows
I do not fw this house whatsoever
Okay but how are they not freaking out about the flashlights
im binge watching BuzzFeed unsolved bc Steven Lim is fricking annoying
Respectfully they are not ghosts but demons, but they are real 💯
yall I don't think we are talking enough about the fact 100 MEMBERS OF THE TOWN VISITED WITH THE BODIES STILL INSIDE!!!?!?!?!? WHAT?! WHY?! HOW WAS THIS ALLOWED?! IM SO HAPPY I LIVE IN THE MODERN AGE WITH ACTUAL RULES AND MORALS (although there's tons of issues still, I'm glad 100 strange people won't see my body before the investigation maybe 🤷)
I wish somehow I could travel through time (not be seen by the people), and see these events with my own eyes and figure out the culprit. My curiosity is killing me
Gay ghost chasers. Interesting
14:48 this is one of the clearest EVPs ever caught
I got a heavy SOUL dread from this story and house dude. Whatever is in that house or was in that person who took their lives is NOT human 😭 my bad energy alarm was BLARING
19:33 it sounded like the ghost said “Batman”😭

Biggest missed opportunity ever is the boys and a ghost adventures crossover
Iowa mentioned
Is it just me but does the outside look like the amityville  house and the murders have the same similarities
i heard that that the kids downstairs only respond to people that are friendly, so when he was like yelling to turn off the flashlight is prolly why they didnt want to
OR he HATES PIGS...aka...People...
Why do I feel like the owners of the house have some technology or fake props hidden around the house & are in on the act.   I’ve seen other episodes where the tour guy gives the group an “energy intensifier” to raul up the killers ghost..  It’s extremely odd that it costs  $500 a NIGHT.
I haven’t watched you guys in forever and watching this video makes me mad because you guys aren’t explaining things as they actually happened and that one guy is pissing off the spirits hilarious
I live 15 minutes away from Villisca and our county police has not improved 👍
I live in Eastern Iowa, and have never been to Villisca, definitely on my bucket list! My mom is from a town only 70 miles north, whereas I’m 250 miles to the East, but ya know, East Iowa, Best Iowa!!!
Shane: “Uh, once again, my name is Shane, I’m looking for the killer. Hey! F*cko!” 😂
Just got back from visiting this place on a pit stop of a larger trip visiting family. I got to play the piano, it was pretty neat. Seeing the axe marks on the walls was definitely unsettling. It'll be interesting to see what these guys think of it.
Is it ax or axe? 🪓
What if the murderer drugged the residences in some way? Than he could have killed them without waking them up? Like if he knew they would be away, he druged some food and then waited in the attic?
Shane has so much plot armor that the spirits are scared of him
Bacon in a towel, like pigs in a blanket. Disrespectful fr
1:23 As a Nebraskan, I agree.
As an Iowan i now greatly fear Shane The Conqueror
Can't spell AXE. Bloody crap American spelling lol
I think this person was paul Miller
ryan was more angry than scared this episode
In support of Shane, even if the flashlights turning on and off are correlated to spiritual entities good or bad, that doesnt necessarily mean thats whats causing it, correlation doesnt mean causation.  P.s i believe in the paranormal wholeheartedly
Where is the buzzfeed unsolved mysteries like this, its used to be many, did they take down or?
anyone hear in 2024 is watching w a tear in their eye lmao
I want them to collab with Sam and Colby. That would be named COLLAB OF THE CENTURY !
23:24 8 members were killed
Hey... biblically, and still practiced by observant Jewish people today... mirrors are covered for 7 or 8 days after a death in the family. Older clothes or rent (torn) garments may also be worn. Someone with scriptural knowledge please help me add...I just had a big spine surgery and can't do much online time. Thanks!
If nasty ghosts don't exist, there must be demons.  Flashlights do not turn themselves off and on when they're just sitting there, by the way.
You should do this but on unsolved crimes
I love Shane's philosophical argument with the horses & unicorn lmao.
it was an old tradition/ritual to cover the mirrors in a house when someone had recently died, in some cases it was believed to keep the spirit from being trapped on earth, in ithers it was to prevent bad luck its a relativly wide ranging practice, but its what comes to mind
Shane and Morgan Wallen could be Doppelgängers
Why would the ghost of the **murderer** be in the house, Ryan?!?!
the guy tried to f*ck the bacon after he killed everyone
I'm not sure, but I think that the bacon could be a reference to an old rhyme about a thief:  "Taffy was a Welshman, Taffy was a thief; Taffy came to my house and stole a leg of beef; I went to Taffy's house, Taffy was in bed; I took the leg of meat and hit him on the head.  Taffy was a Welshman, Taffy was a thief; Taffy came to my house and stole a piece of beef; I went to Taffy's house, Taffy wasn't in; I jumped on his Sunday hat and poked it with a pin.  Taffy was a Welshman, Taffy was a sham; Taffy came to my house and stole a piece of lamb; I went to Taffy's house, Taffy was away, I stuffed his socks with sawdust and filled his shoes with clay.  Taffy was a Welshman, Taffy was a cheat, Taffy came to my house, and stole a piece of meat; I went to Taffy's house, Taffy was not there, I hung his coat and trousers to roast before a fire"
THE FACT IM GOING TO IOWA TOMORROW AND GONNA SLEEP OVERNIGHT
If it was 2 girls and 2lbs of bacon then it could have something to do with the saying taking a lb of flesh as revenge? Who knows though.
Seems staged to me
"like putty in his hands."  Silly putty was not created for another 30 years.
One of the most fucked up aspect of this entire case is that everyone in town decided to come in and take a look at the bludgeoned and rotting bodies of their neighbors that were just murdered and some seemed like they were having fun with it. The past was a total nightmare
After listening to several videos and paranormal shows about this location, it makes me to ask specific questions about the crime scene.  If Mr. Moore was the target of the killer, why the killer killed the rest of the family including the neighborhood girls?  How did the killer have access to the house before the family returned home from service?  And how nobody in the house didn’t hear any noises when the killer start killing?  I think that if anyone plans to do a paranormal/forensic investigation at that location, bring in a guest with good knowledge and experience of law enforcement to probably figure out what is in the mind of this killer and the killer’s identity.
Based On A Thriller Movie Is Called The Axe Mureders Of Villsca 2016
Need an anime of the ghoul boys and ghoul grumps solving stuff 😂
i feel like when shane dies he'll become a prank youtuber in the ghost world
it said they thought it said "Hard to Stop" but what i heard was "I was Drunk"
Experts do say that the reason the bacon was there was because it was used as a lubricant for the killer to intimately attack one of the little girls, likely after she died. So yeah. That fact is not awesome.
these guys are insufferable. Honestly prefer the over acted ghost hunter shows where they are so clearly making it up but act like they're soo scared. This is just two buys berating a 'ghost' calling names out and overall talking like they're just annoyed to be there. And their jokes are not funny. Wow. Glad this series was cancelled
Known about this for a very long time. Live not far from Villisca. Read a really good book called "The Man from the Train" during the pandemic. Really good book and recommend it. But the book suggests he might have been a serial killer who traveled by train.
I am related to the people that died there it is my great great great grandma was a about to have a sleep over and she got in trouble and she could not go so then if she would be able to go I would not be alive right.
I hope people realise that all these ghost things are are all staged
Taunting isn't going to make them talk. They are very disrespectful, in my opinion. They are just goofing off, like they don't take It seriously.
Shane :Ryan loves you big fan of your work .    Ryan : that’s not true *   Shane : yea he’s a sicko just like you    Ryan : that’s not true    7:50/34:30
Loved these videos
28:58 I think this part freaked me out the most. Even Shane felt that something about being inside the house was off. I'm certain it was someone who had a terrible grudge towards Josiah.
I want a mustache like Shane (I’m a teenage girl)
Im sorry but these guys  are terrible ! Who just goes in and provokes spirits that suffered and just want peace like that
After reading comments, I have a theory. It seems an odd coincidence that the murders happened the ONE night the two sisters slept over. Hear me out - maybe they were the real targets and the sleepover was a chance to kill them, and the others had to be done away with as a cover for their intended victims. Misdirection to the extreme!  The comment that sent me thinking in this direction was that one sister is the only one SA’d. That stands out as suspicious to me. If the killer had her in his sights, observing and following her, he would know she went to church and took that time to set up in the attic in preparation. I have no theory of his motive, just positing another theory to consider.   I’ve never heard of this horrible crime before but now I want to watch & read everything on it.
I wish the spirits are free, and the murder stuck in that house
I live in Iowa, and I can confirm pretty haunted
23:09 When they asked what year it was, I believe the murder said 8 because he meant June 8, because the murders occurred on June 9 and he stayed in the attic so he could’ve been there since June 8
I Love This Channel 🤪😍
I have a theory about this. Maybe the killer was actually possessed by a demon/evil spirit and the house is haunted by that spirit.
The covering  of the faces was a way for the killer to disassociate the victims as humans and/or to not see what the killer had done/an act of remorse, same with the mirrors. The killer most likely knew the victims in this case.
Cme on dude 30:15 tht ok when Shane was alone n flashlight went off it sounded like some lady
The mystery of how this was committed without any noise is kind of like Amityville
I wonder how’s the house so clean? No cob webs, no pests, no insects?
Me and Shane are great enemies.   -A person from Iowa
Dig up the Father's grave and test the DNA against the children or a living relative and you'll find it's NOT the Father at all but someone else the Father murdered to cover his sinister deeds.
For someone who doesn't believe in ghosts why are you scared of being alone??????
It seems like the horses knew something was wrong.
26:38 I found a shadow on the bed with Shane
The thing I always feel bad about in this kind of case is when friends of the kids get caught up in it. It was the same in the Keddie Cabin murders, that one of the kid's friends was in the cabin and got killed as well. Obviously, the whole thing is terrible, but especially if it's motivated (as the Keddie Cabin) by some sort of anger against the family in particular, I feel terrible for the kids that were killed just for being there.
Yes, I-state rivalry
It's similar to Hinterkaifek murders and Kaddy cabin murders
I’m not usually super bothered by a lot of these things but this one was just really sad. An entire large family just killed and from the spirit box it seems they’re certainly trapped there
If all ghosthunters acted like these two while doing their investigations, I'd actually watch their silly shows
ghosts gather around the campfire to tell stories about shane
Insufferably snarky hosts.
Did you put the doll on the chair back in the den?
As a Minnesotan, I respect Shane's disdain for Iowa.
You two idiots are beyond disrespectful and annoying.
Now I’m not a psychologist but there are some interesting points about this that stand out to me: The murderer seems to be of two minds The homicidal maniac- this is a person who just brutally murder EIGHT people and then sits down and has a meal before locking up and just walking away never to be caught. He is a sexual deviant ejaculating on the bacon, on the girls floor and stripping and posing one of the girls The guilty man- goes on the killing spree but seems horrified by what he’s done and decides to cover up his victims faces and their mirrors maybe so he doesn’t have to look at himself after he’s done this or for the superstitious reasons other people have responded with. This would also explain why the ghost of the killer is there still to this day. Also the amount of force the man used to bludgeon peoples heads in and to leave a dent in the wall is impressive, and I do believe it is a man based on how high the dent is, the depth of the dent and the method of killing
Probably one of the funniest episodes on this channel
based on what you documented in the video I think there were 2 people that broke in and killed them as a group, a woman and a man, since you here a woman and a man saying something that sounds like something a murderer would say like "it was fun".
That spirit box is laughable 😂😂
these guys crack me the heck up you have no idea how hard I laugh when I watch their videos hahaha their just awesome
i think it’s haunted by the killer itself because of the stop me and such
The town marshal or someone he knew did it.
Going at night is the smartest time to go. Next time invite a convicted criminal and drive him in a sharp implement supply truck to a remote location. Oh, and supply him with hallucinogenic drugs. That’s the safest.
These guys should not go there
If anyone "is their fear", it's Ryan. He is SOOO his fear.
Gotta remember back then even in Iowa people did play jazz and have places too drink at idk if a place like that was around by them but maybe outside sounds could factor why they didn’t hear the killer
Now I’m confused on how to spell Ax/Axe.
Omargoshtv did an alone in the dark series with 16 other people recently and this place was one of them, and the person was all alone.
Scary
as an iowan i can confirm iowa is indeed haunted in general
The killer was German migrant Paul Mueller, a train travelling serial mass murderer.
"He just has no fear which I used to see as courageous but now I think he's an insane person." 😂
Not sure if anyone noticed but they spelled “their” incorrectly on the fake newspaper article at around 4:25… it’s not “ther” it’s “their”.
I dont know what kind of flashlights you guys are using but my flashlights never randomly turn off. Must have been poor quality.
There is a book called the man from the train that hypothesizes that this is one of 100s of murders around the country. All the same MO. Very compelling.
I like how Shane was not witness to the bed moving. It makes Ryan look more like a fanatic
I wonder if it’s possible that everyone was sedated somehow. Like a sedative was spiked into their water or food. That way no one would wake up.
After this video was made these two guys moved to San Francisco to get married thee end 😮
Your spirit box is weak can't get good Evidences with cheap ghost tools 😮
I think the murder knew the family🤷‍♀️
That “what is it” is so clear😣
12:55 "ill get my pocket knife"
Wow, the axe mark so high up, how tall was the culprit... very impressive
It seems like it was someone they knew who felt he couldn’t control his actions.
completely insignificant, but I think that Lena and Ina were probably pronounced leena and eena - that way, their names rhyme (which makes sense, right? a lot of parents name their kids that way), and I have an aunt named Ina (eena)
I know I'm late to this, obviously, but the murders were in 1912, but at 21:00 , the quote from the investigators is that the ghost said the people "Were like putty in his hands." Putty was invented in 1948..... just sayin
Shane is from Illinois... I'm from Minnesota... he speaks truth about the Midwest rivalry... but Minnesota people hate Wisconsin more because screw Wisconsin
Hi! I think this was solved with the bk "The Man from the Train." There's a recap of it on YouTube, I think (2 parts?). This incident wasn't isolated (there were many, many more). The bk came out a few yrs ago. Have fun!  :-)
The murder was the Serial Killer known as the Man from the Train, a man that traveled around much of the USA hoping on and off trains killing people (usually entire families) for his own sick reasons.
He was in the attic talking to himself that (he's miserable) in the attic, and says to himself that the family of is (helpless) and says "(eight) people to kill". He killed all the children than the parents woke up, one of them said ("what is it") then they go back to sleep he kills the man and the woman wakes up says ("stop it") the killer says ("stop me") he swings the axe as the woman shouts ("help me") the killer says again ("stop me").He puts the slab of meat on the floor and covers the mirrors and faces as a ritual. BECAUSE HE WAS IN A CULT.  They heard: (what is it) (Stop it) (Stop me) (Help me) (stop me) again (Im miserable) (Helpless) And (eight) On the spirit box. They remain reliving that gruesome night.
Why do I keep watching these kinda videos
I wouldn’t doubt Shane is holding the ghost of the murderer captive in his home rn.
I'm aware of the popular theory that Shane is a demon sent to torment ryan, but moments like 9:25 make me think ryan was actually sent to torment shane 😂😂😂
me, sitting in Villisa, IA, right now...
Covering  the mirrors is a sign of NOT trapping the soul...we dont do that these days
I am from the South and a long time ago if someone died in the house you stop the clocks and cover the mirror so the soul dont get trapped in it. If there wasn't a way out, like if curtains was pulled or something, the souls would stay inside the house but couldn't enter the mirrors. Because they would be covered.
You guys should make a movie .Rock on
🏠I have never seen Shane get so angry about ghosts for once.👻
Please please cover West Virginias Mad Butcher next. My grandfathers Father gave Micheal Rogers rides to town for groceries, one evening never returning to the vehicle for his ride home. Days later they found what remained in plastic bags. I grew up hearing that story from my grandfather when he wanted us kids to stay out of the deep woods behind our home.
I don’t think the murderers ghost would be there fr
Ryan: "How many skulls have you claimed in this turf war?" Shane, starting straight into the camera: "Countless."
OR OR... THEY THOUGHT THE GIRLS WERE PIGS
Midwesterner turf wars are no joke. Majority of these states are suburban/ small townships but they don’t have nice words for their neighboring states. Illinois vs Iowa. Wisconsin vs Minnesota. Kansas vs Nebraska. The only states I’ve ever seen peace between was when Kansas and Nebraska teamed up to bully Oklahoma. Or how my WI husband and me (grew up in Chicago, IL suburbs)  had a bonding moment poking fun at Indiana ( I lived there for four years in my teens), so I’m not slinging hate for nothing.
Does it not seem like when they were in the children's room with the flashlight when the blue one was kinda flickering? Considering they were children, what if they were struggling turning it off.
Trust me, Iowa is haunted, we’ve had ghost issues. 1:19
Anyone else here cuz in a Sam and Colby video Colby said “we love those guys!” So here we are checking it out and yeah you know what they are pretty cool! 😊
the part where shane screams i feel his frustration
Cant believe every ghost theyve met has said “[unintelligible]” thats so convenient
to explain why the murderer is still there is that. This is his punishment for what he did. the anger of all the 8 victims will hold him on this earth with out allowing him to go to heaven or hell. there is a reason why we should let go of things that others have done to us. because the anger and aganoy will not just keep them here forever but you as well. anger is one of if not the most powerful emotions and energy a person can make.
ｉ ｌｏｖｅ ｔｈｉｓ ｍｙｓｔｅｒｙ.
Maybe the bacon was some kind of offering to some type of deity that the killer worshipped?
I was born in Missouri and now I live in Iowa. We all have beef with Illinois 😂 Iowa is haunting… just in general. Agreed
Another thing that happened in the room the Stillinger girls were in, was the oldest girl was pulled halfway down the bed with her bottom half exposed. And the wrapped bacon that was left in the room had seminal fluid on it. The killer had pleasured himself while looking at his child victims.  Theres a theory that he was hiding in the attic, because there was discarded cigarette buds by the rocking chair. And another that states the person who had done this worked for the church (I think the pastor). If that last part is the case, then he knew the victims personally.
"Right now I'm reaching out to whoever murdered in this house" hahahaha
As entertaining as these Buzzfeed Unsolved episodes are to watch, I find myself hoping that ghosts aren't real because I just find that an awful way to spend the afterlife. My hope is always that the victims are resting peacefully wherever they are now, because I couldn't imagined being trapped for eternity in the place where I was brutally and senselessly murdered. I hope this whole family and the two Stillinger girls are in a good place now.
Why would the murderer still be in the house? Most likely it's the family that was killed.
I must axe you a question. 😂
One of the suspects of the murders was a male relative who was suspected of inappropriate behavior with the children
24:42 BAHA SHANE
I sorta think the marshal did it bc why would he let the people mess with the ax unless he could be trying to cover up his own prints so he wouldnt get caught.
scariest thing in that house was the boobah in the closet
My theory is a bit bizzare, it might be so that the Axeman from new orleans might be the killer for this because it happend in the same year as the Original murders in new orleans. Also note the fact that the murders were done by an Axe.
Goat is the ax
It could have been the town marshal he let them contaminate to cover tracks
My theory is that the family was killed by someone they knew, someone they invited into the home. I think that because it occurred to me that the murderer might have eaten dinner with them and drugged them, and that's why it seems like most of them slept through being murdered or having others murdered right near them.
This was NOT the video to watch as I lie in the guest bed of a friend’s home trying to sleep. No not at all. All the other episodes? Treats. This? *shivers*
Important thing to note on this case is that apparently the Stillinger sisters were black or at least not white. One theory is that the murderer was a visiting pastor who was invited to stay at their home that night. The covering of the mirrors may be a religious belief. The bacon was also found in the sisters room. Basically the theory is that the pastor was racist and didn’t approved the sisters being treated as equals in the home so he wanted them to be slaughtered “like pigs”.
It is not hard to believe that you didn't hear anything. They're being axed in the face while they sleep if he. Does it fast enough two by two then nobody will wake up.... Nobody's waking up from an axe to the face
@1:30 😂😂😂. Preach!
what if the killer was the town marshal and he was covering up his fingerprints by allowing the town people to handle the axe?
Shane is your  Cup of Tea He'll make you Feel like Home and puts you at ease whenever your traveling to a  Haunted and scary place Shane will be by your side like a Guardian "Shannegel"
They believed Lena was the only one who tried to fight. They believed she was sexually assualted. Found her garments lifted up and her body on the edge of the bed.
What if you went to the house on 10 June and maybe do the investigation
the fact that sam and colby solved the case in olny one night investigation
how could a person kill innocent kids in their sleep? kids are angel😔😔😔
i think that the house may be both haunted by the spirit of the killer as well as the spirits of the 8 people they killed. i think that the killer may have come back to further torture the people he killed there. also, when a killer covers up someones head/mirror, it normally means that they know them on a personal level
I read somewhere that the bacon might have been used as a “fleshlight “ 🤢 that way the killer relieved himself without touching the girls
Ryan legit has all the emotions I have 🤣🤣
That house is evil horrible demolition it to the ground 😕😡👎👎
I cant understand how people actually think this crap is real. I once thought it was real but i was also like 5 years old lol. People need to grow up.
What disturbs me is that the crime scene was treated like a side show, like why on earth would you want to look at such a grisly murder?!
Why did they edit “again, Iowa”?
I wonder if it was the town marshall. No better way to cover it up than false incompetence
Really spooky I am big fan of you all video hats off from India
Why was the neighbor hanging up laundry at 5AM?
TW: necrophilia and child abuse     additional case detail: in the room of the Stilinger sisters, they found seminal fluid on the floor of that bed room and the oldest girl was stripped of her lower garments, was pulled to pose with her hands above her head and the found a bloody handprint on her upper thigh (can't remember which side) the guy was truly a sick minded individual but as horrible as it sounds, I'm glad she wasn't alive to witness that being done to her.....
I've always thought that the ghosts seem to be somehow scared of social media. Would explain why they never explicitly reveal themselves 😂.
I kinda believe that there was a religious cult. The murders feel almost ritualistic with covering of mirrors and corpses, closed curtains and maybe even the slab of meat fits into this. There most likely was more than one murderer since it really IS hard to believe that 8 people could be murdered in their sleep without anyone noticing. The cult would also explain many things, if the neighbours and the police were in on it. The neighbour said that she came over when she heard the horses neigh, so maybe it was the murderer(s) giving her a sign that they finished the job. The police contaminated the weapon on purpose and perhaps hid certain clues and concealed the identity of the criminal(s).
My man came out the closet it's okay if ur gay!
Never gonna understand how tf no one woke up besides maybe Lena. That house is NOT big. Like, the house I grew up in is a good size, and I could still hear the TV downstairs when I was upstairs in my room with the door closed. It's also BANANAS that people walked through the house WHILE THE BODIES WERE THERE like they were at a wax museum. Like damn, just casually walking around looking at 8 bodies including 6 kids. Just another day in Iowa.
He covered the mirrors so their souls wouldn't enter them.
That “what is it” was so clear I jumped a bit
If Criminal Minds has taught me anything, its that the fact that they were a "picture perfect family" is a huge possible motive. Look for someone who may have resented them for being a happy family, someone who didn't have one of their own.
That was NOT a picture of Amy and Adam from Kindred Spirits. Fake news!
My great aunt actually lived right next to the house. My family have lived in Iowa and Nebraska for forever. My great Aunt would tell me stories about stuff that would happen. She would tell me that her house was haunted too, and at night she could hear people upstairs having home party's. I miss her
They should’ve kept the spirit box going longer in the kids room the responding voice was the same voice every time and it was clear that’s rare
Well I’m from St. Louis Missouri soooo f**k Illinois 😂
I think Josiah's brother Ross murdered them, he had a duplicate key
27:55 🤨
It was me, i did it and im not sorry
I so wish that both Ryan and Shane meet with Sam and Colby, on a full adventure. It would be so much fun and also interesting!
Ohhhh, I know about this house!  Never seen it though. It's a beautiful house. I just feel so badly for this family and the wee girls. Just lovely people, going about their lives. So, neither the killer nor the people who died are there. There's one wee greebly that likes to play, but it doesn't use the spirit box. It did, however, sit down next to Ryan on the bed and then, as he got up, it climbed the wall. It also is nervous of, but really likes Shane and was reaching out with it's hand to "almost" touch him when he was alone in there. It's very curious about him.
The flashlights isn't even a method... It's all heat & battery.. There is way better, real, methods to use in communication with spirits.
I am not sure, but I think it's axe, not ax.
Any Muslims here? What do you think about these stories and why do you keep watching them
I feel so bad for the people in these videos, I'd befriend these ghosts if I could.
Don’t use Jesus Christ’s name in vain or in a blasphemous way
I dont think that the killer covering their faces was a sign that he knew them personally. Most convicted serial killers will admit that they didnt like looking their deceased victims in the eye - and the fact that the majority of the victims were killed while sleeping somewhat supports this. He didn`t want them to see him, and he didnt want to see himself (hence why he covered all mirrors and possibly hid in the victims` barn before the killings). I also disagree with the two main suspects in the case - neither of whom had murdered before. Someone who can sneak/break into a home with 8 people and systematically murder all of them without alerting any neighbors or victims has DEFINITELY had some practice.
19:10 swag from smg4 19:30 minecraft villager
as a person that has been doing paranormal investigation for a very long time i think that its for the best if you respect the spirits and the energy. Honestly nothing may happen but they can put a negtive energy on you for the rest of your life. Ive been seeing that Shane has been saying some disrespectfull things. I just wish him for the best lol.
It's so unfair to think that the spirit of the killer would haunt the home alongside the family, those spirits deserve peace and to pass over. Has anything ever been done to try to help the family pass over? The killer deserves to rot but come on, those poor kids should be free. Are there any credible theories as to who committed the murders, it's always 'he,' could it have been a woman? Probably easier to hide in the attic if it was a woman maybe? I haven't watched to the end of this yet so I'm hoping for some decent theories 🤞this case also reminds me a little of the hinterkaifeck farm murders in Germany, anyone unfamiliar should definitely look it up, it's crazy 😮
9:29 I love the captions (shane roars) it is so accurate
the music man took place the year after the murder and it makes the musical feel dark
after watching this in 2023, the "what is it" was most def ten of wayv speaking his opening line of phantom into the future 😉
They should have started in the barn
june 10, 1912
😨😨😨
In The end of the investigation when Ryan goes to the attic and turns on the spirit box.. was actually good evidence when you hear the box say leave.. because why you asked? Well there was no chatter at all from it.. meaning it wasn't picking up any radio channels.. nothing.. and for it to all of a sudden say leave is pretty freaking scary 😮😮😮😮😮
I live in Iowa……😂
An idiot friend of mine did mushrooms while staying at this house with her friends. Can you imagine?
32:17 is better cinematography than 90% of movies
😁
istg when it said “stop me” i heard “redrum” 😭
At 7:28 it sounded like brockhams brahm to me tbh
Who are these clowns?
Let’s go millions of people know about Iowa now
I live alone and for the past few nights I think a rodent got into my attic and is scurrying around. Now I'm gonna be super paranoid, thanks 😭
To be honest, I didn't hear "release me" but "bloody swing", which, given the context, is much worse-
I claim no negative energy
The house used to be a rental property too, Check them out!
I don't think I understand why this is a supernatural episode and not a true crime episode
I came here from the podcast History for Weirdos so I highly recommend that for other details, they talk about a guy that probably did actually do it but got away and how there was another case just like this one years later. (Btw they say that the guy who was suspected was a reverend and he actually wrote a note saying God told him then when he went to trial he denied the confession and was let go, people think he did it because he told people that the family had been murdered with an axe before the scene was even investigated so how would he have known what happened?)
I love these guys
I've driven through Iowa too, and I'd ne terrified if I were too
These two are the epitome of what I'd imagine that gen z type hipster men look like if someone was describing them to me.
if..loren an.ed. study this .maybe..it could be solved..hahahahha
17:55
I would imagine the bacon was brought in to throw police dogs off the killers' scent, like how people used to use hot pepper powder to mess up scent dogs. Maybe they found it in the fridge after they were done murdering, when they were having a bite to eat, as paranoia started setting in.
So my friend told me that a ghost won't interact with me bc I don't believe so it's like a shield. Shane is like a shield for you 😅
Covering mirrors was actually a common thing to do at the time when somebody died. Ironically it was so that their spirits wouldn't get trapped...
The amount of toys, dolls, and the kids mattress lets me know that this is a house most definitely in Iowa 😂
That is the most Iowa looking house 😂
The EVP at 7:28 says "cut in the brain"  The EVP at 18:53 says "F*** you" The EVP at 19:39 says "Fredrick" These next EVPs might be a bit weird at 22:55 it actually says something like "Happisobal" maybe another language? And after that the EVP says something along the lines of "tectos carne" gibberish maybe idk latin maybe. 32:00 EVP says "hit me"
The Axeman most of his victims survived. This guy went 8 for 8 in a single night
they need better equipment smfh
I agree with Shane about Iowa. If America was a school, Iowa would be the special needs classroom
I feel like people from Illinois feel the same way about idaho as Michiganders feel about Ohio
The spirit box is a joke right ?
Iowa has better corn
it felt nice to watch this
idaho killings
See if that tape case smells weird. We had those growing up and they smelled super weird inside like cancer plastic.
When the spirit box said “Switch”, maybe it was just announcing its preference in bed and just wanted someone to know and it happened to be the Ghoul Boys ™️
The beginning kinda sounds like the intro to yugioh
The perpetrator may have get back on back on the attic after what he did.
did they keep the items of evidence from the crime locked up somewhere till now - Axe cigarette butts clothes over mirrors? Can the new gene forensic tests that are solving a lot of old cold cases be used on any of the items that are still around?
If there was no forced entry and the door was locked nothing looked disturbed whoever it was they knew and they may have even spent the night
my favorite pair of queers
Johnny was an amazing man the children closet isn’t even bad it’s the closet in the parents room
khole
The Moore family had  2 daughters and 2 sons  with the stillengere girls one who was raped by the killer
What’s interesting. The two Stillinger girls (where the bacon slab was found) were daughters of an ultra wealthy farmer
What if the town marshal was the killer. That’s why he let people to contaminate the crime scene
the killer brutally chopped eight peoples heads off then went: "Y'know what would make this murder scene even more disturbing? a two pound slab of raw bacon"
Anyone else notice that this house has some of the same types of windows as the amityville horror?
22:37 and on are some pretty convincing EVPs
6:50 oh so silky ??
It was James Bond. The parents used to be agents also but went MIA
i belive that the killer was the Reverend. the guy was a pervert towards young kids and it preyed on the most least dangerous group.
i just wanna know wtf is the i state turf war?
yoo im near there sPokY
What if Shane has actually been a ghost this entire time he has the perfect cover
This is the Mystery that needs solved. The whole town deserves closure and for people to be respectful and polite and not constantly bring this up to them
10:13 the ghost has ADHD lmao
You don't believe in ghost but u believe Iowa is haunted ??? So what are ghost then or what do they do ???
this is 100 percent how multiplayer phasmophobia sessions go. One person takes stuff seriously then one other person tries to mess with the serious person.
I love all the stories about ghost encounters in these videos. It's like "So you got any proof that outrageous thing happened?" "trust me, bro"
The only way you can kill two people sleeping in the same bed or in the same room with an axe is either you restrain them so that the other one can't run or scream or drug everyone. Besides this looks pre planned definitely was done by someone who knew the layout of the house and where to start.
This episode proves, without a doubt, that ghosts AREN'T real.  ...because I know if I was a ghost, I would've taken that flashlight and beaten Shane unconscious at the 9:57 mark.  XD
If the town marshal did that . Was it the town marshal ? What better way to hide the evidence  !
could the marshal have been the one killing the family?
You forgot the e in axe
This is my favorite one by far ! ❤
this is real
please show respect not funny
It’s alot like animal crossing villager.
Okay, but that "who is it" audio recording was actually really clear. Like, convincingly clear.
Two Gangsta Ghost seekers ❤❤❤
Illinois sucks and only getting worse good luck
This would have been way better as a true crime episode
I like how ryan sounds more somber in this one
Shane shakes the soda,  ryan opens the can.
I feel as if I should have known this place existed
The best spirit box should be used  like these electromagnetic field sensors, but with whole alphabet along the scale and little program that could read the valid letters from the meeter and speak words. Like pure ghost-to human translator. So by that if we could get an actual word or sentence that makes sense - Wow we got it othervise - ye its piece o'sht,
You don;t need exorcist priest or any kind of people. You just need Shane who insult spirits and tells them to gtfo XDD
is it the axeman?
Rewatching this, it occurred to me that there was likely more than one killer. It would explain how 8 people could be murdered without the others in the house waking up: they were being killed off simultaneously. It always struck me as odd that two people in the same bed could be murdered in succession without one of them screaming. If both were struck at the same time, it wouldn’t wake anyone else up. I know they only found one murder weapon, but that doesn’t mean there weren’t others. It’s possible that one of the murderers accidentally left theirs behind. (Still can’t explain the bacon though)
I can't imagine anyone ever admitting happily that they are from Illinois.
Ryan keeps talking to it like a toddler w: that count down I wouldn’t speak either!😂
Why is all the swearing necessary? Doesn't make it any scarier. Shane, you can go back to Illinois.
so it was definitely the town marshal
Seems like the town did it tbh why were they so interested good god
I'm really surprised that more people who talk about this case, don't realize/mention that covering mirrors in the home and closing curtains are all funerary customs. Mirrors were covered to keep the spirit of the deceased from being trapped in the mirror and the curtains were closed to symbolically show that the soul has left.
“you do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe” SHANE 🥺🥺🥺
how did nobody hear the ax hit the wall, when anything hits a wall it’s not usually quiet let alone an ax. we’re they drugged? was it someone they trusted? why was only josiah killed with the sharp part of the ax?
31:57 I heard "Hit me"
Why would the killer haunt this house? It's not like he died there. And if theories are correct, and it was a serial killer, which house should he haunt?
Disrespectful clowns.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . .  . . . . . . . . . .  . . .  . . . . . . .
I honestly thought something was going to happen to the elderly parents
The sign makes it a little less scary, and you doing it at night doesn’t help how fake it seems.
illinois a republican state no wonder he looks like a fool.
haha iowa, kinda reminds me of that one album....
i live in iowa come down with the meanies lol
What are your parents’ name? Shelby(?) OMG TOMMY-
Creepy. The house reminds me of the amityville house.
would love to see Ryan and Shane go back to this place one day. especially now that they got the other tools to work with
do you guys watch supernatural a lot
During an intense seen an add pops up with a little girl talking saying mommy what's for dinner. I heard the mommy part and was like OMG I just heard a little girl ghost talking.. about gave me a heart attack 🤣
The fat of the bacon was used for either masturbation or as a lubricant for the girl. Lena was definitely the target and it was someone who knew Lena will be sleeping over that night.
Every Iowan just sitting back like "Yeah... You right."
i saw an episode of a show about this when i was like 7 or 8 and i couldn’t sleep over at my friends houses for years
Cannot figure out how that mark would have come from an upswing without also hitting the ceiling and mirror (presuming the mirror was never moved)… I could see the mirror being lower, trying to swing, getting stuck in the wall (noisy) getting the axe free and trying again then not going back to using the blade.  But otherwise... Idk maybe it's just the camera action.
If you think about it, maybe the killer was the Marshall. He was smart to allow people to disrupt the scene of the crime as well as handle the murder weapon. As to why it was him, in this fashion it seems as though the murderer simply did it for his own twisted enjoyment. Being the Marshall is a great coverup for it too.
In some religions it's believed.if you don't cover the mirrors in the house that the spirits will become trapped in the mirror for eternity. Maybe that's why he did it.
It was not stop me it was coffee
Lmaooo I live in iowa and trust it’s definitely haunted
So, does the spirit box make random words or what? Because ghosts aren't real, straight up. I'm just curious as to what that box does.
I've now seen about 10 of these episodes and this is the creepiest one to me, just because of how clear and relevant the answers were on the spirit box. 'Hard to stop' gave me chills...
It was the Marshall, thats why he passed around the murder weapon lol
i like that he takes cares of a house and his name is houser
Idk what they thought they were hearing but that ghost was repeatedly saying f**k you to them on that spirit box.
My God. What happened to that family is horrifically tragic. And the fact the monster was never caught makes my heart angry and sad.
Was at the house in 2019. Didn't see or feel anything until we were back outside. My friend took one last picture of the front door which was closed. The picture showed the image of a young girl maybe 4 feet tall. We tried to replicate it several times!es without success.
I love imagining the national guard coming in and being like ".......you've GOT to be kidding me"
The Town marshall was behind it
that tall dude shane or whatever is actually a fucked up psychopath who the hell sleeps on the floor of a house where people where murdered and says "it's actually quite calming"
To be honest, contaminating the scene back then doesn’t mean crap.  Not exactly a lot of science back then. They gonna jingle chicken bones in an empty can to read who was the killer?
Ya'll should have gone into the upstairs of the barn. I went there recently and got some really good evidence up there. Also, were you two visited by a cat multiple times in the night? There was a "neighborhood" cat that hung around us all night and then when we wrapped up the investigation wanted nothing to do with us. It was weird.
I hate the flashlight gimmick, it’s the most over used and debunked garbage in ghost hunting
have we considered the theory that the murderer is haunting the house because he meant to take that bacon with him and he figured he'd come back and get it
Maybe 'eighteen' is how old the killer was
You’ve gotta keep this series going. I’m a millennial and it’s 2022. You know I watched the entire series in one night. This series is hilarious and I need more
This would have been a great buzzfeed unsolved true crime  and buzzfeed unsolved paranormal  crossover
Why do they think the killer is in that house? He left so his spirit/ghost is not there🤗🤔
The ghosts are trembling ryan
I do not agree with how they were " rude" when trying to talk to them. You are going to make them mad and that isnt good.
My boyfriend grew up around this house since one of his aunts lived literally across the street from the house.  He would play in the yard as a little kid, completely oblivious to what happened there 😅
7:25 the ghost said mcgriddle not brain
Theory :Town marshal murdered them.
What if the ghost speaker doesn’t give present voice, but the one of last things the ghost had said once in the past…or maybe it’s the one of last thoughts they had before they died. Also what if the ghost speaker sends the voices through to the ghost making them believe they’re talking to a ghost/ rather if the killer haunts the victims still and doesn’t let the other ghost speaks if they know it can get rid of them themselves? These are my thoughts, I’m really I don’t know if they’re true I’m just speaking off my head
worlds best duo, one who believes everything and the other who provokes everything
9:28 Shane Rage mode activated-💀
I need to know Shane's opinion on the status of Ohio.....
I enjoy this show, but I just hate how they stop the "spirit box" right when they are getting answers. And that they put a time limit on the supposed spirits and then give, and how they ask loaded questions such as "turn the black flashlight off if there's a demon that wants to harm us". If the black flashlight doesn't turn off, they're like "oh we got the answer, nothing here." But what if it wasn't a demon and it didn't want to harm them? Like I said, I enjoy the show, I've been binge watching on Hulu like a mofo, but I get frustrated a lot 🤣
I would be careful around that place a bunch of people filmed a porno there.
Yeah so the bacon... He used it the masturbate. Also. I used to live in Decatur Illinois. I could live without it.
maybe the fam had ordered the bacon and the person who delivered was the killer
as an iowa shane ain’t wrong lol
Maybe if they talked to them like they were still living they would answer more?
What if it was an estranged or illegitimate older son who killed the family in an attempt of revenge for being abandoned?
If you're murdered in your sleep, how would you become a spirit when you were unaware it was taking place to begin with? I think the feeling of dread is from all of the tourists bringing it to the residence.
ahh yess IOWA my favourite Slipknot Album ❤
There's nothing more Midwestern than dunking on Iowa for no reason other than "it sucks"
This is one of the very few cases that makes me feel paranoid and sick to my stomach every time I watch it. I’ve seen it only twice, and it’s affected me both times.   But the only thing that I enjoy is Shane saying, “You do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe.” That’s the only thing about this video that is nice.
How i can buy this house? 😂😂
i have some medium abilities and think when they said “switch” and talked to shane it was the girls, then shane said he didn’t respect them/they were sickos and upset them
Flashlights 100% are rigged. They dont just flicker like that, for no reason. sure there are ways to do it but you need some kind of electrical interference. If this would happen on regular bases with tested flashlights, any skeptic would start believing in ghosts.  Explain me how that happens?
I grew up only 60 miles from this place and had no idea about it until just last year. You'd think I'd hear about it at least once in the 15 years I lived in Iowa.
Shane is the best! 😂🤣
Should of turn the flashlight off, the whole night since it isn't that dark in a small house. U will get more activities. A flashlight just help u not to get scared n less activities. Use your Night camera to help u see. Don't be a scary cat lol
We're ghoul brothers. That's a bond that lasts forever.
how do they turn the flashlights on and off, and how do they use those spirit boxes?
I don't understand why the murderer's ghost would be in the house.
Glad Iowa's known for something besides corn
I’m coming to it rn
22:41 sounded like "still here"
ok guys grt video but what the f is that near  the window at  26:10
I have never related to Shane more than I did in this moment: 9:30
No idea why the murders spirit would be there after he killed them then left.  I am also surprised that they didn't mention that this was actually one of a series of very similar murders that all went along a train line.  All of which used an axe.
okay so I've heard a spirit box is a device that rapidly flips through radio channels, if that's the case then the unintelligible garble was most likely stations that were tuned in, since it was going so fast you couldn't hear what was being said, the words we did hear were probably that but with the speed that it was going at, it's seem unlikely that different people talking sounded similar and they formed cohesive words, that'd be a very big coincidence.
As someone from Iowa, I can confirm that our state is haunted and our main exports are axe murder and beef.
So at 6:50 even tho the subtitle say 'unintelligible', it sounded like it said "Please don't stab me" which goes well with the line said a few seconds later "release me"
Honestly i think the town martial did it
Do we believe the flashlight thing? Not sure about this whole thing, though very popular.
I would love to see a collab with Shane and Ryan and Sam and Colby, I think it’d be hilarious 😂
28:26 "it's actually quite calming" Shane is a psycho😭
Love watching this show. But these two are very disrespectful. There is nothing wrong  abt being funny… BUT i dont think you can do that inside that house. The way they speak is more disturbing… they were laughing and all. Not nice of them. You can be a little informal of course BUT their actions were really disturbing to watch.
Me as a ghost: People with spirtbox: wits ur name Me: ur mom
Still waiting to hear "Choo Choo pickle pie" What if someone in or connected with the local law enforcement did it so they let people come in to contaminate evidence on purpose? 🤔
so no one is gonna talk about the scream at 7:34? aight
As a Wisconsinite, Shane, no.
I’m from Iowa. I had no idea we were supposed to not like people from Illinois
There was a thing in ye olden times where if someone was close to death servants or other people of the house were meant to cover mirrors or things that could hold reflections because the spirts of those who died could get trapped in them. Maybe he was trying to stop the spirits from attaching themselves to the house?
24:42
I love this series, but why don't they acknowledge the camera person?
So the murderer came casually for a visit, some dinner, and a couple axeings.
I shouldnt have watched this before bed. This fucked me up 😂
Is it too late for a post mortem question?
I must admit, if my family and I were brutally murdered, and I see my home used as a macabre tourist attraction, I'd be damn pissed off!
i feel bad for the Moores but i feel really bad for the other families kids, if they just planned the sleepover for another weekend they’d still be alive, really bad tragedy hope they are resting
i guessing everyone is gonna agree that the children and the murder was talking in the child’s room?
14:46 it could be the mothers voice asking what the device is maybe?
Also, the covering of the mirrors in the home suggests that the killer was oddly being respectful of the souls. Throughout History, it is known that people liked to cover mirrors as a religious belief that souls may be inadvertently trapped if the mirrors weren't covered up when a death occured. They also had a tendency to stop clocks at the time of death.
It was speculated that the killer used the 2lb slab of bacon wrapped in  a dish towel as a masturbatory tool. Like a Victorian Era Fleshlight, because the elder Stillenger girl was positioned in a sexually suggestive pose.
As a fellow Illinoian, I can confirm Shane is our kill leader
The house itself has some chills to it, alot of vibes of Amityville or atleast what I think of when I see that type of architecture
9:28 *(Shane roars)* lol
Did nobody think to take prints off the dishes he used
My initial thoughts are, The Bacon may have been intended to distract a dog if they had one. I've heard of robbers using steak to distract guard dogs, it might be a similar tactic.  If true, since they didn't have a dog afaik, that could indicate the killer didn't know the family very well. Just a theory.
So I was thinking this killer sucked I mean he left so much for the police to use like the silverware he used and the ax with finger prints you know
Imagine wackin ur meat and a demons in the room
Ok a theory of investigtion just came up in my mind. According to the evidences I got from this investigation, possibly that: 1. The killer couldn’t control himself and found it satisfying to kill each family member due to his mental state for staying in that attic for way too long. This often happends if a person never get a new glimpse of a place, this could be proven by staying in a room with a bed, monitor, food, and particularly anything but try not to get of your room for a whole year/months and you will go full bonkers. 2. Possibly, a demon made a contact with him and then thought, ‘hey how bout i make this guy possessed?‘ and proceed to control him because according in the voice box a male voice is heard saying, “help me” or he was being controlled and stuff like that. Proven as well on the occurance during the 2014 after making self-inflected wounds which will confirm my suspision to be true… the mirror confirms it as well as a way of the person not getting his control back, so there will be a total of 9 people residing in the residence but 1 demon in the attic.  3. There could have been three of them, which is impossible, but this could also be the reason why not much of the family’s woke up as the murder happens.  Those are just my theories thank you very much.
You might want to becarful of what you make fun of! Cause it won't be good for you.
The fact that the land where the house builded had spirit like people died there and their ghost still present there in the house. They need a Priest to get the spirit out the house
6:50 I'm not even joking, I heard "I'm transsexual."... Are ghosts becoming "woke" too now?
Isn't it spelled axe?
Cld you guys take the sheet off the mirrors?
19:33 After he asked "What were your parents' names?" I just heard: Batman So apparently we have a man of justice here😂
This happened two months after titanic sank
I'm confused, what happened to the parents of the guy who got axed?
“Jesus…..” “that thing sucks”  Hahahahahaha
Just wanted to correct something but think when they’re in the attic and the Spirit Box says “Helpless [Unintelligible]”, I think it actually says “Helpless Boy”
Ryan 57 episodes after signing a contract “how tf did I get myself into this again” ? 🤣🤣🤣
I think when the box said something at around the 20 minute mark, they said the victims last name of Moore
What if it was the fathers brother, he had a key, he knew each room, it is a possibility
In the attic the spirit said 8 and he killed 8 people why no one pick up on this
10:23 ryans laugh is so cute😭
Is this comedy? More YouTube childish garbage, grow up
I remember watching a ghost hunters episode on this when I was like 8
I have never had one flash light that would turn on and off on its own, let alone 2. Wtf? Is that a thing?
Man such a shame this is unsolved. I wish I knew like why them? Can you imagine being the parents of the girls that let them sleepover? There lives never be the same again and family members just crying for years. So horrible.
Curtains were closed and mirrors covered until after the funeral so that the deceased's image wouldn't get trapped in a looking glass. It was thought that you might be next if you saw yourself in a mirror at a house where someone had recently died. To prevent bad luck, all clocks were stopped at the time of death
i forgot this is supernatural and hearing 'investigators' makes me expect some sort of fact but it's just ghost jargon😂
Me being from Iowa i feel offended
This was actually solved in 1931, when George Meyers (48) confessed to the murders, and he was 29-30 years old when he had committed the murder.
As an Iowa native living a little over an hour away, Villisca has always fascinated me. I've been to this house, but I wouldn't chalk it up as haunted in any sense. It's definitely an interesting story.
it was mary like who tf comes to the conclusion something’s wrong and tries to break in basically
6:50 “I can’t save you”
2022 Reason to have a gun close by.
Not Ghost!  Demands? YES!  Lucifer and his angels are among us. destroying. Until Christ returns. Look up JESUS cast the Demands into the swine, ?
RYAN, if you have extra time on your schedule, look up AMY'S CRYPT on the investigation that was done in this house and show SHANE that there is something strange in this house, something that has affected AMY to the point where she cries. Watch the video with your friend and you will understand what I said in that comment.
Wow! You guys are disrespectful about actual human beings that were slaughtered in their own home!
Omg, now that's making an entertainment piece of a gruesome crime. That "spirit box" thing - that's just offensive. This is not a circus, people died here, and you play it as a fantasy piece. Disgusting.
They used the bacon as a sexual object. He had sex with it while he watched the 2 young murdered girls. One of the girls had her buttocks uncovered and hanging off the side of the bed.   Check out a story called Horror Stories for an excellent recap of this story.
Were the Stillinger girls Jewish? The bacon placed in their room could be a sign of disrespect. But someone else would have to know they were there...
If this happens nowadays they could’ve easily fingerprinted the prints on the kitchens items he ate out of
Honestly, the blankets on the mirrors and the voice box saying ‘hard to stop’ whenever Ryan asked why they did it is so unsettling, even if it could be explained by something that ISNT ghost related
I have lived in Iowa my whole life and didn’t know this existed.
I think that the town marshal letting the people even do such things as enter a murder scene and even touch the weapon that could’ve been used as evidence footprints and fingerprints or even checked the dna on the girls since one of them tried to fight back she could’ve had the fingerprints of the murderer on her so it might be why this mystery was unsolved
What’s confusing is how the murderer’s “presence” is in the room if it’s an unsolved mystery the murderer must’ve escaped and since it’s unsolved he might’ve died of old age so how is he in the room with them because the girls wouldn’t have had a bad presence around them since they were victims
31:48 Bro is that some kind of  statue behind because it looks like a little girl standing behind him
As someone that lives in Iowa I too think it's haunted
Shane's Denial is just some time through the roof.
Narration: "After killing the family, the murderer went into the kitchen and ate some food" Me: "So, I guess that makes them a cereal killer?"
31:15 i didn’t know that
Hey Paul!
"Somebody stop me"  I don't think it's Jim Carrey KILLED ME LMAO
9:26 Shane's face is me every episode when Ryan starts talking. Lolol
You would think that they would hear the murderer open the door with how loud it would've been
The bacon actually makes a lot of sense. If the killer didn't know the family, he might have used the bacon to lure a potential dog away.
The spirit said release me.
Just watching this now, but i do want to add at 6:52 it sounds like it said “I can’t say”… I’m listening with my AirPods and i JOLTED OUT MY SEAT
I'm not going to sit and read through all of the comments to see if anyone has pointed out the fact that the bacon wrapped in the towel, in the room where the little girl was posed in a sexual position but none of the children were  sexually assaulted says the sick s.o.b made a Fifi (fake vagina) out of the bacon. So he had his way with that bacon while looking at her in that position while their heads were cracked open!!!!!!!!
I was hoping to watch something a little less disrespectful to those who passed away...very sad for them
I wonder if the reasons the town Marshall let others contaminate the crime scene was because he was the murderer himself 🤔 just a small theory
I’ve been here, you can stay the night and stuff. I also live in Iowa😂
I like how there was a voice that literally said "hard to stop" and this dudes like "must've been the wind"
I think the hoof analogy works better if Ryan doesn't say it was a unicorn but rather a herd of centaurs
Paranormal AND Humor 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
my sister watched this ep. and said, "molly, you're the iowa version of shane.... you gotta fight." so.... ig the invitation is extended for a duel
Ryan and shane are the best ghosts hunters of all time
That 2lb slab of bacon 🥓 got me In tears 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 these 2 are freaking hilarious 😂 😃 😄 😁 🤣
“you do what you do to make your girlfriend safe” <3
Sorry to say this, but Sam and Colby did it way better than you guys!!!
I think the killer was jealous of the fact that they were a perfect family and wanted to ruin them
You guys are kind of disrespectful to the victims there. Making jokes and stuff.
the piece of ham is because the murderer moved the girls body to show her private parts and he used the bacon to. u fill in the void. so yeah. just truly horrifying
It was the town butcher
At 19:25, that sounded like probably, rather than help me
“what occurred?”
every time the spirit box supposedly said "stop me", i think it was actually saying "help me"
It's the brother. He is the killer.
When Ryan jumps up from the bed you can definitely see an orb pass him
11:52 the axeman strikes again
I heard that covering mirrors and/or glass was done to prevent the spirits of the deceased to get trapped in them.
What if the killer was hiding away in the attic? The whole time he got to chill, no taxes or anything, just learning their habits before he would get out of his space in the house and attack them before leaving and moving on to another place to find shelter and spy on people.
My aunt lives like right next to this place
If you ever have a horrible rotting meat smell in a section of your house it's a bad energy straight demon no ghost. So that bacon slab is definitely the killers way of displaying that he was forced or in a way made by a demon to do so
Caretaker: Imma prank this guy       Whatever the hell went inside the house: *Imma prank this guy*
They covered mirrors back then so spirits wouldn't get trapped when someone died.
I hope ghosts are real. And Ryan is cute:)
if i ever investigated that house alone, i would freeze in fear and text someone to come in and get me
Iowa hates Nebraska iowa is the better nebraska
Bro Illinois is supposed to hate ohio
There was a report of a man on a train leaving that town who said to the man next to him that 8 people had been killed with an ax before the bodies had been discovered.
i thought the where gonna say he santa the way into the house
Those flashlights have to be faulty. If the supernatural is real, I think it would be like prison where child killers get ripped apart by the inmates.
This story makes me wish hell was real.
Personally I think the Marshall did it. He let people in and contaminate the scene, he most likely knew the family and that’s why he covered the bodies with that often being a sign of remorse. Not only is it a sign of remorse, but it also happens a lot in crimes of passion. My guess is that the Marshall was maybe having an affair or was in love with the wife and maybe she rejected him and/or stop the affair. He might have had a troubled mind and only meant to kill one person (my guess is the husband considering the he was the only one killed with the sharp part of the ax) but then killed everyone else in fear that the others would wake up and recognize him. That kind of where the “stop me” and “I’m miserable” come in.
"okay next interview question: how would you keep civilians out of an active crime scene?" That Marshall: "Keep them out? I'm gonna invite right on in!"
Who’s gonna tell ‘em what the bacon meat was for? Who’s gonna tell ‘em?
Guys, I've figured it out! It was the axe man and razor boy!!!!
Who put the doll back in the chair?
7:04 "booty sweat"
The bacon
7:30 it sounds like “Welcome Ryan” 😰
Maybe the ghosts were racist
lmao these two are frickin hilarious 🤣🤣🤣
18:16 just Shane coming out the closet.
Who's to say the Marshall didn't do it?
I like the guy that doesn't belive. There is a Church here in Louisiana I'd like him to visit.
🇵🇬🇵🇬🇵🇬
The house is so cute id like to live here
My name is Josiah
Youre not supposed to provoke spirits. Provoking them is just a gateway for bad things to happen. Scratching/physical injuries,and much more.
It has those creepy 1/4 circular windows just like the Amityville house....maybe ghosts are attracted to those kind of windows similar to the way gay men love track lighting fixtures.
why would the killer's spirit be in that house if he wasn't killed there? where is the consistency
5:50 the meat was there bc he pleasured himself with it after he killed them all , so sick 🤮
It was totally the brother that "found" them. Covering the faces is a sign of remorse, the killer knew the family.
When you show a picture thats supposed to be Johnny Houser, and it's a clean shaven dude with no beard....that's just blasphemy. What are you hiding????? 🤔
King of the Dolls 😅
Please tell me I'm not the only one who falls asleep with this on!
why... why would the murderer's ghost be there?
If the torches are fake how would they do that?
Won't be sleeping tonite! Bye
I find both of these guys very unlikable. Never takes anything serious. If this is so funny and below you just do a show you actually care about and hire people with actual passion for this one. Seriously, so unlikable.
Maybe the guy works in a slaughter house ... it's a maybe
The "I State Turf War" is real.
I wish u guys had a podcast
TheManlyMan could have a point he’s basically saying (to save you scrolling down for 1000000 minutes) that the New Orleans axe murders and these murders could be connected because they are both very similar
Not saying that people should believe this but it could have been the New Orleans axeman both within that decade. These murders happening in 1912 and then the New Orleans axe murders done in 1918-1919 both done in the same way. While they were sleeping and with an axe.
As an Iowan i resent that lol but been to the house and have odd because I had a very hard time being close to the perishable goods room on the side of the kitchen and the attic. It has an eerie vib to it....
Why would a murderer be "giddy" about murdering a family and then put sheets over their faces after he murdered them?  That medium's gotta be faking.
Theory here though jokes aside...anybody happen to remember Buzzfeed Unsolved True Crime? Yeah New Orleans Axe Man....
Ryan: “Eighteen what does that mean?”  It means the 8 victims
As an iowan i can agree that this place is haunted
10:55 how do they do this?
15:01 “I was drunk”
6:51 I think it said “ Reclusive “
Perhaps be a little more respectful
I remember that someone came up with a theory that this murder was the work of a serial killer who may have also killed the family at the Hinterkaifek farm
14:46 So I'd like to preface this by saying I don't believe in any of this spirit box stuff. But that sounds like "Francis" to me, not "what is it?" And one of the top suspects in the Villisca Ax Murders was a senator named Frank (possibly short for Francis) Jones.
F Iowa
You know sh*t’s about to go down when Buzzfeed mentions the time of an event.
what if the town marshall did it and let people onto the scene and touch the murder weapon was intentional
Who puts out laundry at 5am?
Oh iowa is absolutely haunted. I don’t know how to explain it but I’ve lived here for 25 years of my 25 year old life and nowhere else is nearly as eerie
I think there's more to the killer here... I feel like the words spoken in the spirit box could lead to the killer or just  suspects , I personally think it was a case of DID or something (not to offend anyone) bc the voices were "hard to stop" "help" "I'm miserable" so yeah
makes no sense on why the murdered would roam the house, if they exist it'd be the victims not the murderer.
"metaphorical ghost dildo" - ryan 2022
0:35 send a post card to your parents. Ironic, because my parents actually gave me a postcard from that house. Just funny enough, thought I'd share
when ryan asks "why did you do what did you here" at 31:55, it actually really sounds like the spirit box says "envy." could be a good explanation on why they killed an entire family.
Midwesterner here, can confirm that none of the Midwest states like each other, but there are different degrees of hatred between states. Like Minnesota and Illinois have no real beef (as far as i know, relations are ever changing), but there is a borderline civil war going on between North and South Dakota.  And everyone hates Iowa, just as a default
“Turn on the blue flash light and turn of the red one.” Reminded me of the mandalorin episode.😂
I feel that the killer does regret what he did and what he did, he didn’t want to do. Because what he said in the spirit box sessions suggests that. The spirit in the spirit box kept on saying help me, and I did it. Though this doesn’t mean that he should not be punished.
6:51 Ryan and shane?
Stuff like these is why guns should be legal everywhere
Fake ... Stop scamming people
LOL I agree with Shane F off you Ohio folks even we got the highest tax rates here in Illinois )):
Crazy how im driving through Des Moines & this video popped up lol
Ryan and Shane's conversation about hooves and unicorns is legit how I and my husband talk to each other. He's way more of a Shaniac whereas I am more in the middle. I believe that something exists that we as humans cannot understand, but I do not think that ghosts are going to act how they're portrayed in movies and TV. I have had my own experiences with things that I cannot even begin to understand but sound kind of implausible. But ghosts like on TV or in Hollywood movies?  That's a hard no.
6:50 it ABSOLUTLEY said ryan and shane... usually I'm not really with the spirit box because the subtitles makes me hear what they hear... but this time i heard that 100% by myself.
He probably covered the mirror because of the superstition that the soul gets sucked into the mirror upon death
A ghost hunt and unsolved crime?
The voices from the spirit box seemed pretty clear here compared to other investigations they've done. I feel like the killer is in the house and he regrets what he's done. The "stop me" "release me" "kill him" like it feels as though he doesn't like what he's done and he feels sorry.
As an Iowan I've been waiting for this once since day one. Hell yes.
Apparently the killer used the bacon to masterbait to the oldest daughter
Been there and me and my team of demon fighters will help the children there oh LORD JESUS some people should not provoke the spirits who will destroy their lives some people dabble in the occult without knowing it.  I pray for these two lost souls ya Sam and Coly Seth Elton should teach these clowns a thing or two right or Zak or Steve ya IDK maybe Aaron could give them some advice. I think Zak is pry the best at this stuff. ya Ghost hunters are good too. Guys you need to find Zak and let him guide you. Good luck guys you need it Arc ANGEL RAPHEAEL CHRIST JESUS GOD almighty, URIEL< GABRIEL  MICHAEL DO YOUR THING!! amen right on boss
the ghost said, "Unten Leeven Laven Loven".  What does that mean.
27:23 😂😂😂
If you count how many times the guys said "murderer", you would think 20-30 people killed the Moore family, not just one person. Why can't they say killer more? Murderer just sounds annoying. The reason I almost hate the word "murderer" is the reason I don't like the word "appreciate". My sister used to say appreciate so many times just hearing that word makes my teeth grate. Side note: Has anyone ever thought that it's possible Josiah's brother Ross might've killed the family? If the doors were locked, and possibly a few people had keys to their home, isn't it possible Josiah's brother killed the family? It could've been a random person, it could've been a criminal... It could've even been a friend. It makes sense that no one is sure because they were killed in 1912, and there was no type of technology back then to help solve the case. Not saying definitively that Josiah's brother killed the family, just saying it's possible.
They gotta invest in other flashlights.
HEAR ME OUT SHANE RYAN COLBY AND SAM TOGETHER ON AN INVESTIGATION
iowans are always just happy to be mentioned
"shane roars" IM CrYING
Covering their faces is signs of remorse
Just burn the axe and send the soul to the afterlife
I've always wanted to know how the neighbor never heard any screaming out of that many slayings.
At one point when you were asking questions I heard a whisper that sounded like it said “police” and then you have the police officer letting citizens handle the murder weapon 🤔
3:49 🤣🤣
ghosthunter tool: ameshmajh= hard to stop
In surprised the camera man isn’t running away and screaming like a little girl🤘
If someone is interested in more infos on that case I can recommend the Podcast "Haunted Road" by Amy Bruni. The Episode is called "Slay Utterly". She is talking to the owner of the house and also about the guy who got stabbed. If anyones interested give it a listen :)
Fun fact, all the china on the table in the kitchen is brand new because a phone was thrown mysteriously back in my visit in 2017!
if i was the ghost in the kids room, and they where like 'what? what?' i would have been like 'you two are useless'
anyone got an email for these two? I want to tell them outright they solved this case
"The horses began neighing" *Demon sounds*
I'm from Iowa
Alice  Willard was a witness who's testimony got thrown out I have been doing a lot of research there's so much more and so many questions i wonder if there's away for me to access the case file its self for me to confirm my thoughts the police failed as investigators
I'll toss my hat in the ring of ideas. The closing of the windows and covering the mirrors with cloth was a popular mourning tradition in the Victorian era, (ending in 1901) and Edwardian era (ending in 1910) so the idea of these funerary practices being performed is a possibility. It would also be very odd for the murderer to have killed them, moved their bodies / covering them, then gone around the house closing blinds and covering windows and, according to some sources, eaten a meal. A strange amount of interaction between the criminal and the crime scene without something being stolen.
Oh yes my beloved Sam and Colby has been here omg y’all should film with them.
I have the same feelings about Iowa that Shane has. I’m from Minnesota close to the Iowan boarder we deal with them a lot they are crazy
Let's party!! Except for the killer lol!
It was Mary
Go do we need Ryan and Shane back for more
Who's writing the cringe subs for the sprit box? that guys' delusional
7:30 doctor brain & swift is what I heard
Sam and colby debunked this murder on their channel btw (they are ghost hunters if you dont know them)
As much as it has been sort of made a cliché by movies and TV, there is something of a tradition from a long time ago, about covering mirrors in the instance of a deceased person so that they can pass on peacefully. Which kind of implies, if that was the motivation behind covering the mirror, that there was some sort of personal investment and element between the murderer and the victims. It’s not some thing one could do on accident.
I don't think the bacon had anything to do with it. It would be like a murder happening today, and everyone trying to figure out why there was a gallon of milk in the fridge
why do ryan and shane look like the cast of a cbs cop show in this episode
Rip
You just had to reference The Mask didn't you Shane. I was so close to forgetting that movie existed but you just had to make a reference.
Whoever reading should watch the show Ghosts (American and British are both equally great)! According to show Ghosts, not all ghost have haunting powers and those that do, it takes a lot of effort. If ghosts are like the ones in the show, they’re probably cursing Shane because it takes a hell of a lot to just urn off a flashlight 😂
maybe the ghost was colorblind?
08:08 WHY WAS THE THING ON THE RIGHT SIDE MOVING, THE THING IN THE DARK DJDJDJ
So we all think it was the brother right
My theory: the town marshal. He let people contaminate the axe the killer left behind and let people into the crime scene.
The murder of the 5 year old boy is so sad. Like Fr.
My theory about this is the Marshall was the killer. Why would anyone let a bunch of people touch a MURDER WEAPON? Unless they didn’t want their own prints or evidence to be found being contaminated with others prints and DNA. The Marshall would also be someone who most people would know and trust so he wouldn’t be as suspicious if it was the Marshall.
31:57 I don't know why but it sounded like he said "Hippie" (sorry if the time stamp is wrong lol)
"Almost 100 years later in June 2009-"  What day? If it was the 16th it happened on my birthday
This is my home town and in my opinion I think all of this is fake. This isn’t even the original house. Yes all the stories are true but I don’t think everything now is NOT real. Maybe I’m wrong, but personally I haven’t seen any activity in this house.
there was only one girl in the bacon room and i was the oldest and the murder used that bacon to do things that is not appropriate for kids her dress was lifted up and under garment off
Welp atleast they died during the titanic soooo
There were a series of extremely similar murders along that railway at the same time, entire families . It's on YouTube worth the view...
wait... a place that has a special effect on people? welp, time to call the scp corporation.
No
I still don't understand how this crime is still unsolved.  It is so obvious that the Father murdered some Hobo, smashing his face and head to gravy kills his wife, children by suffocation and then mince meats their bodies to match the handy work he's done on the hobo. It's the O'l SWITCHEROO. Daddy hot-foots dressed as Hobo. Probably went to live in Brooklyn. All that needs to be done is a DNA TEST on the remains of the " Father " in the grave and the children.  SOLVED.
As an Iowan, I can in fact confirm that Iowa is haunted
1:00 Shane I get it u don’t believe in sprits but please for the love of Christ stop staring into mine 😭😭😭
The murdered can't communicate with people. That's not the state that they're in.
I wonder what kind of sense of humor people had back in 1912... maybe the spirits or Ghost  would have responded more had they not been laughing so hard at you guys. yal are the best!!
What if the ghost was all sweet and your like , " your a looooser !! " Lol 😆
Why can't I find friends like this
Plot twist it’s the axe man from New Orleans
i also heard that the murderer did something sugestive to one of the girls,like raise there skirts and do things...
"it would be trending for.. a day or two on twitter" thats both the funniest and most accurate thing ive ever heard LMAO
I think the family is gone, it's just the killer now.
Honestly, I wonder if the town Marshall had something to do with the murders. It would explain how the murderer got in the house because the family probably knew him or he could just flash his badge. It would also explain why he let the townspeople hold the axe, to cover up his fingerprints on it. Could also explain the regret that the murderer probably showed. The motive could be because of an affair with the town Marshall’s wife and Josiah. And since the Marshall might’ve been used to brutal scenes and such, that could explain the casualty of making food possibly after the murders. Then maybe the guilt set in and that could’ve been when he decided to cover the mirrors and the bodies. Purely speculation but I thought it was an interesting idea🤔🤔
So the Marshall is a sketchy dude letting the townspeople WALK ALL OVER THE CRIME SCENE
I mean, police investigation in those days was a joke, but this one seems to take the cake, people parading in murder scene, which happened in other cases but then letting them play with the murder weapon, and that is the head, I think, don't even want to know what the juniors would have done.
Schindler said he could have even saved us so stop the killings and violence it is gross this is my house I am Renee Lemke they were Tills
“But unicorns aren’t real..ghosts are real” 🤯🤯🤯
am i the only one who doesnt understand why everytime ghost hunters go to a place of murder, they also talk to the murderer? like the killer didnt died in the house so im confused...
the scientific method fears the buzzfeed unsolved comment section
The covering of the mirrors is an 1800’s superstitious thing …. If you don’t cover the mirrors 🪞 the spirits of the deceased can attached themselves to you if you look at your reflection in the mirror
29:49
In Poland, we cover mirrors after death, and during shiva, when we mourn. I mean in Jewish houses, but I have a lot of non-Jewish friends and their families have a similar tradition.
The bacon was there most likely because they sexually pleasured themselves to the oldest girl, she was placed in a way that she was dragged down in the bed with her night gown pulled up to her waist and her undergarments were removed. There was also a bloody handprint on her thigh. Also there is 3 main suspects, if you want another perspective on all of this, go to the YouTube channel, “Sam and Colby” and go to their video of villisca axe murder house
“I don’t believe in ghosts but I think Iowa is haunted” is one of the funniest things he’s ever said
8:56
The house is creaky and loud now, because it's old and the moisture has gone out of the wood by now, but back when the murders happened the house was probably newer and the wood was still fresh and thus didn't creak when the murderer snuck in.
It was the Marshall.
Ok Shane, you might be from Illinois but at least Iowans can drive right
Iowa is better
4:27 their*  Edit: "(yeef)" -Shane 2021
The fact the titanic also sank on 1912 and this now like wow
did the dude use the bacon to pleasure himself with? I thought I remember hearing that
Because of you now I believe in ghosts and spirits
you guys are so fuckign cringe , the topic is cool but you guys are make it unbearable
9:05 I THINK they should do a control test to see if this is the case.
Shane- HEY FUCKO😂😂
Personally I feel like Shane & Ryan where a lot funnier under BuzzFeed. I’m not sure if it’s because their jokes seemed more natural here or the writers at BuzzFeed wrote their scripts. Now that they have their own channel “watcher” it feels like they are trying too hard & their jokes are forced.
Skidmore isn't that far away from Villisca.  Just sayin'...
i live a little less than half an hour away from there, very interesting
It could have been the town marshal trying to cover his fingerprints, that’s why he let the residents hold the axe
9:28 when you hit your toe on the coffee table
How is the flashlights action of turning on and off on command not proof enough for Shane? I mean they aren't your butlers to do it the moment you say 3..2..1 :P but they still got it almost right immediately. Why else would 2 perfectly charged flashlights turn on and off like that so many times almost on command?
Ryan is one of the most fearful ghost hunters alive!
My freind proposed this therory, and I gives me chills. She proposed the thery that he was under the influence of something demonic, which would explain the stop me. Also Demons have ties to pigs aka bacon. The covering of everything, would demonstrate that they were ashamed of what they did. As an Iowan,  we dont have many murders like this, and when I went to visit, me got better detail of the crime. Its truly sad what happend.
I'm genuinely curious, how do Shaniacs explain the flashlights turning on and off on their own?
Watching these with Shane pisses the ghosts off in my house, so these are kind of funny to watch
Shane will always provide me serotonin
Respect to the camera man
can you do Lizzie Bordon case
You cant be so specific.  Gotta give them time. It takes energy, I think.👻
I wish I could be as skeptical as Shane!!!💜👻
Sounds like the Marshall did it and contaminated evidence on purpose
Having it be exactly the same makes it a lil creepier. Back in the day I think people weren't as big as they are today either
Back in the day the wood might not have been as loud
Buzz feed Ryan and Shane  Want is your scary moment  And went is your favorite place to be in ghost  Shane single  Are have a moment place that you like go 👻🏰👍😱
Buzz feed You guys are a ghost and Ryan Shane want are you in ax murder house  I hear light turn off  By ghost turn one off  I saw the light turn on by ghost
I listen to too much LPOTL. I was waiting for a "NEERNANEERNANEER" whenever somebody said "with an axe"
Why the hell are those flashlights turning on and off in general? I've never had a flashlight that randomly switches off on a regular basis. Are broken flashlights standard tools in ghost hunting?
the “Here comes the spirit box!” brought me so much joy
It seems to me that the crime was personal because of the weapon used. This person was filled with rage and they seemed to know when they would be home that they waited in the attic. Another reason I think it was personal was because they seemed to show remorse for what they did to their victims by putting cloth on them to cover their faces. They also stuck around the house after the crime. They seemed to know the house and were comfortable inside.
As an Iowan, I'm so happy that you guys did this case!
I like how this series is a good mix of comic relief and really fricken scary, I mean Shane should be a comedian.
Do the oklahoma girl scout murders! they're still unsolved!
When your watching this in the middle of the night for inspiration for a school short story
"Their lives were shockingly cut short" Bro i cant with these puns anymore
Shane with his mustache reminds me of Jim Carrey, specifically as robotnik and idk why
I went to middle school about a block away from there
It could b because of local radio stations but …the “hard to stop” had a heavy Iowan accent which is freaky
The fact that I just learned they were in Iowa? Damn.
Illinois FOR THE WINNNNNNNNNN
Omg when I started this video, all the lights went out...
so I just recently just rewatched this and just noticed something. Around the 17:00-17:45 mark is you listen super careful you can hear a "help me Ryan pr Ryan help me". I dont know if it's Shane messing around but I only heard it wearing headphones.
R Ty Ty t try red AC
That bacon wrapped up is really dark
[9:07] Shane:*trying to explain the thing about flashlight*    Ryan:but unicorns arnt real......but ghost are real        Shane:*INHALES*            Shane:*SCREAMS IN DEMON*
the fact my name is lena 😂😂
I looked up this place and it's only 3 blocks from a middle school. 😬
Did anyone mention and/or notice that Ax is misspelled...should Axe!?!?! Or is there something I'm missing?
He was definitely stealing that bacon, but forgot it...
the axe murders were in 1912, yet 21:00 says that there was putty in his hands, putty wasnt invented till 1943!!!
I think the brother did it, cause he can easily get in the house with the key's, he would know their daily routine and be able to time it perfectly, and he might have been extra aggressive with the father because he didn't like him, or he was jealous that he got with the wife and not him, and it would explain why he will have been able to go about the house so we'll knowing where everyone was, and why he put a sloth over their heads, and he might have made the dinner and stuff to feel like he had a real meal with the family before going, but I'm not a psychologist or anything, so take my opinion on a serious level
So imagine you are a ghost. Your death is a spectacle, but people come and try to talk to you now and then... Then some guy walks in, and keeps yelling for your murderer while simultaneously talking about how the murder was unsolved. i.e. why would the murderer be haunting that location?
I have a theory:  What if the murderer was someone close to the family and was invited to their house? The murderer might've used some kind of untraceable poison in their food/drink which settled in and knocked most of the family out in their sleep. Except for Lena, who didn't have as much as the rest of the family. After the murderer did whatever he did, he covered up the mirror because he was superstitious.  Anyways, as a Boogara myself, I don't think this house is haunted. There's a lack of strong/clear evidence that can show proof of ghosts.  Also, 1912 really was NOT the year. Villisca Ax Murder House, Titanic sinking...
Don't believe the killer left the house because they were tied to both families. Seems odd to kill 2 girls just staying over. My theory is the family just about to go for an evening stroll. When someone came to visit (maybe to check on the girls) They offered to make supper upon returning. The family then head to bed as said person cleans up. Both husbands did have shonky business deals and both families had religious beliefs that were putting a strain on local townspeople. Still begs the question who but think it lies within both the families.
My question is why would you be doing your laundry at 5:00
Wish yall would come back😞
I'm kinda surprised no one's mentioned this but in the Victorian era, it was common practice to draw the curtains and cover the bodies after death. They would also cover mirrors to prevent spirits from being "trapped in the looking glass". They murders were only a decade after Victoria died, so the practices were likely still common, even in America. If anything, it sounds like the murderer did these funerary practices to prevent the spirits from coming after them.
i was born a few hours from this house!!
i do wonder why the ax killer stayed and continues to haunt the house?!.
That woman who lived next door definitely must've heard something, summertime, those two houses were very close, but obviously I don't blame her, what's she going to do, I'm sure she had nothing idea what was happening other than some screaming, especially the two little girls sleeping over, one of them hid in a closet and was pulled out and attacked, it's hard to believe they didn't get the guys who did this, everybody knew everybody in all town like that, no proof or evidence, so sad, my heart goes out to the innocent victims. 🙏
submissive and breedable? no no, vulnerable and whackable 28:25
You are idiots to play with other people's tragedy!!!
I've been there before!
"Hey Fucko"
Eight... he said eight when shane and yran were in the attic. Maybe referencing the eight lives that were taken that day?
Dose anyone else see the guy laying on the bed @ 31:23 ? Or is it just me.
I don't get why Shane doesn't believe there are ghosts when they have had several flashlight incidents in the past! Also, anyone sus the marshall? Weird thing he did to let that many people in and out and actually play with the crime scene. Seriel killers like to return to the scene of the crime and taunt the public.
I’ve been here
The ghost the you Ryan heard that said one probably means how many killers where on the house and when you 8 it meant how many people where killed
I do live in Iowa in the house but we are poor because I didn't realize their was a murder house 🏡🏡🏡😂😂😂😂 but I fell bad for the People that were murder but was Iowa was billed in 1850 or something like that I was born in 2009 but u guys I am your biggis fan of all up u guys and Shane is funny because he makes me laugh 😂😸😂😸😸😸😸 all the time but sometimes when I go to bed it make me scared 😨😨😨😨😨😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳 all the. Time
"How loud is it in Iowa?" I cracked.
as a native of Iowa... how dare you be so right. Iowa is filled with wackos' man, I'm telling ya.
unrelated but that is a GORGEOUS house
how does shane just not care?
Again your absolutely wrong about the flashlight. The point of gapping them to the point of just Barely turning on is the energy from the spirits closing the circuit using there energy which in turns allows the light to turn on and off on command. It’s a very easy tool for spirits to use 🧐😤🙄 y’all have got to learn what things are used for. You can’t just misinform people all the time
Love your videos
It's so annoying when ppl act like your arrogant because you prescribe to proven scientific and psychological phenomenal and not ghosts 🙃  It's called Pareidolia. It is a common human tendency to try to make sense of the nonsensical. Especially when your literally using inductive logic to prove ghosts exist. It's the same logic behind seeing faces in toast just with noise. The "voice" is a natural sound our brains rewire into one thing or another that makes sense to us like "yanny" or "laurel". Like "what else could it be" is just lazy. Especially when it is a recognized physiological phenomena.
18:36 The ghost that moved the bed be like: "Yo i would but your tall friend weighs like a ton compared to your little mouse body, ryan"
The good old attic home of the insane axe murder pictures anyone
2750, am i the only one who genuinly doesnt believe that shane is a non believer, whether he truely isnt or has been told to act like it, he can tell by his genuine reactions sometimes u can tell he is scared, and or 50/50
the sound when Shane jumped lmao. if this was a movie, he would have made a hole in the floor, and later when running out of the house for his life, he would have accidentally stepped in the hole and tripped. door slams shut, he gets dragged away at high speed, cut to black screen, and credits roll.
What is in the corner of cameraman screen during the scenes in the kids room? It is a Black spot with a pink spot inside of  it. I don't think it is anything supernatural. I just think is little werid and funny. I can't laughing evertime I saw it
19:30 shane gets possessed by a minecraft villager
...The bed straight up moved O_O
i love how though your in an EXTREMELY active house- your still cracking jokes and messing with the spirits 😭
There is something at the thing looking like a clown?
Someone's reflection was there mirror beside shane bruh!!!! that freak meh out
Having watched so many of these, this is the episode that really got under my skin. That house does NOT pass the vibe check.
Shane: "if you're the killer" *cuts to ad* "if you're always traveling, get venture one capital card!"
I feel like that EVP was one of the clearest you’ve ever found.
it might just be me, but when the murderer was saying 'stop it' and 'stop me', im almost certain i heard the words 'it won' shortly after from the spirt box, this makes me wonder if the killer had mental health issues and perhaps a voice or hallucination continuously bothered them with intrusive thoughts until they snapped and couldnt take it anymore, they seem genuinely sorry as well so i wonder if it was indeed psychological issues that prompted this killing spree anyway, have a good day
does anyone else ever wonder if the spirit box hurts them, because i remember a handful of the spirits/entities saying  over the years things like 'stop it' and 'please stop'. i wonder if it hurts or stresses them trying to use the spirit box
I’ve heard theories that the murderer hid inside the attic. There were cigarette butts found inside next to an old wooden chair.   That’s the most terrifying part to me. The killer was waiting in the house the whole time and nobody realized.
The axe mark in the wall is creepy
Ryan: Unicorns aren’t real. And ghosts are real  Shane: *Calls upon the demons of hell*
You guys should've used the estes method, sam and colby got some really good results
How did Sara not wake up when her husband was being killed???
What if . . . the ax murderer was a woman. That attic was tiny, a full grown adult male isn't going to want to spend a lot of time there hiding. And if it was a woman it would make more sense why they didn't bring their own ax, and left the ax there - because a woman walking around carrying a random ax would garner slightly more attention than a man walking around with an ax. Plus all of the things about the crime scene that point towards the murderer feeling remorse.  It's just a thought
Gengpuaka hadir
27:56
Whoa that “what is it” voice pick up was super clear!!! Spooky….
Shane is in the closet just chilling , suspicion confirmed !
If I was a spirit I wouldn’t want to communicate or listen to idiots like these people they have 0 respect for what happened inside this home and shouldn’t be allowed to “tour” this home with the amount of disrespect they have towards these spirits. ESPECIALLY because they’re in where the younger girls slept saying sexual stuff DISGUSTING
i think they're saying apple tater
*ryan about to close the door in the closet to lock shane* Shane: “hey...😞”
I saw someone saying there was seminal fluids on the bacon?????? Tf????????
The best and scariest episode. I definitely wouldn’t have the guts to go in there! Every fact literally gave me the chills. 🥶
I heard that when people died somtimes they would cover the mirrors so the spirit wouldn't get trapped
Yo he was sexually pleasuring himself with the bacon after he killed them lol that was proven did you leave out that evidence on purpose?
Probably their brother did it or a neighbour ...... but yeah like always unsolved crimes are the police not handling evidence properly
Giant murder sign right out front. Wtf 😒
FYI: The bacon was thought to be used as a makeshift vagina. Lena's butt was pulled towards the side of the bed indicating the perp was looking at her
You guys are starting to look like dad's with that facial hair.
I don’t claim any negative energy from this video 🙏🏻✝️
Shane's not wrong about Iowa being haunted. There's no worse hell than being trapped in Iowa for eternity, after all.
Theory on the flashlights: the ghost is colorblind.
All it sounds like is that the killer saying he is helpless and couldn't stop himself from killing and maybe one victim wanting help.
“No, i’m in the closet” same 🏳️‍🌈
quality as always but they need to replace them damn batteries already
Dude at 32:25 someone is behind you and its terrifying
Do you think that Ryan stands in front of the mirror every morning and gives himself a little pep talk? I can just imagine him staring at his reflection and pointing and being like "You ARE one of the most feared ghost hunters alive."
I feel like someone needs to cross these spirits,especially the murderer, over to the light.
I’m from iowa Go fly a kite
The covering up the mirrors is a common Irish catholic funeral tradition. Comes from the whole "If a spirit sees itself in a mirror, it becomes a ghost." Maybe he didn't want to be haunted?
The bacon wrapped in a towel just remind me of "Pigs in a blanket" which might have been a convoluted way at insulting those girls by calling them "Pigs"
I've just got to ask...did anyone else listen to the Morbid podcast episodes before seeing this and therefore have a completely different conclusion on what happened ??
If I were violently murdered in my home, I would feel very disrespected if my murder were used to turn my home into a spooky tourist trap.  I guess that's sufficient motivation to haunt the place, though.
I am going to say that it was a local official because nobody would ever let anybody else get close to the house and he let anybody Touch the acks because he was really trying to too erase the evidence of the murder I wonder if he was ever question in the way he allowed everyone else that showed up and he should have been question
Next time i tell Alexa to turn off the lights, I better be sure it's Alexa and not something else, Ufffff
It was the lil old neighbor lady. No mystery here.
October 23rd: “no one can split us up” November: “this is the last episode of buzzfeed unsolved”
Every investigation I see of this place the evidence always includes a man asking people to stop him. I have a feeling the killer was so lost to madness that he was outside himself. I almost feel like those responses come from him watching himself commit the crime. So much adrenaline and pure madness that time was distorted, his view of self was distorted, he was outside himself. He covered any reflection and couldn’t bare to look at any human face. The rush of the kill terrified him as much as it thrilled him. He had no control and he submitted to that, he let himself be consumed. But that’s just my own opinion.
So the killer even ate a meal. So many fingerprints and dna there to use. I feel its weird that the dad was the only one killed with the blade too. Also why would the ghost of the killer be in the home unless they died there? Definitely a head scratcher
Shane: Turn off that sexy little black flashlight Ryan’s Face* 10:07 😂
I have a theory…I think the town marshal did it…think about it no sane person would’ve allowed the whole town to look at a bloody crime scene and handle the evidence and murder weapon as though it was a museum. I don’t have a motive but just the fact that he did that says to me he was possibly trying to prevent investigators from finding out that he did it especially since forensics wasn’t as good then as it is now
"You do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe." PLS HE IS SO SWEET
Shane should have pretended to have died inside the house when he was in there lying alone and Ryan's reaction when he would find Shane lying on the ground not moving would have been amazing haha
when it says: stop me, help me and so on i think that the murderer feels bad for what he did and this also shows in the fact that he covered up the mirrors because he couldn't bear to see himself/herself do it, he also says "couldnt stop" implying that he wanted to stop. what do u think?
Investigators found blood on the arm, but no cut...she was likely killed while her head was on the pillow, and pulled down the bed after the killings were done. Blood above her knee on the left leg as well...
i was planning on going here for my birthday sense i dont live far and seeing them go here makes me want to even more  and also yes shane i can confirm iowa is haunted
Me as a ghost- “stop counting down, ur making me anxious man!”
Hi Ryan and Shane!! You've got a fan from Singapore! Love your unique antiques and fantastic chemistry!!
Sounds like " what is this "not it
Extra sauce in this one
If the masculine voice that said "hard to stop" was the killer it makes me wonder about his MO. Like that sentence sounds like his thinking was similar to the weepy voiced killer that just had a irrisistable compulsion to murder women with an icepick but felt great remorse for it. But with the causal way he smoked some cigarettes and fixed himself some food, it sounds like a sociopathic kind of thing like the Gary ridgeway the green river killer where he just was fucked up and wanted to, and once he started he wouldn't stop until the job was done. (Minus the sexual component). I think its more the latter probably, somebody who has a sadistic need for control and to impose his will onto others, and had an obsession with murder and carrying out a murder fantasy. And maybe in his post death clarity he covered them all with sheets after in his weird way of completing the ritual. And I bet he was the type of person who did it once and went the rest of his life without having to do it again. That happens with many unsolved murders that end up getting solved through DNA analysis. They did it once and never again. A sociopath is the type that would want to try it to see what it felt like and then maybe that was enough, or they decided they would rather not get caught than kill again.
I grew up in Iowa for 18 years of my life, and as a native Iowan I can confirm, yes, Iowa is haunted.
Would the murderer haunt the house? Wouldn’t it just be the family since they are the ones that died in the house? The women’s voice would be the wife, right?
"I'm just here to help."  "Can you give me my life back?  No?.....K, you can go now."
Maybe the Marshall did it. That's why he had everyone come in and touch the axe and destroy the crime scene evidence.
The" is this the killer, hey fucko " got me
What if it’s the Marshall? That’s why he let people hold the axe to hide his finger prints. Anyone else?
19:26 i hear avacado
I am a paranormal investigator with Iowa City Ghost Hunters. Iowa is haunted.
Tell Shane the reason the wind blows so much in Iowa is because Illinois SUCKS!
Why would the killers spirit be there?  It didnt make sense that they were trying to talk to them.
Honestly,  I hate it when Ryan will count down for the ghosts saying if they don't say anything he's gonna turn it off. That wouldn't make me wanna talk to him if I were a ghost.
Lol such obedient ghosts
can someone explain how the spirit box works
“You do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe”  Awww! 😍❤️Shane! That’s so sweet. Sarah is a lucky gal! ❤️ Rewatching this for multiple times😂i ran out of things to watch In Youtube
I don’t trust the spirit box but I find it incredibly interesting with the “what is it?” As it sounds like a women who has just woken up. The couple seconds of when you just wake up and don’t know what’s happening.   Reminds me a lot of when I would shake my mother awake. The raspy voice where you can hear pure confusion.   Made me form the storyline of the mother hearing something and then waking up and saying “what is it?” Expecting her husband to have already been awake and alarmed but she was killed before she entirely woke up.
I've been dreaming for this video to happen for so long, and this video exists, so I'm happy, and the part where Shane is screaming that the ghosts are real gets me.
Metaphorically ghost dildo😂😂
Stuff like murder cases and documentary’s aren’t scary to me, but when it comes to ghosts and paranormal stuff, count me out.
why do i watch these at 3am specifically
Didn't people still use bacon in attempts to help heal the body in some cases around this time? like raw bacon to help throats or something?? That was what came to my head about the bacon idk, maybe the kids were using it XD
iowa may be haunted but at least we’re not nebraska
That, "what is it" was super clear.
American hinterkaifeck
29:23 me returning letting people know how I am
Just imagine this whole series was a prank on Ryan
I can't believe they were 30 miles from where I live. This is crazy
to me, sam and colby clearly solved this
Wonderful video
Idk why but I feel like the town marshal did it. He let people hold the axe, which contaminating the evidence. With that in mind they could’ve figured out who did it if the townspeople didn’t touch the axe
Shane does indeed bring good vibes which does repel any negative presence, so chances of them talking to the killer were very slim ngl but yay! for Shane for being in good spirits 😂  (Sorry but not sorry for the pun)
Nothing happens to the camera man
The always do the flash light thing how uk it’s not staged
the fact it has been solved. I found out by my cousin who lives in Iowa
Absolutely love Unsolved and the Ghoul Bois but I cannot help but wonder why they thought the murderer’s spirit would be in this house? Wouldn’t it be wherever he died later in life?
I really do wish that you guys would leave that spirit box on for longer. I'm sure you'd get more out of it than giving them 10 seconds only and then hastily turning it off.
22:20 Sara LOL
This is gonna sound rather bizarre but because Peter Mueller was a serial killer who was responsible for murdering many families with an axe between 1892-1920, my original idea was the seemed responsible for this one. However, since the motive isn't directly clear, what if this family murder was a set of copycat killings?
17:17 find it hysterical someone put a Booh-Bah doll into the closet, a show that wasn’t made until 2003. Whoever looks after the house definitely just finds the most haunted looking toys possible for added effect.
I think this video is so fake
The caretaker seems suspicious
Got to think, Any possible link to the 1918 New Orleans ax murders? Snuck in at night attacking people with their own axes and other weapons and then leaving the weapon, just craxy theory just watch those two episodes back to back so seemed similar
The spirit box session in the attic had some of the most compelling evidence since the start of the series: the fact that the "I'm in here" was crystal clear and a direct and immediate answer to the question gave me chills, as did the fact that it answered the "what year is it" question with a number
as an iowa i personally have more beef with nebraska
He said "release me" and then "switch" meaning that he was playing a sexually submissive role but he is a switch and would now like to be released from his restraints so he can take on the more dominant sexual role. I recommend establishing a safe word before continuing the investigation.
I'm sure the house was a lot more sturdy whenever the murder took place that's why he could sneak around
I hear "pretty sweet" when you hear the "release me". Could it be that the murderer is proud of his work?
At 1:07 who was that in the mirror?🤕🤕🤕🙄
ghost is real i can see ghost
In 26:41 something moved on the left a few times
I thought all the kids was girls
lmaoooo ryan repeatedly saying that’s not true is killing me 😭
Im not sure if itz just me but at the end of the video where Ryan investigates individually, before he turns on the machine, there's a doll behind him, so i feel the doll changes it position before and after Ryan uses the machine
am i the only one that noticed that the EVP image was moving with his voice.
Honestly I'd by unicorns being real at some point (or a deformed horse) over ghost. It's just a horse with a horn😐
The flashlight turns on and off because of the heat from the lightbulb and things slightly swelling and then shrinking because of the lack of heat from the bulb.  Love the Ghoul Boys and can't wait for their new show, next year!!
@31:14 IT WORKED - He got through to Clint Eastwood #dirtyharry
I have a sort of theory that the killer not only still resides in the house, but they're in some sort of limbo where they're stuck killing the family over and over again. Endlessly. It would explain the responses: "It's hard to stop" "Stop me" and "Help me".  Perhaps now they're finally regretting what they did and they're begging to be released?
When someone dies in a home, it's thought to cover mirrors so they don't trap the spirits in them. Very old superstition, as mirrors are seen as gateways
You are loved by God no matter what you think or do trust that always,  seek him and you will find.  He can help anyone out of any situation. Amen✝️🤟🏻
the wrapped bacon immediately made me think they brought that in case the family had a dog
I love the boys so much for real! That being said this ghost kind of seems like a HACK. Okay seriously sorry sorry that's my last axe pun in the comments.
You guys should watch this.. SO much more evidence and suspects and SO MUCH MORE RESEARCH.. i like  vid as well but not much research is done as this one-  https://youtu.be/_nu1-II8klI
Could possibly be that the murderers ghost is haunting the house because either his sins or regrets are tying him to the house for all eternity being reminded of his past deeds.
Thought this was gonna be bout lizzie borden for a sec
9:28 me working on my anger management issues
the spirit box stuff is one of the more harrowing stuff on this show. yikes
Shane is not afraid of ghosts... Ghosts are afraid of Shane.
I've always thought that the covering of the mirrors could have been a clue that the murderer was Catholic.
Shane: You do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe.   That was cute, Shane. Good man 👍
I live in iowa how tf did i not know theres a famous axe murder near me😭
Bacon was probably brought there just in case their was a family dog in the house
I went here a couple years ago it was really crappy and I felt like people were just around me
no because the "what is it" at 14:48 took me out
"I'm in the closet. Just chilling." Me too, for like, 14 years.
I know the program is made so that one of them is skeptical but it becomes too much nonsense for me, it is annoying to watch and listen to,
this killer sounds alot like the family who was killed in same way at that farm ,you know where father saw footprints in snow coming out woods but not return ,he also suppose to be living in the attic ,one maid left has thought it ghosts and poor maid who started that day was killed with family ,after he piled them up in the barn , little girl was thought to be still alive for a while has clumps of her hair in her hand , but lot similarities, he never caught either
I love how these past years I am well fed with the right doses of Ryan and Shane. 😂😍
5 a.m DOING LAUNDRY!!?!
the police actually found seminal fluid on the bacon and one of the girls in that room had her underwear taken off and was posed by the killer. there was also a chair found facing the girls
Something cool -  There's a thing called Residual Spirits, residual energy; when a person exerts a lot of energy, normally very emotion moments, that energy kind of embeds itself in that moment and will express itself sorta like a ghost or spirit! Like spirits that haunt specific places, rather than people.
6:30 minute  mark orb coming out of Ryan's head????
A lot of this seems like it could be the murderer. He showed signs of regret and self hatred by covering mirrors and the bodies and a lot of the voices coming through are saying things like "stop me" etc 😳
“Im soooooooooo vulnerable right now, oh my goooood” 💀
Umm, there's actually an explanation as to why the bacon was there. It's actually very messed up. I can't even type it here.
im so confused how theyre not possessed yet
I live for reckless shave us
Obviously Shane yelling when Ryan proclaims unicorns aren't real was him hamming it up for the bit, but I LOVE the moment just after Ryan says it where you see him genuinely bluescreen
3:16 gorgeous spider
Saying the Marshal somehow contaminated the evidence by letting people handle the axe is a little funny like, it‘s not like they had any decent forensics back then lol. Like he shouldn‘t have done that it‘s majorly disrespectful, but it‘s not like anyone was gonna take dna samples or dust for prints back then, right?
Lol i realized this a month late for the postmortem, but there is a grieving tradition of covering mirrors. It was typically done to all the mirrors in a house when someone passes; IIRC it stems from a belief that the spirit could be trapped in a mirror and not pass on. It could have been the murderer in an weird act of mercy; it also could have been a towns person who was touring the house in the 3 hours till the scene was secured
I’m from Illinois too bc of Shane Iowa & I have beef also 😂🖕
At no point did anyone say axe you a question. Dislike.
This is probably my most favourite murder mystery stories.If I ever had to write my favourite murder I'd write about this murder definitely! Btw Shane is such a vibe.Gotta love that guy
1:28 I'm from Iowa :(
buzzfeed unsolved kept this video very family friendly however if you know the true detail about the bacon , shane wont be saying "yummy"  . research at your own risk .
this had the most evidence of anything they have found so far in my opinion
Nobody:  Shane: if you're the killer-  Ad: InTrOdUcInG aDvEnTeR x-
So when are they going to do a unsolved true crime of the villisca ax murder house? Who r potential witnesses and or suspects? Any theories??? Why just make it into a paranormal episode for if you guys don’t do a proper job bout it either
The stilinger girl actually had a lot of other things to have had happened. and the theory of why the bacon is there is messed up, so I won't get into it, but its gruesome.
Why would the murderer's ghost be hanging out in the house?
The fact that Shane is shitting on Iowa. I love it! Even as an Iowan, I love it!  Also my parents both grew up in Illinois, so I travel there every holiday.
I wonder if it was the Marshall, like how do you just leí people contaminate a severe crime scene like that? I'm almost positive it was like did this guy have an alibi?
sure he may have murdered that entire family with an axe, but the bacon almost makes up for it- who wouldn't want a massive strip of bacon.
shane: ryan is a big fan of your work.  ryan: that is not true.  shane: he is sicko just like you. ryan: that is not true.
Pls are we not gonna discuss ' ghost dildo' at 27.55?
The "stop me" and the "help me" sounded like different voices
The "stop me" and the "help me" sounded like different voices
23:00 Just to suffer? Every night i can feel my leg, and my arm, even my fingers
Ryan pretending to be brave is my new favourite kind of video
The covering of the mirror is what they used to do when people died to prevent the spirit of the person who died from being trapped in the mirror
Is it just me or I saw someone at the window
I got a geico add where angry birds where running into everything and people said atleast geico can cover it all but can it cover the birds ingerys
These 2 creep me out.
Please don’t stop making these videos, you guys are the best team ever! I’ve been watching you guys for years now and I will continue to do so, as long as you’re there 🤧❤️
Why do all horror stories include four children lmaoo
6:32-6:35 THE SPIRIT BOOOXXX!!! 😄
I’m iowan so the bashing Shane says is very true
For that Particular Murder case, covering of the mirrors and faces of the victims I'm pretty sure that means it was personal, the killer obviously knew their schedule, and they had keys to be able to get in and locked up before he left, I don't think the two girls that stayed the night were on the list but had to do it no witnesses plus it was dark and probably couldn't tell if it was the Moores children or not. MPO🤷‍♀️
19:25 it sounds more like "probably"
Okay so nobody's going to talk about Ryan's new affirmation this season "I'm not my fear, I'm stronger than my fear"
Disrespectful idiots
19:41 Patrick ??
To shed some light on the subject if you don’t know already but the bacon in the room was believed to be used by the killer to pleasure him self and no I’m not joking. Watch the podcast morbid cus they have a two part series where they go deep into this murder
As the video went on it made me think it was the dad more and more and he had a psycotic breakdown and then killed himself after realizing what hed done, even though he ended up liking it so much
@31:00 lmao 🤣
@27:01 I believe the killers spirit is still in the house for like an enteral punishment
No one suspected the guy that allowed the general public to populate the crime scene and handle the murder weapon???
The fact I live like an hour away…….
Magnitude of act of ghosts in history is always frightening than the time paranormal investigators visit the scene. It's like ghost who slaughtered 8 people without sounds trying to play with torch lights and making weird noices
The one thing I was confused about was that they kept trying to communicate with the murderer. Because why would his spirit be in this house? It would make sense to speak to the murder victims because they died there but the murderer probably wouldn’t be there.   (Obviously IF ghosts are real which is a big IF)
what if the town master did it and he intentionally let other people "contaminate" the evidence?
"I'll kill him" sounded like "I'll get one" to me 👀👀👀
Shane would be an awesome deacon in my Church. Anyone possessed would just walk out, instead of getting liberated 🤣🤣
I like how they misspelled 🪓 on the sign
I think the murderer did wake up someone though. Going by the slashes on her arm I think the killer woke up the wife trying to kill the husband. How he killed both the little girls sleeping over without waking the other up is a mystery. They mentioned they were in the same bed right?
Everytime Shane says "I'm Shane." I think of him going "Ich heiße Shane."
the way the responses on the spirit box are accurate tho and the fact that it's all the same voices except for the one who was asking for help  + i think the only thing why they can't hear most of the responses on the spirit box when it's picking up voices is because it's sitting close to them. they will probably hear the voices if they put it a few feet away from them
I think the covering of the mirror is because it's believed in some cultures that if someone dies in front of an uncovered mirror, their soul can be trapped within it as mirrors are seen as portals to the other side.
I can't get over the fact Shane is so tall that it looks like he's an actual giant going into a normal sized person's home lmao
shane...looks so hot !!
Considering this was the last ever season 6:08 really hits different
There’s a Reddit post on this saying how it was probably a group of people and the Marshall was in on it and it’s quite believe able
Now wait just a minute. How do we know that the mayor didn't do it? It would make sense as to why he would have everyone touch the axe. So everyone else fingerprints would overpower his.
"turn the blue flashlight on and turn the black flashlight off" The color blind ghost: 👁️👄👁️💧
We're just going to act like the flashlights turning on and off is no big deal?? 😂
Why would the ghost of the killer be in the house
I thought, briefly, I had imagined Shane and Ryan stopped doing this with buzzfeed…. I didn’t. And that era suuuucked.
What if the town Marshall was the killer, thats why he let everyone in the house to ruin the crime scene
I just love shane
What if the muderer was a spirit that possesed the weakest either the mother and killed the father then the kids thats why no one even the father woke up about it and killed itself
I love how much Shane despises the spirit box. Every single time made me laugh so hard.
when are we getting the (yeef) merch tho
idk how u two are so brave,,, i wouldve fainted in like 4 mins
shane is insane, indeed he is. but in the best way possible 🤝🏻😌
Y’all should come to Charleston job corps WV
The ghost: I'm miserable  Me who heard "I'm miscible": In what?  Also at the end I actually thought the ghost said, "Hit me" and not "leave me" but maybe that's just my own subconscious that's being violent.
It could be a murder suicid
(yeef) Took me out, wtf
Hey! Iowa! We never get any recognition XD  Love the hate Shane, appreciate that 😘
razor boys return!
I don't think that the person who did it enjoyed comminting the crime. The way he covered the victims' faces, and the fact the he also covered mirrors looks to me a sign that he personally knew the family. Covering the faces so he doesn't have to look at them and literally face what he have done. Covering the mirrors either to not look at himself, or because of the belief that mirrors might trap spirits, so he didn't want this family to be stuck there suffering even more.  Some might not believe in ghosts and be more on Shane's side here. But I'm a believer on the paranormal, and I'm standing on Ryan's side right now, because I'm gonna be talking about the voice on the spirit-box.  It's clearly a man's voice everytime. Not only that, but the same voice. It sounded to me as if the killer is trapped inside that house, either by choice as a self-punishment, or even as a divine one. He sounded distressed, and as he said it himself, helpless. Asking multiple times to help him, because he wasn't able to stop himself from doing what he did.  So I think it's safe to say that he probably wasn't mentally stable when he committed these murders. It was probably a moment of insanity when he did it. He also sounds as if sometimes he feels like he's living through that moment, and other times as if he's replying to Ryan directly, so in and out of this looping cycle. That's why I feel like it might be some sort of punishment, bc he sounds sorry and truly helpless.
y'all this was my family! my grandmothers maiden name is moore
That’s my family. I just found out today at thanksgiving. Pretty cool if you ask me
I love ya Shane but that mustache doesn’t flatter you
Why would the murderer still be there?
shane reminds me so much of sheldon
6:15 on the bes you can spot a blue bear with peace signs on it. I was looking at it and realized... I had the same build-a-bear that my brother game me-
Mini theory the Axeman came back for more killing
Also, the house was refurbished and rented out as a normal house, but the current owners bought it and un-refurbished it.
Imo they said they're parents names were "better middler"
31:57,  at 0.25 speed sounds a lot like ''save me''
Shane looks like a late 1880's American railroad magnate
Shane is giving me Daniel Day-Lewis from Gangs of New York but with snazzy blonde hair.
shane screaming about the maglight is me with anti vaxxers right now
19:05 what if the murderer, didn't actually wanted to kill them? Yeah I mean he killed 8 people but that makes sense (kind of)  The covered mirrors, so he didn't had to look at his self after  The "Stop me" could have be from the murderer, just like something told him to do so and he couldnt stop it or he just had to do it  (obv i'm not saying hes not guilty, but I think it seems intresting) + From what I remember, covering victims face can mean regret of your action.
I was hoping for this season that they'd add more equipments (EMF, SLS, Static Cameras, etc) rather than just relying on a spirit box, two flashlights and "claimed voice recorder" that was left in a room since that's so easy to fake. meh... still a great season tho.
i question why i'm scared at night but constantly rewatch these videos at night
Wait wait... this is a Buzzfeed Unsolved True Crime crossover! Also, are you guys not, yourselves, a parade of onlookers poking around the house and examining the axe damage?
I wonder if he put up the sheets to prevent the spirits of the murdered from getting caught in them, it’s a common myth that mirrors can hold/trap souls after all
Im just not understanding why nobody  was able to get away, impossible someone would have had to heard something this is very bizarre
Shane is not a hard skeptic anymore and Ryan is braver. They've come a long way<3
Killed in their bedrooms with no one noticing?  Never in my life, have I been so happy to sleep with my sisters and parents in the same bedroom with the door locked.
I love the pictures
Since they didn’t mention it here or in the post mortem I’m pretty sure that the covering of the mirrors is some sort of cultural thing because some people believe that there mirrors trap spirits so when someone dies they cover the mirrors so that their spirit can move on
Maybe it was the Town Marshall??? He let everyone contaminate the crime scene to cover his actions??? 🤷🤷🤷 Covering up the faces suggest that he knew them personally.
When it comes to the flash lights I think you need to be more specific but with less descriptors, such as blue and black. Why do we think spirits see in color when color is something our physical brains process. But really I know nothing about ghosts and believe in them half heartily I just think maybe you're not thinking like a ghost. 🤣
1:26 me from iowa: 🧍🏻‍♀️
yooooooooo kindred spirits!
Mrs Moore: "What *is* this thing?  The most human reaction, it's kind of heartbreaking
Why don't they freak oh over the flashlight?!?!? How does that JUST happen?!?
I remember watching a history channel ghost hunters episode on this when I was like 7
I'm studying this case an i believe there was more then 1 person that committed this crime an a woman was involved as well this case gets me to this day. thanks for your videos love it :) an i believe in spirits. I know there is
Creepy place. The killer rode the railroad. About ten miles away is a house that was a hotel and also had murders in. One theory I'd it was a hobo that did the murders in both towns. Perhaps even more along that rail line!?
Ryan looks soooooooo terrified in the house alone
Y
Observe viewer here! Gotta say I love these guys! I actually have never been interested in ghost hunting shows because they always play it up for views. But after seeing these two on observe I have finally found a supernatural/true crime duo I enjoy watching!
what if the murderer was the family's relatives or friends? They asked him/her to stay for the night. Hence there wasn't any sign of distress nor forced entries.
"One of the finest cities in the state" Shane: That's not saying much
i spent the night here once, found it a very cozy little house. nothing weird.
As somebody who has live in Iowa my whole life, Half the town contaminating the crime scene really shows that people in Iowa haven't changed one bit. I could honestly see something like that happening here today.
What would Shane do if a ghost actually listened to all these things he's been telling them to do to him?  Probably be like oh crap! 😂
“Stop it” “Stop me” “Help me” sounds like a conversation between the killer and one of the victims
To do ghost stuff and to hunt for them they need to get the right kind of gear and they don’t have that
that’s a new one… (yeef)
shane: so let's see if i end up in a puddle of my own bloood!!. LMAO HAHAHA
The covering of the mirrors and faces feels very much like a superstition thing to me
One of these days we're gonna be watching Shane yuck it up outside with the camera crew, and we'll see Ryan tossed through a window like a rag doll in the background. Lol
Just what I took from this investigation. On the spirit box, I heard one similar voice coming up consistently. Saying similar things, in different rooms. Phrases like “ can’t stop “, “help me”, “ im miserable “ said over and over makes me think they weren’t talking to a family, they were speaking to a regretful spirit of a murderer, trapped on earth.
Who the killer? You have to find out
Who kill the eight people?
This is an hour from my house!!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
My birthday nov 7 😛😛
There was a boobah in the closet. Does anyone else remember that show from childhood? They were pretty scary looking back at it
as an Illinoisan I think we can all agree that we really all hate Indiana
Unless the murderer died on the premises why would his/her spirit be there ?
Just discovered these two lol I dare you to go to England and the borley rectory chapel.   Or Edinburgh vaults.   I’ve been.   I got pushed and recorded noise we didn’t hear through ears.
Haha y'all weren't talking to the family in that kid's bedroom. That was 100% the murderer
“Let’s see if I end up in a pool of my own blood” 😂😂😂😂😂😂 so meme-able
You never know a man can't murder without breakfast
I wish shane taunted the killer by saying "You know what? I think you're just a big pansy, a coward. You committed all of the murders while they were defenseless and asleep, didn't even kill them head on, thats really disappointing."
for some reason i thought last season was your last season so i un subed o.o almost missed this
Ghosts: silent   Shane: SPIT IN MY MOUTH
he's inshane , man
omg tbe pillow literally inflated by itself lol!!
The ghost playing with the flashlights Uhm…I’m colourblind
Why would the killer be there???
Ryan " Well unicorns aren't real, ghosts are real" Shane " ARRRRRGHHHHHH!!!"  Pretty much sums up their relationship in a nutshell. time stamp 9:28
ryan’s gotten more aggressive when he goes by himself because either 1. he wants that damn evidence or 2. he’s trying to hide his fear for the last season
I find it hilarious that Ryan counts from 5 to 0, nothing happens, Shane goes "Okay, that light better be off in 3..." **light goes off**
I know this is the last season but can you please watch Netflix series “Hunted” episode “Hunted by Henry” 🙏🏾 and please go to the house to see if “ghost are real”. Pretty please 🥺 with a cherry on top 🍒
Shane reminds me of professor lupin
I like to think Shane can actually see ghosts, he just likes to mess with Ryan
The Stillinger girls are my relatives.
I'd say forensics could estimate the height of the killer if they had the measurements of the ax from the dent in the bedroom wall. Unless this happened from the ax slipping out of the hands from being bloody and slippery, flying from the hand into the wall. If it were from a backward swing then the height might be determined.
The spirits of the family are not in that house. Nor the murderer. No, there’s just straight evil in there and it’s messing with anyone who goes looking for it.
As I'm studying psychology I would say there should be an experiment ,like we can take 2 groups of people 5 of them will be the ones who knows everything about the murders and 5 will be totally unknown to the murders ,we can make them stay at that house over a night and can ask their experiences the next morning , results will be a lot different. Because not everyone in the world knows about every haunting place in the world . So subjects should be randomly picked from different countries .also we can decide the gender of the subjects whether to put all females or males or mix their age and skeptics and believers that can affect the experiment a lot .
there are no ogs watching this because we’re all in denial it’s ending so we watch all their videos.
Ya’ll June 10 is my birthday 😰😰
fun fact: when a murderer covers the face of their victims it usually means they know who they are on a personal level. It also explains why they covered the mirror so they didn't have to see it but also for the time period - when a death happened in the family people covered the mirrors and closed the curtains when in mourning.
Just incase no one knows or its buried in the comments, they now think it was a serial killer. See Bedtime Stories' video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvjY67JUuM4&ab_channel=BedtimeStories
This is addressed to everyone here who ascribes any technological efficacy or functional legitimacy to the so-called "spirit boxes". I suspect that the marketers of these devices correctly presuppose that people will only employ them when in a reputedly haunted place which would ostensibly be suitable and conducive to purposes of receiving communications or transmissions from ghostly phenomena. If you want to test the absurdity of the hypothesis that such devices confirm the existence of the paranormal than just activate it while at Walmart or some other obviously banal place that has no infamous reputation and I can almost guarantee that you will encounter the same sort of transmissions, or whatever you want to call the noise emissions from this device that you would, had you been in some allegedly haunted place. And I will also add that ghosts and the entire edifice of the supernatural are merely a byproduct of the fallibility, credulity and pervasive stupidity of most human beings who lack the capacity to properly discern the true causes of that which they misconstrue as validating their absurdist phantasies.
I wouldn't tell the spirits that you are there to help them because in all reality you're just there to see if they exist. So be honest about it with them, you may get better responses. Don't offer help if it isn't the truth.
Shane looks so old
someone explain the bacon please
people can be so evil, disgusting
I always wonder about the logic I doubt the murderer died there so why do ppl always think the killers spirit is there
Plot twist: the marshal was the killer 👀
That house desperately needs some wd-40.
Guys say makeup is witchcraft but I say facial hair is witchcraft. It completely changes the face. 😂😂
I love this channel so much
If you slow it down to 0.25x speed at 17:40 it looks like the bedding at the head of the bed Ryan is sitting on starts getting pulled upward. Or maybe that’s just the light? Dunno. Kinda weird.
Would love when they go to the Lamb house where really every day something paranormal is going on, and shake hands with Shadow dude... 😁👍🏼
Well it's in Iowa so....ya know....
im with shane.. i hate the spirit box bs..
I had to rewind and listen to Ryan’s “f**k me” 3 times when it all went dark. Laughed so hard
25:53 i thought the creaking of the door was something outside my window my heart literally stopped
So what’s the consensus on who’s saying all these things on the mike when they are trying to talk to the ghosts??? Someone please explain? Is that real or just gimmicks ?
What if the sherif did it on purpose? It was either them or someone they knew and thus let everyone tamper with the evidence.
Ha I have the same name as the father
I think the “help me” was the dad/husband again because he wants Ryan and Shane to help him stop the k!ller and then the k!ller again said “stop me”
I think the “ill k!ll him” and ‘stop it’ was maybe the husband/dad trying to stop Ryan and Shane the way he couldn’t stop the k!ller and then the ‘stop me’ was probably the k!ller
I think the “what is it” sounded like a woman like maybe the wife/mom?? The “hard to stop” sounded like the killer
The fact that the murderer covered the mirror makes it more mysterious,  in Philippines we believed that mirrors should be covered when someone passes away for they can trap energies.
I love how ryan automatically knows shane is going to mess with some spirits lol
the reason why he covered the mirrors might be he wants the victiums to suffer all eternity in that house remembering what happened over and over again,covering mirrors is covering the portal to the other world,wich closes the portal to the other side,therfore,he trapped their spirits in the house with the intent of tourturing them for all eternity
A great ghost story but all bs.  Great entertainment but hate to bust u but there r no ghost spirits etc.  U played great voice and bed move mechanical fun
30:57 Ryan sounded so much like Usopp
I remember reading once that it was once believed that mirrors could absorb a person soul post death, thus making a ghost stuck in the mirror so they had to be coved to prevent that. Maybe whoever did the deed believed this and covered the mirrors to prevent ghosts that could identify them
Shane is way to funny😂😂
thats bad and everything, but the worst jumpscare came at 15:33 when that manequin stared at shane. bro, my heart lept up and summersalted
I believe youre talking to the killer. with shane making fun of him like that "stop it!", he couldve been a very emotional person driven over the edge. perhaps the covering of the mirrors and faces was so that he couldnt see the evil he just caused. locking the door after his meal couldve been to make him feel like it was a regular day for him and that he didnt just kill people. when he says "stop me" i believe thats a sign of guilt
Shane holding the box like is ewww lol
Shane: if you're the killer turn the left flashlight off  Killer: *tries to mess with Shane by flickering and then turns off* Shane: ok so the killer is here *non chalantly*  Bro Shane omg I woulda 🏃🏾‍♀️
Why did Shane lean in like that when Ryan said "Let's get into it."-
maybe the covering faced and mirrors was a richard ramirez sort of thing where he/she just didnt want to see?
"Let's party folks, except the murderer. We do not want to party... with you."
So nice of Shane to not only make his girlfriend feel save but Ryan too, by scaring the ghosts so much that they even want Ryan to leave. You just gotta love wholesome demon boy. :)
Bacon in blanket- pig in blanket maybe a reference to the family members murdered in there beds
shane should dress up as edgar allan poe next halloween
How about we add 2 more persons who aren't skeptics and who aren't really believe in ghost. I mean, isn't the ghost/demon going to be liked this. Demon: Let me possess the tall guy. Nope, not gonna happen. Too many demons in line. How about the mi- Goddamn censor.."  Seriously, I'm  mi-. Damn censor. How about going global?  Believed me when I say, people will let them you guys eat and sleep for free just to prove their hauntings.  #BooGara #Shainaics #BUN #BUNGlobal
Who goes into a house and say allat? Plus I don’t think think the killer was there, but they wanna leave soul wise
as a shaniac, this was a pretty interesting one, good job
Mary Peckham is a Marites 😂😭
Wasn’t it a theory that the killers covers the faces, mirrors, and windows so the spirits couldn’t leave?
Shane: "AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!"
After all this time. I truly think Ryan is a non-believer
To disrespectful
I feel if the family manifested when you guys were in the house shane would be in the corner with a beer and one of the family members like "so whats it like being a ghost?" While Ryan is screaming his head off trying to hide 😂👏
Did this ever do Mary King's Close in Edinburgh Scotland? I don't think it has. Would recommend for haunted places. I know two people personally who ent there and had experiences. My mum actually was the producer who scouted the place for the BBC and that's how it became famous. Also, I will swear that Savannah Georgia, may be one of the most haunted places. I had an experience with my mother there. Some ghost took a liking to me as I was back home at night. It was raining too. It was so archetypical ghost story. I was only in Savannah for one night and I had quite a freaky experience.
The Spirit Box is the most annoying thing ever.
Imagine sending your kids to stay the night and they get murderdd
Those with spiritual believes about mirrors and windows would cover them because they either thought their image would be trapped in the mirrow/window or something evil is following them and they don't want to let the evil in. But also someone who has mental instabilities can be psyched out by mirrors and windows thinking their souls will get trapped or someone/something is talking to them through it. 🤷‍♀️
With Ryan's comment about him thinking Shane is the type of person to sleep with windows open and stuff, that's the way my boyfriend is. He lives in a trailer, so he's on ground level right near the woods that he actually had someone follow him through until he booked it to his house, plus he has an old neighbor who sneak around the woods. Yet he decides it's perfectly safe to sleep right next to a his large open window, which is literally right next to his bed where he could roll out if he wasn't careful
WHY ARE WE NOT FREAKING OUT ABOUT THE BED MOVING ON ITS OWN??? this is the best evidence we’ve found so far
As a iowan i can confirm, all of iowa is just haunted
y’all ever think ghosts get tired of being asked to turn on/off lights? like they be sitting there like “that’s all everyone ever wants from me :(“
"You do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe" - said every guy in a horror movie before he got killed for going downstairs to investigate a noise🤣
It's a shame forensic toxicology tests weren't developed at the time, I think a few years too soon, could be wrong. I wonder if the family were drugged before being murdered so that no one would wake up or struggle..but then that doesn't make sense because one of them did resist.
So let's see if I  ended up in a puddle of my own blooooodddd 🤣🤣
I'm sorry but the "what is it" genuinely frightened me
17:15 "oh! there's more ppl in here" 🤣
Even though some of the words didn't make sense, the voice was consistent
As a Nebraskan, I 100% agree with Shane’s judgement of Iowa
I don't believe in ghosts, but I am scared of being at a murder scene in the middle of the night
"You do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe"  Awww I can't ❤
Maybe it was the townsperson dude or whatever. And that's why he let everyone hold the axe 💁‍♀️
9:30 I could feel Shane's rage hahhahahah
Kinda hard for them to catch a ghost when they have a literal demon along with them 😂
Yeahhhhhhh there's alotta turf out there
Is no one gonna talk about how the murderer fuckin made themselves breakfast 💀
Couple of frat bros checking out haunted houses.
They are really straight up taunting the ghosts at this point 🤣🤣
That blue-walled room reminds me so much of my childhood bedroom. It's making me feel all warm and cosy. My room was also a bit haunted.
Torches don't turn off and on every minute , I've never had a torch that turned its self off and on
why would you assume the killer's spirit is there? this episode is just way too real, i appreciate the banter and humour but it just didn't sit well. maybe it's the only episode in which the victims were children?
Question for the people who believe these places are haunted (I do): Why do you think nothing happens to Shane, but Ryan picks up on a lot? You think it's bc Shane chooses not to see? I would imagine some of the evil entities would love to attack him in some way or another, but it never seems to happen. Maybe the fact that he's highly skeptical protects him somehow?
That little quote about "putty in his hands" makes no sense since that phrase wasn't coined until 12 years later in 1924, it's just strange that a murderer from 1912 would use that phrase
Did anybody notice the windows in the upstairs rooms. High hopes.
LMAOOO this duo is HILARIOUS. "See if you can do the same waaacck!" LMAOOO
27:19 :)
I really like/support the theory that it's the same person that carried out the Hinterkifect murders. I don't remember who I heard the theory from but the way it was explained it was very convincing.
Shane gives me confidence that I can make it through a haunted house 😂❤️
I wish Ryan would use the Oculus more
"Nah I'm in the closet, just chillin' " Felt that Shane
8:28 “cut short” literally 💀
As someone living in Iowa.   I can confirm that Iowa is indeed haunted.
"Im so vulnerable"  Me: i like them submissive~
Materialism is degeneracy.
The marshall was the one who murdered them, that's why he allowed everyone to handle the axe and contaminate the evidence
I actually love the spirit box. Not because it's particularly truthful, but its just another cool interaction with the environment
I think the ghost was just saying he wanted to play the Nintendo switch with the boys. They should’ve brought Mario party or something
I literally love this show so much I wish they would keep making it
I imagine the axe murderer returning home and being devastated that he forgot his bacon.
stay in the amityville house
Metaphorical ghost dildo😂😂😂😂
I just noticed a light flashing on and off on the left during 32:13
as a minnesotan, I agree with this Iowa slander
Nah nah nahhhhh the vibes in the attic were off I was unsettled the entire time they were up there
If you pause around 3.18 the amount of face it looks like looking out at you 🙀🙈💩💩
i love how ryan went from that little paranoid little man years ago to this brave almost skeptic man
Shane vs the super natural whose gonna win lol he’s always talking smack about the ghosts
Ill forever share shanes skepticism about ghosts but his approach to all this is so hilarious that i want to keep watching 😂🤣🤣
What if it wasn’t like any of the suspects but it was Josiah’s mistress that he cheated on Sarah with?
Any chance the sheets by the mirror was put there by the family themselves? I'm asian and my family covers any mirrors reflecting the bed because it believed to be bad luck.  Also what if the responses that sounded like "stop me" and "I'm miserable" was the killer itself? Maybe he's finally seen the fault of his way?
I don’t know if it’s just me a couple seconds before 26:45 in the video or a bit before as Shan’s sitting u Can see like a shadow thing like go bye on his left
Maybe the ghost is worried about being called a racist, you should call the flashlight *African-American color*  prob would have done it right away but you didn't word it right
Flashlights turn off and on...  Ryan- "it feels like we're alone in here" 😂
ive always wondered why the flashlights keep turning on and off whenever they ask the “ghosts” to do so. anyone has a logical explanation for those?
Sounds like the town marshall was the killer if you ask me
Shane boo, unicorns are real! They just got fat and people started calling them rinos instead.XD
Them antagonizing any potential spirits like that is gonna end badly someday
bacon wrapped in dish towel? my thoughts: someone who hated the family was calling them pigs in a blanket.
This is so hard to watch. These guys are not funny at all. Not sure why they would say their lame jokes in the middle of the show.
i am so glad your back
The flashlight sequence made me think the ghosts of the children were goofing around. Kids follow instructions up to a point, but if they want to play games, they will, y'know?
That guy that stabbed himself, yeah that was my uncle with my grandparents. I live with my grandparents but stayed home that trip. Sure was a fun phone call tho 😄10/10 would try again
7:33 uhh..... goosebumps....
I cant believe theres people that actually believe this video is real. Then again a lot of people voted for Biden
What if, Lucifer the series is real? But here, Lucifer isn't a rich club owner but it is Shane.
leaving a timestamp for myself 22:10
Please investigate "the ghosts of carmel maine" house.
9:27 Shane breaks
with the sheets over the mirrors, it was a common thought that spirits could get trapped in mirrors in the room they died in, in an odd way the murderer may have tried to let the victims pass on peacefully, either that or may have been scared that it would have been bad for him if they did end up sticking around
It’s a 2’fer! Supernatural and crime!
Fucko 🤣 I died! I’ma start using that!
Hell yeah Iowa!!!!
At 6:49 it sounds like the ghost says “I’m transsexual”
The town marshal very well could have done it. If he went to church with them, he would know when and where they would be home. Or, to be up at the scene and allowing people to contaminate the ax contributes to it. Along with making such a spectacle over it. That's just me.
The Morbid podcast recently covered this case in depth (minus the claims the house is haunted), it’s a good listen and really goes into stuff Shane and Ryan left out for time’s sake. Btw one of the Stillinger girls was posed with her bottom half naked, no evidence she was raped but I think it’s considered sexual assault of some kind. Also the bacon found was possibly covered in... bodily fluids. I won’t gross anyone out but I’m sure you can figure out which kind .
Whats the reason we dont watch ghost hunters or most haunted anymore or other shows? Because all the people in it are believers or actors and it makes it hard to believe its not a hoax and the show is guenuine. We need a guenuine unbiased skeptic but im starting to think what if Shane is being paid to act like he doesnt believe just so the show seems more authentic?
a very unrelated channel but jacob sharpe viewers watch this apparently  i mean i can confirm that i watch both but i didn't expect that
What if the Town Marshall was the killer and to cover his steps and contaminate the evidence he had everyone touch it?
Where the fellow Iowans at??
Another thing that’s weird about this case is that a bunch of women who lived nearby started cleaning the blood before police arrived. Also, I 100% believe that there was one other person that helped murder those people.
I thought he was gonna say “I don’t believe in ghosts, but I do believe in Iowa”
9:00
The reason of putting sheets on mirrors is because a vortex for spiritual
I have one thing to say: I don't know how to add a timestamp, but at 19:30, Shane sounds exactly like a villager in Minecraft. Thank you  Edit: okay it did the timestamp by itself. You learn something new everyday
In the past in Louisiana, when people died it was custom to cover the mirrors in order for the spirits to go to the heaven but apparently it did not work .
5:55 bro he legit made an elaborate joke: 2 pigs in a blanket bruh
Y'all Yankees never been whooped with a switch? Right after you asked child spirits if they were scared the box said switch.
Are they faking this to be sarcastic? Because these things are real based on my experience but I don't believe easily.
This episode actually gave me chills and a general sense of unease
Why would the killers spirit be in the house when he just killed the family and fled??
I kinda feel bad for the spirits. Some were saying “help me” or “stop it” they probably didn’t like being provoked.
It was the brother how did he open the door
So sad what happened to that family.
okay shaniac here through and through but i gotta say the "what is it" was SO scary hahaha
plsss id wanna see them do and episode with trixie and katya were they all go ghost hunting bc they honestly all give similar energies
Flashlights don’t turn on and off that often
I thought the little Asian feller left?
17:55  [mysterious rustle]  So...the ghost's name is "Russel," eh?
The only thing that I can think of to explain the bacon might be an anti-Semitic gesture?  It sounds like the Moore family attended church, but I wonder if any of them were of Jewish descent?  Or even just assumed to be, really.
POST MORTEM: not a question, but a speculation. Maybe the Marshall did it, or had something to do with it, so that's why he was letting everyone in and touch things and contaminate everything so he couldn't get caught. I'm only part way through the video, so I don't know if that's a theory yet lol
They kept trying to talk to the murderer when I am pretty sure he or she just left the house after the killings :3 Most probably died somewhere else. I guess shane did point that out
could you guys talk about gonjiam hospital
Definitely the creepiest place they’ve been in terms of background story. Checks the box for my fear of being killed by an axe murderer in my house.
THEORY: hear me out on this. maybe whatever was in the little girls’ room thought that ryan looked similar to the killer, and wouldn’t reply to him, and only replied to shane because he looked nicer.
The most proof they’ve gotten. I’m not a skeptic, I straight up don’t believe, but this episode had me freaking out a bit.
pigs in a blanket
Shane should've brought a weapon for the ghost to use on him
i think what the ghost said torwds the end when ryan asked for its name was "nikki"
The killer most likely put the sheets on the mirrors because then the spirits cant leave/rest
The Marshal purposely allowed a hundred people in the house so as to cover up any evidence. The Marshal did it.
i wish I'm as brave and insane as shane 😩
What if the ghost was communicating in Morse code….
Why were they trying to communicate with the ghost of whoever murdered the family? I would think the ghosts there would be from the victims
*Cackles in Indiana*  We win the I-state war because no one remembers us. We strike from the shadows.
"putty in his hands" putty was invented in 1943 I don't think this guy knew what putty was
As someone from Illinois that goes to school in Iowa, Shane did not lie
The “what is it” sounds like it could have been from the mother who might’ve woken up or heard something coming from downstairs.
“Axe”
Is this a true crime or supernatural series?
Don't mind me. Just watching this at 3 am with the lights off....in a house with an attic like this one....also located in a small town like this one....yeesh
“It splits teams up and they start to argue”  “You can’t split us up.”  *2 minutes later*  Ryan: “Ghosts are real…”  Shane: *Demonic Screaming*
I really don't want this to be the final season.
Fun fact! The Villisca axe murders were so horrific, that it took the Titanic sinking off the news papers headlines….
“You do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe”  SHAAAAANE that’s a nice thing to saaaay 💜
Just smoked and making cookies. I love the new episodes with the ghoul boys 🥳 amazing work
I have two theories as to why the Marshall would let people handle the axe: one- he was trying to find his suspect.... two( less likely but still plausible): it was someone on the force and he was purposely contaminating the crime scene. I mean if someone on the force was a serial killer perhaps the bacon was a hint. serial killers love being caught.... did they call police Pigs back then?
Oh man the countdown… just do it silently! It kills me that they never give enough time between questions for the ghosts to actually answer
the bacon was probably in case they had a dog to keep it quiet idk
What is with the bacon?
Nah he was calling Ryan a switch 🤣
No...the bacon was used as hand lotion. I had been there and did the research. Did you also know that there were other ax murder cases in the Midwest a year prior to these murders.
I wonder if it was the town Marshal and he'd let people contaminate the crime scene to covers his tracks easier
Love you boys ❤️❤️❤️
The bacon wrapped I a towel is a symbol for "a pound of flesh". The killer may have been jaded or had a deep grudge with he family.
SOMEBODY STOP MEEEHH!!!
as someone who grew up in iowa i can confirm it is, in fact, haunted and creepy as hell.
So good!
Don’t people cover mirrors after someone has died so their spirit doesn’t get trapped in them or something…?
Lol I’m from Iowa and never knew we had beef with Illinois🤣🤷🏻‍♀️👻
As an Iowa I completely agree with Shane’s statement except for one I am a completely sort of nice person
@24:59 The movie, "The Axe Murders of Villisca" supports that theory.
So if the murderer was hiding in the attic, HOW DID THEY GET IN THE ATTIC?
Why is it odd that no one woke up? Axes don't make noise like a gun. An ax would kill a person instantly, with no time to yell or fight back. One of the Stillinger girls seemed to fight back, perhaps because the killer was swinging at the sister between her and the wall.
I wonder if the 2lbs (1kg) of bacon is a red herring. Just a delivery from a local butcher,  that had nothing to do with with murders.
Only good thing BuzzFeed has produced. I’m impressed.
9:25 I COULDNT STOP CACKLING WHEN RYAN SAID “but unicorns aren’t real” AND SHANE JUST PAUSED COMPLETELY. LIKE THAT IS EXACTLY THE POINT HE’S MAKING. AND THEN RYAN ADDS “but ghosts are real” AND I CAN JUST FEEL THE GENUINE FRUSTRATION WHEN SHANE SCREAMED LMAOOOOOO
Why is no one mentioning the bed that one was too clear 😭😭
Stop Turing the spirit box off so quickly you getting results why stop!!!!?????? That’s literally the only thing I don’t like about the show.
I am curious spirits are energies , do they carry memory like whom they killed, how these kindof stuffs too
Wow, this place has bad vibes. This is the scariest one they’ve done in a while.
"Now you gotta be brave... do you remember how to do that?" Forget about the ax murders, Shane be murdering on the regular with his one-liners LOL.
Wouldnt it be the ghost of the victims, not the murderer? PS you guys are the actual best... so funny.
If your goal is to annoy the ghosts, that spirit box is the way to do it.
The Marshall did it.
As someone from Iowa, can confirm, the whole state is in fact haunted.
do they know its a super common things for kids in iowa to stay the night in
*"You wouldn't buy my bacon? I'M GONNA MAKE YOU BUY MY BACON"!* 🐷🐷
is it just me or did ryan repeat some words at some point?either my yt is glitching or he reapted them.
Ryan is profiling the murderer
I heard that people cover mirrors when someone dies because the souls can get trap in the mirror.
SHANE CHECKS ALL THE ROOMS IN THE HOUSE FOR SARA I CANT 😭😭😭
Love the videos 🙌 you guy's are both amazing 😎😎
F-bombs.  Not cool.
I think when you pass on to the other side after you've murdered or died while possessed, you're stuck playing that same scenario for eternity. That's maybe why the ghost always says "help me" or something similar.
"Oh maybe the killer was waiting in the attic" Me: "But how in the name of all thats holy, did NO ONE WAKE UP EXCEPT FOR THAT ONE GIRL. HOW DO YOU NOT WAKE UP WHEN THE PERSON IN THE LITERAL SAME BED AS YOU IS GETTING BEATEN TO DEATH WITH AN AXE???"
(yeef) eye opening, world changing, never before seen
Interesting case
I feel like the mirror thing could have been the killer feeling a little regretful or ashamed and couldn't bring themselves to look in the mirror and fully recognize their actions
Why do I feel like the ghost hated shane 💀
Why do these flashlights turn on and off?
Shane: “I don’t believe in ghosts but I do believe Iowa is haunted.” Me (Iowa native): “How dare—…… no that’s fair.”
The entirety of the midwest is haunted. -Missouri native
9:30 I thought I was going to see Ryan loosing his mind in this episode but i was not prepared for it to be Shane instead😂
Yo guys, Shane and Ryan have their own YouTube channel where they may continue the Unsolved series: SUBSCRIBEEE https://youtube.com/c/watcher
(yeef)
idk if anyone's said this but what if it was the marshall? he might've had everyone contaminate the weapon so it couldn't be traced back to him- and it would make it a lot harder to solve the case
Would have been more strange to be in a pool of someone else's blood 🤔
*shane walks in the house alone* murderer's ghost, crying in the corner: not him please i wanna go home
0:53 So my gahd i didn't expect the man standing at the back starring at the camera hahaha
The fact that Shane was actually scared this time is kind of sus
24:42 HAHAHA
what about Josiah's brother? why did he have a key? it could explain why the killer used the blade of the axe in a way to show "mercy"" to the victim perhaps? and then it could explain the mirrors, that he didn't want to view himself with his family to see the people that he murdered where just like him. it could also explain why no one heard anything, it could have been entirely normal that Josiah's brother was inside the house, especially in that era.
I haven't seen anyone mention that the older stillinger girl was pulled halfway down the bed with her bottom half exposed... And beyond disrespectful to all of the victims that they just let folks walk around the house and look.
“You do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe” that was such a sweet moment omg
Is this old ?It is..isn't it?
Why would the murderer be in the house?
"I'm one of the most feared ghost hunters alive"  I love Ryan's confidence in this one
google said putty wasn't invented until the 1940s so why would the killer say "putty in my hands"?
How about you boys investigate Bachelors Grove in Illinois. Bring Shane home. A haunted cemetery in the middle of a forest. Nothing else around. Boo!
Would have been interesting to see them go over to the Squirrel Cage Jail in Council Bluffs while in Iowa.
OOOH probably one of the best episode i've seen since a long time.
I personally have no beef with Iowa but I do now cuz Shane and I are on team Illinois 🤣
I spent a night there once. It was an experience.
Hey! I know this case from Morbid Podcast!
what if the killer was the town sherif and he let all those people into the house to cover up everything and make it impossible to trace back to him.
I live iowa. how rude! >:c 😂
Everyone but the father was killed with the blunt end. It was the father who had the opportunity to kill all of them without commotion. The father then kills himself at the end with the sharp edge. Mystery Solved
the town marshall did not let people onto the crime scene, he was one of the only ones who tried to secure it right from the start, they were blocking people off, but most either snuck in or talked their way in, one man who hated josiah used military connections to get onto the crime scene and stole a piece of his shattered skull, with hair still on it.
crazy...I live literally 10 miles south of this place and never think about it much...nice to see other's reactions to it still.
i know that they probably know what the main theory behind that bacon is…. i know they didn’t include all the details about leena… im kinda glad they didn’t
i started to smell blood watching this.
19:56 "Sarah Moore"
Anyone else watch this whilst working?
"Lets see if I end up in a pool of my own blooooood" 😂😂😂😂
Oh no ,our shane, he broken
He probably Drugged them. And the meat most likely to throw off any stenches while he completed his goal.
The killer was obviously ashamed because of covering the mirrors, “Stop me”, “Hard to stop”, “Help me”.
I don't think I've felt someone's frustation as much as I felt Shane's when Ryan said unicorns aren't real
Why do I want them to do the Estes method so bad
I feel like the ghost that’s speaking in the spirit box is the killer and he’s guilty about killing them so he can never leave the house
why does Ryan look like a gay Cuban from Miami
MY FAVOURITE GHOSTIE HUNTING BOISSS
My grandma is from (and lives in) iowa. Shes pretty nice. Classic slips-you-money and overstuffs you with food grandma
I'm sad and I love how Ryan's not losing his mind from extreme fear anymore, like he's definitely still a bit scared but Shane kinda rubbed off of him now.
it’s 10:28 and i have a test tomorrow but here i am
Shane needs a spirit to follow him home
I believe the clothing/sheet over the mirror may be so nobody witnesses the act. Even the mirrors. Or the spirits get trapped in the mirror. Kind of like Bela Lugosi.
Bro I need more true crime 😭😭
Maybe the murderer was one of the family members, then the guest walked in on the scene, took the ax, killed the last dude, decided it would not look good if they figured out he had been there, so he decided to ignore it for the next hour or so
I absolutely love the content you guys post! I just think its a little comical that you guys are basically "Ghost Rhett and Link"  to me, I am a mythical beast so no offense its a compliment!  you guys do have your own personality and originality , I just find it equally enjoyable
Just wondering if the trouble with switching the coloured torch is can spirits see things or just hear things
17:17 somehow I doubt those toys are historically accurate.
Take away all the sins of the professor accuses Ryan of murder!
At the 19:55 minute you ask about killing them and if they saw; it almost sounds like "Town Marshall" which would make 100% sense why he contaminated the crime scene deliberately.
I would have loved for them to do the amityville house 😭
8:18 p-p-pewdiepie?
I've been watching this series since it started, so maybe I'm just desensitized to the other videos' stories after so many rewatches - but this one seems particularly gruesome in comparison. it's like a sister episode to keddie cabin. the suddenly active spirit box doesn't seem like a coincidence to me either, it hasn't spoken up hardly at all lately but this location seems uniquely preserved. maybe that helps with activity?
Who else saw this on Junkyard Digs?
That "What is it" is super clear. Like they didn't know what the voice recorder was, which would make sense
Shane, as an Iowan, I want you to know that I like Ryan better than you.  lol jkjk
I really want Shane to SEE a ghost, and he just screams and Ryan laughs as he knows everything had changed.
Normally a sheet over the mirrors after a death is from the belief that a persons spirit would be trapped in it if it wasn’t covered.
PLEASE do the Chris Benoit case 🙏🏼
THERE BACK BABY
Hey this show  is getting popular now I been with them in View 35k 5 to 6 year's ago
yeef…
absolutely killed me when shane started SCREAMING at the unicorn thing
This axe murder stuff reminds me of a creepypasta character named Ticci Toby and it shakes me
As someone who was born in iowa I will say, shane is right about it being haunted, we all are born as ghosts and only become human if we leave the state
I THINK the killer is the towns butcher that is why he left the bacon..😁😁
I'm impressed that the murder house has wheelchair accessibility
I’ve been laughing at “someBooDddyy StOoppp MEeeEe” for 10 mins now.
If you haven't already please do the South Korean Hwaseong serial killer
Ryan: seemingly sincerely questioning both his and Shane's mental states  Shane: Hey FUCKO!
Maybe being more respectful to whom ever you guys are talking to, would make the chances for responses higher...
Why does it always sound like Shane Bidet?
weird how in 23:04 subs said "that was fun," instead of "helpless,"
the “i’ll kill him” really did sound like michael rooker
The funniest part of Shane saying Illinois has beef with Iowa, is that it's Nebraska and Iowa that dislike each other. Iowa only thinks Illinois is corrupt, but will throw down with Nebraska.  Anyway, I went to the murder house for a field trip! It was okay. I was eight or nine, and was not that impressed, but it was better than being in class.
so, it’s common belief to cover the mirrors if someone dies in the house so that their soul won’t get trapped by trying to pass through the mirror on accident. maybe that was his intention?
“Hey ya sick little weirdo” lol
My heart breaks for the family and the two girls. I hope that people find out who was responsible for this horrific act.
fun fact ghosts hate being called ghosts or gouls, thats why most ghost hunters never get results a lot
the clothing/sheets on the mirrors, bodies, and windows could have been signs of remorse OR superstition, and the latter could be some sort of delusion that explains why killing was “hard to stop”? idk man
Are you open travelling internationally? Like in the Philippines we also have alot of ghost haunting stories here #postmortem
at around 7:30 i heard “f*cking bright” instead of “brain” so switch could have been referring to the light
Shane looks like Skid from Ice Age and I love it so much.
This house is not far from where I live! I really wanna go see it! 😱😱😱
That “what is it” was so clearly spoken, it gave me the chills
Wish they would’ve addressed the other ax man murders, in that the most likely scenario is that it was a traveling serial killer. There’s a podcast that covered this in depth called American Hauntings
Forgot that you guys were still doing Supernatural.  I believe people can haunt a house, especially after something bad  has happened  🙂
Did anyone else think that the ghost just wanted to play some animal crossing on a Nintendo switch?
This was like a supernatural and true crime ep in one.
I am 7
in ther beds
The ghost has no power over unafraid skeptics
9:25  And every Shaniac simultaneously had a stroke and died
They cover the mirrors so the spirits wouldn’t get trapped inside them.
Ok the animation of the window sliding into the house and then sliding back into place was hilarious
Ok I haven’t seen this fully just yet but I find it funny that this is sort of a crossover between True Crime and Supernatural
Is it just me...or does shane look like hitler had a baby with Dangle?
3:51. Imagine he jumps and immediately after hitting the ground the whole house caves in on them.
ryan’s skin is so smooth what’s the routine
Oh man, this one was freaky. The "stop me", "help me", stuff is disturbing.
Shane- let’s party folks except for the murderer we do not want to party with you has me rolling🤣🤣
The real thing that's unsolved in this episode, why didn't they spell "ax" with an "e?"
the spirit box was on POINT in this episode!
Spirits are real. Definitely, but I don't believe they're what most are lead to believe. If we are to agree with Ohms law or Law of Energy then it would somewhat make sense they appear as Orbs of Light. All depends on if you believe we have souls or we're just this organic matter that shares emotions like empathy & love & are conscience of these emotions.
YALL CAME TO IOWA AND DIDNT COME AND SAY HI!?!?!?!?!?!?
in ireland (and maybe other countries, im not sure), it is customary to cover mirrors when someone dies.  i think it is possible the killer is from a country where this was common practice or grew up in a home where this was tradition.  maybe after causing these people's deaths, he did this to make himself feel like he wasnt a terrible person or to pretend like he actually respected them.
bacon????
Ok I feel the marshal is suspicious ok like he'd know better but let them taint the evidence that would be left behind. Also it won't go unnoticed how freaking sweet Shane is for checking every room for his girlfriend.
My theory is that the killer drugged them
why would the ghost of the killer be there?????
hey wait, axeman in 1918 and villisca in 1914.. maybe theyre the same person?
It was the axe that’s haunted ooooooooo
I’m in Nebraska, and I agree with Shane. The entire state of Iowa is a haunted mess.
Bacon......the candy of meats mmmm
No one else noticed a dark hand reach into the bed at around 26:52 as Shane says “also chose to haunt this place” in the bottom left corner of the frame ?! I’m creeped out
the voices this episode were so insanely clear it’s spine-chilling
"You do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe." was not expecting such a soft moment in a vid ab an ax murder house tbh
Johan's copycat killer
Maybe the town marshal did it and let all those people in to contaminate the crime scene. 🤷🏻‍♀️
i don't like
postcard???   lmao.  great video!!!   bye.
At this point I'm pretty sure the ghosts are more afraid of these two than they are to them.
I wish I was kidding but I watch this series to sleep..it’s uh..soothing? 😀
Not me watching this at 2 am
All my Iowans check in
I cant get over the layout and atmosphere of these videos. Unmatchable.
fav line "I am one of the most feared ghost hunters."
I was SHOOK when Shane payed on the floor with his eyes closed LIKE OMG HOW 😭😭😭😭😭😭
What if the ghost in lena and ina's room was color blind
19:54 scream after stop me?
I think the bacon was meant as a distraction in case they had a dog, as many farm families do
Ax or Axe? Since the murderer used an Axe to kill his victims.
9:30 sounds more like "i'll kill"
Bruh as soon as this video ended my brother fiancé walk in with a essay that I wrote last year about a confederate solider statue and apparently it printed on the printer that I never even touch before
Why do they have such defective flashlights...
How do the remote control flashlights work? They just have someone behind the camera?
Is the killer anti Semi? Covering mirrors? Bacon? Haven’t finished watching.
My shane is losing it 😥
I'm so happy! Yay!🦇 Happy Halloween everyone 🎃
God tier Ryan giggle at 10:23 You are wellcome
I want one time they go into a house or something and get a completely coherent conversation with a ghost through the spirit box
plot twist the marshall is actually the killer
Why am I watching this at 00:28 am? 🤔
What about the Quad Cities which is Iowa AND Illinois LOL
Yall should have tried the estes method with the spirit box - would have made cool content
"What year is it?" "Eight" 8 people died idk..
The town marshal was the axeman .
In regards to the covered mirrors, thats also a traditional symbol of mourning in many different cultures. You cover the mirrors when someone dies. It could have been one of the townsfolk that did it.
I want one of those “spirit box” things. It’d be fun to play around with.
I find it incredibly strange that none of the victims killed last were able to hear the others being murdered. It’s like they were drugged or something.
17:53, there's 10000% something under the bed. Bottom right corner, the sheet lifts up
Leaving this here for myself 11:10
They should have slept in the house 😂
Here after Morbid podcast recommendation. A lot of unexpected details like the size of the house and rooms, small. It would have been tough for the 4 Moore children to be teenagers in that space.   Spooky for the ax murderer to haunt the Villisca house instead of the victims.
Pigs In A Blanket
Kinda wonder why this wasn’t a true crime episode? Bailey Sarian goes into much more detail, I definitely recommend watching her take on these murders.
14:46 this is literally someone whispering into the recorded like ain't no way you can explain that away
27:19 #postmortem Shane, are you putting feelers out for a postcareer in doing standup for spectres trapped in haunted houses? They probably could use some cheering up, it's a needed service, but how would you get paid? Grants?
I like how Shane entertains Ryan that ghosts are real.
When I was a child, my mother could not get a hold of her fiancee for several days, got the landlady to let her inside and found him deceased. The way Ryan narrated the opening gave me a little twinge of PTSD that I didn't know I still had after all this time. But ...distracting myself with something lighter: Everybody's hair and facial hair is handsomely on point here. You both look very nice, boys.
They used to cover mirrors back then so the souls couldn't get trapped in them when people died
I think the bacon is a clue, when the neighbor tried to get in the murderer was still inside and she disturbed him and he left the bacon. There was an infamous axe murderer in Iowa at the time. Either he did it or was inspiration for someone
The ghost said “stop me” and “hard to stop”  Maybe the killer meant to kill one person, than had to kill the rest in fear they would wake up and find them.
For Postmortem: I think the Marshall has something to do with it. I know the police back then wasn't as capable as nowadays, but you can't tell me that turning a crime scene into a tourist attraction happened regularly. Either the Marshall was the murderer or he was trying to cover the murderer by ruining the evidence.
as an iowan, you’re on thin ice shane.
So they DO still exist!
I have a theory about this one What if the father of the family killed them all and then killed himself No signs of forced entry, no money was stolen No one heared anything  Maybe they were drugged during dinner and slept soundly so that made it easier to kill them  And also the murders were commited by an axe that he owned
"i don't believe in ghosts but i do believe that iowa is haunted" new iconic shane line just dropped
Can these 2 just get their own channel
The true villain is the person who did the music
Ryan's one of the most feared ghost hunters alive 🤣
Shane very submissive and breedable on the floor right there
I’m curious, is that just a regular old flashlight that there using for the ghost to turn on/off or is it a flashlight used specifically for interacting with ghosts bought at some ghost shop. Anybody got an answer for me?
This case has all the hallmarks of the "man from the train" killer. If you've never heard that theory I'd highly suggest looking it up but the short version is that a vagrant serial killer traveled from town to town by train working oddjobs and occasionally murdering random families. He targeted large families, usually with young girls, snuck into their house while they were out and waited until they went to sleep before murdering them all, typically with a blunt or sharp impliment taken from around the house. He would then cover all the windows/mirrors, eat some of their food and slip out before the next morning.
these mfs were near my town and i didn’t even know ???! whack
I heard Kathrine https://youtu.be/aABFIzfg72A?t=1142
Maybe ghosts are colorblind
Theory: The killer's spirit still resides in the house as punishment/penance for what he did. The victim's souls can't leave as they had a traumatic death before their time, so the killer cannot move onto the afterlife either and has to stay in the house with his victims.
"You do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe" aww ❤❤
im not liking this version of Ryan.  been out the loop with these guys for months and now Ryan seems to not be terrified anymore?? where's the fun in that? 😔
The growth in Ryan 😍 watching him walk around on his own without freaking out. What a character arc!
the what is it heard in the pearents bedroom could be sarah moore asking it to her husband because she may be able to hear the axe murderer else where in the house
A century later someone would visit the ruined studio of Unsolved and attempt to contact the spirit of one Ryan Bergara, who was brutally murdered by his friend Shame after an argument broke out over the existence of ghosts.
'Concentrated dread'--nice one, Boogara. At slowest playback speed, 6:50 male voice: 'I can't (understand you?)'  Interesting captures, Ghoul Boys. It sounded like you were communicating with two different people in the downstairs bedroom. Ryan's direct line of inquiry was On Point (Kudos!)....which may be why he got an f-bomb from the perp, and asked to be switched to Shane. Perhaps because the Shaniac is not as open to such phenomena (and yes, that IS a thing), the vocal responses from the ghosts in that room grind to a halt.  13:41 Those marks in the wall allegedly made by the axe are awfully high on the wall, and far away from the bed, to have been made in the attack. And the fabric covering the mirrors is the sort of thing a superstitious person would do. 19:54  'I'm one.' (sounds like a female)  Same voice at 23:03. Did this family have a cook (or friend: that female neighbour?) who drugged the food the family and guests ate that night, making it possible to murder them in their sleep, and so be complicit in the crime? This female may even be the one who cooked the murderer's meal afterward---a weird detail at the crime scene. At 26:40, #Shaniac suggests that the murderer(s?) chose to remain there; as someone claims to be 'miserable' in the attic earlier, they have no choice in the matter: this is their Hell on Earth. 31:57 ('Hate me' ?)
We now know Shane is gay because he was IN THE CLOSET
If you didn't know, Morbid Podcast, also did an episode on the Ax house! They are fantastic and love BUN (AKA the ghoul boys!)
I totally think it was the town Marshall..like it makes the most sense either that or that guy was horrible at his job 😂
me watching these at 3am: 👁👄👁
I HATE the actual theory presented by detectives about the bacon. Also, there’s a pretty solid theory that it was a serial killer, who perfected his ways at this house, since a lot of axe Jude red happened around the same time in the same manner. Morbid podcast did a great episode on it.
Creepy
Yall need to try the estes method!!
I highly believe their own family member or a close relatives killed them and acted all calm and composed so nobody knew !
Maybe the mayor did it, letting everyone in, touching everything, ruining every little bit of evidence. Very disrespectful....
shane is scared thats why he yells so he can be bigger:P
The axe wasn't there, it's been lost since the murder investigation. Even the display case holds a replica
I think you broke Shane with the unicorns aren't real response
I remember going here and when I was getting a picture out front of the sign there was a face in the window
It was the town Marshall
We are def haunted here shits crazy
Imagine if shane came out of the closet in his real demon form🤣🤣🤣
shane kickin back in his chair saying “yeah we got beef” could be an amazing gif
shane is aggressive on this episode
As a Iowa native I agree with Shane and all his claims on Iowa
imma be honest, ive never had a flash light just turn off. maybe i just have good flash lights
Me when Ryan said he wasn’t scared    😧 is that really him!?
Is Indiana in this i state turf war? I need to know
I took a forensics class last year, I did one of my semester projects on this. Got an A on it, it’s very interesting
I’m crying I miss you guys so much the other videos are not good enough for me
Shane means business when ya ask about his skulls!
Can y’all just adopt me as one of your own?
At 22:38 the box sounds like it’s saying “I’ve been here” instead of “I’m in here”
Shane looks like a young David Thewlis in this episode
27:55 IM SORRY WHAT
The town marshal probably did it tbh cus no cop or officer in the right mind would let evidence be contaminated like that
I can't NOT hear Shane as a Muppet since Muppet History lol
that is in iowa i am from minnesota
I would love to get my hands on that same ghost box sound but I had no luck with one I bought
Shane's attention span at the beginning of the video is all over the place. SQUIRREL.
It makes sense that a person from Illinois would hate on Iowa cus we're ranked 3 and they're ranked 5 B10 West
do midoro pond next
You guys should investigate the Custer House at Fort Abraham Lincoln in ND
Anyone from Iowa here especially in DSM?
So, I don't hear my name very often in life but when I do, I'm nothing short of subconsciously shitting myself
what if the sheriff did it and allowing 100 people into the crime scene and touch the weapon was his way of getting rid of evidence
Ryan and Shane episodes are the only good ones in my opinion, peace and love
In “ther” beds…. Typo?
Did a ghost steal the the letter E from the word Axe?
Town Marshal did it... That's why he let the whole town handle the ax, and trample all over the crime scene lol
i was too distracted during the entire investigation in the girls' bedroom on the bottom floor, cuz i just kept staring at that beautiful antique sewing machine 😍 How can i purchase the villisca ax murder sewing machine, asking for a friend
Just can't help but think that during the times between each season of filming, Ryan recieves psychotherapy.  Lol "I am not my fear..."
Kind of glad this series is coming to an end. No one takes it seriously anymore and that’s a shame.  It had a good run though. I have enjoyed watching.
🤣😆 lmao Ryan, " I'm one of the most feared ghost hunters alive." The ghoul boys don't mess around
Shane: Iowa and Illinois got beef Me: from Illinois going to school in Iowa  Me:... Me: So, funny story
Where can I buy a spirit box??? I NEED to get one!!!
Damn! Up at 5 am hanging up laundry?? I am so grateful for washing machines and dryers!
19:05 that shi said bop it
.
6:53
Im gonna miss this show 😭
Sup Shane I’m from illinois too 💪🏻💪🏻
Uhmm doooo ya think the curtains were already closed because most people shut their curtains at night time...?! lol
one of the things that struck me was veiling the mirror. mirrors are generally considered as portals for spirits to the other world. one probable reason could be that the killer intentionally covered the mirror to stop the spirits from going away and wanted them to be in the house. ik this cant be the fact but this was my though upon hearing the "killer had veiled the mirror in the bedroom".
that guy was stabbed on my birthday
Not to unleash the side of me that binge watches criminal minds or anything...but like, i've got a theory - the fact that the murderer killed all the victims by disfiguring their faces, then covered their faces, covered the windows and most of all covered the mirrors suggests to me that maybe they couldn't confront or were maybe even remorseful about their actions but for some reason didn't feel like they could help themselves, like they couldn't bear to have any witnesses to what they did or even acknowlegde it in a reflection...that mix of guilt but an incapacity not to murder would explain so much about the video: why the murderer's spirit might return to the house; why the spirit box caught them saying things like they're "helpless" and "miserable", or asking Ryan and Shane to "stop me"; even why they spirit might continue trying to murder people...  Okay, tinfoil hat off now! I'm not sure I even believe in ghosts/spirits, but this video...well, it makes me wonder haha
can we see a collaboration with Sam And Colby
In Bulgaria, when someone dies you cover the mirrors with cloth and open the windows so their spirit can  move onto the other world/realm. I don't know if its the same in the US but it looks me like someone tried to make sure their spirits would never leave this place - covering the mirrors and the windows too.
Statistically, purely by chance, the spirit box would have had to produce one meaningful answer on the show by now, but it hasn't. This is the spookiest thing of all. 😀
"F*ing brain..." because.. the murderer 😱 yknow.. If you chop into enough heads I'm sure you'll develop some violent complex about it  Rest in piece all the victims 💔
32:23 do u see that figure behind Ryan?
SHANE: Hey Fucko!!!
The "there is so scientific proof of ghosts" can just be thrown out as an argument. Why do we assume we know how being a ghost works? NO ONE can say that me and my sister didn´t see a painting fly across the room
This is my favorite unsolved crime house. I even made a play in school about it
Did I just see Shane getting scared and Ryan not getting scared in the at all ????
Amityville
shane no,,,,, our REAL beef is with indiana
We're in the last season now, but I'm still convinced Shane doesn't see or feel ghosts because evil spirits are said to prey on a human's fears. the more a person believes in spirits, the easier it is for the spirits to attach itself to them.
Plot twist they were all vampires and Abraham Lincoln killed them
apple tater is always the best thing that the spirit box has ever given us
Okay so it seems the house is possessed, not the people. Like the people aren’t possessing the house, something else is. The killer seems like he is a victim
Im not there but when they were in the attic I got really emotional. I think the killer wasnt conscious or aware
My guess: the killer is the only one haunting the house, but he himself was possessed. Escpecially the putty comment, it contradicts his please to be stopped. It sounds like he is battling something. The mirrors being covered too might support this because mirrors that face you while you sleep are dangerous because mirrors are thought to be portals
I think the guy who killed them didn’t do it under his own free will
ghost: "HELP ME IM MISERABLE HELP ME HELPLESS HELP ME KILL THEM"   ryan :" so what are your names...?"  shane: *shouts relentless abuse towards ghosts*
im sorry but who tf would stay overnight in a murder house that is possibly haunted
Ghosts aren't real. There isn't any evidence. Until then.
I love seeing Ryan being confident not only in himself but in the way he talks to one of his biggest fears.. THATS WHAT WE CALL GROWTH!!
Ryan: Ghosts are real and unicorns aren’t !  Shane: Aaaahhh ! Noooooo!
Why would the murderer be in the house? Well now I see why you think he is but I still feel like its illogical for him to be there.
Bro I missed you, I live in Iowa.
Shane: Somebody Stop me Ryan: I don’t think it’s Jim Carrey Shane: Oh 😂😂😂
31:55/31:56 - I'm hearing "hate me" or "hit me"(?)   Not quite sure but voice is consistent, over the scans I mean.😨
31:55 - is that a fuckin mummy right behind Ryan!?! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"Odd choice to haunt this place..."  What makes you think he has a choice? _"Release me..." "Miserable..."_ This is his hell.
I think it was the neighbor. Makes the most sense. She was drying laundry at 5 in the morning so she was up most the night washing her clothes? Had remorse and covered the faces and mirrors. The upswing above the mirror isn’t making killer extremely tall. So possibly a female.
I never realized how close this town was Ryan and Shane were within an hour of me
you do what you do to make ur girlfriend feel safe?! EXCUSE ME SIR. i had to pause the video to write this bcs that’s cute oml
Has the fbi made a profile for this case? It's pretty weird, was there any similar cases to it?
27:57 , the best part 😂🤣
Bro their was a beebo in the closet!!!!!
Pigs in a blanket
What’s with the “Amityvilly” windows?
Y'all dont know turf wars until you've seen the Vermont vs Every Other New England State turf war.   Now if only we could get the other states to realize that there's a turf war.
I think the *Marshall* did it- I mean who purposely lets a bunch of onlookers come in to mess up the crime scene unless they were trying to hide something?
at 31:58 the ghost said teehee
SHANE lmao  "There's no mistaking who would be in here..."  "It's _the stinker."_
I think the spirits are scared of Shane lol
The ghost just sitting there while ryan does a countdown like 😐
you guys should use ouiji boards
Pahahehah, "when should I come outta here?"
I live in Iowa and yes Shane, it's very haunted and just the worst. 😂 I'm like 4 hours from Villisca and I want to go. Some day I will.
This one gave me CHILLS. knew this one would be rife with stuff
What time do you guys post on Fridays?!?!
At 7:30 after Ryan asks "are you scared of us" does it sound like a man screams in the background to anyone else?
Stretching the mind to accept that spirits might remain where they died but why would the murderer be there?
Is there not a new episode this week?
Where’s the new episode?!
"a hitchhiking ghost" thought you could just slip that in there eh ryan?
17:52 Did anyone else see the far side of the bed shift up? They talk about Ryan feeling like someone sat beside him, but the shift behind him is what made the noise/made him jump; it happens right before he reacts.
When you asked the names of the parents they said “Patrick”
ok but is it axe or ax
23:13 it kinda sounds like "Prayer" or "Slayer" to me. Anyone else?
Anyone else hear “let us in” instead of “what is it” ?
Mirrors are said to be portals for spirits perhaps the killer wanted to make sure his victims were never able to escape him even in afterlife? Just a thought
Wanted to hear shane talk about the man doing naughty things to that bacon slab. Because they think he did. Lolol🤣🙈
No, no, Shane's right. Even Nebraskans don't like Iowa lmaoo
At 31:57 when Ryan asks why he did what he did, it sounded like “envy” to me
What scares me if the blue peace sign build a bear in the girl's room is the same one I have and I dressed him up as a doctor with blood splatters on his clothes 😅
Highly recommend the book the man on the train, which discusses how this murder is likely linked to a serial killer using the railroad to travel. Many things in this case match other cases he is believed to have committed.
05:00 Lena had been handled by the killer after her death. The blood on her arm was from the killer and not due to a cut. No victim had been attacked below the neck. 13:24 Joe wasn't hit with the blade of the axe. Sara, his wife, was. Joe was hit only with the blunt side of the axe, like all the other victims. 15:52 No. There may have been cookies on the table or uncleared dishes but there was no evidence the killer made themselves a meal. 21:17 No one really knows how the killer might have gained entry. This "removed screen" guess comes from another, likely related, axe murder in Paola, KS several days before. The killer removed a screen to get in through the window. In this case, there was clear evidence. Not in Villisca. There was no indoor plumbing though, so the back door might have been unlocked. 21:33 It was impossible. The absolute biggest "wrong" thing said about this crime. The entry into the attic space is in the parent's bedroom closet, which, in 1912, was crammed with clothes and boxes. The killer couldn't have hid there without removing all the boxes, then somehow replacing them, then crashing through the boxes into the bedroom later. Also, contemporary investigators looked into this at the time and saw nothing but undisturbed dust in the attic. There was no sign of anyone having been in there for a LONG time.
I believe there was more than one culprit.. Maybe  3 of them  . one with ax.... 2 with weapon or with out weapon.to keep them from escaping. .And it could of been someone they knew.
For postmortem: how does the spirit box work? Could the voices we hear in the spirit box be of unrelated radio signals?
as an iowan, i agree with shane when he says the whole state's haunted
Literally came here right after listening to Morbid podcasts episodes about this house. What a koinkydink.
in that time it was popular to cover all mirors. because they belived if you saw a ghost in them they would get stuck there.
I didn't know there was a turf war between Iowa and Illinois. 🤷‍♂️ oh well .
Please please please do an investigation at Gettysburg battlefield in PA. So many people have reported ghost sightings and I think it would be cool to see my two favorite ghoul boys really close the case
I thought buzzfeed unsolved stopped making videos for buzzfeed unsolved. This was posted 6 days ago I'm glad it hasn't ended though :))
After watching all these episodes, and look forward to the rest of this season, it dawn's on me.... Shane is so down with it it just creeps anything out "Oh he really wants to be haunted... What's wrong with him. I'm just going to avoid him."
Wow, I can't believe they are finally back. I wonder what else they did lol
The… bacon??
nobody:  minecraft villagers: 19:31
Me not paying attention and wondering why there's a cassette tape organizer on the desk.
Please go to Queen Mary room B340 before it closes down to the public for good!  Like so they can see
Any chance the Ghoul Brothers could visit the haunted Aokigahara forest in Japan? That place is hot with activity...
I saw a face behind Ryan
(yeef)
why r u ending 😭
Did these guys already do a true crime episode for this case?
okay did anyone notice the weird guy standing behind shane ? 15:32 ...
how does one get 'help me' from that lol
it sucks because Ryan never gives the spirits a chance to speak through the spirit box, how are you going to get evidence if you can't speak for long?  Maybe he does speak for a while but it's edited all out.  Idk, I'll only believe if they just give them a chance to reveal something...
I wonder why the murderer would haunt this house? unless he killed himself after the deed.
0:01 I was half expecting the Yu-Gi-Oh theme to play.
So excited!!!
Not YETAAAA ok wait for ittttttttt..
Are u scared yetaaaaaa??????☺☺☺☺☺
Well i guess im not sleeping tonight
Who else skips right thu spirit box sessions?
So this story creeped me out. my name is Josiah and my birthday is June 10. Immediately made me stop lol
I have an ancestor (or relative of ancestor, I can’t remember) from Iowa who murdered someone with a hand saw and everyone in town signed a petition and he was pardoned by the governor.
Why you gave up the unsolved crime for paranormal, i'll never understand, but the Villisca ax murders are an interesting unsolved crime, so i'll watch it for now. I do hope you do something for your subscribers that loved the unsolved content you put out, which was great. 🎃
the killer probably haunts the house due to the mass amounts of guilt and torment
this is why i sleep in the morning but wake up in the evening until morning.
Shane's 'Oh, there's more people in here' while going into the closet was hilarious omg 😂
Wasn't it their foreman who found them?
doesn't matter how old the joke is, that tall guy is a demon himself
14:46 i dont hear " what is it?" but rather "Let us in"
Someone on tiktok said that they think shane is a demon who took a liking to ryan and decided to become his bff 😭
32:23 wtf
Imagine getting your face split open with an ax then they turn your house into a tourist trap
yo if i was mary i would have legit sprinted from there
Telecom/phone was available in 1903 (-_- )ﾉ⌒┫ ┻ ┣ ┳
In the past five years I have only noticed, devices respond most of the time in Ryan's hand, of Ryan's call. Ghost scared of Shane
Unicorns are so real.
Ghost: help me! Help me! Stop me! Ryan: what are your parents names? Ghost: Bro what the fu-
Its really very sad what happened to the family. Especially those children 😢😢😢
could the bacon left behind be the killers way of comparing his victims to livestock? Especially the way that it was neatly wrapped, almost as if he was trying to create it a bed and blankets to resemble the state of his victims I also think the town marshal did it, letting random people wield the murder weapon is extremely sus
help im blind can we see the bed move
I could imagine what old Shane with a mustache would look like and an eye patch would work too
As an Iowan, I've never felt an ounce of rivalry with Illinois...  Until now 👀
Ryan: I am not my fear...uh...fear is the mindkiller...and other quotes about me not being afraid I can't think of cuz I'm scared shitless... *takes out spirit box*  Ghost: oh ffsake *walks out forever* Ryan: this house is clean
I feel like it's only the axe murderer in there.
I did a course in criminal psychology and there is a lot of things that does not make sense in this case but what stands out the most to me is: Covering up the victims is a classic move done by killers who knew them personally and/or instantly regretted it after doing it. Very common in crimes of passion. The fact he entered and exited the house easily also adds to the fact that the family probably knew the murderer. Also adds to the things heard in the spirit box like "Stop me" and "I'm miserable". I don't think who did this was the "murder is fun" kind of person. If I had to guess: a very troubled man who was in love or had an affair with the wife - it would explain why the husband was killed in a more violent manner when compared to the others.
It was Lizzy Borden, case closed.
I really do think that killerS did this
how did i never visit this place when i lived in iowa?
Seems to me it was probably the guy that let a ton of people contaminate the scene
I’ve heard a theory about the bacon that made me very uncomfy. Listen to the Morbid Podcast episode on the Villisca axe murder house if you’re curious.
Possible suspect Orlando Peckham. I did some research and I have a bad feeling about him
I’m 52 and I think Shane is a budding curmudgeon.
The dangerous inventory unexplainably escape because glockenspiel thoracically employ over a crazy thursday. present, amuck authorization
It’s possible that the family knew the killer. The town's population was very small so it would be easy for them to know the killer. The killer sounded to be psychotic and manipulative. The killer possibly make the family trust him somehow. It’s scary how easy it is for a killer to get into someone’s house safely.
#ghoulboys4lyfe
Gotta love Iowa
"I'm one of the most feared ghost hunters alive" —Ryan Bergara
it would have been awesome if Michael Myers had stepped out of the shadows during the filming in the house, and just opened these two soyboys up.
Should have driven 35 minutes east to do an untouched murder house from 1919
"HEY, FUCKO!"  This is what I'm gonna yell from now on when I'm home alone and scared
So, here's an idea. It was 8 killers and they all killed the people at the same time which is how no one woke up.
Lol @7:56
Imagine if the town marshal was the killer and him making the house into an public attraction of sorts was his way of covering up his tracks.  Definitely not tryin’ to say he did it, it’s just a funny idea to think of a world where someone was ballsy enough to try it
i had a crazy thought about the bacon, but no evidence. What if the killer was worried about a dog? a dog would bark and alert the neighbours, or try to protect their family. What if the family had recently had a dog, but no longer? or the killer didn't know the family well but came prepared nonetheless? I guess another theory is he brought a snack for later but didn't end up eating it because of time constraints (he would've used their kitchen to cook the bacon, but i suppose this weirdo could've eaten it raw)
"No, I'm in the closet, just chilling." - Shane
Axe*
Shane is scared too but he talks so he doesn’t hear anything, make jokes so the ghosts don’t take him serious. Ryan goes in and opens up, they see him as the person who believes and can communicate with him
not even a minute in and I love this already
The sheets on the mirror are to stop the dust 😂😘
it is very funny when the words they hear on the spirit box arent what you heard at all
Buzzfeed is so screwed without you guys
29:47 lol Ryan's laugh sounds like Cat when his nervous XD
UwU
YOU GUYS WERE IN IOWA WHERE I LIVE AND I DIDN'T KNOW OMG IM SO UPSET
as an iowan ivE BEEN WAITIN FOR THIS ONE TURN IT UP
For Postmortem: I recently heard a podcast about this case. From a few sources, including "A Nightmare in Villisca: Investigating the Haunted Axe Murder" by Richard Estep, they thought that the killer used the bacon to masturbate in, since it was found in the same room as the Stillingers. They came to that conclusion since Lena was the only one that was thought to have fought back, and she was also the one posed sexually. That makes it so much gross, but it could be an explanation as to why the bacon was there.
what's this? something interesting in iowa?
Is it normal that flashlights turning on and off and on again on their own to everyone?
Does anyone else feel like they know exactly what Shane will be like as an old man?
Damn imagine calling your son Herman
What if the murderer was from a different city in the state of Iowa and he wanted his city to rise in the ranks
"right now I am reaching out to whoever murdered in this house?" umm wouldn't he/she have died somewhere else, if they weren't caught.
Ghost transcript: I'll kill him. What I heard: Monke
“you do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe”
I thought they said I’m okay not help me
Ryan is such a receiver and Shane is such a shielder haha
Shane remembers me on Professor Lupin from HP with his Hairstyl 😅
why would the murderers ghost be there
So pranks were a thing in 1912?
You actually have a point you go anywhere in Iowa you are bound to find a haunted location even my house I have recorded voices
I shouldn't have worn earphones 🥲 RIP my ears at 9:30. Though, Shane's scream of frustration and anguish was oddly satisfying. I love you Shane and Shaniacs but I'm a #Boogara at heart.
Shane having beef with Iowa is relatable 😂 I’m from Minnesota and we hate Iowa too
Just finished watching all the episodes of Puppet History... kinda disrespectful of that Shane guy to be mocking the professor's voice like that with the half-assed genie cosplay :/ rip professor at least some of us will honor your memory
So what I’m getting is that Shane believes in unicorns, but not ghosts. 😆😉
for the post mortem - if you could say anything to the town marshal and the people that made this tragedy a spectacle what would you say? also hey guys! long time watcher ;) - ur local cryptid boogara
Hey guys can you please do the van meter ghost? I think you would have a lot of fun reading and looking into the case
Can you do the van meter ghost?
How do you do this
Genuine question - if they DNA tested the ax and used some kind of historical record of who toured the house, would it be possible to find out who the murderer was?
#postmortem okkk i know you’ve already done the video for the q&a, but I have a theory to Ryan’s question: how did no one wake up to the murderer. What if the person who killed them, KNEW THEM and drugged them previously? I can’t piece together how they would’ve done it, but hypothetically speaking it would make sense in a way. It would make sense too since they ate food from the kitchen as well. He seemed to be comfortable with the kitchen
What if the marshal was the kill them and let everyone touch the murder weapon so that it was “contaminated”
Why is no one talking about how the bed moved while Ryan was sitting on it 😭 wtf was that
I find it funny that Shane is just now saying there’s no science behind it, like they haven’t done two whole season of this show already. There was never science behind it lmao.
I think this killer had been watching their every move and had probably been inside the house before he killed everyone so maybe he put something in their food the day of the murders to sedate them so that no one could hear or stop him from killing everyone else. or probably drugged them some other way, it makes no sense for eight people to be killed and no one hears anything.
WAIT SHANE IS FROM ILLINOIS? Why have you guys never gone to Alton it’s one of the most haunted towns in the country #postmortem
Based on the scene, I think the medium is wrong. Signs of remorse and being giddy about killing don't really go together. Covering the faces and such makes it seem like it was someone they knew
When Rayan said "metaforic ghost Dildo" i died laughing 😂😂😂😂😂
#postmortem in some cultures it is believed that the souls/spirits of people can become trapped in mirrors and travel to other mirrors that way. So maybe this dude believed that and didn’t want the ghosts to travel back to his house and kill him as revenge??? What’s your take on it?
That bed didn't move lol
0:51 Shane remind me of Edgar Allan Poe 😏
I think these investigations would really benefit from having a medium present. Ryan seems sensitive already but they'll never really find anything without someone fully in tune to these things.
Read a book!!!! The Man From The Train, Bill James.
So.. if they never found the axe murderer, how do they know when or where he died? How do they know literally anything about him other than he killed an entire family without a trace..
The fact the ghoul boys were in Iowa where i go to college and I didn't try and see them makes me upsetti
Ok but the 2LBS OF BACON 🥓? That is so weird
This is considered basically solved!! You've GOT to read Man from the Train by Bill James & Rachel McCarthy James, about this case and others.   Basically, the guy was a prolific axe murderer of families across the United States for decades, but never caught because of the way information wasn't shared then like it is now. At the end of the book, the authors think they've solved it. I read it over a year ago and I still think about it at least once a week.
I went here like 5 years ago with a friend. Later found out that a spirit of a little girl had attached itself to my friend & followed her home. Please be careful!
I"m pretty sure the town marshal is the suspect
0:04 The murders happened only a couple of months after the _Titanic_ sank...just sayin'.
They both remind me of Dana Scully and Fox Mulder. 😁
Is this same guy who did all the axe murders throughout Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Nebraska, and finally ended up in Iowa? If so, he has some 100 deaths on his hands. He always had the same MO, no theft of money, and always left after eating a snack and leaving it on the table or counter.
Lol i noticed at the start of BuzzFeed Unsolved Shane & Ryan were both very cheerful an clearly excited to be working for BuzzFeed now at the finale they’re just dropping constant F bombs and just seem to be generally annoyed by this work
Okay I feel so bad for the murdered family, I'm only at like 6:29 in the vid. But WHY A SLAB OF BACON? Murdering a family wasn't enough so this dude decideded he needed to leave a cacconed loaf of meat on their floor 😭😭 I'm laughing so much rn I'm so sorry ripppp
the marshall knew OMEGALUL
It'd be really cool if your last video could be at aokigahara. One of the most haunted forests in the world.
Love you guys, the difference personality you guys give is amazing😂😂😂
When he said ‘8’ I thought he was just referencing back to how many he killed
It was believed that mirrors could capture a soul, so maybe the killer covered the mirrors to let their souls go free.
So in all of the INSANITY in the world today, GOD bless you boys for putting out content that takes me away for a few minutes from my crazy life, Work, all the F@@@@D BS one has to endure these days. Thanks again. Go to the Goldfield Hotel. IF YOU DARE..
the bacon wrapped in towel…. pigs in a blanket?
I’m confused, I thought they left buzzfeed?
awe shane "well you do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe"
In certain religions mirrors trap the soul and the eyes are the window to the soul
Y’all they both look like both ends of divorced dads
Is no one talking about the "you do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe" ?? That seemed so genuinely sweet
What if the ghost was trying to tell Ryan and Shane that the ghost is actually a switch and they just misunderstood? 😂
So funny ! How have I been missing out on these videos omg you guys are so hilarious 😂
Ryan seems a little braver here with the flashlights vs when they visited that other house in the kitchen. Here, he is more chillax about it.
I’m seriously dying for you guys to go on an investigation with Moe Sargie’s crew. Shane wouldn’t last 20mins.  Also. Love y’all😋🤘🏽💞!
I can't believe the amount of bots in this comment section. I've literally never seen this many. It's wild.
"Ooh, that's a...ghost thing!"
19:23 I heard “is there anything you want to say to us?”  “Probably.” 😂
The most Iconic question of the entire series.   *Are ghost real?* Shane: '(ツ)'
"I'm so vulnerable right now" *Therapist Shaniacs shaking in happiness*
The ghost walk-in round:  Care taker:  BOO Ghost: hey that’s my line!!
‘you do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe’ that’s the cutest thing ive ever heard
Some serial killer checked the fridge before finishing his crime, saw the bacon and took it (because bacon) while wrapping it in a towel to-go. Breakfast was soon, they prob broke a good sweat too. Then he goes to kill in that room, sets the bacon down to do his deed...and then simply forgets the bacon!
9:29 BYE
OMG when they were in the attic when he said 8 he also said here that means 8 here?!
The killer also used the bacon to uh.... 'enjoy' himself.
When they’re standing in the room with the upswing, I was looking away from my phone. I look back, and JUMP OUT OF MY SKIN AT RYAN’S SHADOW LOL.
shanes moustache looks like hes slowly working his way to becoming the sheriff in a small town in 1885
“…I’m not some dour ghost hunter coming in here…” Dour is my favourite English word 😂  Nice use of it Shane
this video is crazy
If that purple Boobah had went off while Shane was in the closet… he would’ve 💩 himself… I know I would’ve cause they are a weird creepy 2000’s toy anyway!
Love you, ghoul boys
I think the Demon possessing Shane was released when Ryan said unicorns aren't real
yall need to make a video on the burari case
Metaphorical ghost dildo lmao
Well science has often just been proving what the bible has already said and there is ghosts in the bible so yknow
My favourite part of this video, after trying to communicate with these two the ghost, gave up and told Shane to leave.
I'm gonna miss these series soo muchhh 😭😭😭😭😭
The killer was going to take the bacon but forgot it.
<----- Realizes it's 9:40 pm 😱
How do we know that ghosts aren't naked?
I don’t necessarily believe in ghost. I’m basically unsure, but still I’d never f@$k with them like that… angering them. Oh hell no
The sheet over the mirror has nothing to do with anything. I have had a thing with mirrors all my life. When I visit my parents, they have a stand up mirror in my old room. I turn it around when I stay. Just a quirk from childhood
Idk, I feel like it's the Town Marshall, just for the fact that he is somebody most people would place their trust on and that he let the town's people touch the murder weapon to maybe cover up his own hand prints
I recently read a book that postulated this was a scene of a serial killer that crossed the country, committing axe murders. "The Man From The Train" , by Bill James.  Very compelling read.
Ryan: unicorns aren't real... Ghosts are real. Shane: *mental breakdown*
I'm glad it's back, holiday's wouldn't be the same without it.
9:58 They sound like 2 investigators tryna interrogate souls, might as well polygraph them
DO THE ESTES METHOD!!!!!
I suggested this to yall on Facebook and you actually did it!!!!!
22:39 did the ghost say poggers?
Hey, we all know what Iowa stands for... Lmao
I feel like the killer liked Shane
22:18 ahhh yes, Sarah <3  Everyone will protecc Sarah <3
The Spirits of the People killed there are more likely to be there than the Person who killed them and left the scene . Why taunt the least likely spirit to be there .
I wonder what Shane has to say about Minnesota and if he’ll be respectful, considering we are obviously the superior Midwestern state
Ryan: grab a picture, send a post card to your parents. Me: wait, actually, my mom would love that
Did the brother have a spare key? I'm genuinely curious why he was able to open the door when the neighbor couldn't because the murderer possibly being someone close to them is high. Like he knew the inside of the house enough not to make noises. Also, the murderer covering up their faces could be a sign of shame. And hitting them in the face might have been a sign of deep hatred, a feeling that only someone close can have for the other.
Classic
Didn’t the last time the spirit at the lighthouse??? say switch it literally meant “switch with me” babes I don’t think they were talking about the spirit box
ah he do be vibin
They should've asked why is it E=MC2?
U do what u do to make u r loved one feel safe. Respect ❤
Haven't they already been here?
Ok but when Shane leaned over after going mob boss on Ryan all I saw was Walter from Jeff dunham
Can we please not end this show? Please?
I wish for one episode instead of doing the same old "let's be as loud as we possibly can, and use this dogshit device that speaks literally all the time and has nothing to do with anything", they would just sit and be quiet. And let the horror or terror of the area speak instead of them. You notice how some of the most terrifying things happen when they are just sitting quietly in the places they are staying in?
i think if the house and evidence were preserved. Today's forensic might be able to solved this mystery.
shane reminds me of my grandpa
The killer to me of course felt ashamed. And then eating the food in the house was weird, also the possibility of it being someone the family knows is highly likely or at least someone that previously scooped out the house.
PLS- not at me forgetting that iowa was a state and reading the description 'Iowan house' as 'Lo-Wan house' and trying to figure out what they meant😭💀
I've lived in Iowa my whole life and didn't even know this place existed till now
23:04  Ryan: Why are you still here? Red Subtitle: Helpless YT CC: That was fun  WAT?!!
as a native iowan, shane is right. its all haunted. every corn field. also i've been here! it's so cool to see shane & ryan go somewhere that ive seen and also felt very creeped out in.
If I was the killer u would want everyone to touch the murder weapon too.
9:28 time rn to all my assignments
🤣🤣oh god I'm so vulnerable... hopefully no ghosts come and hurt me or anything that would be just terrible
What did they eat for dinner? Assuming they all ate the same thing. Perhaps the bacon is indicative that the killer was a food supplier who drugged the family so he could kill them without fighting back. I'm pretty sure the police wouldn't or couldn't drug test if the cause of death was blunt force trauma... also 1912... he could have been watching the house and slipped in to drop something in the dinner pot. Steps in a small house wouldn't be as noticeable with several people moving around the house.
GO TO THE MYRTLES TALL BOY
omg .. I have never heard of that many people viewing a crime scene. That's crazy!!
Encore!
Mmm bacon 🥓
Again buzzfeed you need to keep this running.....I don't watch any of your videos anymore except these guy's
If any house has more than 2 chimneys I automatically assume it's haunted
Now granted, being on the "ghosts aren't real" side of this debate I'm no expert, but I've always kind of liked the idea that ghosts can get stuck here because of their own internal baggage and what my mind immediately jumped to over the course of the spirit box sessions was that the killer was the one "speaking" the entire time, that they were trapped there by their own guilt, maybe reliving what they did. There wouldn't be much reason for all the "hard to stop"/"stop me" type comments from the victims.   this theory is wholly unfounded but it's what I've decided is objectively true.  earlier assessments from previous spiritual/ghost hunter-y people can be pretty easily explained as "everyone's got preconceived ideas about what an axe murderer's personality would be like." or maybe it's just been a while since then and being trapped in some kind of groundhog day ghost hell changes a dude, who knows.
At 31:56 it sounds like Ryan got an answer to his question, "Why did you do what you did here?"  I heard, "...made me."  Assuming that was the killer's ghost talking, it's possible that he felt compelled to do what he did by someone or something else.
Am laughing whenever they do the individual investigation and Shane's in there
Maybe it was the Town Marshall, that's why he let people handle the axe
They're not actually alone, there is a camera person with them. Come on, ghoul boys!
What if the killer had split personality disorder? And he came back to the non-killer personality after he murdered them and that’s why he covered the mirrors
i instinctively hate ryan's fiancé because of how envious of her i am
God I love you two🤣🤣....."I'm from Illinois and they can go f**k themselves"🤣I was thinking the same thing.... lovely people I'm sure but f**k em🤣
Left flashlight to Shane or looking at Shane?
Somebody give these guys a podcast
Glad they didn’t bring a uv light bc you can still see blood spatter everywhere if you do, they weren’t great at cleaning blood in 1912
18:59 LMAOOOOO
I wish less happened to the Moores. Ha! See what I did there...less and Moore. I'm a dork.
Wait why do they think the murderer’s ghost is in the house?
what the town marshall did made me sick to the stomach
What kind of sick ducks tour the scene of FRESH MURDERS?! WHAT KIND OF MARSHALL LET PEOPLE HANDLE THE AXE??!!
Shane screaming at the sky a few minutes in is comedy gold.
Shane screaming at the sky a few minutes in is comedy gold.
I wonder if Tye Dillinger is related to them...wait his name is Shawn Spears, nm...oops...Stillinger...not Dillinger.
All I gotta say to the flashlight debate; correlation vs causation people, correlation vs causation
I’ve been waiting for this since Johnny H posted the photo with y’all.  Whooohooooo!!!!
ryan bergara used the power of satan to murder an innocent puppet, host of a history show, with questions desing for children!!!!
Glad Ryan is just as goddamn ridiculous as ever.
"Really pleasant"
On the last episode of the season or on the Q&A episode, Ryan should let Shane destroy the spirit box with a baseball bat or something.
The flashlights still confuse me. I’ve never owned a flashlight that just turns on and off randomly
yk what they should do someday…do a video with rhett and link 😏
You guys were in Iowa and you didn’t let me know!
Pleeeease do more haunted house videos!!! Soo excited to see another upload
19:25 "probably"
Hey thanks for taking my request of going there!!!!! ❣️💕
I don’t think yu should disrespect spirits to get an answer because yu will get attached and it will drain the life out of yu.
1:42 why does Ryan look genuinely a little scared lmao
I'M SO VULNERABLE RIGHT NOW
They should go back to the sallie house and stay there for a few days for one of the episodes This final season
You know what! I don't why, this episode made me feel like Shane would be a wonderful dad. When he was chilling around 28:25 if I saw my dad doing that.. I'm 29 but I'm like damn.. I'm like scared of bugs.
Okay but as someone who grew up in Iowa, Shane's take on the entirety of Iowa being haunted is 100% accurate. You don't mess with the things that live in the cornfields. #Shaniac #postmortem
I thought they left buzzfeed?
i love that scream “ARRRRAAAAAAAAAAAGH”
this is some of the most convincing EVP i've ever witnessed on this show. like i can't even repeat the words that rattled me so much it's fucked.
"my name's shane, i am looking for the killer" "HEY, FUCKO!"  PLS I CANT
Shane at 22:18: You do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe I'm going to cry this is the sweetest thing I have ever heard, Shane checks every room before going to sleep not because he is worried, but because he is so lovely ;__;
Was the iowa hitch hiking ghost a reference to feild of dreams?
So I never understood why Ryan asks if the killer or their spirit rather,  is in these places.. is there something about the spirit of someone like a killer being present in the place where the victims passed over that I don’t know about?
I thought they were done
Bah ahaha,... “Hey my name is Shane and I’m looking for the killer,... Hey Fucko!” 😂
Lmao my mom grew up here and had a friend that grew up in that house. My cousin's dad works there 😂
Anybody else already hear about this case from Bailey?🙋🏻‍♀️
idk why you are trying to talk to the killer, like hes not the one who dies there, why would he be there
Okay okay so serious question…. If the murderer was the one who killed everyone else… then why or how would his spirit be in the house?… he’s not the one that died there??? Am I the only one whose confusion??? 💀💀
The guy with the jacket on reminds me of Edward Nordan
I think the family maybe knew their killer. I find it hard to believe NO ONE woke up. Maybe one of the kids woke up but was eased back to sleep before being killed, comforted by whoever it was.
when shane bullied the ghost into silence
7:35 which one were they calling a switch? lol
You should of kept insisting to know his name!
Why didn’t we get the theories on who dun it??
1:26 is that Michael Myers?
What a waste of bacon
The mirror thing was actually probably done because back in ye olden days it was thought souls would go into mirrors if you didn’t cover them soon after death, so that’s probably what’s going on with the mirrors being covered
Maybe the flashlight thang was the little kids and they dont know their colors 😂
cap
Shane “If I just give a little” *jumps* *whole house threatens to collapse*
I WANT A SEASON 8 PLEASE TOT
I wonder how much of the story is from all the locals looking around before the investigation. Like the meal the killer supposedly ate, seems more likely it'd be from one of the few hundred bystanders  Also on a side note, why are there so many comments from "bot" channels here? (Risky, and Bribe)
Bringing back the bowl cut 🤣
Really do love this show always brought a day of brightness to my week same with the postmortem. Thank you shane and Ryan
When I saw the word “murder” I got so excited cause I thought somehow True Crimes was back
The boys are back
are they using warm white old skool flashlight ?
I’m here from the Morbid podcast, hey weirdos!
we love a good true crime/supernatural hybrid
So basically the flashlights work by twisting them on just enough that any movement will make them turn on and off?
Wasn't this story already covered?? I swear I'm having deja vu...  Edit: Apparently I was thinking of the video done by Bailey Sarian... oops. She and gents look nothing alike... my bad 🤷‍♀️
15:31 Anybody else get a little jump scare there?
can you buy touristy stuff from the house? like I visited a axe murder house and all I got was this lame shirt?
Is there a reason why these houses don't use electricity? Is it because there isn't any for every house?
how are these guys talking to the killer? nobody knows who did it so the killer was a thousand miles away when he died and not even there
Remember Amityville Horror house where someone committed six murders and no one heard a thing because it was demonic possession same with this house I am sure!
I love the goul boys
Why am I the only one that still thinks any flashlight turning off and on when I tell it too is creepy AF? I've never had a flashlight turn randomly off and on, maybe flicker if the battery is low, but off and on??? No way.
when ur from iowa and have never heard of an Iowa-illinois 'turf' war lolz
all that wackin' made him hungry! Should've saved the Bacon!
7:16 the ghost farted
Yes sir hi! It’s me in all seriousness what if the murder was a family friend someone they invited in that meal could’ve been prepared earlier and not eaten which is why weren’t suspicious of the murder being in the house he could make as much noise as wanted #postmortem
It's crazy how many multi-channel phrases came out of the spirit box IN THE SAME VOICE and no one is talking about this! We all know how much of a let down the spirit box is otherwise with random radio clips. This was different!
The wildest part of them all sleeping through the slaughtering isn’t that the house is so small, it’s that many of them not only shared rooms but BEDS. How do you not wake up when the person lying next to you is being murdered with an axe???
“aaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGHHH”  -Shane 2021
The ax man is back
Good to know my birthday is on one of the most horrific murders 🥲
A gruesome murder of 2 adults and 6 children, in a town of 2000 people, and people who had to have know victims parade through the crime scene and play with the murder weapon? Yeeeeah. Sounds like they didn't want the murder solved.
It’s so cool you guys came to Iowa! I know we are pretty boring but means a lot lmao
This is the best series of buzzfeed ever
They came home from church and the neighbor cooked for them they ate and were very tired. And went to bed. The neighbor lady had drugged them.
Toured her a couple of times. Met the owner before he died.
Some people believe that the Ax murder was a homeless person with a mental illness.
ok but like this episode actually freaks me out because while i don't fear like a ghost appearing in my house, i do very much fear someone breaking in and murdering me!!!!!!!!!!
(yeef)
Axe man and razor boy at it again probably
Great! I wasn’t gonna watch it unless Shane and Ryan were in it… 🥲😩
Poor guys upset
The only scary thing about that house is the spelling of "Axe"
This needs to be a Netflix series
Have they done the Amityville murder house on Long Island? If not, DO IT
So proud of Ryan
Word of advice, I’ve personally been to that house along with a bunch other haunted places. It takes the sports at least 30 seconds to be able to process the question and flip on the flash light.
At 7:30 I thought I heard "Loaf of bread"
Well you know, murdering works up an appetite.....
For postmortem: does Shane actually believe that  the energy in there is off? IS HE STARTING TO BELIEVE? #boogara
Shane: “ghosts aren’t really” also Shane: *spirit box makes noise* “what did he say?!”  lol
who  tf is fred
It’s about damn time this happened! Good video.
When I'm playing phasmophobia I take the Shane approach, kick the door down like HEY FUCKO
why is nobody talking about how the spirit box had the same male voice every time??? that’s gotta be the most compelling stuff yet
shane sounds like just the sweetest boyfriend
7:50 spirit got sad after hearing what Shane being rough with him 🤣 So that is why no response from the latter...
1:26 Being from Iowa we say the exact same thing about people from Illinois 😂
What happened to the elderly couple that went in with the man that was stabbed? Surely they would have been there too or at least knew something about the night??
For Postmortem: "i'm reaching out to whoever murdered in this house" but why would the murderer be in the house? wouldn't just the victims be there? someone explain ghost science if that's not the case tho
For postmortem: It seems like whoever killed everyone felt guilty. With all the "stop me" and "help me" chat, as well as the nonchalant making of a breakfast. Could be that they were in shock? This is just a theory, but it is interesting
YAAAAAAAY
For postmortem: What does Shane think about the voice captured on the recorder whispering "what is it?" It was so clear it seems that either it was faked or it was real.
When the ghost was saying switch I think he wanted to kill one of them he didn’t want one of them have the spare box and also in the other room he told him to kill him
I’m from Iowa and Illinois….i don’t like Illinois
I hope they do another active haunting like at the Hannah Williams house
No one's talking about how those two random girls just came over for a sleepover and they ended up getting murdered. 🙃
Ah the crossover of True crime into the Paranormal   who dun it ?
Looks like Ryan and Shane really decided to try something new with their appearance during the pandemic. Ryan's looking pretty sharp, although I have to say Shane is kind of starting to look like a blonde Edgar Allen Poe X'D I don't know why that occurred to me, it just did.
0:54 my favorite part in every video
You guys should do burrari house of horror
Bummer you got murdered :( wanna turn off this light?
I feel like this is one of the most relevant evidence gathered with the spirit box! and the What Is It? was so clear! so exciting.
do you think it's possible that someone in the house committed the murders? like a murder suicide?
that towel wrapped bacon tho
Pig in a blanket?
Is there any indication that the victims were drugged? Or was everyone in the house just an insane heavy sleeper? Especially to have people being murdered in the same room as you with the BACK end of an axe which mustve been way harder and louder than the sharp edge? The door was locked so was the house keys ever found?
The mirror thing may actually be a superstitious thing. In some magick it’s believed that mirrors are a portal between the worlds of the living and the deal, and it’s possible that superstition may have been a factor.
I know its frightening to be in these situations-- for Ryan at least lol, but I have always wished that they would change tactics a bit based on where they are. For example when they were in the room where the girls were murdered, instead of being loud and harsh I wish they'd be more reassuring and kind. It may sound silly but I wonder if trying to establish a trusting connection would help see better results in places like this. Just my thoughts, loving these episodes, can't believe its the last season :(
#Postmortem is it possible that the brother was the murderer? The murderer was clearly comfortable in the house and even had a key, just like the brother did as well. What if he had some type of resentment toward the family and decided to finally carry it out. #Boogeraalways
If you are looking for more on the Villisca axe murders, I HIGHLY recommend listening to morbid podcasts 2 part series on it. Very well researched!
Real Life Phasmo
Iowa actually is really, really loud at night in June. Loud bugs.
In Victorian times, and previously, it was believed that spirits could be trapped in mirrors, so people would cover mirrors and open windows after a death to make sure the spirit traveled on and didn’t stick around.
You guys should TOTALLY do a collab with the girls from the Morbid podcast! They just covered the Villisca Murder house!
Download these precious videos separately before Buzzfeed will remove them.  Maybe we will not be able to see em again.
I TAKE ONE BREAK FROM YOUTUBE... Im late, but glad the boys are back!
Covering mirrors is a common practice after death in a few different religions like Judaism. It's so the soul doesn't get trapped inside the mirror or confused by what it sees.
In every unsolved murders it’s assumed it was a male.
Is this show a comedy now or do they not actually care about finding ghosts?
💌💘💘💛🧡🧡❤❣💞🤎💗💗💗💗💓💓💞JESUS LOVES YALL 💘 💖 ❤ 💕 💗 💓 💘 💖 ❤ 💕 💗 💓 💘 💖 ❤ 💕 💗 💓 💘 💖 ❤ 💕
I wonder if the covered mirrors were related to the covering mirrors and stopping clocks superstition.
Not to be callous, but after the killer hacked all 8 without any issues, I’m sure they must have thought “well, that went better than I could have hoped”.
28:19 Behind Sane that is a fingure standing or...
26:13 "now i just think he's an insane person" thats fair
26:26 Behind Sane Right back in the Mirror did you see face.
nothing screams haunted house more than a giant sign that says "ax murder" in front
the bed literally moved
Have you see them. "Just one" 19:56
i was genuinely scared for shanes mental health at 9:30
Shane: "I'm so vulnerable right now! Oh my goddd! 😣" 🤣🤣🤣
For #postmortem: The “what is it” was quite weird because it sounded like the wife asking the husband what the noise was they heard downstairs or something and they didn’t know it was the the murderer.
Just creeped out by the doll eyes behind Ryan when he is sitting in the attic😂😂😂
** FOR POSTMORTEM: what theories do you guys have about why the entire household could have been slain without anyone waking up?? such a creaky house (plus the ax mark on the ceiling) why didn't anyone hear what was going on? PS: morbid podcast did an amazing 2 part series on this case too!
21:00 I dont think it was the killer, seeing as "putty" wasn't even invented until 1943.
I think the butcher did it because there was bacon 2 lb of it laying on the floor
Do Ellen Greenberg next! We need your insights
the boys are back in town
What if it was the brother? could have let himself in, after putting something in the food (maybe invited himself to dinner)to make them all sleep heavier? the Town Marshall could have been in on it and ruined the crime scene on purpose. Would have been no need to steal money etc as a relative the brother would have probably got everything anyway?
tbh I heard 'let us in' instead of 'what is it?'
It was the town Marshal. Mystery solved. He returned to the scene, showed everyone the work that he was proud of, contaminated the whole thing while hiding in plain sight.
Okay okay but can ghost even see in color?? I can picture this spirit getting soooo frustrated 💀
After I started the video, I had a feeling so unsettling unlike any other video from the ghoul boys.... don't like it one bit 😟
Imagine being a ghost and trying to communicate with the spirit box and get frustrated. "THIS THING SUCKS!"
#postmortem: didn't the cops have anything to say to the marshall about the handling of the crime scene? is there any record of any explanation the marshall may have given?
Shane: im SO vulnerable right now oh my GOD
31:53 HE SAID PP
why is no one talks about the flash lights ?
cigarette butts and bloody footprints  sounds like a banger title for a book....the genre is anyone's guess
Check out Seaview Mental hospital in Staten Island, NY! It’s an abandoned mental ward that’s been untouched by the state since the 50’s. There were so many horrible things that happened there by the staff as well as a serial killer called “Cropsey” that preyed on the mentally challenged children. The place is huge (37 buildings) and there is so much folk lore surrounding it.
When Ryan was in the attic alone that little doll on the chair behind him scared tf out of me
do you think the murderer was paid by someone to kill this family? Maybe that's why he covered their faces with cloth to sorry for because killing them wasn't his choice #Boogara
“100 people toured the house with the bodies still in it” wow that is a crime scene nightmare, almost as bad as the Oj Simpson case
#Postmortem - Shane seemed legitimately creeped out by his time alone. I don't think I've ever seen that before. Are all these spooky places wearing his psyche down? As a proud Shaniac, I hope not! #ItsJustTheWind
Shane: *exits closet* “What occurred?”
Stop using the ‘f’ word. Makes you sound extremely ignorant.
"You do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe" awwwww
Could it have been the axeman of New Orleans on vacation?
Damn the voices through the spirit box were straight-up unnerving. Almost the most ' evidence' in one video itself.  Edit- I don't know how the spirit box works but Ig it takes effort for them also to communicate with the real world through it, hence the garbled pieces of phrases. And even for the flashlight case, to physically move or tap on something takes more effort than we are assuming.
Shane is looking real good this season :)
Omg SHANE I'm deceased from laughing!Ryan can't take you nowhere what made you jump in that shaky house like that! lol
Indirectly giving the ghost sass by demoting Shane's given ghoul rank to a mere ghost, feels bad man. He was a ghoul for good... idk 5min.
Woah, woah woah...how did the dude just waltz on in if the door was locked? The lady tried it, the the dude shows up and walla?
Shane is evolving into the ultimate Dad as the seasons go on, especially with that mustache!
Man, why is it every time that a family gets violently murdered in their sleep, that the kids had friends over
Shane is the real MVP. This show would be unwatchable without Shane.
Hehe If you know Shane is just legit cuz I think he is a god of memes !
Post Mortem: I know you didn't go too in depth of the details but I think the bacon on the floor was from the killer using the grease for masturbation. :-/ I know it's a gruesome thought but there was sexual things done to girls. Plus there was other similar families killed by an axe murder in surrounding states which would make this a serial killer.
I would’ve thought that with how much they’ve caught on this episode, that Ryan would actually defecate himself instead he was so confident😜#growth
Postmortem: do you think it's hard for the ghosts (if they exist) to interact with the spirit box and they get frustrated when you threaten them to turn it off???? no, you only think about you (kinda roastmortem?)
Their tone with 'Here comes the spirit box' is strangely familiar. I just can't pinpoint what it is. 😏
Tell my why at 7:08 I heard “good soup” 😂😭
Oh there's a lotta turf alright, and it belongs to the Iowans. I've lived on this border for 20 years and the aomunt of city wide wars we've had are immaculate and they are bloody as all-get-out. So good thing you weren't tresspassing to long...
im not sure if im convinced by this one but it seems like the ghost of the murderer is asking them to help him stop because they asked why he killed them and it replied "hard to stop" then when they were in the kids room it kept saying "help me stop" or "stop me"
shane disrespecting every spirit they talk to and leaving unharmed make me doubt if ghosts really exist  bcs if i was a ghost I’d def fight him💀
#postmortem: what is Shanes explanation for the words coming out of the spirit box? I mean, they are kinda scary though, even if you don't believe in ghosts haha
There’s a theory about the bacon but I don’t wanna be the one to tell them….
17:16 I have that same boobah. It also hides  in the closet. Spooky :0
Sheets over  miors can be seen as a ritual to keep spirits from moving on
Future idea, Buzzfeed unsolved international, where you guys go to haunted and chilling places across the globe
im sorry but this episode has to be one of the creepiest vibe, i kept getting goosebumps
pre health and safety heavy duty sleeping pills were big back then probably not even recorded in the investigation they were so common. also doubt the floor was that creeky 100 years ago.
You know one of these days i have a feeling that Shane is gonna get scared....like really scared...
Been waiting for this episode for so long! Sort of a morbid case of home state pride in knowing that a place this messed up is right in the state where I was born and raised. Hope you guys liked Iowa!
Just a theory… the sheriff committed the murders. He let the crime scene get contaminated and let people swing the axe to remove and skew the evidence so it would never be traced back to him
#Postmortem  what if the town marshall was the killer and intentionally had people cover up his tracks by having them hold the axe?
The bed clearly moved! 👀
This is a bit of a reach but could the two pounds of bacon have been a pound of flesh for each of the girls who were sleeping over? Maybe the killer wanted to get rid of the family but saw the two friends as innocent and left the two pounds of flesh to try and settle the debt? With him or her covering the mirrors as well this killer seems to have been trying to be oddly courteous to the spirits of the people they murdered. 😅
who ever got Shane to lay on the floor with scratches on it ( aka the axe marks ) deserves a raise!! Freaky AF! XD
ryan : "went in" shane : im surprise i dont hear any scream right now
Can you do Oslo woman case
As sad as I am for just getting into Unsolved a few months ago, they’d better end Unsolved with an “Unsolved Mystery” just for the fun
What if this is a hot fuzz situation and there's way more people involved than one person? It's easy to not wake everyone up if they are all killed at the same time. After the house was flooded with people it would be easy to overlook many sets of footprints etc.
When the horrible tragedy that now plagues this house happened on your birthday.
Shane isn’t scared because he picks up the personality of each ghost/demon everywhere he goes
I’m on neutral ground about ghosts, and I usually tend to side with Shane but that ‘what is it’ gave me chills and a general sense of unease
7:00 - I'm hearing -  "to please me"  it's  so eery and hard to tell ....😨 that was DEF some thing tho!!!
For postmortem: you guys are liars and are cutting out all the ghost footage just so you could stay true to the name of the show and keep it going.
anyone have an id on shane’s jacket in this ep?
9:25 ryan thats the point of shane! people would think oh those hooves mark are from horses but people with wild minds would go to the extreme and say they're from uniorns which in paranormal world, if you put the light switch in the middle of the on and off it till have a tendency to fluctuate  abnormally to which some people would say "ahhh ghost".  and there's more scientific reason why a light would fluctuate in different scenarios. which in shanes difference, having that as your support evidence that the 8 ghost are still there is not strong support evidence
Pigs in a Blanket
The guy absolutely snuck into there house while they were away
I've going to be so mad if you guys don't do Sloss Furnace in your last season. That place is fucked. If there are ghosts. They are there.
When your sitting on the bed and dudes in the closet  something is standing next to u up on the bed
#postmoretem Listening to the description of the scene in the house and how the town reacted to it the whole thing sounds like a cult sacrifice/offering. Perhaps something the town heads agreed on either for better harvest or to keep the town safe from natural disasters. It would explain the covering over the mirror and faces of the victims and the random slab of bacon. The town marshal could have been in on it which is why he let people come in to see the scene and let people hold the axe. To show those in the know that the ritual was completed and to cover up the evidence with the public.
#postmortem You were confused about the murderer covering the mirrors- considering that mirrors have often been considered a doorway for spirits, is it possible that he believed in ghosts and didn’t want the spirits of his victims to be able to come after him in the moment?
The fact no one heard their screamed or hear any ax killings is pretty much eerie
So it's not cancelled?
Uhmm why were they trying to contact the spirit of the murderer though? It’s not as if he died in that house too
shane: "a great deal of my time was spent napping.."  i want that on my tombstone
For Postmortem: did it spook Shane even a little when he was in there alone and the flashlights were "responding"? For a very brief moment, I hoped he was going to get scared - and then I remembered when he laid down in the pentagram.
The town Marshall did it,
the banter and energy of this video was top tier
I went there last Halloween!
Does it bother anyone else that Ryan doesn't have eyebrows during pre-talk
Man, I really wish for one spinoff episode Ryan and Shane would play Phasmaphobia together.
The ghost box replies in this episode eerily sounds like someone who's either in need of desperate help or ecstatic from taking lives, almost as if both victims and the killer resides the house. the amount of "help", "killed" and "stop" from the box is insane you could almost play a drinking game with it.
no bc it was always the same guy's voice talking
IMO-It's crazy how much Shane looks like John Lennon....maybe that's why he's not afraid of ghosts because he's.....iykuk
go to the suicide forest in japan
Funny how this is in Iowa cause nothing is there
Okay so the bacon- Murderer is about to have his meal, realises there are more people than he thought, puts it down to kill the other two girls.
As a minnesotan, the Midwest turf war almost made me walk away 😅
Whens the q and a
im scared
Pretty sure this murder was the work of a serial killer known as the Man From The Train. It's possible that this murder and the murders that the Hinterkaifeck farm were the work of the same person! Bedtime Stories has two really fascinating episodes about this that I strongly recommend!
For postmortem: At 32 minutes when Ryan was alone using the spirit box I thought the response sounded like “easy” #postmortem #boogaras #ShaneIsADemon
🤞 Fingers crossed that this episode preceeds a return of the Hot Daga.
When did Ryan come out of the closet?
I wonder how it feels as a ghost in there when your killer also resides in the same house you are haunting.
Did Ryan read Dune before going into this season. "Fear is the mind killer"
Maybe it was multiple people, that would explain why none of them woke up (one person could’ve gone downstairs, the other upstairs) and also why the word one was said on the spirit box
9:28 😆😂 22:01 amityville like What happens if u take cloth off 🪞
You’re both giving alien 👽
I don't get it. Why would the murderer (or his ghost) be in the house?
some random things I noticed from this episode: - 7:50 - the clock on the dresser is at 3:00 (idk if this was intentional or accidental) - 14:47 - it also sounds like the voice is saying "let us in" - 20:43 - the EVP in the background is moving to Ryan's voiceover (really cool detail) - 22:57 - kinda sounds like "invisible" or "invincible"
17:45 this is such an insane shot knowing Shane is just standing in the closet 💀
This was National news until the Titanic sank a few days later
No mention of how Lina was displayed? Goes a lot to motive in my opinion. Also the mother was only one who the sharp edge was used on
solidly spooky
For Post Mortem: Have you guys given any thought to starting your own ghost hunting show on Watcher?
This is possibly the most coherent the spirit box has ever been, which is really interesting. It doesn't mean much, but it *is* fun. Poor Shane losing his mind trying to explain why the lights don't work.
Decided not to stay over?
Am I really the only one that saw that movement in the corner in 26:44? Or is it just my imagination?
as an Iowan I was absolutely tickled to see u in Villisca! If it’s june, the cicadas were definitely very loud. Also, I know people who have family in Villisca and they say the whole town is creepy. Did it feel like keddie at all? #postmortem
Sure seems like the killer was a disturbed person with little control over their actions, just from all the EVP they picked up in the episode...
hang on a sec, that's the house from a 90's made for TV movie about Charlie Starkweather!?
why does shane look like kevin spacey
Uncover the mirrors to ask the spirits-
damn we got true crime and supernatural in one episode. this truly is the end of an era
it's.. kind of horrifying that the town marshal let citizens of the town into the home and PRETEND TO USE THE AXE. with the bodies still there. they were a small town. many of those people probably knew the family and yet they treated a horrific murder like a.. show??
Oh hey, the man from the train
someone has to be really fcked in the head to not only gruesomely murder two adults, but *six* children. one of them a toddler.
Post mortem: Weird that they became a showcase to the town after the incident (that being said) Wouldn’t it be possible that the Mayor or maybe the head of the town had a grudge with the family then decided to kill them all and have them for display of his work? Lol sort of like medieval times where the tyrant king would show the beheaded people at the front of his gates to warn them of the consequences etc etc  Maybe unlikely but it is off putting to have it turn into a show even with the bodies laying around. That’s just inhumane.
Did anyone notice the boobah
This was legitimately the most I’ve ever felt like one of the locations was haunted, I truly feared for Shane’s life
Idk about anyone else but if my family was getting murdered i would not wake up I’m a heavy sleeper
I already know it’s the town Marshall, there has to be some kind of vendetta between the guy who owned the home and him because who even leaves the bodies in there and also let’s people handle evidence…
For postmortem: On the topic of the killer covering all of the faces, mirrors, and windows, covering mirrors after death was also a common tradition around the time to prevent spirits from getting trapped in them. It was almost like the murderer was mimicking the rituals of a family member, respecting them enough to try and ease their souls’ passage into Heaven. So in addition to the killer being ashamed, the mirror thing could also suggest that the family was murdered by someone who knew them personally (or maybe they were just afraid of the spirits coming back for revenge).
I somehow think that even if ghosts are real, they surely would be really scared of Shane and that's why he wouldn't see them even if they would be there XD They would show only to Ryan and escape from Shane XD Shane again has this dad mustache~ I kinda wonder if he's just getting used to be a dad and would be one soon^-^" I kinda felt it's possible^-^"
I’m related to the people who got murdered in this house. An investigator came to us and made us a book of our family tree and how we are connected to them.
THERE BACK
"Can't split us up we're ghoul brothers" I was half expecting Shane to say  "Maybe we should take turns in the room"
I've been here too! Used to live in Iowa, really creepy vibes and a TON of paranormal activity 👻!!!
that town marshal's suspicious as hell
theory: the town marshall was the one behind it all and he forced someone to commit murders with BIG dirt on the person. since he was well known, the rumor would have spread around and it could have been something that got the person killed or tortured, which would be why the person who asked for help and said that they're miserable said those things, and they could have been the murderer.
For #postmortem this episode seemed like it could have been a cool crossover episode between true crime and supernatural. #hotdaga
I think it was the Marshall... Thats why he contaminated the scene and evidence on the murder weapon.
Is it possible that the family was somehow drugged and that's why they didnt wake up to see the killer?
As an iowan i can confirm the state of iowa is indeed haunted
Please make this a Netflix series
I didn’t Shane was from Illinois!!!! I used to live there!
I just solved this case. It's the town marshall. You can thank me later.
14:46 "what is it?"
Postmortem  Morbid Podcast just did an episode on this. They are big fans, have you heard about their podcast they do a a really good job and they love your show
i’m from iowa and i’m ON THE FLOOORORORO
The scariest thing is my exam tomorrow and the other exam the day after that, and how I cant study for them.
im not thru the whole video but something about asking "why did you do it?" and getting "i couldnt stop" and then later getting "ill kill him. stop it. stop me." thats spooky O_O
Who hungs  up washing at 5am? 😱 🤔
This reminds me of the German Hinterkaifeck case. Many similarities. An entire family killed in their sleep with an axe. Nothing was stolen. The killer stayed in the house for several days afterwards, cooked himself meals and fed the animals.
Favorite YouTube channel
Shane came out of the closet
Ryan: the spirit gravitates to antagonistic people Shane, the notorious ghost antagoniser: a great deal of my time was spent napping   That's pretty par for the course, I think.
You guys should do combined episode with ash and Alaina from morbid please 🥺
Is always the years 1970 or under😂 specially 1920 under
A few years ago Ryan would've been crying and throwing up at that flashlight business
Had to come over when Ash and Alaina from Morbid Podcast said you two were here!
i’ve been here before
As a Wisconsinite Midwestern I can tell you Shane is right we hate each other I hate Minnesotans the most
come on this videos do so good keep making more seasons and yeah ghost are probably not real but who cares we want Shane and Ryan energy
finally the old content is back
I think this house and Lizzy Borden should be left alone and be respected. Although I enjoy it I believe that it should not be made into a bed and breakfast or any haunted attraction for fame or money. Let them rest in peace especially with how they were killed
Wonder if the dad had beef with the town butcher.
That ghost dildo crack was so remarkably uncalled for and I don’t know how to handle it
the scariest part of this episode was the suggestion that the killer had been hiding in the attic until the family went to sleep. I was fully prepared for Ryan to bust out "it was a demon" but he hit me with that instead and now I'm really regretting watching this when I was home alone 😣
That duo is just perfect
You should come to the ancient Ram in Gloucestershire UK
Shane looks like wattson from the Sherlock Holmes movies
HEYYY you finally took my advice and made an episode at this intriguing site👍👍🕴
Why would the murders spirit be there? Just victims only right?
i think he used the bacon to.. uhhh.. ya know lol
Did more people live in the house after this tragedy? When did it become a museum??
Lol it says pp 31:55
Torch literally switching on and off in front of you.... Shane: I Don't Believe in Ghost. Wtf😂
Is the spirit box just picking up radio waves.
I live in Iowa😂 I’m so happy y’all are covering something in Iowa!
Ryan's whole persona has changed doing these. Remember when he never wanted the ghosts to know his name and now he's like  "Boo! It's me Ryan..."
what a creepy place
(yeef)
YOU GUYS WERE IN IOWA AND NEVER TOLD ME?!?!?
i’m upset that it’s ax murder and not axE murder where tf did the e go wtf
What if it was a murder /suicide and the dad did it!? The dad was the only one killed with the sharp end of the 🪓 annnnd it could explain why the killer's soul is still there. Maybe? Possibly?
"Sounds like michael rooker" 😂😂
“Hey fucko!”
That spirit box is so noyzeee! 🤪 EXCELLENT episode!!!
The story with the man who got stabbed sounds kinda fishy. He checked in with two elderly people and they used the rooms in the upper floor? The elderly people I know always are sleeping in the ground floor, avoiding any kind of steps.
When you decide to play a prank on a trespasser 😂
Been waiting for this for so long ahhhh
You’re telling me you came to Iowa and I DIDNT KNOW
Post question: will you guys give up ghost hunting once you finish you contract at buzzfeed or will you do it on the watcher? Just wondering because you guy  are the best ghost hunters to ever live
My thoughts: The bacon wrapped in a towel kind of reminds me of pigs in a blanket. Maybe it was a clever way to show how the killer viewed his victims.   The fact that the killer waited quietly and patiently in the house shows the behavior of a predator yet the murderer did not torture his victims. On the contrary, it seems like he tried to make their deaths as clean, quick, and painless as possible. He also covered the bodies (out of respect?) and the mirrors like he didn't want their spirits to be trapped or linger. It's a bit confusing and eerie.
"You do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe." WHAT ABOUT YOUR CAT SHANE HOW DARE YOU
i stayed the night in this house with my family. it was so freakin scary
Couldn’t pin why I like Shane so much- now realizing it’s just because he’s from Illinois 😂 he speaks to my Midwestern soul
Pun attended or not
I've stayed the night here! Also, I sat alone for 30 mins in that closet trying to catch EVPs.
I always like to imagine that when an investigative team studies a house and is unsuccessful its because Sam led Dean Winchester beat them to the punch and the place is no longer haunted.
Postmortem: I think it was the neighbour lady. In many cases the person reporting the body is the actual killer. Maybe she was having an affair with Josiah and that’s why he was the one attacked with the sharp end of the ax. He was bigger than her and she was scorned by him. As a close neighbour probably also had a key to their house and just lied about it.
For #postmortem: why didn't you spend the night? Wasn't it allowed? Love you both 💖
What are you guys spirit box called and where did you buy it? Trying to find it but it's hard 😮
reason why they can't capture evidence; shane be scaring ghosts 😭😭
The ax murder house isn’t even that scary I pass that house every day
do include the Bhangarh fort in this series, given that it is the final one and is well known for supernatural evidence...
the "what is it" from the parents bedroom sounded like a female voice. maybe the wife investigating the recorder left behind in their bedroom?
Finally! Did you see some people think that it was the same murderer as the New Orleans Axe murderer? Just jumped off/on the train. #Bergara #GhostsAreReal #TurtlesAreRealAsWell #JustSaying #IdkWhyISaidThat #GetOffMyBack #Hashtag
17:16 did anyone else see that purple booba in the closet lmfao
Since the town sherif or whatever let everyone contaminate the crime scene I wonder if it was him.
My nams is Josiah what does this mean lol
"Well, unicorns aren't real." Best moment of the series.
If there was a correlation between murders and ghosts, wouldn't pretty much every prison across America be mega haunted? Just saying... 🤐
#postmortem did the ghoul boys intentionally make this a supernatural and a true crime wrapped in one? If so, bravo
do you think the murders could have been prevented if they had just played some jazz?!
Why does no one suspect the father? Only one killed with the sharp end, slash in the wall in his bedroom, mirrors and faces covered, a last meal was eaten. Murder/suicide is legit the only answer here. The killer never left the house, it was Josiah.
For #postmortem Is there no way you’ll come visit Texas State University?
Will Ryan become a Shaniac by the end of the series? Hmm...
I'd say that the mirrors were covered to stop spirits from getting trapped in them; that was an old practice at the time in grieving homes. Might line up with the "stop me" refrain #postmortem
Why is no one talking about how creepy the doll is that is sitting on the chair while Ryan did his individual investigation in the attic.
It’s a pretty common superstition in the south that you have to cover the mirrors in the homes of the recently deceased, as its believed their souls can be trapped in the mirror until the person has been laid to rest.
Ryan: "Why did you do what you did here?" Ghost: "PP" 31:52
“investigators from kindred spirits” Me:Yeeeeeesssss!
im really watching this while in bed …
Idk if anyone has commented this, but they used to cover mirrors so that the person's soul wouldn't get trapped inside. Idk if that's what the intent was, but if so that's very interesting that the murderer put them up
They should definitely start a podcast!
For postmortem: you guys kept asking about the mirrors being covered and I’m not sure if this is why but it’s a widely used practice in different religions to cover mirrors after a death in the house. Depending on the religion or culture it means different things but when of them is to stop the persons soul from getting trapped in the mirror so they can pass on. I’m pretty sure that most of the reasons have to do with making an easier passage for a persons soul to be at rest #postmortem
For postmortem: If the axe murderer has indeed returned to the house as a ghost, it has a few implications. Mainly that ghosts return to places that hold a lot of significance to them, whether it be positive or negative. My question to the goul boys is: where do you think you would return as a spirit? #bergarasriseup
#postmortem not really a question but, negative spirits feed off negative energy such as fear, so when shane goes in with no fear the spirits arent really interested in him because they know they went get anything out of you. Been watching forever, Love you guys! #Boogara #DoAHotdagaSpinOffShow
There is a theory regarding the slab of bacon that it was used by the killer to masturbate. But I understand why you didn't add that into the show lol this series is a little more light hearted
In old days, they covered mirrors in the room that someone has passed, in order to stop the spirits from being trapped inside the mirror
❤❤❤❤❤❤
It looked like a man in that bed upstairs.when you were alone.Ryan
I have watched all of the seasons since the very beginning, but the footage with the flashlights in the past two episodes has me trying to remember. Have the ghoul boys ever caught some kind of shadow/apparition on camera? Anything more than just some lights flickering, doors closing etc.?
The sheet on the mirror doesn’t mean he was ashamed. Many people believe that spirits get trapped in houses and things of that sort, that’s why some cover up mirrors so that spirits won’t travel into the home or another body, also it’s to block out bad spirits. Many also believe that if you look into a mirror after a close friend or relative dies it can cause them to stay trapped in the mirror for eternity, that could possibly be the reason for the sheets over the mirrors.
I believe that the murderer had plenty of practice. He pulled the curtains, covered all the reflective surfaces, positioned lamps under chairs, etc, etc. He knew exactly how to hit them, killing them in silence, no one waking up. Dude was a serial killer.
they were murdered in ther beds?!
Hope you guys liked Iowa! And I personally take that our whole state is haunted as a compliment :D
I always agree with Shane that the torch and EVP have no basis in science. A cursory look at the wikipedia page of these will even show the psychology behind them, showing that they cannot possibly provide evidence of the paranormal. Irrespective of this I'll miss this series. Much love #shaniacforlife
when ryan was the the attic alone, I expected to see shane's head pop into the doorway and say "Boo".
Shane and Ryan going to the murder house while Ash and Alaina cover the murders the same week... we have been blessed
Listen to morbids episode on this if u wanna know more about the bacon ☠️ let’s just say there’s a theory that it was used for… personal reasons.
Just saying, I doubt whoever actually did it is actually still in the house.
Shane: "I bring good vibes" Can't argue with that Shaney boy
I think the town Marshall committed the murders. He let everyone enter the home, and handle the axe so that any evidence would be contaminated.
they need to make shane and ryan as characters you can play in phasmophobia
Ryan: Well Unicorns aren't real, Ghosts ARE real.  Shane: *head explodes into mushroom cloud* AAAAAAAGH 😤🤯
I thought we weren’t gonna see these anymore YAY
#PostMortem: At 30:49 and 30:50, I find a golden/red light flicker twice, which is towards the left side (as appears to the views) of a white colour rectangular frame kinda thing which has black, or void space inside the frame, that can be seen behind the left shoulder of Ryan. {try watching it at 0.25 or 0.5 playback speed to notice it}. And that looks strange to me. Is that the light from any candle, torch, machines or cameras that you guys placed earlier? Or, is that an activity of any spirits/ghosts? Point made by a loyal Boogara! 😃
im so dissapointed that this is the last season this is my favourite series i think ever
Anybody got a rational explanation for the bed moving? I rewatched it, but I genuinely can't spot a cause
every time ryan says "i am not my fear i am stronger than my fear" in my head im like *fear is the mind killer*
Honestly the Town Marshall could have done it and then let the entire town come in and contaminate the evidence because..... wtf?
We all know you want to bring back buzzfeed true crime, so announce another season, and let us all be happy!
Loved this episode of true crime
#postmortem is it possible that the murderer managed to blend in and escape the house when the influx of towns people arrived at the house.
Ilove watching this Shane cracks me up and Ryans reactions are priceless lol👻👻👻
Woke up to a icky rainy day but find buzzfeed drop a new spooky 👻 video?!?! Hell yes 🙌 😺🖤
Everyone in Villisca is a meth head
Demons check their closets and under their beds for Shane.
Is just me or has Ryan’s voice over style changed?
For some unknown reason I always think ghosts have like a challenge that the person who completes it will like rule or some sh*t  It’s to scare Shane Madej the whole challenge would be to scare him demons have participated in the challenge as well and no one’s succeeded so far
I started this journey as a Boogara and now... im sorry Ryan... I am a Shaniac #Shaniac
They're here... <3
For postmortem: I remember reading a theory that the Axeman of New Orleans could be the perp? And that he moved around, continuing his spree and ending up in Germany and committing the Hinterkaifeck murders (similar - whole family murdered, no one knows by who). Is it possible the same guy was travelling around and killing random families?
Why would the murders spirit be in the house tho
#BuzzFeed please don't do jokes and humors, do a proper serious investigation further on please..
bed didn't move
I wonder what the stillinger girls parents reactions were what if it was them🤔😂
Why can't Shane admit that he is the demon and the ghosts fear him.
why would the spirit of the axe murder be in the house? he never died inside it.
#postmortem Covering the mirrors is usually done as people think they are portals/something can come through them. If I believed in this type thing I would postulate that he was possessed and the demon/ghost in his body didn't want to go back into the portals (also why the bodies might have been covered). The "stop me" repeating over on spirit box maybe be him asking someone to stop him from murdering as he was aware what was happening
#postmortem what could be a possible motive for the killer? i mean, just a hypothesis but the covering of the mirrors and the curtains and how he made himself food after... (this is a stretch but) it could be cos the killer doesn't look good-> never got married and had kids-> was always jealous of this family-> and then was like if i cant have it, you cant situation... also kinda links into why he could be haunting the house?
The fact the voices are consistent throughout the spirit box sessions are kinda freaky
This was a perfect combo of True Crime + Supernatural
the town Marshall's very suspicious- he let everybody hold the ax maybe to remove him from the top list of suspects...
9:29 textbook example of Shaneshock
for post mortem: werent there some sources that said sarah moore was the only one who was hit with the sharp end of the axe, instead of josiah? i also read somewhere that the murderer covered the mirror and the victim's faces (which has similiraties in other axe murders during that time period btw) because they mightve had a thing about feeling that someone's watching them.  I personally don't believe in ghosts but i do believe in energy left by people in specific places and considering how 8 people were brutally murdered in the house, I would say what the housekeeper said about it having an effect on people's mental state is probably true since there would be a lot of negative energy left here
I’m surprised Shane is still alive after talking sh1t to the spirits in the house.
if u wanna explore u can go to lizzie borden axe house
Perhaps the killer brought the bacon to express what Shane also said - “we got beef, and so i killed ‘em”
imagine the murderer toured the house the next morning with the bodies and axe still inside just admiring his work
There’s an image of a man on Shane’s left side wall and it scared the beejeezus in me. You guys need not use red on the captions in your video. Hard to read
must have been batman
You should check out the book “The Man From The Train” by Bill James and Rachel McCarthy James who connects a great many similar axe murders of entire families, including the Villisca murders, from 1898 to 1912, suggesting it could be the work of a serial killer traveling by train.
Did the murderer put the clothes over the mirrors? If so, that is a custom in certain cultures and could be a clue into who murdered the family.
There was a string of similar murders, all using the blunt side of an ax, closed curtains to avoid people looking in, bed sheet covers to avoid blood splatter & all near train tracks to mute sound & leave quickly. There were several suspects, each with different insane, plausible motives that would have made an awesome true crime episode.
At 23.04 the female voice doesn’t say “Helpless” but “That was fun”.  Fact is most of the interpretations of the spirit box are off. It’s hard to hear the actual words, but the subtitles doesn’t fit what the box says.
Why are haunted places in America so clean
PLEASE TELL ME THE "UNICORNS ARENT REAL, BUT GHOST ARE REAL" CONVERSATION IS AN AUDIO IN TIKTOK 😫😫😫
What if it was a hired killing carried out by someone close to the family? Would explain the compassion for the bodies. #postmortem
Hey I was thinking, for the future visits of haunted places, could you guys bring a camera with you? Like a DSLR you know.  It’s often said, and seen, that sometimes something get captured on camera and that photo.   That really would round up your ghost haunting tours.   Love to see whats coming
I was just telling my sister last week, us both being Iowans, that I wished the ghoul boys would have done an episode at the Villisca house!
How come nothing ever happens to Shane 😭😭 Ryan must be so frustrated
I think it's funny how midwesterners are known as being nice, yet the different states all hate each other. Illinoisans make fun of us Iowans for being farmers, we make fun of them for saying they're all from Chicago when they live an hour away from the city. The circle of life.
at 12:19 does anybody notice michael myers behind shane??
The “what is it” also sounds like “let us in”
Never been prouder to be an Iowan then when Shane throws shade lol.
Don’t quote me, and I dunno if this is the case in this situation but they did use to cover mirrors so spirits wouldn’t be stuck on this side, it was done so as not to confuse them and trap them in the mirror (if I remember correctly) could it be he didn’t want the spirits to linger
Can you please make a documentery on the upside down cross house please?
A lot of spirit box talk this time was interesting. Also, I still don’t understand how Shane can be so comfortable in these places. Even if you don’t believe in ghosts, you’re alone in a building where 8 people were murdered in their sleep, how can you not feel the least uneasy?
Ever wonder if this and the new Orleans axman murders might be related... kind of in the same time period. Just curious
I'm from and live in Iowa and I can 1000% agree with Shane that Illinois is better! 😂😅
You two are so brave. Wouldn't go there at night and taunt the ghosts.
Love to see Ryan's faith in the supernatural just completely dissolve over the course of this series
I'm starting to believe that they may be the greatest ghost hunter
Please respect the victims at least. im sorry if i sound like a know-it-all i am, but please take it a little serious for the victims. I do not believe in ghosts but respecting those who have passed on,even if it doesnt matter, is cool. Please.
Shocked Ryan didn’t freak out at the flashlights but so proud of him hahah
#Postmortem out of all the haunted places you guys have been what are your top three most haunted places you guys has ever been on?
Ion like em
I had just recently picked a random true crime podcast episode over this very subject. Creeeeeepy
FOR POSTMORTEM: How does Shane feel about Minnesota since he hates Iowa so much? 🤪
"How loud is it in Iowa?" Idk, I mean, you get used to the cicadas screaming...
Being completely honest I was waiting for this, as a fellow north Iowa fan/liver
this episode actually gave me chills
"yeef"
I love this series so sad to know this is the last! This seasons episodes are awesome!
i feel like the town marshal shouldve been looked at... cuz in the day and age if i wanted to get rid of my killing evidence i would let everyone in town touch the damn axe.
For some reason, I thought they already did this one, but obviously not
At 23:04 the subtitles said "That was fun", and the ones on the video say, "Helpless".
i hear way diff words on the spirit box he’ll say it’s “i’ll kill him” and i hear “pumpkin”
in some other universe shane carries holy water and ryan noddes the head.
this place is 30 mins from where I live and let me just say it is TERRIFYING
Ryan I am part of a paranormal investigation team,  and I deal with "Shanes" all the time so I feel your pain.;😂
How do I know if all of this is not made up
How this case was handled sum's up the intelligence of people of southwest Iowa, even 100 years later. (Yes, I grew up near Villisca)
can u guys do the Burari deaths in Delhi, India PLS<3333
Y’all do not want to know what he most likely used the slab of bacon for.
Ryan, we're proud of you  Shane...we're amused, but concerned lol
Morbid Podcast is currently doing a series on this case if you’re interested!
Post Mortem: You need to test the flashlights just chillin in the studio and see if they still turn on and off randomly!
fun fact from the podcast, Morbid! investigators believe the intruder had used the bacon wrapped in a dish towel to get himself off after the killings
WAS THAT A BOOHBAH IN THE CLOSET
6:28 orb flying past Ryan's face
waverly hills recommendation
I LIVE IN IOWA
I seen this
I have 2 theories about this- 1) being that the killer could be schizophrenic who had no control over his actions with the split personalities took over (bare with me I don’t know that much about the illness) leading to why they kept asking for help and to stop him. Could be in an inner turmoil over the murders such as feelings ashamed of what they did but also not when they admit to it   2) the Marshall being in on it or being the killer also because he did let people into an active crime scene which would cause all the evidence to potentially be destroyed or tampered with. Not giving detectives enough information to actually figure out the case-knowing that he would be screwed if they figured it out. More deeper into thought, could there have been someone who had a personal vendetta against the father since he was the only one hit with the sharp side of the axe or could that have been the killer’s own mistake?
please do an episode about madeleine mccann. i think her parents 100% had something to do with it, but i wanna know what you guys think!
Well...Im thinking that damn Town Marshal is SUS AF
WAIT A DAMN MINUTE. Ryan said this would be the last season of buzzfeed unsolved. And in a video from 2019 he said that the only way they would ever end the show is if Shane became a believer in ghosts!! Could it be?? Could this season be the season to change Shane’s beliefs???
Villisca only has an Ax Murder House. In New Orleans, we have loads of them……same basic era though
“You do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe”  **Everyone liked that**
shane looks like a chad today
The voice saying stop me and help me were two diffrent voices entierly
This is how you know Ryan isn't scared of ghosts anymore: he laughs when ghosts turn flashlights on and off when in season 1 he would flip out.
I used to hate Shane by good measure... now I'm a fan hahahahahaha the way makes faces when he hears "ghosts are real" cracks me up all the time.
#postmortem I'm a large skeptic of the paranormal, and realizing it now, there hasn't been that much evidence proving that ghosts do exist despite the various techniques for identification.  For your final paranormal expedition, could you break your rule of being respectful to the ghosts and have the intent to be malicious towards them?
I live in Iowa in a small town a few hours away from this house and have been through Villisca so many times. I pass by it every time and remember the frightening story, gives me the shivers! It is truly such a sad story that will probably never be solved but glad to see a story from Iowa on such a big stage!
Why is this on supernatural
3:27 me when anyone says hello to me
There was so much activity in this episode! I am compelled to think the owner staged the house with recordings. Some of the ways the supposedly ghost was very vague and could sound like answers to large topics of questions. Really makes me think it's a staged fun house than an actual hunting.
Did you two see that Ash and Alaina on Morbid: A True Crime Podcast shouted you guys out? They dropped an episode on the Villisca Ax Murder house right when you dropped this! They said they'd love to collaborate if you were down for it! I just thought it was a wonderful coincidence that you released very similar content around the same time. :]
Who's here from Morbid Podcast 😋
The bacon is a reference saying he slaughtered them like pigs
Sounds like a recording set to say the same spooky phrases. I'd love to know how the ghost box works. And if people who sells the investigation rights doesn't  set up certain types displays to be found by investigators
Ryan: *turns on box* Ghost: HELPMEHELPMEIMDISTRESSEDIMSAYINGWORDSIMSTILLHERELEAVEMEHELP Ryan: Okay, you have ten seconds to say something Ghost: 🗿
IOWA LETS GO!! 🌽🪓
isn't it awful... imagine u just wanna have a good time with ur friend having a sleep over in their house but ended up killed without knowing anything, what an unfortunate life🥺
My video about this: https://youtu.be/-YDlH51PL1s
Best paranormal investigation show in YouTube! In the world actually. I’m gunna miss you guys..
#postmortem - do they still allow visitors to spend overnight in that house? It would be more spooky if you both spent the night there! Looking forward for more adventures, you guys are awesome, keep it up!
I too fell asleep upstairs. Then on a corner chair downstairs.
I know the flashlights did not turn on and off at the specific time Shane and Ryan instructed, but why were they randomly turning on and off? Do flashlights usually do that?
I effing love Ryan and Shane so much, from this, to puppet history, to too many spirits; it’s absolutely one of my favorite dynamics in all of entertainment. Very seemingly genuine and funny guys.
I always knew i liked Ryan better! - an iowan
So the Marshall let every contaminate the crime scene before the national guard could get there and properly investigate..... HOW WAS HE NOT THE PRIMARY SUSPECT????
Who is Sarah?
1 15
The Morbid Podcast brought me here. :3
Hearing about this case, I really don't trust the investigative work done on this case. How much of the reporting was really accurate? This whole case is just weird.
18:00 has tiktok sound potential
#Postmortem: I’m 95% sure the killer knew the family. He covered their faces, and he even ate their food. He may have lived in their attic for a while  and planned everything until the perfect moment. He obviously was comfortable being in the house because he stopped for a snack. Or maybe it may have even been a deranged attempt at revenge.
As an Iowan I was super excited about this video til about 2 mins in Mr. SHANE
Why so many serial killers from Midwest?
What if the dude who let everyone touch the axe did it
as a wisconsinite, i fully agree with shane's statement about iowans. even if he's a fib.
I thought they weren’t with buzzfeed anymore?
So basically your saying the town Marshall did it???
Wat the hell. I go away for a couple yrs i come back now they both have mustaches and shane looks like the guy from the liberty mutual commercial
"I'm not my fear, I'm stronger than my fear" iconic
Y would these bozos want to hold the ax? I wouldnt want my fingerprints on a murder weapon
I'm pretty sure nobody will ever catch anything on camera. There should've been an episode where it was only audio recorded, if even that. I'd take Shane's word alone if that's what it took for one of the boys to get evidence for themselves.
Do u and Shane think this episode has most evidence of ghost or spirit out of all episodes u guys did together
I like to think that when the caretaker jumped out of the closet he scared the ghost
did you guys stop by the casey's for some delicious pizza?
I’m going to start a chain Favorite movie
For post mortem : I think the Marshall knew who committed the murders and allowed the townspeople to handle the axe In order to cover it up . Also the covering the bodies and mirrors points towards remorse and that coupled with the Evps leads me to believe they didn't want to committee murderers but they couldn't stop which may mean they committed suicide shortly after . Lastly the bacon wrapped in a towel strikes as something someone would use for a bruise or swelling of some kind .
Here from the Morbid podcast 😌
Okay as a Nebraskan I have beef with Iowa too hahahahahah
Lmao who names a baby Paul 😂😂😂😂
Morbid just did this too :o
GoNNa MiSS YoU GuYs 😔 😔....
You need to do a True Crime episode about this too! I want to hear more theories and suspects. 🤔
at 17:56 you can see the carpet move before ryan has time to put his weight on it. also the audio that was picked up in the room where ryan heard a voice was bone chilling ive never heard something that clear in this show
Hey my birthday is June 10
#postmortem: did the evidences(??) here made you REALLY REALLY believe in ghosts? What qualifies as an evidence for you to actually believe in ghosts?
at 19:43 when the caption says “stop me” to me it sounds more like “patrick”
I know this is random but is it just me who thinks they used the slab of bacon wrapped with a towel probably to cover the Moore’s mouths so their screams wouldn’t be heard ..? #postmortem
pretty sure that spirit box based on how it works is theyre picking up random radio interference. And it is someone else talking on a walkie or something that is why the guy said "switch" as in switch channels. and after that they didnt get another response.
…anyone want to tell them the theory behind why the bacon was there…?  Just in case, there’s a theory that the murderer used the bacon to masturbate😬
The sheet over the mirror could be some form of remorse. It was believed that a spirit wouldn’t be able to pass to “the other side” if they saw their reflection
I can’t believe you came all the way to IOWA!!
why was this episode kind of scary?? i feel like they don’t usually bother me but this one was creepy
I just listened to the Morbid podcast coverage of this story this morning and watch this video later in the night. It’s a nice little combo
Plot twist: Shane’s defense mechanism is actually yelling mean stuff at the ghost. He’s hiding he’s scared.
At 31:22 I SWEAR I saw a man lying down on the bed, I saw the head and it looks like an arm (with a watch!!!!) I know it's the pillows and stuff but I saw a hundred times and cannot unsee the man!!!
#postmortem out of all the places you’ve visited which place would you live in if you could?
Yeah, Shane looks like hes from Illinois
For the #PostMortem , I can assure you, from a resident of Iowa City, Iowa, Iowa is indeed haunted. free us
It was the dad
Such a sad and horrific incident that occurred. I’m very glad I listened to the podcast Morbid before this episode because I got so much information. They split it into two episodes because there is so much information. Including what the bacon was probably used for 😖 In the podcast, they wondered the same question about how someone could creep around killing people with an axe and no one wake up in the home. Systematically taking out the victims from highest chance of fighting back to least, seemed to be the murderers solution.   I did have a thought.. that probably people back then slept more soundly than we do today. They had no tv or iPhones with that pesky blue light to mess up their melatonin production. They had much less sugar and caffeine in their diets compared to modern day. On top of that the family would do daily chores, like caring for the horses. All those chores would make anyone tired by nightfall.  So I believe people slept better back in those days
"ryan loves you. BIG FAN OF YOU WORK!"
Let’s start a Kickstarter to rent Shane a haunted house for him to live in for a year. Maybe he’ll become a believer by the end of the year 🤔
the gift that keeps on giving
honestly why would the ghost stay in the house that they killed people in? im pretty sure a lot of these are just demons screwing around with them tbh. i do still like their stuff though!
Isnt this the amenity horror house?
There's nothing scarier than that purple Boobah facing the wall in that closet.
this is the real life version of "Supernatural"
"you do what you need to do to make your gf feel safe" bahahaha me making my boyfriend look around the house every noise despite us having two cats
3 Axe Murder videos so far
For #postmortem Why would the murderer's spirit even be in the house if there's no proof that anyone other than the victims were found?
The doll behind Ryan’s head sometime after 31:00 scared the living crap outta me lol
"I do not believe in ghosts but I do believe that Iowa is haunted" - THIS IS HILARIOUS! I was born in IA (unfortunately) and this made me laugh hysterically ..because I feel the same way =D
the amount of contact that they got in this episode alone is crazy
somebody help my boy ryan seems like hes having a midlife crisis
should have cooked some bacon instead of using the spirit box
Ryan: Why did you do what you did Ghost through spirit box: beepbeep
As someone from missouri, we even hate Iowa down here
This is completely bullocks. The killer hopped a train. He left the bacon to say they died like lil pigs. The home holds a residual scar. How can you people say tthose lil girls and boys arnt in Heaven
You mean to tell me... she tried to simply enter Moore door?
Most of the time I just laugh along while watching Supernatural but damn this episode is extra scary! As a cross between Supernatural and True Crime in such as small place like that, thinking about the massacre there is just so horrifying. The thought that the murderer was just lurking in the attic all this time plus the covered up mirrors are even creepier. Poor girls just wanted to have a sleepover...
Went there on a girl scouts trip once. Played the piano downstairs a bit
19:57 it kinda sounds like the name John Morse which if you know of the Borden case thats really intriguing-
CAN YOU PLEASE GO TO THE PURDY MANSION IN PURDY TENNESSEE
I've been to Villisca and I caught a picture of one of the kids my question is Did either of you boys feel anything evil? #boogara #believer
Whenever there's a "the audio recorder picked up this message, take a listen:" sort of thing, I always close me eyes and try to hear it for myself without the subtitles guiding me. At 14:45 I heard "Let us in." loud and clear, not "What is it"
if you use a maglite, just use one that does not goes out from alone.
18:57 ‘sounded like michael rooker’ YES! I said it just before you! WTF
Listen to the 2-part Morbid Podcast on these murders. They do a fantastic job of laying out literally everything known on the case, and the book The Man on the Train indicates it could have been a serial killer.
Yall should stay in a spooky house for a month. One night just isn't enough, but if you stay in one of the places you've visited for a month or two I guarantee you'll get results.
Psychic Medium Amy Allan had visited this house and picked up on that there were multiple people including the Reverend involved in the murder. That makes sense as to why none of the 8 people escaped.
Wait, what? Mary was out hanging laundry at fricken 5 AM??? What time did she start??? 💀
What if the father killed them all, and the only reason he was the only one with the sharp end of the axe in his head was because he wanted to make sure he died from his own blow. The axe could have been in his head still and unreported because the townspeople messed with it o.o he had one last meal at the head of his table before joining his family
🙄 shane you are just jealous you don’t have as much corn in your state
How mean :(
#postmortem what if it was a woman who committed the crime? Most suspects are always men, maybe thats why its unsolved,  *sexism*
"A great deal of my time was spent napping." One day i hope to be as peaceful in my own house as Shane is in the axe murder crib, the mans in a total state of Nirvana.
So, the Town Marshall had something to do with it right? How else could you be so ignorant to let people tromp around the murder scene...
This murder was so big at the time that it took the Titanic sinking off the front page of the newspaper. It’s still both interesting and sad at the same time.
For Shane: What do you tell yourself to remain so calm and to not get scared?  #shaniac
RYAN IS SO BEEFY NOW WAT THE HECK !! I HAVENT WATCHED THIS SERIES FOR LIKE 2 YEAR AND LIKE OMG WTFFFF HAHA
I’m from Indiana and you couldn’t PAY me to live in Illinois.
#postmortem My boyfriend & I were there a just a few days before you guys & I was soooo sad when they said you were coming later in the week! Question for Shane : Aside from a ghost coming up to you and singing the WB Frog song, is there anything that will ever convince you that ghosts are real? Question for Ryan : When I went in broad daylight I did NOT like the feeling I had in the kid's room, but my boyfriend was more uncomfortable in the attic. What room made you the most uneasy? #Boogara #ShaneSucks #JustKiddingILoveYouShane
True crime and supernatural in one, the ghoul boys at their most meta.
I think it was the marshal and he contaminated the scene to hide the evidence
Thank you for going there.  I asked two years ago but I  sure you had planned it anyways.  I do laugh when so called psychics can say they communicate with the killer since the killer never died there and was believed to be involved with multiple similar murders through the US  and Europe.... Using the railroad and WW 1to travel Europe.... The Hunter K case in Germany......
Yeah, I also have a question. What if it was multiple people that killed the family? That might explain why no one woke up.
I keep looking at the mannequin at the back hoping it would move again …
At 17:55 when ryan feels the bed move u can see the cover kick back a bit extra as is someone next to Ryan stood up quickly cuz they were scared or shocked.
#post-mortem covering up the faces after a murder typically indicates someone who knew the victims. Were any of the suspects close to the family? #shitfish
You guys should do the anteville horror in house In Franklin castle in Cleveland Ohio
Love you guys! :-)
I feel like the “I’ll kill him”, sounded more like “F*ck him”. Anyone else?
Does anyone else find that the voice at the 14:46 mark sounds like it's saying "let us in", instead of "what is it"...?
“ I forgot Iowa can be interesting 🤔” - My Iowan friend
Post Mortem: Some people believe that the Murder is the same murder who did the New Orleans Axe Murders, I think there’s a book about someone on a train going around different cities killing people with an axe
I kinda hope that ghosts are real, and all the ghost Shane mokes, going to a self-help meeting.
I’ve been waiting on this one!
Well they solved the mystery of the bacon. One of those ‘visiting’ clearly dropped it whilst contaminating the murder scene
maybe the bacon was in refence to the pounds of flesh?
At 23:04 the added caption says, "Helpless," but the automatic subtitles say, "That was fun." I couldn't help but notice that it was right after Ryan asked if it was true that the ghost enjoyed murdering.
14:46 honestly I heard "let us in" instead of "what is it?" But both work
For post mortem: the bacon was actually used by the killer to masturbate after/while he killed the stillinger girl that woke up
YOU WERE IN IOWA AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ME!?
#postmortem what if the towns marshall did it, and thats why he left everyone damaged the scene
My husband said clearly the murderer was the Marshall lol
31:56 the answer from the spirit box for the question 'why id you do what you did' sounded like "Funny" to me.
Who else thinks Shane looks like Professor Lupin from Harry Potter!
TW - sexual assault   I’ve listened and done some research on this case and Lena was also found with her underwear taken off and her nightgown pulled up so there’s a theory that the attacker pleasured himself with the bacon (hence it being wrapped up) after murdering her. It’s absolutely horrendous but that’s the theory with the bacon.
AHHHHH IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THEM TO DO THIS FOR SO LONG!!!! BUT THIS MEANS THE GHOUL BOYS WERE IN IOWA AND I MISSED THEM??????
My mom actually had a friend who lived in a house down the road from that place. She knew the neighbors. Idk if she lived there when the murders happened Obivously but you know. Edit: went and asked. Her Great grandmother was out of town of the night of the murders.  But still owns the same house
i think the reason they don’t get strong responses from the entities is because only one of them is scared, ghosts feed off of people who are scared because of their strong energy, so sense shane isn’t scared they only feed off of ryan which is only so much 😂
the pound of bacon is believed to be used to “pleasure” the guy sooo😬
Postmortem: Maybe it was the marshal himself. So he let everyone grab the Ax to cover his tracks. What do you think?
Iowa???? Come to my house shane I have food for you
I do think it's impressive the killer got away with it. The family had horses, and yet they didn't get alerted! Now that's impressive. I don't know how horses are. But I think they could get spooked easily if they heard something out of routine. So like, they hear at night noises they never heard before, they'd probably freak out and wake up people. Yet, that's not reported, so I guess their horses didn't see or hear anything. Again, I don't know much about horses so I don't know if they can hear from their stables to the house or not. But when the neighbor went to check in during the morning is when the horses got worked up. I feel bad for those horses! I hope the horses got sold to new homes where their caretakers weren't killing.
Morbid /just/ dropped an episode on this case!
Loving the mustache Shane, as for Ryan, you keep doing you
Shane had the chance to finally be rid of that damn spirit box for good…and he just…🤦🏾‍♀️
why dont yall use other ghost devices?
T-shirt opportunity: Just the words "A Metaphoric Ghost D*ldo" followed by the show logo and "The Final Season".
I just want to point out that that "What is it?", if it wasn't said by anyone on the crew, is the most compelling evidence of a ghost presence in this whole series since the haunting of Hannah's house. I audibly gasped as soon as I heard that.
I live in Nebraska I'm glad the Iowa hate isn't limited to us lmfaooo
"But there was also bacon wraped in a dish cloth" They were just hungy maann!!!
It'd be so frustrating to be that ghost.  Ghost: "Help me." Ryan: "What are your parents' names?" Ghost: "....." Gost: "Are you even listening to me?"
YES IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS SINCE SEASON 1
"Hey fucko." My new favorite saying haha.
I just think the ghouls are done with these bois lol. They've seen enough of em!
Y’all should investigate the Galvez hotel in Galveston Texas !!!!!!!! Super creepy and sad stuff 🤠
#PostMortem DO you think he was a mentally ill person and he covered the mirror so he couldn't see himself becaue he was ashamed of what he did because of say, Schizophrenia? As well as that he also stabbed himself afterwards? Sounds like Schizophrenia to me
good👍
I do not know either as a matter of fact the only thing you do not do is swear at ghosts 👻 so no I have no idea I know I do remember a ghost laughing at me telling me to shoot my self in the heart I just laughed 🤣 as well
The scariest, most tragic thing about this house is that it's in Iowa.
a little observation: at 19:56 when shane asked "did you see them" it sounded like they answered "just one" maybe they misinterpreted "them" as plural rather than singular and was clarifying that there was only one killer
Is it possible that Josiah committed these murders and then turned the axe on himself?  - the neighbour never mentioned anyone unusual turning up at the house which you think she might have if she was observant enough to go over and knock when she didn’t see them outside the next day - no one was woken by an intruder - because he was already inside - even if the family woke up, they would likely go back to bed when they noticed it was Josiah - he was the only family member to have the sharp side of the axe used against him - which is something you would do if you’re going to kill yourself with an axe  I think the backswing explanation with the mark on the wall probably could have been a misidentified mark or something made post-mortem by those visiting the home.
HELL YEA and morbid just uploaded a episode about this
“Iowa”
Lookin like a bootleg Nicolas Cage lol
The Iowa vs. Illinois beef had me dying 🤣🤣 because it’s true!
maybe the town marshal did it ? since he let that happen ?
Did you find the info about how the bacon might have been used as a masturbatory aid or did you just not want to get demonetized?
Usually the spirit box has multiple unintelligible voices. I will at least say this time every answer in the bedroom sounded like the same voice. Interesting
Shane on the floor reminded me of Bob Belcher
When Ryan asks, "Are you escared of us?" And the  spirit box said, "switch",  I thought that meant, instead of the ghosts being afraid of Ryan and Shane, that Ryan and Shane were afraid of the ghosts.
I normally watch these in the daytime...at work...where the monsters can't get me...but I was so excited for it, I had to watch it at home...at night...alone....  the shadow in my room didn't like that....
I live in Iowa so happy you did this
shane: ghosts aren’t real also shane: iowa is haunted
#Postmortem Why aren’t you guys ghostbusters yet? Stay puff would be scared as hell dealing with the wet ghoul boys
Is it just me, or do the ghosts kinda sound like Ryan and Shane?
#PostMortem i personally am lead to believe the ghost communicating with you guys was that of the killer. do you guys think his guilt over what he did keeps him in the house ?  edit: i feel like most of the times the spirit box is used, i think its the killer responding. i dont know if his responses are attempts at tricking you guys into thinking he feels guilty, but i can confirm it seems like the ghost followed you throughout the house.
another good lauugh!
As an Iowan, I can confirm that Iowa is in fact haunted
#postmortem Why did you not spend the night?
27:11 me entering my school
20:16 😂😂
For post Mortem: do you guys think the spirits (wether or not they’re there) would behave different if the recording crew wasn’t there or if you guys weren’t recording?
diversity win! the murderer who killed eight people in one night uses they/them pronouns
I love the sound of disgust Ryan makes at the beginning of these 😂
Thank you so much for bringing these ghost videos back, they are my favorite in your channel ❤️
I love this duo.
Please don't make this the last season... I mean the fact you're getting nearly 2 million views in 2 days should prove its still worth it.   Or is it that Ryan or Shane no longer want to do it?
Perhaps the killers ghost is trapped and is having to relive the horrors he caused.
I think it was a missed opportunity to make this like a True Crime/Supernatural crossover.
The boys came to Iowa and I MISSED IT? Oh well. At least they've changed the sign outside the house. The old one was like in a "scary" font, dripping with blood. Tacky as hell.  Yeah we have beef. Delicious IOWA beef. And pork. And corn. So take that you FIB.
I'VE BEEN ASKING FOR THIS ONE SINCE SEASON ONE I'M SO HAPPY
Well, what if the ghosts are colorblind, huh?
COLLAB WITH THE MORBID GALS!!!!!!! They covered this case this past week on their pod. I think the four of you would have great banter. :)
I wonder if most of the furnishings in there are original to the family, or replicas.  Most museum houses don't have the authentic furniture and items that belonged to the family there, because the house was never initially intended to be a museum.  Later on, when the house is declared a historical site, replicas are brought in to try and get as close as possible.  The Molly Brown house in Denver is like that,   most of the stuff is a replica, not her actual things.  They didn't have Barbie in 1912, so no way those toys belongs to the kids killed there.  There were probably people who lived there for several decades before some historical society, or the city, decided to turn it into a tourist attraction.
FINALLY!!! been wanting y’all to do this story for years!!
Well Shane, I’m from Michigan so both Illinois AND Ohio can gtfo 😌
buzzfeed unsolved is ending for the sake of shane's sanity and ryan's safety
so it was definitely the town marshal that killed the family
I’m from Iowa and still have never been there. Now that I know you two have been, I definitely want to go now!
Has anyone noticed that the two axe murderer houses they’ve been to there’s been an Uncle Moore??? 🤔 #postmortem
Bacon, wrapped in a blanket— pigs in a blanket. They were murdered in the bed 🧍🏻‍♀️ murderer had some hatred hatred lol
But what if the caretaker did it
As someone who goes to school in Iowa, I can confirm the whole state is haunted
For post mortem- Shane what do you think about the bed sheet moving when you were in the closet? #bergara
i love that it came out same time as morbid the podcasts episode
They actually thought the slab of bacon was used to do the “deed” with
The voice from 14:47 doesn't add up with the with the voice few minute later , i didn't with the whole video yet but i can guess the killer is Ross Moore cuz with evidence that the victim faces were covered maybe the killer is someone close to them.
For the post mortem:   Is it possible that the spirit you all spoke with is the axe murderer and the house provides as some kind of eternal purgatory to remind him of what he’s done to the Moore family. The clothing covering the mirror might suggest that he felt regret for killing them afterwards and couldn’t bare to look at himself. Is it possible that the house is his eternal hell and the voice speaking to you both is the sound of him begging to be released? #Boogara
What if ghost only mess with people who think there real? That would explain why nothing ever messes with Shane
I think Asian horror movies or Asian urban legends are more scarier/realistic than American scary movies. “I do believe IOWA is haunted “, I AGREE!! 😂😂😂😂😂👍. Iowa nothing but flatland cornfields.
I get more scared by that mannequin behind the door more than investigation.
I’m sorry Ryan but did it not occur to you that saying 8 in the attic may or may not have been referring to the 8 people he killed (postmortem perhaps?)
It's not like the doors were locked back then
I worked at a place in Nebraska that had items from this house on display. While working one night something grabbed my ankle on my way down the stairs and I broke it.
Why would the murderers ghost be there? Wouldn’t it just be the victims?
Question for post mortem: How do they even let you two bumbling idiots into these places? I bet some of the owners look at you and go "mm, Yes, Quality."
They legit have a hitchhiking ghost in Chicago
missing the days when ryan was still terrified
I wonder if there are crime scene photographs, if it would appear that the Man of the house self inflicted his wounds like the guy with the knife. Perhaps it was like the amityville where it was a family member that did all the murders   "quietly"  except in this case the killer     turned the axe on himself. Covering the mirrors would make sense. He wouldn't want to see himself doing this to his family.  The bacon throws everything off though.
Question for the #PostMortem: It could be a little far fetched, but what if the murderer was in fact Josiah? I mean, it was his axe to begin with, and even though it sounds like a gruesome way to commit suicide, it would at least make some sense as to why he was the only one who got hit with the sharp end of the axe (to obviously kill in the one hard hit).. that would also give some validity to having the Killer be seen as a ghost/spirit afterwards, considering he took his own life in the household.. not sure if this was considered during the investigation, but I find it a plausible outcome to say the least. Regardless, great episode once again by the Ghoul Boys.. y’all never fail to make me laugh during these spooky stories 🤣
I really hate that around the 26:44 mark, it looks like kids laying in the bed on the pillows...
Welcome to Iowa, Boys
I always thought "lying in a pool of their own blood" was a weird phrase. Is it natural for people to lay in pools of other people's blood?
What the hell is going on here !!! R these two for real ??
5:20 THATS WHERE I LEFT MY BACON!! Dangit! I knew I had left something important behind, I just couldn’t quite place it. Thanks for reminding me boys, that’s been bothering me for 110 years now.
#postmortem, I think it could've been the town Marshall because he might have let everyone use the axe and contaminate the crime scene to cover his tracks. Loving the final series btw:)
#postmortem Why is this the last season?
3:48 He just ends up going right through those old floorboards… Now THAT would be comedy  😂😂😂
two pound slab of raw bacon wrapped in a towel
spirit box is such garbage lol, people hear what they want to hear
Could you guys cover the Madeleine McCann case? There have been new developments and I think you guys will find it very interesting.
For the #postmortem : I have a very wild theory lol but wouldn’t it be crazy if it WAS the marshal? Or somebody on the police force? Maybe the family had some history with the cops (like being anti-police or something) and so he came in and killed them. The bacon left there being like a twisted reference to cops being called pigs. And then the marshal made a spectacle of the whole thing and brought the whole town in as the final payback. 👀 An absolutely MASSIVE leap lol but it would be interesting.
This is so exciting, I’ve been to this location!!! It doesn’t really show in the dark, but in daylight the house from the outside is the cutest house in Villisca; really hard to believe something so horrible happened there
The mannequin got me again 😫
This killer was the same one who went to New Orleans
it doesn't make sense to me that the "spirit" of the murderer would be in house, only the "spirit" of the 8 victims. But idk, it seems kinda weird as the guy/girl who killed them dipped from the scene and probably ended up dying somewhere else in the world 🤷‍♂️
Pretty unsurprising that the house caretaker would have some spooky stories about the place, though, considering he likely profits from the house being considered haunted/getting visited/etc
for #postmortem, is there some supernatural being that is "allergic" to mirrors apart from vampires ?(not saying it was a vampire at all)  are there rules about ghosts or demons  not being allowed to see their reflection ? that would make sense for the mirrors and windows, and even covering the faces since there could be reflection in the eyes. #shaniac
so why was the light just randomly turning on and off?
“I’m looking for the killer… Hey.. Fucko” 😂
For the #postmortem : The fact that the ax was left in the room closest to the entrance probably means that the killer did indeed hide in the attic because he would leave the ax in the last room he was in. If so could it be that the girl, who was found in a position as if protecting herself, had woken up, heard everything, and just stayed in bed crying and waiting as any little girl would do? Because that just makes the whole thing way more terrifying and heartbreaking.
You guys should check out the Bedtime stories video on this case, they go into much greater detail about who the killer might have been.
That's English Reverse lol : EKAF...lol
Love you guys, going to buy a shirt or sweat shirt. Wish the boys are here was in the other styles
Why do you guys shut the spirit box off so quickly? There was SO MUCH activity this episode! I personally don’t believe in ghosts, nor do I understand the box, but this episode definitely suggested the most “paranormal activity”
out of any of the supernatural episodes, this is probably the one that I might actually kinda believe that there are ghosts
What about the bed moving!
"Shane, was that you?"   "No, I'm in the closet..."
Yeah!!! It's finally back with the boys
King of the dolls!! Lmfao " I'm so vulnerable right now omg!!" Haha
Love you ghoul boys.  Have you read/did you read "the Man From the Train? by Bill James?? A really interesting book that MAY have found the culprit for who committed these grizzly murders. Great read.
Just sage the freakin house already people 🤦‍♀️
Me from Illinois- 👁👄👁 We have beef with Iowa?
Could the town Marshall have been the killer? His ineptitude in having people tour the crime scene could have been a front to try and destroy evidence. Having townspeople touch the murder weapon and walk through an active crime scene would have been a great way to make the crime pretty much impossible to solve, especially for the time period
#postmortem do you think that maybe the spirits of the Moore family may be scared to come out because the spirit of the killer has dominated their home ? #boogara
You posted this on my wedding day and my husband and I thought it was a great wedding gift as we are Shaniacs
#postmortem Have you guys ever considered to look up offensive terms from that era to maybe get a better reaction? Have you considered they were possibly murdered because the windows resemble the original amityville house windows? Maybe it’s a vibe because these folks were bludgeoned to the head and the others were shot in the head. Food for thought.
Seeing Iowa has its own lil supernatural horror gives me mad sketch vibes… I live in Iowa and I now trust it way less lol
For postmortem: isn’t it possible that the town Marshall was the killer and brought everyone into the house to intentionally ruin the crime scene and add loads of fingerprints to the weapon?
keep doing these videos please!!!!!
I wonder if it’s possible the brother that found the family was responsible? Obviously he had means to enter the house but maybe I’m thinking to deep into it
Maybe they were murdered because the windows on this house resemble the original amityville house windows, thoughts?
Have you guys ever considered to look up offensive terms from that era to maybe get a better reaction? Also, you should do a follow up with Loey before wrapping it up because she got amazing feedback from her ghost.
IM CALLING IT ! They are going to Alcatraz this seeson
OK, wait...a...minute.  She's hanging her laundry at 5am and decides to check on her neighbors because THEY aren't doing chores?
Has it ever been considered that the father himself did it? No one would be curious about him moving around the house at night, he could've gone downstairs and blugeoned all the kids come upstairs killed his wife and then axed himself with the sharp end so it was quick. Makes sense that he would cover the mirrors so he didnt have to see what he was doing more ig?
I am surprised by the sentences they are getting
You could literally see someone grab the corner of the comforter on the bed in the video that is 100% evidence and really convincing!!! I want to hear Shane’s rebuttal to that one
This is the last season of supernatural and and it will be a huge miss if they won't visit the Amityville horror House 🏠,bruh like thats where the final boss fight should be.
HOW DO THE FLASHLIGHTS GOING OFF NOT MAKE HIM BELIEVE ?
9:05      “ *oh hellos :)* “
Why am I watching this at 9 am?? Really setting the tone for the day huh
the bed moved and Ryan was scared...
Man from the Train theory? Killer Paul Muller? Interesting book tells of a number of other ax murders very similar to Villisca throughout the U.S.
At 15:33 that mannequin is downright creepy
This is so cool I live just a little ways away from there such an awesome video!
Who here in the comment section actually believes In ghosts
I love Shane: ''I DO bring good vibes''😂😂😂
What’s he talking about. Unicorns are totally real. 🦄
I wonder if the family had been posioned/drugged. That's why none of the victims woke up. This case always reminds me of the Amityville murder. How could someone murder an entire family in their beds?
shane: "can i come out of the closet now?"
Shane is very right to be scared of Iowa. It sucks here 😂
#Postmortem Do you guys think that the town Marshall was somehow involved in the murders, because what he did was super unsettling .(If yes, way to cover it up dude and if not what's wrong with him?) Also if they did not find any apparent reasons for the murder of the family , I think that the murderer could've met them on their way to/back from the church. That can explain why he killed the other two girls , maybe he thought they were the part of the Moore family.
Sending love from Philippines 🇵🇭
At least it kinda like a true crime one.
I remember Ryan he looks so much older and healthier
#PostMortem what was Ryan's favorite and least favorite place to visit and also Shane's? And is one of them among either the most or least active places you visited
Here's i think. The killer was one of the deaths..
Almost all these supernaturals and true crimes have either bad or absolutely terrible police work that is probably the main reason they are unsolved
Y'all see a man behind Shane looking through the window at 1:41? Scared the heck out of me. I know it's a prop
"Love the spirit box what a wonderful gift" lol
19:03 sounded more like "im afraid" then stop it
just saw this house a while ago in a @Junkyard Digs video
Shane screaming in frustration was just such a highlight. It reminds me a lot of debates I've found myself in. #shaniac
#postmortem will Ricky Goldsworth appear one more time?  #4evsBoogara
Shane screaming after Ryan saying that he believes in ghosts but not unicorns will never not be funny
#postmortem after how many episodes I have watched of this show the spirit box has never been more active what do u think? BTW boogara for life hoessss
#postmortem bringing back to the true crime aspect of the story do u think the police purposely tried to ruin the crime scene by allowing people to trample on the evidence and touching the axe maybe they had something to do with it whether it be blackmail or one of the policemen btw boogara for life bitches
The voice asking you to stop him and the I'm miserable makes me wonder if the killer has been tormented by the souls of those he killed. Or perhaps he was mentally ill alive and was gleeful and malicious while committing the murders and after because of how much attention he got. But as more people came and laid lut how disgusting and horrible his actions were and offering sympathies to the victims and trying to help them move on. I believe souls can change, that is the Biblical purpose of Hell. To be tormented until you repent. And maybe this was his own personal Hell.  Idk it justs seems like a 180 from bragging about it and enjoying it so much.
Now this sounds to me like the work of our friend the axeman. Unidentified entry point, victims own axe used. Maybe Razor Boy grew up
i mean would someone who was brutally murdered care if Ryan was sorry about it, decades later
Iowa in a small town and killed 7 people? I believe they were unknowingly drugged. Then He did the unthinkable.
I feel like this tale would have made for a very interesting supernatural/true crime crossover episode…🤔🤔
#postmortem after listening to the spirit box footage again do u think the family or the murderer resides in the house or perhaps both btw boogaras for life hoessss xx
I’ve been waiting for this one!
I don't want this to end :(
I'm thinking maybe the town Marshall killed them after one them called him a "pig".  Hence the bacon.  ????
22:57 same
Bro y'all came to Iowa???? I'm so sad I missed this !
“Im one of the most feared ghost hunters “ lol
I didn't realize there was a baby doll behind Ryan when he went up to the attic alone and it startled me quite a bit 😂
I’m upset that no one told me this show is back !! Omg I’m so nostalgic rn I adore it so much 🥰🥰🥰
So the “medium” said the murderer said he liked victims that were like putty in his hands? That idiom didn’t come about until the 20’s and the murders were in 1912 so….
Wait where in Illinois is Shane from?? The whole state kinda sucks but im from chicago and wheaton
#postmortem: Do you reckon maybe the Marshall did it? He may have let the townspeople handle the axe on purpose to hide his prints.
The voice didn't say switch, it tried to say sandwich, referring to the bacon he has dropped behind when fleeing
I’m so proud of Ryan. He was facing major fears in this! 💕
Shane reminds me of porn actor in the 80s
I also feel like maybe spirits don’t choose to go places but they are tied to it because of what they did or what happened to them was such an emotional and surreal thing , but it would be interesting in the idea he did choose to remain there because maybe it was his “best work” in his mind, like the most victims and never caught since people did he say “he enjoyed it”
Btw, I have been scared of Iowa since I heard the Slipknot album.
This case really resembles the Hinterkaifeck case from germany.
I am dreaming? A new episode. Gosh, Im crying! I missed this soo much!
I love the idea that none of these places are haunted and just 2 dudes yelling at nothing
Did the killer or the town people who covered the victim #postmortem
I’m from Iowa so it was fun finally seeing you guys go to the Villisca Ax Murder House! I literally live 20 minutes away.
Shane saying that he feels good energy on that house. Well, the ghosts already left the house. They heard about Shane and they are afraid for their life.
Look ya'll need to come out with a DVD special with all the seasons including post mortem so I can have them!
How do these flashlights work? Why do they turn on and off? I dont understand :D
It’s extremely interesting that you’re getting intelligent answers back what sounds like the same one person every time, I feel like the victims are not there but the killer is , especially the can’t stop, but when you got “I’m miserable” it sounded more like “pleasurable” which would answer one of your questions on why
Omg you were in iowa!?
This one reminds me of the German axe murders, Hinterkaifeck murders from season 1.
Why is nobody talking about the "What is it"? THAT WAS CLEAR AS DAY
So the Ax Murder house's caretaker is called Johnny Houser. Before that, was it owned by Sir Atticus Ax Murder?
#postmortem actually in 21:08 when Ryan mentioned the medium, I actually thought of the movie parasite. Did anyone check for secret rooms or basements or anything? Or like a loose floorboard and a tunnel behind the courtyard? Because could there be a secret tunnel the murderer used to go in silently and then get out openly? I am really creeped out by the house.
worst paranormal investigators ever, the counting down ten seconds before you turn off the spirit box thingy is annoying and feels like it defeats the purpose.. if i were a ghost I'd be like F you and your ten seconds, man. 😅 that being said, entertaining to watch anyway.
31:57 I though the ghost say "PP" ahhahaah!
I think the ovulus works better than the spirit box
Shane is just a crazy dude 😁 never changed. Keep it up shane.
"to find the unthinkable"  "i think there was axe murders"
What's the point of a spirit box if you can "hear" them like whispers.
Anyone else hear Bobby Wilk or something similar instead of I'm in here during the attic scene?
I just want the last episode to be solved. Like can the ghosts just step up and do the thing please?! Just one episode?! 😂
I feel like we need a True Crime style episode for this one.
31:24 looks like a head on the bed
19:40 as soon as he says stop me i think i can hear someone scream or that was some edited sound effect
So my theory is this guy was mentally unstable and he felt like he was obliged to do what he did but he didn't want to that's why he covered up his victims and the mirrors so they wouldn't remind him of the monster he is then he regrets what he did for the rest of his life thats why he says things like stop me or help me.
"ahahah" "i didn't mean to laugh at that imjustverynervousrightnow"
He covered the mirrors due to the fact  that silver backed mirrors are ghost portals so he covered them with the intention of trapping all the spirits in the home this also explains the windows
(yeef)
honestly love your series and will be sad when this season ends :(
Did anyone else see the shadow moving toward the bed at 17:53?
so...where are the stillinger girls' parents at tho?
Anyone else just listen to the Morbid podcast’s episodes on this case?
I’m a boogra and I believe you can hear him saying get out. But unfortunately like Shane says you hear what you want to hear # team Ryan
Who put a fuckin boobah in that closet
they look like two crazy and slightly gay journalists in a random 90s show sitting at the desk
Anyone else think that the father did it? He was the only one who got sliced by the axe something he could do to himself unlike attempting to off himself with blunt trauma, I mean if he tried to off himself with the back of the axe there would be more of a chance that he would have just knocked himself unconscious.
Shane would be more afraid of the boobah than ghosts
how this was all handled was super interesting
#postmortem : at time frame 6:50 you can actually hear “I can’t say/ can say” when Ryan asks to say their names back to them. freaked me out a lil ngl! regardless, i still don’t know if im a boogara or a shaniac 😂 love you both x
#postmortem how do we know it wasn’t multiple killers who just left behind one of the axes to trick people ?
More than 100 years old crime.
iowa doesn't even notice illinois, we're too busy hating nebraska lmao
Just know in one of these final season episodes the editor is going to  insert a perfect jump scare at the perfect time and 800 000 people are  going to collectively c*** themselves.
#postmortem aren’t you guys worried that the killer’s spirit/other spirits might follow you back? Or do you do holy cleansing after each investigation? Btw, love you guys! #boogara
Am the only one who heard the " thudding noise " at 23:13
my computer glitched and lagged while you were tellling the story in 2014
Shane said that he doesn't like holding the spirit box. Is the spirit box louder than it sounds in the video?
I’ve been here months ago. I had a dream of the place before going, the steps to get upstairs are crap
Look... i believe in spirits and the supernatural.. but whenever ryan points out something is said or there is a text on screen that says what they think is heard, i keep thinking.... "i really need to hear actual words. Not just random breaths."
It’s okay go through the comments you not afraid
I gotta say I’m living for Ryan’s confidence
#postmortem i really wish someone used a thermal camera on the bed where ryan thought someone sat next to him, when shane was in the closet
Are we getting some more hot daga?
Why did the town marshall let the people 'play' in the crime scene? He a sus tho
OR HE JUST MISSED BREAKFAST!
EVERYONE IN TOWN WAS A SUSPECT!
It confuses me how Ryan still asks how he got himself into creepy situations as a ghost hunter when he’s been doing that literally for years 😂
I'm proud of Ryan. He's getting quite brave with these paranormal investigations..
Is NOBODY gonna talk about the bed movement??? It really looked like the bed    moved!
Our biology teacher once said : as humans are made of flesh and bones, there's no space for a soul. I kind of believe him. What're your thoughts? #postmortem
Everyone: silence Everyone: nothing Shane: Hey, Fucko!
ghoullll boys🥷
I'd love to see an experiment on Ryan.  An episode where they go to two different houses and stay there overnight. One is claimed to be haunted, one is not. Ryan does not know which house is supposedly haunted, and he is not allowed to know. Shane is the only one who is allowed to know.  Then they do their usual investigations in the houses, and have Ryan report what he felt about each house.  Shame this is the last season and they've probably already planned out the whole season.
fuq buzzfeed  we know all about this without ur propaganda
I got an idea, maybe you should do something like guess the house thats haunted. You have 2-4 houses one of which is haunted, the Boys gotta investigate each and guess which is haunted.
I keep seeing the word "ax" on this channel, is this just how you spell axe in the US?
why would the murderer be there 😭😭 like im so confused why they kept trying to talk to the murderer
I’m happy when watching your video💕 Have a nice time💕🌼🌺🌸☘️🌿🌾🌴☘️🌿🌴🌾🇳🇴
Am I the only one that liked it better when Ryan was a chicken sh*t? And the Ghoul Boys failed to notice that the majority of the spirit box sessions were spoken in the same low voice pretty much the entire time. That, in and of itself, is noteworthy.
Was the mirror covering part of the old tale to cover the mirrors so they wouldn’t get trapped or something? It’s been a long time but it was I think Victorian
I'm curious that ppl think it's Ok for ghost hunters playing around and cracking jokes where 8 ppl lost their life in a brutal fashion? I mean would everybody be all good with strangers doing that if something like this had/or does happen to their family? I heard that the one little girl who had the cut on her hand was also thought to be sexually attacked because they found her underwear pulled down or off? so many ppl are morbid and disrespectful when it's not them or their loved ones being violated and whatever?
Unicorn lmaooooo
I heard that cloth over a mirror is to block spirits travelling to the real world or something so he possibly didn’t want them to come back to him and that could explain why you get lack of activity #postmortem
Imagine if it’s the family haunting the house but pretending to be the killer just for shits-and-giggles
POSTMORTEM: #boogara :) considering y'all captured great evidence on this one, why is it that Shane still continuously claims that ghosts are not real? Btw I love you too Shane.
As an Iowan I've been waiting for this video for so long
You guys the spirit box really made the narrative that the ghosts are stuck in a death loop. The family gasping for help as the killer is there reliving that moment, poor souls.
27:20 HAHAHAHAH
"Shane, was that you?"   "No, I'm in the closet..."
that is the most activity I've seen on this show.
#PostMortem It's kinda disappointing you didn't go through the list of suspects like you did with the Lizzie Borden episode. It would have been nice to have a little touch of True Crime in the last season of Supernatural. Why didn't you cover that?
At 23:04 when Ryan asks “why are you still here?” the auto captions translated the response not as “helpless” like the official captions, but as “that was fun”…. Creepy
if Bert & Ernie ever grew up..  these two guys are them...  lmaooo🤣🤣🤣🤣
The fact that the flashlights started flashing on and off once they started asking is still pretty wild lol
For the post mortem: I think the spirit box was definitely being manipulated by the killer. I heard “I’ll kill ‘em” which is very similar to the EVP “ I killed them” that the other team heard also the “eight” like the 8 victims
love youre videos
#postmortem the fact that everything at the murder scene, the cloths over the mirrors and the victims faces and the closed curtains point to remorse, and that the voice speaking through the spiritbox says things like "stop me" and "release me" really just chills me.
Ryan has some of the best character development of all time
After so may episodes. Ryan became braver and braver. I will not be surprised if he turns into a non believer.
I swear they used a photo of Johnny Sins for the Johnny Houser, house caretaker guy.
our man shane looks tired omg
I’ve never had a flashlight turn on and off on me
“You do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe.” Lol. True, though. Lock them doors and windows, close all the blinds, check all closets, and look under all beds.
I suspect that the killer was able to "sneak around" because there were 8 people in the house by the end of the evening, so hearing some footsteps wouldn't have set off any alarms to anyone
I think it’s probably unlikely that the killer’s ghost would be in that home since the evidence more than likely points to an axe murderer serial killer who replicated these events several times but the police ignored. That killer killed a lot more people than just those in the Villisca house
it drives me crazy how they refuse to use the spirit box correctly
They back
Carole Baskin husband "disappear" act
I can confirm, we are real.
Hey ghoul boys, completely unrelated to the episode, how do you feel about the zodiac killer revelation? Is it a bunch of hog wash or is it legit?
Ahh, 2:16am and i come across this…guess ive gotta watch it🤓
Shane, shave.  Ryan, don't shave.  My 2 cents.  LOL
"metaphorical ghost dildo" 😂😂😂
"Shane, was that you?"   "No, I'm in the closet..."
All they have to do, is let my parents reside there for a week.  Any spirit/ghost attached to that place, will detach and yeet itself into another world.
Ryan: "I used to think it was courageous, but now I think he's an insane person." I'm not sure how he's been friends will Shane so long and not figured that out already.
Oh heck ya - an Iowan
What's that radio thing they walk around with, and what is it meant to do?
Honestly the Midwest turf war is something not a lot of folks outside of the Midwest are aware of so whenever ppl start talking about states that hate other states I have to bring out the diagram. Just remember, we all hate Nebraska and Wisconsin the most and don’t ask me why that’s just how it is.
Ryan be like "I shall not fear. Fear is the mind killer..."
My bestie did her final over this!! Since I live in Iowa my APUSH teacher had us make presentations for our “final” on local or state history.
#Postmortem will we be seeing more of Shane and the spirit box? It was quite enjoyable
#postmortem the sheriff had to be involved somehow. What sheriff in his right mind is going to contaminate the crime scene like that?? Definitely sus
My friends grandparents live in the neighborhood to the axe house and one time while her and her sister were staying over the neighbor kids tricked them into going in and scared them by banging on the doors and etc, and her younger sister straight up pissed herself (she was like 8) out of fright 💀
Killer entered through the kitchen before they cam back home hid in the attic then when they were all sleeping he killed them idk just a theory but what do u think?
I don't want this to be the last season...will you 2 continue this series or a similar one on the watcher?
I spent the night in the house with my mother and a bunch of our friends. My mom and I sat in the Stilinger’s room and we both heard little girls whispering. At the time, there were bells on the door and they occasionally chimed. Every time I walked past the kitchen stairs I felt like something bad was watching me. I took photos from outside and in the window of the parent’s room were two small shadows. There was nothing sitting against the wall or window. I want to visit again. Before we stayed in the house we went into town and ate at a restaurant. The waitress said that every group of people visiting the house sat where we sat.
for the #postmortem, not so much a question as a possible answer for covering the mirrors. I've heard of a tradition that covers mirrors after a death in the house so the spirit doesn't get trapped in it, and this is an old tradition that some cultures still practice to this day. So this would suggest that the killer cared about their victims afterlife to some degree, whether to allow them to go to heaven or to prevent getting haunted by the victims.
It really seems like the spirit of the killer is residing in the home
Going to add "yeef" to my vocab
For postmortem: The spirit box picked up somebody saying "hard to stop" and then around 19:20 someone saying "I'll kill him" "stop it" and then "stop me" maybe the murderer couldn't control what they were doing, or were being forced to
This is just for me i think it's funny 8:47
this is very interesting...
the mannequin in the back always scare me out lmaooo💀😭
Michael Rooker is still alive
finally got the courage to watch it haha....
damn
Alright people moment of truth:  Are ghosts real? I say yes 👻
Ryan is a shaniac now.
Did the house heavy and did you feel like there was a spirit in there?
Hey Shane.  Do you think it was the wind that moved the bed while Ryan was sitting on it(when you were in the closet)? 😅
The flashlights freak me out every time 😭 HOW IS THAT NOT PROOF if i went in there and asked and the light turned off that would be it for me it would be definitively haunted 👍🏼 definitely solved
the (yeef) is makin me lose it
#postmortem Do you think the killer knew the Moore family and held a personal grudge against them or was the killer a random person? (I think the killer was a friend to the Moore family, because he did say he was miserable, maybe he regrets killing the family)
At 19:57 that unintelligible sounds like "Only one." ... Maybe its so baffling that one person killed eight people, because it wasn't just one person... Maybe it was more. Maybe that was the little girl who tried to defend herself.
#postmortem Hi Ryan, did you feel a presence or energy shift in the house at any time (except for the one when someone supposedly sat on the bed)
Am I the only who finds it very cute when Shane was in the closet and he politely asked: "When should I come out of here?"
To Shane, do you get enjoyment from scaring Ryan before he goes into the house alone #POSTMORTEM
Why have I never heard of this place, yet right after watching this I finally caught up on Destination Fear and was on the Vilisca murder House episode this season
ghost: stop me my head: *starts playing i can't stop me by twice*
maybe the bacon wrapped in the towel was something like pigs in a blanket?
Putty was invented In 1943 and the murders were in 1912
You guys are extremely rude when supposedly talking to ghosts who were traumatically murdered children. I wouldn't want to contact any living beings if they were talking to me like a douchebag tbh
almost same happened in India burrari deaths 13 people died mysteriously
How do I get ahold of you guys? I am a local and want to give you my opinion on a few things about this as well as call out a weird mistake made on the video.. if you're still in town we could do a interview if wanted.
My guess is the wrapped bacon in case there was a dog?
Ryan is much braver this season omg
#postmortem You and Shane should do a episode with Ghost Adventures and hope Shane will tiptoe over to ghoul town… amazing season btw.
Who's watching in 2027?
FACT; IOWA IS HAUNTED
#postmortem i live near here!! my question, what was the most compelling piece of evidence you guys think you found
I recently heard about this case on one of my favorite podcasts "Morbid" it goes into it a little more and even includes some theories.
The voice at 14:45 sounds like a girl, my heart dropped immediately picturing two of the girls curiously investigating the strange unknown technology in their home - “what is it?” They sounded like they curious kids sneaking around..
NO WAY YALL WERE IN IOWA
Hehe I'm scared
For #postmortem were any women ever suspected of the murders?
...to have humbleness by one's side is an advantage a benefit, even if one try to pretend it; still that does not answer the motive of killing innocent children...
okay but "putty" was intvented in 1943...
#postmortem Could the killer's spirit be trapped in the place of his crime as punishment for his sins?
Why is this a final season bcos I thought u guys won't stop untill u guys get an evidence ......??#Q and A
Can you guys do the blair witch at some point
Also for #postmortem: Shane, what "supernatural" things do you believe in? I know aliens is a yes but what about our other homies like Bigfoot and Mothman?
For #postmortem: I just listened to a podcast about this murder and it is wild let me tell ya. After looking at all the evidence I believe the murder was actually a serial killer, due to there being multiple ax killings with the exact mo in close locations, all near railroad tracks. Ya'll should look into the other ax murders and compare, it's really fascinating.
For Post Mortem, do either of you have any theories for why he killed them? Do you think they were targeted or random? and if it was targeted, would he have known that the Stillinger girls were sleeping over?
town marshall is the culprit
For Post Mortem, Why do you think the murderer haunts this house and not where he died? It's more common that ghosts haunt the place they died, so do you think he went out of his way to return to the house or is he just not there at all?
"Yeah, we got beef." - Shane  Strange how Iowa has over double the cows Illinois has. Seems like /we/ actually have beef.
its so frustrating to see just HOW MUCH evidence there was on the scene and know that its still unsolved
ferb i know what were doing today!
If the recorder left in the room was alone the "what is it" could be referencing to the device the ghost asking what the recorder was.
The Morbid podcast literally just did a 2 part episode on the Villisca murders this past week! What are the chances I'd be so prepared,
can we talk about how horrifying this case is tho
What took you guys so long to make this episode if it's one of the most famous cases out there?
Some sources says he used the slab of bacon as a masturba+ion tool. Look into the Morbid crime podcast.
I'm going to miss watching them so much 🥺
Postmortem: could it be possible that if it were a family member or friend that the night before they drugged the family so that it made it easier for them to kill the family without anyone waking or unable to fight back?
As someone from Iowa, the war is indeed legit. And Iowa… is indeed haunted.
For #PostMortem so, Iowa has the ax murder house and Illinois has John Wayne Gacy.... I'd like to hear your thoughts on who  wins that jellybean. #Boogaras #ButMyMomIsAShaniac
I'm shaking and my heart is beating so fast because I sleep in a pitch black room..haha- 😍
The"what is it" sounded more like let us in
Why do i feel like the caretaker is the murderer 🤔😆
Not being awake at 5am? Sus.
for #postmortem, do you think you don't get as much evidence because Shane IS a demon, and the other demons and ghosts are too scared of him to do much? #boogara #sorryshane
This one felt less like a "haunted house"and more like a sad house
This has to be the most evidence I’ve seen! The audio is so clear
Almost midnight, eating chocolate chip cookies while watching Ryan and Shane get bold with ghosts. Sounds like a good time.
#postmortem  👻hey guys love your work and how you guys connect,I’m wondering if you guys will ever do a world tour  and check out haunts all over , like suicide forest in Japan for example, Where ghost/yokai mythology goes very far back, thx 🖖
wonder if they ever asked the butcher if anyone bought bacon recently
this murder case sounds like something straight out of a criminal minds episode
(yeef)
I love how this episode kind of seems like a mix between supernaural and true crime,
I don't understand why the brother went to the room where the Stillinger girls were because you would think he would go straight to his brother's bedroom
Holy Crap! I grew up in Clarinda IA 15 mins away from there.. been on the tour it's intense.
"release me" also sounded like "booty smoothie"
maybe multiple murderers, could explain how 8 people died without a lot of commotion- this reminded me a lot of the keddy cabin murders
Maybe the mirror coverings were a sign of him knowing that mirrors are a portal and he didn't want them to find the way or no way.
#Postmortem are you two going to continue this on Watcher I really hope so it’s an awesome show
For #postmortem could the family have been drugged?
The intro bullshitting grabbed me by the sack and would not let me go 😆. Fuggin hilarious boys.
the “what is it” and “i’m in here” made me so uncomfy
For #postmortem, People typically cover up the mirrors after someone died in the house. They do this so the souls wouldn't get trapped in the house. Covering faces is also usually  covered to show remorse because they couldn't look at the faces.
I love these 2 👻👻
When Ryan asks "Why are you still here?" and it says in the red subtitles "Helpless" (unintelligible), my subtitles said "(machine)That was fun." Weird....and kind of creepy.
What if the killer then became the axe man of New Orleans since they both used the home owners axe
Am I having weird deja vu or did Buzzfeed Unsolved True Crime or some other true crime show on Youtube for this ? I swear they did but I can't find it when googling... I already knew the whole story going in and I SWEAR it was an unsolved true crime episode I saw it on.... wanna make sure I'm not going crazy lol
For #postmortem , how long did you guys film for before you actually got an answer back from spirits?(via spirit box/stuff like that)
as many people going in and out of that house I believe the evil spirit has already gone
I love that we got a recreation of Shane's scream like the one he did at Hannah's house 😭
The murderer probably was a family member or knew the family enough to know where food items were, what the house looked like and where he could get a white rag.
So did they ask the towns butcher/s about who bought pounds of bacon that week? No? Seriously? That was probably their best lead!
wouldn’t it be funny if the guy like hurt himself on the way in and was using the raw bacon to ice his injury lol
I don't know if it was mentioned, but it was tradition to cover mirrors with a cloth when a death occurred in a household. There was a belief that if the mirror was uncovered, the spirit would get trapped in the mirror and not be able to pass on to the afterlife. This also worked if the mirror was turned against the wall.
go to the ram in UK stay overnight?
For postmortem: Great work to both of you as well as your production team. Truly will be missed once the show is over.  I have a question if I may ask. Given that you’ve visited many potentially haunted places, have either of you (or your team) came back from a trip and just felt like, maybe you’ve brought something spiritually back with you? I just feel even if these places aren’t haunted, I still wouldn’t want to poke the bear as much as you guys do. Particularly Shane 😂
Are they making a spoof of the ghost adventure shows? It's kinda annoying
the murderer was definitely very remorseful if he covered the bodies and the mirror. in a town with so few people, he probs knew them. maybe the bacon was a ruse ? some food in exchange for hospitality for the night ? tho idk why it would be left on the floor staged like that. grosses me out to think the killer definitely toured the house with other townspeople to relive his crime
Possibly the family was drugged.  I doubt whatever coroner had jurisdiction over this small town in 1912 ordered any kind of tox screen when all the victims had obviously died of blunt force trauma.  Being drugged may explain why none of them appear to have awoken in time.
This sounds really familiar. Did this not happen in Germany also? To the Hinterkaifeck family?
Morbid just did a 2 part episode about this 2 weeks ago. Before then, I had never heard of this case.
At 19:57 all I can hear is “AND 1” and I think of The Professor trying to find basketball terms lmao, maybe this ghost just is hip with The Professors lingo
Jesus Christ is coming back very soon I know you might’ve heard it before but it’s true or else you wouldn’t be seeing it.Prophecy the Bible spoke of is coming to pass now like never before.God doesn’t want any of you to perish what I mean is whether you believe it or not we are all sinners who have fallen short of His glory and without His mercy we were destined to hell bc we have transgressed God’s law which we are all guilty of so God sent His son Jesus to save sinners like you and I He died a brutal death on the cross and 3 days later rose up from the grave to pay the price/wages of all our sins so if we have Faith in Jesus believe in Jesus death,resurrection and repent of urs sins confessing  Him as Lord would be saved don’t wait another day call upon His name NOW is the time.He loves you so much!❤️❤️
@6:50 I wasn’t looking at the screen and heard the spirit box say either “I’m Shane” or “hi Shane” at that point and had to rewind and see it again. Idk if I’m the only one who heard it, but it sounded so clear when I was looking away and was honestly baffled that I had to go back and check again
25:03 when Ryan said “the caretaker thinks that the house has a dangerous effect on people and their mental state while inside” I’d like to let Ryan know I was uncontrollably crying on and off while watching this video. I wasn’t sad, I just couldn’t stop myself from crying. Wonder why that is? Does it affect watchers as well? Did anyone else experience this?
Anyone else here fans of the Morbid podcast?! Their theory about the bacon is stuck with me 😩
Is it me or do these guys remind you of key and peele skits!! 😂
It sounded like the audio said 'I'm visible' or 'invisible' instead of I'm miserable.
That "What is it?" voice is perhaps the only voice I've ever actually believed it's a real voice
Ok… shouldn’t have watched this on the farm alone at night 😅
https://youtu.be/eL5hdHdd8Wg OUT NOW
this episode keeps giving me chills wtf
Try the Lizzie Borden house
Was that a Boohbah in the closet at 17:18?? LOL
Just listened to a podcast about this and…unfortunately the breakfast thing is not the hypothesized reason for the bacon being there.
Man, now I really want to know more about the suspects in this case. I'm probably too late for the post mortem but I hope they cover at least some of it.
For #postmortem the killer put cloth over the mirrors which suggests some kind of remorse, but later people say that the ‘ghost’ of the killer enjoyed killing and liked hurting people. However the spirit did say ‘I’m miserable’ in the attic. why would the ‘spirit’ act so differently then covering the mirrors suggests. Is it possible he covered the mirrors so that if someone woke up they wouldn’t see him in the mirror?
for postmortem: how long do spirt box sessions usually last? thanks so much for another incredible episode :)
Do you guys even bother to be authentic?
The voices sound like they're reliving their last moments before they get murdered
#postmoretem Why do you think spirits dont response to your questions or show signs when you ask?
Omggg they have no suspects? No theories? Why does that scare me so much?!?
In the places in Iowa where I've been, it would be so easy to cover up a murder and not need to worry about noise. You get immune to bloodcurdling murder noises because THERE ARE SHRIEKING FROGS EVERYWHERE
In all fairness to the town marshal, fingerprinting didn't become common in the US until 1902 and this little town probably had no idea it existed in 1912.   There was nothing to contaminate when they let the people tour the home and see what was done to their neighbors.
i love watching these while getting geico ads it’s such unintentionally brilliant tonal whiplash
For postmortem: do you think the brother could have been the killer? He had a key that he could have used to get in and out and would have known how to sneak around the house. Also covering all the faces could be a sign of remorse.
I’m from Iowa
Is this guitar playing up to the mark? https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGwo4iqsr5wzHZig0vISdMOG-rw-CyHNt
I think the murderer was Joshia’s brother because the door was locked by the killer. The brother was called to unlock the door - he had a key. He could have been there that night and left in the morning. He covered the face of his victims showing remorse. He ate breakfast in the home before leaving which shows comfort in his surroundings. Love the show #Boogara #Shaneislit
ammityville plz
I think he used the bacon to knock em out. The ol' raw meat to the noggin move
Nobody is talking about the flashlights ? ... how ??
"So they can all go f*ck themselves" I'm from Iowa so I  just go do that quickly.
Ryan is having an existential crisis  Shane: "F¤cko!"
What always bothers me about ghost ‘evidence’ is that every device that is supposed to indicate ghosts doesn’t have an explanation as to how exactly a ghost would interface with it, so the only evidence that it works is that when it was used in a place that we expect there to be ghosts, it did some arbitrary thing, so ghosts have to exist? Ghost inventors need to get better control groups or something
For #postmortem : I'm not sure if it's a global thing, but here in the UK around the same era and a bit earlier it was customary to cover a mirror (and sometimes other reflective surfaces like windows) to ensure that the deceased persons spirit did not become trapped in the mirror. This was particularly big in the Victorian era. Could this be the reason that the mirrors were covered? Therefore could the ax wielding maniac be a Boogara?
Please also check out The Man From the Train by Bill James and his daughter, Rachel, because the same criminal may have been a prolific serial killer who broke in and killed families with their own axe all over America and was never caught
You guys should look into either Robert the Doll or the Beast of the Land Between the Lakes and the killings that happened at the Land Between the Lakes in the 1970s which had been attributed to the Beast.
#postmortem I have a strong inkling that maybe this was a personal killing, mainly towards Josiah Moore. I mean..the seemingly perfect family may not be so perfect deep down. Maybe he owed the killer money? Maybe he had some dirt on the killer and was gonna expose him? Maybe he and the killer were friends and maybe the killer was a lover of Josiah's wife or Josiah himself? Just some guesses but I feel like there has to be some significance to why EVERYONE in the house was targeted, why Josiah was the only one to receive an actual chop to the head while everyone else was bludgeoned, also why he fixed himself a meal (probably) after the killings? Maybe as a way to say goodbye to the people he knew by having a last dinner with them? Dont know...but interesting case. Missed you two and your Ghost hunting! #boogaraforever #shaneishilarioustho
Hey Ryan I really hope that someday you will be able to do an investigation with some perfesonal ghost investigators. Sorry to say this but I don't think ghost like Shane. At the Conjuring house when the doors opened I think the ghost left the house. Just saying  #Ryan
The "what is it" is such a clear female voice. I'd pose a guess that it's the one of the two girls. Maybe the one with the mark on her arm. That or the mother of the home in response to someone waking her up because they heard something. If it was the young girls they more than likely froze with fear and stayed in bed faking sleep untill the man walked in. Or if it were the mother she may have been ignorant to the pleas.
I mean the town marshall let people touch the murder weapon, you ever thing maybe he had something to do with it and wanted the people to tamper with the evidence? just a thought :oo
For postmortem: why tho? Why put up with Shane’s attitude Ryan? Jk I love Shane. But only jk a little. Boogara for life
You guys should go investigate Spellbound studios in LA
Ryan how do u feel when u walk into a place that murders happened, and Shane  do u ever feel that Ryan going end up with a demon attached to him. This for question postmortem
These guys deserve a show on Netflix or something
My best friend unfortunately was killed by her boyfriend in their bedroom. I once stopped by after work one night to leave flowers because it was her birthday and I saw the bedroom light turn on and off over and over again. I thought it was squatters so I called the police but they said nobody seemed to be inside. I told her mother and she burst into tears and said she hated the idea of her babygirl being stuck in that home. I hope those kids and parents aren't stuck there.
I feel like ghosts know they’re on camera
It's Axe, btw.
For my birthday I went to that house to tour and we got an energy censor that detected energy by the bed where they were murdered
Iowa and Illanois: YEAH WE GOT BEEF Idaho: Yeah, we got potatoes
Thought that last video was the last one?
When they asked “why did you do what you did?” And the spirit said “hard to stop” made my blood run cold. Maybe the person was either a serial killer or only came to kill one or two people but they couldn’t stop killing. Just a theory. Pretty damn creepy
for the #postmortem the caretaker stated that the house messes with the mental state of those that stay in the house. did either of you feel any different? while being in the house as apposed to when y'all left? also the last episode is the same episode i have a concert on so thaaaaanks
For Post Mortem: Could we see Shane’s initial reactions to the EVPs please? They were some of my favorite moments in the earlier episodes. Also, love you guys and the watcher channel. Proud of you all and thankful for the laughs you provide, especially during these tough times. ^-^
Did anybody hear a whispered "help" when he flips the camera at 31:17
I swear I heard it say Henry when they thought it said stop me. I didn’t even know before that a man named Henry Lee Moore was a suspect
It's those weird shaped Windows!! The Amityville horror house had those too and that involved  murder. I'd never live in a house with those windows 😱😱💀
The ligma ax murder house
Never in my life has a room given worse vibes than the parents room in that house.
OR... he missed breakfast.... Pahahahaha
They could've pulled down the sheet covering the mirror. That would've produced a creepy responses or prolly a shadow of one of the victims.
Stupendous channel
Man, I want them to visit the Stanley Hotel so badly
My theory is there were more than 1 mirderer, since it really make me think HOW do you bludgen someone to death and not wake the person sleeping next to them?
ok guys you need to do a little more research on traditions during the era. The cloth over the window was a custom they did at the time for when someone dies you cover the mirror so the spirit don't get trapt in it.
6:50 it sounds like interesting
Hey Shane, I'm from IL too! 🤙
Covid has made us all a bit crazy but I think they felt it worse
For #postmortem: Do you have any theories/ideas about the mental state that the killer was in at the time? The murdering of eight people (including children), the covering of the mirror, making themselves a snack in the kitchen, and potentially hiding in the attic says some really interesting things about the person who did it.
(yeef)
#postmortem if Ryan reads this and let’s me go to the next hunt I’ll tatto both their face on me
I feel like the only soul left in the house is the soul of the murderer. It seems like he wanted to tell that he's been miserable for years.
I feel like it may have been the marshall. If he didn't do it, then he knows who did.  By allowing everyone in town to not only tread through the house while the bodies were STILL THERE, but ALSO allow them to handle the axe, he basically made it seem like anyone could have done it. Why would he have done that if he wasn't trying to cover something up?
so we can all agree ms pecham or whatever her name was was the killer right? like thats just obvious
What about.. the dad did it ? And then killed himself with the sharp piece of the axe 🪓
Sherlock and Watson lol
#postmortem between the flashlights flickering offbeat in this episode and the ones from the conjuring episode, y'all really need to get new flashlights
I got into unsolved mysteries and stuff like that after hearing the story about B.D Cooper
*me enjoying the video* "WHAT IS IT" made me SCREECH
this has absouletly nothing to do with this video, love it and its amazing per usual. However i want to try out discord to meet some new people, if anyone knows of a discord server that doesnt have a lot of people and is taking new people (?) then please let me know :))))
What if the marshal did it and that’s why he contaminated the axe *shrug*
Is this guitar playing not bad? https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGwo4iqsr5wzHZig0vISdMOG-rw-CyHNt
colourblind ghosts: _sweats nervously_
okay but like, why would the killers "spirit" be in the house tho, ne didn't d i e in the house, he left, getting away with the murders, and seemingly lived out the rest of his life, however he may have died
be nice to them:( they aren’t demons. just spirits. they all got killed :(
please dont let this show go
It's all in your head. You go into a house that says is haunted and your mind likes tricks on you.
for post mortem, is it possible there was more than one killer due to the fact that no one heard anything. they could have all been killed at the same time by two or more people?
2014..his name was Robert Laursen Jr. he was 37..and he was w a couple of people. .doing paranormal research. ..and it was 1235am...or 12 something  according to the police report. ..the time he was transported to the hospital
For postmortem: Is it possible the family was drugged? Could possibly explain some connection with the bacon found wrapped up. The killer snuck in to plant the tainted food or perhaps was the one who sold it to the family. They wouldn't need to worry about the family waking up during the murders and then after the killer wrapped up the food and took the evidence with him, making the mistake of dropping the bacon.
Hi guys! I’ve heard more than one investigator say that the family isn’t there anymore, just the killer. Ryan, do you think they are right? I’m not even going to bother asking Shane. #postmortem #boogara
Did anyone else hear “please” or “leave” at 31:47 ?
Covering a victim’s face with clothing/bedding is a sign of guilt and remorse! So ties to the idea that he may not of wanted to kill this family or knew it was wrong but genuinely couldn’t stop!
With that beard, Shane Looks like a ghost Give that man a cowboy hat and you guys have a great mascot for your ghost hunting
Is no one seeing the link between the bacon and the covered mirrors? There was a Jewish serial killer in that town that spent years screaming into his pillow every night, "THE CLUES WRE THERE, DAMMIT!. THEY WERE THERE!"
My favorite moment in past episodes is when the demon was playing with them when Ryan was counting down,
I would love to go ghost hunting with Ryan but omg we’d both be crying with terror
#Postmortem Where did the Ovilus contraption go? Less offensive to my ear drums than the spitit box lol     Also anyone else get resource exhausted check quota error on here?
23:10 sounds like he said 1980
I dare you to go to the Lamb house in Carmel Maine
Shane just lying on the floor, thinking about getting whacked by an axe 🤣
When Ryan asked the killer why did he do what he did ryan thought it said “leave”.  I heard “I’m evil”  🤷🏻‍♀️
For #postmortem I have a question for Shane in regards to the flashlights: You said that the flashlights turn on and off by themselves. But how do you explain the flashlights staying on *until* you start the questioning? And when you go camping, like your crap example, do your flashlights just randomly turn off the entire time?  Also, you say it has no science backing it up, but that is false. Demons use the power of the flashlights to gain energy and draw the light out of them. Anywho, try harder next time, bestie
(postmortem?) Apologies if this was covered elsewhere but how come you've never used the phonetic voice box thing again? The thing used at Hannah's house. Thought it was interesting and infinitely less annoying than the sound of the spirit box😅
I would love to own and live in that house
Did anyone else pinch the bridge of their nose and give a heavy sigh when Ryan said that people were walking in while the bodies were still there and handling the ax. Because same.
awwhh...thats a ghost thing, lolol
the uncooked bacon is absolutely sending me sfdlkjs
sad to find out that shane is in fact a fib (fuckin illinois bastard) :/
Ryan’s voice gives such an ominous vibe
i dont believe their..the Moores.  ghosts..are the entity s thatvare particularly there....more than likely they are gone but i believe entities ate around us .constantly!
YEAH THE GHOUL BOYS IN IOWA
jusy the fact im sure u giys put nee batteries in thr flashlights every tour u go on...the fact the flashlights turn on and off is absolutely enough evidence for myself .anyway! !
i feel like ryan and shane need to leave the spirit box on for a longer time, they turn it on for like 2 minutes then turn it off
Shane makes my tiny, black, grinch-sized heart so happy. 🖤🖤🖤 The scream after Ryan said unicorns aren't real... * swoons *
maybe the ghost haven't masterd turning stuff on and off..like how to manifest or use energy. ..
for post mortem: this case seems very similar to the HinterkaifeCK farm house case in 1922 in Germany. Both cases had the killer hiding in the attic and eating a meal in the house before leaving. Probably not the same killer but give there is only a 10 year gap it could be possible
#postmortem: sad to see the end of supernatural but looking forward for this finale. Quick question: wondering if there was any core relation between these murders (what year and historial context) and the Lizzie Borden case? Could it be a copy cat killer or killers?
Ryan seems strangely calm-
#postmortem at one point in the video (forgot where) boogara asked “who did it?” And although the subtitle said “unintelligible” I swear I heard “more than one”. More than one person? A spirit/demon possessing a human vessel?   Also Shane has officially become unhinged.
Maybe the bacon was to pacify a dog had there been one.

What if the marshes that let everyone touch the axe was the murder and he did that to cover his tracks?
17:47 bro whatever that is in the mid-left of the screen between the two beds, looked like a severed head and it scared me so bad-
Watching this at 12 am on Sunday and tmrw I have school 🧍
I just want the ghost to respond to Shane in such a way that is so obvious ghost exist and then Shane find a way to disprove it was a ghost and we be back at square one lol
why is no one talking about the bed moving??
You'll get like 5 episodes in a row with no activity then all of a sudden you'll get one like this where there just seems to be a lot of stuff going on 😯
Strangest wish you where here postcards you could send 😂😂 very mixed messages
I actually suggested they should check that out!
All these seasons and I still haven't gotten used to that creepy mannequin 😀
man..over 1 million views? !!yall are banking it up
#Postmortem For when you guys are using maglights, have you ever seen what happens if you don't ask questions for a extended period of time? Do they still turn on and off on their own?
My grandson and I were there a few years ago. We heard children laughing in the room where the 2 girls died. I didn't feel much in the house. Going down into the cellar was a whole different thing.   I really didnt want to go, but I  did. I caught a large orb down there.  Didnt see it until we were going over photos.
#postmortem I think that whoever committed the murders was either a family member or someone very close to the family. Usually when a killer covers their victims’ bodies it’s because they lowkey care about the victim.. I feel like that would maybe explain why the mirrors were covered up too, they didn’t wanna see themselves committing the murder. My name is pronounced fa-teya, don’t say it wrong thx
13:47 Right here, the ghost crashed my browser.
Shane's disdain for the spirit box is the lighthearted touch this video needed.
I know that Shane may not believe but lets say that ghosts are real... I think that the way y'all approach children's spirits could be intimidating to them. Sometimes the way y'all speak is a bit gruff and would make my own kids feel uncomfortable. Ergo, stop swearing if children may be about. Sitting on a childs bed may also intimidate them. Maybe try sitting on the floor, getting on their level. Bring stuffies or toys but leave them there for them.
Thank you Youtube Subtitles for captioninh Shane yelling about unicorns not being real as "(Shane Roars)"
For the postmortem: what do you think the bacon slab could have meant? It reminds me of The Godfather -- "it means Luca Brassi sleeps with the fishes"... But bacon in the room where the friends were sleeping? Do you boys have any theories on that? #postmortem
I live in Dubuque and Iowa sucks.
Imagine someone nocks at your door 7 am to check you out because no one is up and about!
"That thing sucks" lmao
In the old days mirrors where covered when people died so their soul wouldn’t get trapped because mirrors where/are seen as portals. People also opened windows so the soul could be free.
😎👍
I wonder if maybe the killer had some kind of split-personality or suffered some kind of mental break that caused these horrific actions. The way the spirit box responded, “Stop Me,” “Help Me,” “I’m Miserable,” etc gives me the impression there is some remorse and that the killer is trapped where they committed these horrible acts due to a feeling of guilt.  Though, we’ll never truly know.
It’s creepy to think that if the whole town came to the crime scene and the murderer lived in the town, they probably came back to see the murders they committed, pretending to be shocked and appalled but secretly giddy at seeing everyone’s reaction
You should do the spirit box with headphones so that you don't have to annoy each other HAHA. But, if you get the S-Box Spirit box it can also record and play back the sound for the video.
Thank you, thank you, thank you for finally going to Villesca.
Morbid just came out with a two part for this same murders
We just gon gloss over the "release me" and the "Hard to stop" comments huh?  *edited for a typo
Is Ryan single?
Ryan isn’t afraid of ghosts anymore! I think he’s been to so many haunted places that he’s starting to think maybe it’s all just stories.
https://youtu.be/GHIMASbscXA
Ghost DILDO ? Ryan
Listen, i dont believe in ghosts but i just have to say… of course the ONE TIME ryan gets something as big as a bed moving, shane is standing inside a closet
Next ghost investigation they gotta wear ghostbusters costume
#portmortem @14:47 the "what is it" is the scariest thing out of this episode. Definitely proves to me that ghosts are real.
Finally one for the Iowa homies
Let’s see if I end up in a puddle of MY OWN BLOOD 😂
#Postmortem: https://youtu.be/aABFIzfg72A?t=1179 19:39 It sounded to me like it said: "Fredrick" or something similar in response to Ryan asking for his parents' names? The translation says "stop me", but that's not why I hear.
Did you guys put the doll back on the chair in the attic? Because it was there while Ryan was up there
Maybe the town marshal was the murderer and that’s why he let a bunch of people contaminate the crime scene
#Postmortem: I'm kind of a Shaniac and don't believe in ghosts the way Ryan does, but I gotta give it to this house. After the Ohio State Penn and the Waverly, this is the most "evidence" I've seen during an episode. There was a theme to it too, which made it more appealing from an outsider standpoint. It almost sounded like someone kept asking to be stopped from doing more bad things, which is curious. The only reason I don't believe it, at all, is because of the Spirit box.  Anyway, good episode! I'm very proud of how far Ryan has come in facing his fears! Love you guys!
im not sure if anyone noticed but when Ryan goes into the attic at around 31:40 there is a doll sitting behind him, staring at the camera, then at around 32:20 when he's counting down the dolls head is leaning back
Back in the old days people use to take an axe and hit hogs between the eyes the the blunt side
for postmortem: Is it possible the murderer never left the house after the killings? Evidence being the front door remained locked, a meal was prepared and the effort to shroud the bodies- perhaps the killer intended to stay a while and didn't want to look at what they'd done. I find it curiously possible that the killer could have remained in the attic after the incident and simply climbed down and blended in with the bustles of townspeople come to gawk at the bodies.
I have real horror content btw
If 8 were killed in the house while still in bed and no disturbance, why are we assuming it was just ONE person? Wouldn't it make sense that more than one person was involved? Or did I miss something? EDIT: I know only one weapon was found and footprints, but the whole house/crime scene was contaminated with random townsfolk walking all over and touching things. Any of the other evidence that might have been found could have been gone.
The bots took over the comment section. A true haunting.            I hate myself because of this terrible joke
#postmortem I wish this wasn't the last season cause I wanna see Shane and Ryan go to a haunted location that they know absolutely nothing about, hear/see stuff and gather their evidence, and THEN read up on the place to see if any of the pieces match up. I just think that would be so cool if they got something out of that hahaha
At 31.36 when ryan asked the killer "why did you do what you did here" the killer definetly replied "boobie"
How special was this children’s service?
You MUST watch “observe” here on YouTube, he talking about you guys. It’s hilarious.  I love it.
#postmortem wonder if the ghost couldn’t tell what colour the flashlights were…colourblind ghost ???
The girls probably don’t know their colors lol. Y’all just had black and blue flash lights. They’re probably confused 😅😂
I didn't need to sleep for yet another night, thanks.
Of course the name of the current house caretaker is Johnny Houser
So why the flashlight turn off and on? How is that normal to these guys?
Could have been the town Marshall who killed them, that's why he  contaminated the evidence Dont they cover up the mirrors when a Jewish person dies, also some believe the ghosts can live in the mirrors, i may be wrong
Ok but if we are just letting the house be a site for gawking, after the crime, maybe the food the investigators saw was from someone else? Lol
Hey, I just want yall to he aware that in your last video there was a woman in the basement after Shane said "Crooked neck lady, why is your neck like that!?" There is a figure behind the boxes that moves to hide.
The scariest part to me was that the neighbor was finishing laundry at 5:30am! 😬   Btw, does anyone know what they did for work (well, the mom probably sayed at home to raise the kids, but I am curious what the dad did for a living).
Shane represents Illinois very well. I can say that because I am from Illinois.
I think the fact that it remains unsolved makes it that much more disturbing!  Murder without motive baffles my mind 🔪🔪🔪
What a waste if bacon
#postmortem Could it have been one of the victims, perhaps the father? Like a murder-suicide that would explain why the murderer still haunts the house and why they were never found
I love that I’m just watching this in my family’s house in Iowa rn.
The ghost definitely said "Patrick" instead of "stop me" when they asked for his parents names
Anyone else feel like they never leave the spirit box on long enough?
When Shane asked about who/what they saw, and it’s labeled as unintelligible, it sounded like Edward to me.
#Postmortem This question is for Shane. Shane, what’s your stance on souls? Are you admitting that you are just a meat vessel? Big fan of the Hot Daga by the way, but sorry I’m still a #Boogara #morethanjustameatvessel
They would cover the mirrors with a cloth back in the day so the spirit wouldn't get trapped inside
From Iowa, can confirm,  very haunted.  Many ghosts
These are definitely the most coherent and on topic spirit box messages I’ve heard. Still don’t think ghosts are real but if any of these episodes were proof of real ghosts, this’d be the one.
"I'm sooo vulnerable right now Oh My God!" -story of my life 28:30
Omg im from iowa!!!!
19:10  L O L
Kinda funny, coincidentally, that I just listened to the morbid podcast's 2 part episode for the Villisca Axe murders, and then this episode comes out
i cant fathom that this show will end😐
Alot of the things that the killer did like covering their faces and the mirrors showed remorse or guilt. Usually covering the face of the victim is because the killer cannot stand to look at what they did or even as a way to put them to rest. Covering the mirror may have been because the killer couldn't stand to look at themself. The audio recorder picked up "hard to stop" which could point to some form of compulsive disorder or something similar. This last part is very out there but the bacon could have been a sort of peace offering or apology. Maybe the killer worked at a farm or butchers. That might narrow it down a bit.
I’ve read that when someone dies, you cover reflective surfaces so their ghost doesn’t haunt you.
For the #Postmortem Have you heard of the  Book called “The Man from the Train” which theorized this Ax murder and several other ax murders of whole families during that time period was committed by a man named Paul Mueller that was a traveling Lumberjack. Estimates put him between 40-100 possible victims.
Am I crazy, or was there a true crime episode about this case?
Clown Motel
I think all people were drugged in church itself, somehow the wife wasn't drugged. that explained the killing without anyone getting up when the other person in room killed. Or wife was with the murderer, that explains it.
Shane looks like a dad from an animated Pixar movie💀
Why do these always pop up for me at night, when it's dark, and I'm high, and I'm scared man?
I hope you guys bring the ghost search stuff to watcher. I need more trolling of the undead from Shane.
They should investigate Zak bagans museum LOL or join them on an episode haha
Me being a history student: Oh 1912 titanic sinking time
#postmortem Yeah that is cool and all, but do you think the ghost/spirits aren't talking to yall so it'll confuse the general audience?  I assume that they at least have some knowledge. Spirits/ghost was once human in their life, so it make sense that they will still have life.  Also maybe this killer is like Chucky,  just love killing peeps.
Unicorns are real, Ryan! #PostMortem
In the attic when the spirit box said “8” it could be referring to the number of people they killed.
When an anime character goes ballistic 32:16
For #postmortem : why don’t you guys freak out when the flashlight goes on and off? It isn’t a regular flashlight or is a special ghost one that is easy to turn on and off? Bc I’m surprised every time that it does that ahahaha
Where in Illinois are you from?
for the #postmortem, what do you guys think about the theory regarding the killer being a traveller on the railroad that runs through the town? Do you think the killer knew the family or was it a random killing? some people theorize that this killer was actually a serial killer and used the railroad to travel and remain undetected? opinions?
the sheets over the mirrors were to prevent their spirits from getting caught in them. spiritual people know mirrors are doorways, which is why many of us wont sleep with an uncovered one facing the bed. spirits are drawn to them and they use them to get around. maybe the killer didnt want them seeking revenge?
YESSSSS I’m so happy they’re back!
My 1 yr old daughter loves ya'lls stuff. Unsolved and most of all Too many spirits. Too bad this is the last season of unsolved. Best believe I will have it on repeat. I know it's not the best for a little one too watch but she loves it. Maybe one days the ghoul boys will be back it again in one shape or form🤞
Foe #postmortem At 31:56 it sounds like it’s saying “leave me”

You know you should check out the Still-Hildreth sanitorium in Northeast Missouri. It was a sanitorium where they did a lot of "therapy" and where people have died. It's also now an apartment building complex
#postmortem Hey, what's up, has anyone in your team experienced supernatural activity after visiting a location(like at home or something)?
Excuse me is that a man by their window  I'm out
It's odd that the killer would conduct the proper funerary measures of covering faces and covering the mirrors after death so as to not trap them in the mirrors or distres the spirits but then closed the windows and blinds since that was thought to trap the spirits in the house. Like he didn't want them stuck in a small space but he still wanted to trap them??
maybe he covered all the mirrors to keep the victims spirits from becoming trapped because i believe that it’s a popular belief that mirrors trap spirits and that’s why people sometimes cover them up at funerals and stuff
Someone was already sitting next to Ryan when he felt the bed move. You can see a dent before it moves and afterwards there's no dent. You can also see the dent on the pillows when the boys go and look in the closet. Don't belive me? Go back and slow down the video and you can see the bed retract. If you wanna go further reverse it. I promise you won't be disappointed. Point for the #boogaras # postmortem
When the spirt said "helpless" in the attic, i heard "Taco Sunday" 😂😂
maybe the bacon was a disguise of sorts? like the killer was carrying it around pretending to be a butcher bringing meat?
#postmortem I just want to know how Shane felt about that Boobah doll in the closet. Honestly it's more scary than any potential ghost in this and I stand by that.
i wonder if the bacon was to distract any dogs the family might have had?
Y’all don’t know how to talk to any ghost or past humans respectfully the content is amazing jus do it with respect
why does it have to be just one murderer?
ive toured this place and there were TMNT crocs in the down stairs closet. i wonder if its there still there lmao
I don't quite understand why they're so nonchalant with the whole flashlight thing now.  I get that it's not impossible for a flashlight to go off on it's own but usually it's because there's was an issue with the battery, bulb, or something with the switch or wiring.  And I've NEVER seen one turn on on its own.  I'm not jumping to conclusions and saying it's something supernatural but if this is "normal" to them, probably means they should've invested in getting new flashlights.
Love the unsolved paranormal videos keep up the great work
Post mortem: Have y'all seen the theory that the Villisca Axe Murderer is also the Axeman of New Orleans and possibly even the killer of the residents of the Hinterkaifeck farm?? Bad era for families with axes.
Why do you have to stop producing these. They are literally the best shows. You guys have amazing on screen charm. Please keep producing them.... Please. Ps if you don't I will haunt you.
shane and ryan could fake a totally undeniable ghost siting in the last episode and thanks to them never finding ghosts before, we’d all have to believe it
FOR POSTMORTEM: Will you do a "Father Thomas Reacts to Buzzfeed Unsolved Supernatural "?
7:29 I swear I heard Tom Brady lmao
Idk if the family is still present but I think the killer is in a loop of that night and he is begging Ryan to stop him from killing the family so he can move on.
at 14:47 am i the only one who heard "Let us in"?
the ‘visitor’ pic looks like Ben Barnes
#postmortem my theory is that some ghost are introverts, so they may not be comfortable in telling two strangers their life stories! Maybe your just visiting shy ghost? 👻
Amityville next
Why is there one of those fuzzy purple baloo(?) fellas in the closet?
I bet the bacon was in case they had a dog. Which would mean that the murderer didn't know the family and had done this before. 🤔
Why am I watching this before bed?😭
bnm,
Imagine being a ghost, doing your ghostly rounds, and then some guy kicks open the closet door and screams. My ghoulish soul would be scared shitless
pig in a blanket
Thank you I can't sleep now
When they opened the door to go inside the squeaking door sounded like a guinea pig.
I WOULD watch ur videos since I enjoy the topics discussed, but I WONT watch your videos because I don't wanna hear you dropping the F BOMB or cursing in general.
The scream by Shane after Ryan proclaims unicorns aren’t real but ghosts are 藍藍
I think the murderer was trying to call the people ‘pigs in a blanket’ 😬😬. So I think the person did not like the family and killed them in their ‘blankets’.
Guys I’m from Iowa and there is a couple places I know of that you should go to
#postmordem : What similarities or differences do you see with the Villisca Ax Case and any other Ax Murderer Case (Ex, Lizzie Borden Case)?
Maybe ghosts are colourblind and that’s why they couldn’t do the torches!
“Everyone in town was a suspect” maybe because you let everyone in town hold the axe after the murder???
its not just illinois that hates iowa. nebraska hates them too. hell even iowa hates iowa
Ay it's you guys again ! Where the hell ya been??
I really feel like it was the brother who was called by the neighbor. The killer took the key and left after committing the crime, and then the brother comes and is able to get in the house after the door was locked. Yes he could have had a key but also the killer felt comfortable enough to make a meal and smoke.
Everyone walking                                                                                                                                             The cameraman- Remove your hand from my shoulder Shane or Ryan.                                                                                               'Relises that they are walking in front of him.'
For #postmortem I heard on a podcast that the raw bacon could be  for the murderer to "pleasure himself" with... umm... thoughts?
#postmortem The Iowa axe murders happened in 1912 and the New Orleans axe murders happened in 1918 and 1919, is it possible it could be the same suspect. He could have traveled across the country and commit both crimes.
Hate to break it to you, but sounds like footsteps at 30:15....so if you were in there alone....kinda weird.
I have to admit as a skeptic of the supernatural- this video was the most creepy and convincing I’ve yet to see
31:54 the doll over his shoulder made my heart stop.  Also #postmortem it sounds like the killer was talking throughout. But it seems like he's not "giddy" about it at all. I sounds like he's begging to be stopped. Do you think he haunts there because it was the worst thing that ever happened to him too? Like he didn't want to do it but couldn't stop himself?
It sounded like in the children's room that you were overhearing a conversation between the killer and one of the victims.
"You do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe" that's the sweetest thing I've ever heard Shane say awe
I love how throughout this series Ryan’s whole physique and style has changed and Shane…well he got a stache and his pants are higher.
Come on ryan, revisit the sally house
Ghosts are real.....I've had encounters for many decades. Some have told me where their murdered bodies were. Law enforcement verified.
Okay, but when he jumped and wondered how the murderer could have snuck around... houses settle and creak as they age. It's unlikely it creaked back then.
Yeeesssss
#postmortem Shane: Why do you hate the Spirit Box so much? Also do you think that it  was enough evidence to to believe the killer is still in the house?
"Shane, was that you?" "No, I'm in the closet... just chilling." 🤣
I bet the town Marshall did it haha
#postmortem The axe murders at Villisa are really similar to the New Orleans Axeman murders. And they're only a few years apart. Do you think they could be connected? Maybe one inspired the other?
My thoughts on one person getting hit by the sharp side. Killer: man why isn't this axe cutting (*realizes they've been holding it wrong the whole time*)
Not a question, but if you want to discuss on Post Mortem, the mirrors being covered may be linked to southern superstition. I live in KY and I’ve always been taught that mirrors should be covered and windows should be opened when a person dies so that their spirit can move on from the place without being trapped there.
" no im in the closet, JUST CHILLIN" lmfaoooooo
So happy to see you guy's back THANK'S.....
based on all of the evidence ryan showed us and the spirit box and other stuff, i have a theory. the murderer was an insane person who had a taste for killing people but felt bad about it and killed themself shortly after. i think that maybe people should take a look at any people who committed suicide or died under mysterious circumstances or disappeared shortly after the murders. i’m open to discussions with other people it’s just a thought i had.
for #postmortem : the "what is it?" sounds like a woman to me... maybe the mothers last words before they got attacked? maybe they heard sounds from downstairs plus in hungary there is a costum that if someone dies and they had a mirror in their room, it gets covered. I think thats true for a lot of slavic cultures
31:56 deadass thought the ghost said “eat me”
"if you're the killer-" *ad plays* "HAPPY HAPPY DOG"
Enough with the spirit box. It adds nothing. Just give it to Shane. You can tell the fans that he took it from you. Give it to Shane and he will do with it what you should’ve done four years ago.
(yeef)
At about 19:34 when he asks “what are your parents names?” I swear he says “Fredrick”
Why would the killer haunt that place? He probably died somewhere else right…?
For Post Mortem: Do you think the murder could have been a family member or a ghost
I love this show, but this episode was the only one that truly unnerved me. I really think that murderer is in there, and he was the one trying to communicate the whole time 😭 nightmare fuel
this one made me so sad :(
I grew up 30 minutes from this house and I refuse to even drive by it.
P.M. Have you considered maybe the town sheriff killed these 8 people and that's why he allowed half the town to ruin the evidence?
A PLACE I HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN! AND HAD AN EXPERIENCE IN! Also Shane, as an Iowan and an Illinoisin, go faq yourself.
It's the frustration in Shane when Ryan said unicorns aren't real for me.
Wasn't there a flash game named "Exorcist" or something that was based om thid house?
They should just start getting supper soakers full of holy water and go Rambo in there
I'm from Iowa, and I can confirm the iowa vs. illinois beef
Those lights tho 😬
For the #postmortem my immediate thought when I heard the townsfolk got to play around in the crime scene was that either this was A) started by the killer themself to contaminate everything or B) allowed by the Marshall because either he ore one of his officers was the killer...
“You do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe.” I loved that lol Shane is a smart man.
For Post Mortem. Is it possible that the family was drugged prior to the murders? That whoever killed them maybe “spiked” their dinner or something, and that’s why they didn’t wake up? Also, is it possible the Town Marshall is the killer and that’s why he let people try the axe, to cover up anything that would point back to him?
Hmm no comments about haunted Iowa and Field of Dreams…..
Ok but the way that bed moved was just unnatural considering Ryan was sitting still, Shane was in the closet standing still and nobody else was visibly there
23:03 uhhh in video text said “helpless” but subtitles said “that was fun”...
Really suprised no one is talking about the clear as day "What is it" EVP legit got a chill down my entire body
I live in Iowa and the other day i was thinking to myself, "when are those guys going to come here and check out the haunted stuff here?"
I feel like this is the most activity they’ve heard in any of their hunts
This house have the same eyes of windows that the Amityville horror.
Ryan just picks up that doll and places her on the floor LMAO
Did anyone else melt a little when Shane said he checks his house every night to make sure Sara feels safe? So sweet!
See, I can only sit here and watch these when Shane and Ryan do these. Nobody else does it like them lol #GhoulBoys
Any chance that you guys would try to do a full on exorcism of a house to get some activity this season? I mean, if they are real, I’m sure trying to kick them out would get a reaction. #postmortem #notashaniac #undecided
For the #postmortem: a victorian tradition of grief was to cover all the mirrors in the house with a black cloth because they believed spirits from the after-life would tempt them through. Do you think the killer was trying to perform a make-shift version of this tradition? Especially if he or she had mental issues.
Illinois ain't the best either Shane, big talk from someone who moved out of their state
Yeah, of course it's hard to follow instructions when you been bonk by an axe.
Waiting for the day, when they will cover The Burari death case👀
The ghost box is a crock of 💩 lolol
Where is Ricky Goldsworth?
👇 https://youtu.be/UTapeU7tmpY
If the crew doesn't stage a fake haunting before it's over I'm going to be upset
https://youtu.be/DFC9ZB1ot6I 🥂
For the #postmortem, have we considered that ghosts just don't want to communicate with Shane specifically? #boogara
Drives me CRAZY that they kept addressing the murderer. If ghosts are real wouldn't only the people murdered be there? Why on earth would the murderer be there? It wouldn't make any sense.
wait have these guys started doing these again????
As a native Iowan, yeah the place is a bit haunted imo.
as somebody who is from iowa i do not appreciate the aggression sir
for postmortem: why did you do a true crime episode for the supernatural season? it’s such a waste of an episode..
https://youtu.be/kN5wsT9-B6w I have seen the ghost of a child 😱😱👀
He wants to keep reliving the murders
It was the marshal
7:15 it sounded like it said "who?" in response to shane LOLLL. sick little weirdo? who, me? :)
I’m thinking that when the box said switch, it meant the Nintendo variety.
14:46 I can almost never agree with the subtitles lol To me, it sounded like "What is this?"
Where is the Ax today?
Who hangs clothes @ 5am?
why do I always watch these right before bed smh
aaaaa
Me, from Iowa: 👁👄👁
#Postmortem at 22:57 Ryan asked if the killer enjoyed it, or something along those lines, and over the spirit box you can make out “I’m miserable.” So the last time a medium asked the murder about their experience, the medium said that they were “giddy” but now, what if enough time has passed where the spirit finally realized that this is their hell loop? “I’m miserable?” Could be that they realized this is it, for eternity they will never get to experience the nice part of the afterlife because of their horrific crimes whilst on the earth? Huge fan, so happy to see a place I’ve actually been too! Happy Final season  Ghoul Boyz!
You're in a house where an intruder violently murdered multiple people, you hear an intruder come in and your thought is "I'll pull a prank?"
What if the whole town is the killer, Hot Fuzz style?
The "switch" reminds me of the "swap me" which we heard at the lighthouse. I wonder if the souls use each other to communicate in some sense. Big creeps big scary no funny
Its gonna end soon. All throughout the episode, I smile and laugh,  yet so sadly.  With the end of every episode,  I realise that they're gonna leave us soon
I should be terrified, but here I am, laughing like a fool because of Shane’s antics.
If Ryan went into this house w:o Shane, I am sure he would have gotten activity. The PARANORMAL FILES Went into this house alone almost a year ago & got legitimate activity. Honestly, Shane’s negativity carries so much into locations that it has an effect. I can hear him right now if he were to read this! And one last comment, shave that mustache off. You look like a 1970’s reject.
Not gonna lie, I love the spirit box!
FINALLY Ryan at least halfway explains what the spirit box is supposed to do before turning it on XD can you imagine being a ghost who died before technology was widespread and two chuckleheads come in and blare the sounds of the damned at you, no explanation?? I'd vacate the premesis so fast
Ghoul boysssss! How ya doing
Some questions for Ryan: do you believe everyone will be a ghost after death or only some, and how do you think the distinction is made? Also, what do you believe the differences are between ghosts and demons?
Shane and Ryan few months ago: This will be our last supernatural series  Shane and Ryan:
#postmortem Have shane bring back the HOTDAGA for 1 last dance!
They should add a carbon monoxide detector to their ghost hunting kit.
For postmortem : fun theory, maybe that family is a spy, as they were said to be the “perfect  family” and maybe fbi or cia some other agency wanted to kill him off
I have been waiting for this episode for so long! I live in the town nearby of Clarinda which is about 10 minutes away and I’ve been to the ax murder house many times and I’m sorry Ryan although I love you it’s not haunted and most of us who live nearby know that. Great episode though, love you guys!   PS Shane I don’t know why you hate us Iowa people we don’t hate you Illinois people.
19.55 when you guys asked if they saw who killed them I swear I heard "I hope not"
just wondering, why would the murderers ghost be there?
oh $#@%$# !! it DID!!!
19:50 was definitely someone saying Fredrick
i’m pretty sure that, when they were in the kid’s room, and they couldn’t tell what the spirit was saying, i’m pretty sure that it said “wrong one”. i re-listened a bunch of times and considered the other responses during the other parts, it just makes the most sense. the spirit is definitely the killer.
You should investigate the haunting of Mario Lara
Would the murderer's ghost be there, though?
I used to believe in ghosts from stories until Shane enlightened me with logic😅 I am an official Shaniac now or maybe just because I am getting older🤪
yay! a win for Ryry Boogara!
I'm a lil bit confused, didn't they say they wouldn't make another season? Of course I'm really excited about it, but have I been mistaken? Wasn't the watcher made because they didnt want to do this series anymore?
Shame was so mad about the visitor claiming to have the flashlight turning off and on, that during his horse rant my wifi switched on and off.
#postmortem i usually never know what to say for post mortem, but had to mention that when Shane said "you do what you do to do to make your girlfriend feel safe" (22:17), my heart swelled 🥺. we know Shane definitely cares about 2 people, and that's Sara and Ryan.
For #postmortem: I think that maybe the “stop me” and “I’m miserable” really points to the house having had some affect on the murderer’s mindset.  Obviously it was predetermined since we think he hid in the attic, but perhaps he only meant to kill the head (haha) of the household. I’m really interested as to whether or not the land had any violent history before the house was built. Also, Ryan and Shane, how did your moods change after leaving the vicinity? Did you feel oppressed? #shaneisademon #shaniac #doesshanebelieve??
31:58 pp
I bet the marshal did it
I was listening to this (rather than actively watching) and at the “hard to stop” part, I gotta say, I heard, “Pure amusement.”
i was literally listening to a podcast about the villisca ax murders when i thought oh buzzfeed unsolved should be up by now...
Wheeze? More like... Yeef??
for #postmortem: I am quite curious, for the paranormal cases you guys have investigated, which case were the most believable with how much evidence it garnered and the case that had the least evidence.
Me being hungry, misheard “stop me” to “crab meat” 🤦🏻‍♀️
chicken alfredo
#postmortem Why do Henry Lee Moore was not convicted? He killed of his mom and grandma few months after Villisca. Sadly, I kinda think this family could be his target for practising killing people before targeting the one his truly wants to kill,
the end of an era :(
This is one of the few places these guys have visited, that I’ve actually been too and live nearish to it.
Wasn't there a theory about a priest probably following the family and murdering them? Like he was being weird towards the girls or something like that?
these are legit Phasmophobia: The Movie
On behalf of all Iowans, I can confirm that we are all haunted.
I feel like the killer was both excited and guilty about what they had done.
THEY -  Turn of the light  Gost- Am i your servant ?
am I the only one who thinks 14:45 sounds more like 'let us in'
We’re looking for Morse code 😂😂😂
Did amazon buyout buzzfeed or something? Whats wit all the ads yoo
It's bad fengshui to have a mirror facing where you are sleeping, maybe the murderer is a fengshui believer
Who else is sad that this is actually the last season? I was hoping that Ryan & Shane at some point would go outside USA to explore more places......for example going to some locations in Europe what is considered the most haunted areas with the most chilling history. Well.....Ryan & Shane...I really hope that in the future you will still do more of these and explore more! I'm sure a lot would agree of wanting that to happen!
I can't add to the post mortem so I'll leave it here. Covering up Mirrors and windows is stopping spirits from exiting to the portals. It is possible the murderer didn't want his victims to leave so he can torture them in the afterlife. #Postmortem #boogara
For post Mortem, do you think that the killer was ashamed of his actions, which is why he cover all the mirrors and windows. Based on the spirt box, it seems like he was not proud of what he had done like other mass killers are. Maybe he is stuck living at the house in the afterlife because of his actions
I was a fan of shane until he said he has beef with Iowa wtf shane
Okay so the spirit box is total bs in my opinion but I genuinely have no idea how anyone could hear “helpless” around 23:04. It clearly said “that was fun.”
“Hey fucko”
.
my fav series is baaack!!! lezgo ghoul boys🖤🖤🖤🖤
Shane screaming was deffo Anabelle taking over
Maybe it's the Marshall hahahhahahah
When you're a ghost and people only ask you to play with lights and say names.
Shane's mind just explodes at 9:29
Usually I’m able to watch supernatural episodes at night but this one freaked me out the most even tho I’m a #shaniac
Their banter gives me life and I'm gonna miss these ghoul brothers😭
Ryan: “He stepped in only to find the unthinkable”  Me: “BUT ARE THE HORSES OKAY!?”
I don't believe in ghosts. There is a spirit world
Is this the case that was the inspiration for The Smiths Suffer Little Children?
Thought the spirit said poggers 😭
im sooo glad we have Friday Gouls day going on for a while!  i hope you guys do something similar on Watcher 😉  "World Mysteries" with Ryan & Shane 🤤😏
been waiting for yall to do this one
Yo is it just me or the way Ryan laughed I think he's the ghost were looking for.
“I didn’t mean to laugh at that” me in any uncomfortable situation
The majority of this video is just Shane and Ryan telling ghosts to turn the flashlights on and off lol
the bacon was there because it was believed that the killer uhhh got off to lena 🤮
And Finally, My Favourite Ghost Hunters Are Back😎😎💕💕💕💕
Post mortem: So do u think the voice on the spirit box in the children’s room was the children or the killer? i felt like the killer was telling u “stop me” and “help me” bc maybe he somehow couldn’t control himself while killing them? You kept asking who the kids parents were but i think the murderer was talking in the spirit box not the kids.
When Ryan said what are you parents names, I heard ‘Frederick’
The flashlight thing makes no sense because the people that died lived in 1912 and I'm pretty sure they didn't have flashlights back then
Shane's the one guy who's not gonna compromise on a bet even with ghosts
i like that this one was a little bit like an unsolved episode
At this rate I bet they’ll end up in Amityville. I’d also love to them at Stull Cemetery
Are we sure it isn't the axeman of new Orleans
Post mortem: There used to be a custom to cover mirrors after there was a death. With everyone coming in and out before the investigation began, how sure is it that a friend or neighbor didn't cover the mirrors?
yesss it’s backkk
The sheets over the mirrors is how people show they are mourning and so that souls (energy) don’t get trapped in the mirrors.
Please lord let this not be the last season of Buzzfeed Unsolved Supernatural 😭🙇🏻‍♀️
the “what is it” voice gave me chills wtf
I feel like I could take Ryan to my grandmas house (where nothing bad has ever happened) and he would say.” I get a bad feeling about this place.”
is it just me? or do we all wanna see shane and ryan take on the amityville horrors??
for some reason, i think the fathers brother did it. idk why, but thats my theroy
that moment when ryan feels the bed move, u can kinda see the bedding dip down a bit like someone sits down right where ryan shows shane where he felt it 😭
some of the soudns are just sounds LOL, its still fun to watch the video, the sound was like AWAA and they went, YUP IT SAYS "help me"
I got the strangest sense of dejavú throughout this entire episode I cant explain it
I've heard from family members that when someone dies in a house, you must cover the mirrors with a cloth so the spirit/soul doesn't get trapped in the mirror/house.
I'm sorry but how has no one commented on "yeef". YEEF?!
These two dudes are too much, can't watch this bloody shite.   Cancel this channel please, youtube now!!!
These ghoul bois are the bestest in yt investigation thingy.
Why is, “Are ghosts real,” still a question when last episode ya literally caught them talking in the recording!😱 They real!
21:05 sounds like my ex
For @/postmortem : Idk if this is wayyyyy too late to say but do you think that murderer would get pleasure from returning to the house when they were testing the axe and playing around with the murder scene like a sick spectacle? Wouldn't that be ironic if they were there at the crime scene, and nobody would ever know it was them? They would usually have a personal stake in it, perhaps some people would try to comfort them, but behind it, they're happy to see their handy work cause a stir.

For #postmortem: Well to me it seems like it was someone who knew the family well, maybe even had access to the keys, thus no signs of a forced entry. The attic theory doesn’t make a lot of sense since it meant the house has been broken into at some point and it would’ve alerted the family. Motive could be financial (next to kin) or jealousy.
"i am not my fear. i am stronger than my fear" thank you for being so inspirational ryan
For Post-mortem- Why are ghosts always from the olden days? Why are there no ghosts from 2007 screaming “Leave Britney Alone” through an EVP?
I really miss this, when that series end  😭
"the house might have a dangerous effect on people and their mental state" this could maybe also explain the audio recordings saying "hard to stop" and "im miserable", like the murderer didn't just kill one or two people but the entire family because it was "hard two stop" and he was feeling miserable mental state wise (maybe he heard voices in his head telling him to do it and not to stop and was on "autopilot" which made him not think clearly and realise what he was actually doing) #postmortem
Ryan saying that the killer couldn’t have snuck around because the floorboards are squeaky. My good sir, the house is now probably 120+ years old. It was new back in the day lol
#postmortem how would you explain the man taking his elderly parents to stay overnight in the house 8 people mere murdered in? like why would someone do that-
you are some you really are a bunch of assholes and i mean that you just make them ridiculous of me may you experience the same with an ax then i can laugh with you fake hunters of my feet
the audio recording saying "eight" and there were eight victims gave me the absolute chills.
#postmortem what was the bacon doing there???????
It was a cult and one of the victims was the killer, #baconinbanquet
"i'll kill him." "stop me."  so the children maybe knew who killed them and their family and now want to get revenge in the afterlife?
#postmortem Since none of the victims noticed the killings, there might be more than one killer, such as eight killers who executed the family at the same time. Besides that, just saying, the people in the town might know what will happen that night, that's why they contaminated the evidence before the authority arrived.
Curious that the spirit box in multiple rooms said something along the lines of "stop me", always in a male voice. If that was the killer communicating with them, it could be that he had some sort of condition that saw him unable to control himself.
In all due respect Shane …being that paranormal activity doesn’t happen when ordered (in most cases) so it’s kinda hard for science to recreate it….. every time!!
You should investigate an unsolved case of the 1979 Ghost Train Fire, that happened at Luna Park, in Sydney Australia, which is one of the most gruesome cases of Australian history.
I’ve been wanting you guys to go to this house since season 1! Glad to see it finally happen for the final season. Been a fan from the start, and am excited to see everything you do next <3
I think the town marshal is the killer
Johnny Houser really tried to jump scare a ghost
Hope they do a sleepover episode for Halloween !!
the murderer putting sheets over the mirrors in every room where he killed the victims kinda got me thinking so i looked up why some people cover up their mirrors and i stumbled upon a tradition where the family of the deceased cover all mirrors in the home so maybe the murderer was a friend of the family or someone that was close to the family? i've also read that some people think that the mirror traps the soul of the deceased so maybe the murderer did it so he wouldn't be haunted by the souls of the victims whenever he looked into a mirror and be reminded of what he did
I'm gonna miss unsolved 🥺🥺🥺
I heard “My Brother” , on 19:56! Like this so that they can see
I miss the Ghoul boys so much
Why visit the house at night ?
Not Shane coming out of the closet
ryan do you honestly think there’s something going on in every place you’ve been?
Nice shirt
#postmortem shane's hatred for iowa is insane, what's up with that shane?
the fact that the town marshall let the townspeople handle the ax like this ax wasn't just used to kill 8 people in a row seems kinda sus if you ask me-
THEYRE BACK??? WHOOOOOOOO
I'm immediately sus on the town marshall, like surely if it's such a serious crime scene you should know not to let people PLAY AROUND WITH THE MURDER WEAPON BEFORE YOU'VE EVEN INVESTIGATED. I get that DNA evidence and fingerprinting weren't a thing back then, but come on, seriously?!?
I love how Shane goes in guns blazing and doesn’t give a f about the ghosts feelings
Is this the last season??:(
I understand the reason for counting down from 10 to get a response but it makes me wonder if ghosts or spirits experience time the same way we do, you know?  Also, idk what the rules are but unless it's a residual haunting, I could imagine not feeling excited to sit down and recount the worst time of my life every day to strangers for over 100 yrs (and possibly for all eternity) just because they walked up into my old house uninvited. I'm surprised many ghost hunters get any EVPs at all but it's interesting all the same when they do!
Dude get that motion camera that films any entities it’s cool
#postmortem do you think there's a certain reason why mostly families get haunted or have stuff like this happen to them?
EVP Recorder Ryan needs to be a staple of this season
9:30 makes me laugh so hard
Another W for the boogaras #postmortem
For #postmortem :Could it have been all the people who came in to see the crime scene who put the clothes on the mirror? Some people believe that if you cover mirrors in the home where a wake is taking place it helps the soul on its journey to the afterlife. They could have thought they were doing a nice thing.
Are the remains available to be dug up for toxicology? If they were drugged, it's slightly possible to see if they were drugged? Knowing the types of drugs from that era, it may be easier to narrow it down in testing? Just a thought...
"you do what you can do to make your girlfriend feel safe" wait that's so sweet omg
Howwwwww/why would the killer be haunting the house? I'm all for ghosts, but that makes no sense to me ?!
7:15 Shane: Hey you sick little weirdo! Ghost: “oop-“
At 27:58 it kinda looked like that upstairs light turned on by itself
I would sit down and use the spirit box on every room
ryan “shane was that you?” shane “no i’m in the closet”  LMFOAOAO
this could be ryan or shane whispering but does anyone else hear a voice at 3:12 saying something like "hi" or "hey"?
#postmortem is it possible that there was more than one killer? would explain a lot. Love you guys keep it up!!
#postmortem ok but we all need to know: shane, what's your business with iowa?
#postmortem: When Ryan asked what year it is, and the Spirit Box picked up eighteen (but text showed eight), what if that was the year the killer died? Like 1918? Or, if it was eight, the total number killed? PS-our house is divided: I'm #Boogarian and hubs is a #Shaniac. Can you help us by the series finale? Haha love y'all!
can we all take a moment to appreciate ryan's hair because it's BEAUTIFUL
Pin me you won't
For Post Mortem: this was of course discussed in the Al Capone video, but do you really think a spirit haunts anywhere kind of important ? I always believed ghosts are bound to be in the place they died - and I don’t know if the family would appreciate becoming roommates with their serial killer
Is this an actual murder that happened? Because why murder them with an axe specifically what was going on in the murders mind
Why did the killer stay home?
You do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe" - imma gonna side with Shane now <3 we all need a Shane in our lives, ladies/gents/everyone :D
i gotta say this is i think yhe most evidence they ever got
For postmortem: couldn’t the guy just have stabbed himself? Like he was swinging the knife around and trying to be intimidating but he just accidentally stabbed himself. He probably wouldn’t have remembered it because of the amount of blood he lost. Also love the chaotic energy this season
It was the town Marshall! ... Why else did he let them all come in and ruin the evidence... solved
22:09 can we just appreciate the thought of Shane looking through the house and locking all doors and windows before bed, just for his girlfriend to feel safe?  Kinda adorable. <3  Specially when he propably while doing it is thinking there's really no need to do that, but does it anyway ^_^
Pleaseeeee do AmityVille Horror. I can't believe it hasn't been done yet :)
Wonder if the axe man of New Orleans and this guy are friends?
Maybe they couldn't turn off the blue and black flash lights properly because they're colour blind 🤷‍♀️
Oooooœ This is the sound of ghost
I was so confused got a moment.... I thought this was Unsolved True Crime at the beginning...
For the post mortem; one of the family member could have done this horrific thing?
#postmortem I would like to know Ryan's views on why the killer would go back to the place where he committed the murders .. as I didn't I think that was how it worked?!?! (I mean I don't think any of it works as I am a Shaniac, sorry not sorry)
Of course, this happened on my birthday.
For the postmortem: I know this episode is more focused on the haunting of the home, but what do you guys think of the theory that this was the work of a serial killer using the railways to commit heinous ax murders in multiple states? Many of them shared the covering of the victims faces and the mirrors/windows of the homes along with a few other indicators of a specific modus operandi like the split wick of a lantern left in the home, thought to soften and distort the light. #shaniac
For postmortem: it was totally the town marshal, he contaminated the evidence.
It hauntingly reminds me of the hinterkaifeckmurders in germany. Family of six murdered by axe in 1922 and the bodys where covered up. The murderer stayed there for about three days. It is highly rumored that the murderer was a ghost especially because footprints there found on the farm before and after that led to nowhere. Seriously the resemblence is striking. #postmortem
My old house was creepy the only thing ik is it’s haunted and 5 people died in it, my mum has seen a girl and a mother
For postmortem: What if the murderer was a family friend/ relative who stayed over for the night? Could explain how he easily walked into rooms without alarming anyone. ps- Love how this was a true crime-supernatural clubbed episode.
......havent watched in....ages? Ryan....ryan....you look all muscley and swipe right annnd....i think you two have swapped roles....shane definetly was more scared than you....
Well this is awkward
Question for Ryan:  Has there been any place that has been so devoid of any ghoulish activity that has made you question your beliefs?  Question for Shane: Has there been any place that gave a lasting spooky impression that made you question your beliefs?   Just tossing it out there, I think it would be absolutely hilarious if they had a montage episode with the combination of evidence towards the supernatural verses the debunking. Since this is the last season, I just wanted to put out there as one of the many viewers that look forward to the spooky shenanigan filled entertainment. A heart filled THANK YOU to both and your staff for all the time and effort that was put into the series.
so is Idaho and Indiana in this turf war as well or are they just watching?
it happened on my birthday:)
what happens to the mustache XD
the victim's ghost are polly in a vacation or something idk
for post mortem: is it possible that the town marshal let the people handle the ax as a hiding of evidence, whether it was him who did it or someone he knew?
I have been watching you guys for years and I still never get tired of watching you...
For post mortem: it was the Marshall the bacon is a pig aka a cop and that’s why he let everyone hold the axe and walk all around it would also explain why his prints would be on the axe
I’m sure that books on the subject suggest that this crime may have been committed by a serial killer - there were several very similar crimes (same details like mirrors covered, etc.) so the evidence is pretty convincing - so I’m not sure that the murders spirt would be in this house, even if they do exist.   Also, I think there were more disturbing theories about the bacon 😳 but maybe they aren’t safe for YouTube 😂   This all info presented about the case in the most recent Morbid podcast - they go into a lot of detail about the case so it’s worth a listen 🙂
Btw... what was that at back of shane outside the glass 1:24
23:50 IS THAT NEGAN LOL THE MAN IN HIS 50’S LOOKS LIKE NEGAN
This episode is great.Both crime and supernatural ❤️❤️❤️
Again, following suit, this episode like the last one brazed through a lot of the narrative to accomodate the clowning around. Have you seen your previous case files recently, the time when Ryan actually cared about the story. Don't even look back many days and you'll see that the final True Crime season was a lot more sensible, had a detailed track. What the hell are you doing? Poor narrative, poorly executed. Why do all good things come to a pitiful and disappointing end. Sad.
the doll in the attic that’s on the chair, Ryan kept it down before he sat on the chair. And it was back on the chair again when Ryan was in the attic alone. I hope one of the crew members kept it back and it’s not some Robert type event.            ( #postmortem )
"Once again my name is Shane, and I'm looking for the killer. Hey fucko!"
#postmortem what if the reason why the spirit box said I’m miserable is because the ghost of the killer is trapped in the house constantly being tormented by the people he killed as punishment
Sounds like amityville back in 1912.
So m watching this and my phone just sets an alarm to "8" hours by itself. I did not touch my phone.
This had to have been the least haunted place on the show
#postmortem I think we are going to need Ryan to elaborate on his statement about unicorns.
i wish they used the spirit box longer
Why do I keep expecting pink panther to suddenly pop out 🤔🕵️‍♀️😉😂
If you listen with head phones it whispers “Shane” at 6:50 #postmortem
👍👏🤗🇵🇱prosimy napisy po Polsku .
Post-mortem:  Why do I think it has something to do with the Stilinger sisters by someone who has a connection with them. Strange that it happened the one night her friends were there.
"You do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe" noooo Obi's parents are so cute please 🤧🤧
"you do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe" omg Shane 😭💖
For post mortem: What is the one common thing you guys have noticed every time you investigated a horror place? #shaniac
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0TAOh3YTts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0TAOh3YTts
Do the Munich Farm
Ryan: Nope not doing that Shane (Immediately): Ill go in there
Really hope u could do a season in Europe for example.
"You do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe". Shane, you just make me so proud!!
Only buzzfeed videos I’ll watch
Why do haunted houses always have those funny little attic windows... im never going to buy a house with those funny windows....
i don't understand how you can turn hehe to help me
Could it have been the mayor because he let everyone hold the axe to get his prints off of it and turned it into some sort of tourist attraction?
Maybe I shouldn’t watch this while I’m high alone in my car in the mountains at midnight lol  where quite a few suicides Happened within a mile radius 😅
I'm with Shane. I'm from Central Illinois. I lived in the Chicago suburbs when I was in college. Iowa SERIOUSLY sucks. Shane: Schaumburg is a tourist trap!!!!  I said it!! Prove me wrong!!
I’m so glad the boys came to Iowa, as soon as I saw Villisca in the title I wrapped up in my Hawkeyes blanket and thought the boys were an hour or two away and that just warmed my little goul heart 😊
"If you think someone's a murder, either you're insane, or you're their next victim." - Martin Goldstein
#postmortem what if the killer was the dad? He can easily put something on the food, like sleeping pills, thats why no one heard the massacre. Then he also killed himself.
Who does most of the horror movie characters have so many children. They do be on fire 🔥
Bedtime stories covered the story in much better way!
Wish you guys would’ve axed better questions on the spirit box
For post mortum do you think "razor boy" got fired and now he's "sheet boy" and has to cover mirrors?
For the post mortem: why would the killer's ghost still be in the house if there is evidence backing up that he had left after the murder? Love y'all
4 on trending yayyyy
I 100% think all of those responses were the killer talking to you, sounds like he wanted someone to stop him from doing what he did to them.
For #postmortem, I listened to the Morbid podcast episodes on this case and they brought up a theory that it was actually a serial killer who used trains to find houses, there’s reports of extremely similar murders in Colorado Springs, Kansas, and Illinois around the same time. Do you guys think this has credibility or this was a personal vendetta against this family?
0:48 I love that they subtly plugged Watcher.
That Michael rooker line floored me lmaooo
If Shane say something about a place that it "doesnt seem right" thats definitely a haunted place.
Honestly I’m so disappointed that this is gonna be the last season. Because I would’ve really wanted to see a Nuke’s top 5 crossover, with Ryan and Shane contacting those people in the video and go to those places
WHEN THAT AUDIO RECORDER PICKED UP "what is it" I STARTED CRYING
What made everyone decide for this to be the last season when the fans don’t want to see this end?
#postmortem: I think the spring axe murder(1911) ,this villisca axe murder(1912) and the axeman are realted.what if its the axeman's doing and he might be a serial killer who was never caught
Okay. Everything is super funny. But A family was slaughtered. Cool shane.
Sounds like an axistentual crisis
Why are there so many new toys in there? Haha
#postmortem could the father be the killer? A case of familicide? Wasn’t he was the only one killed differently, with the sharp end of the axe. Maybe the others were killed with the blunt side bc he wanted to end his suffering quickly after the murders. The mirrors could have also been covered bc of guilt or shame. Idk
Shane is a fellow Illinoisian! I was wondering why I felt an affinity towards him and his anti-ghoulie self... Anyway, Ryan, if you want to ingratiate yourself to spirits and get them to communicate you, you might want to try not calling them "some-THINGS" and "WHAT-evers" 😂...
Jesus Christ is king and he died on the cross for our sins, repent from ur sins and follow Christ and get closer to him please, he loves us all no matter what 🙏❤️
Town Marshal is the murderer. Wrapped bacon is his "pig in a blanket" joke calling card. He let  townspeople contaminate the crime scene to cover his tracks!
I mean, it had to be the cop, right? The one who let everyone play with the axe. He even told on himself by leaving the bacon behind. #postmortem #mostporkem
I swear that the only reason they don’t find paranormal stuff is because of Shane’s presence 💀
"I'm one of the most feared ghost hunters alive"...Shrieks at a skittering leaf....
wait i thought they left buzzfeed
Yeah I've got one for postmortem, why comic sans? Also, I am a Boogara, so fight me Shane.
Watching this as I’m going to college in Iowa
This episode had more clear communications from that spirit box than usual. Also both Shane and Ryan seemed uneasy in that house. And Shane has never seemed uneasy in any of the other episodes.
32:17 im cackling ryan's cam angle looks like an anime character who's about to go insane
For the #postmortem: When will we get the conclusion of the hot daga 🥺🥺
Shane: I don't believe in ghosts. Also Shane: Come on ghost,turn off the light.Oh oh oh not yet off,just a little more light left..! Yay you did it!
I've been watching your show since I found out about it a year and a half ago and I watched every episode you guys are far the best show that's been on in a long time I'm sorry to see you guys go but here's a thought if you guys put your series on DVDs I'd buy them and I know everybody who wants to show wood just a thought
Yeah still a Shaniac 🤷‍♂️
The way Shane roasts these "entities"
ryan: *serious talking* shane: HEY FUCKO
case of delhi 11... can u crack it?
Yes! The duos back!
🦄🚫 👻☑️
im 300% convinced sm of those spiritbox responses were from the killer
Love the show.
I’m from the midwest & Shane is right, Iowa can go f*ck themselves . it’s just a midwest thing Ryan 😁
I would love for shane to meet Kim Russo  Since he is not open to anything from the beyond/beyond, She is a. Psychic  medium. she is amazing,honest,and a beautiful soul.shucks I wish I could meet her.
A NEW UPLOAD!!
Since Ryan confirmed Shane is a demon in the last postmortem, maybe the ghosts are scared of him 🤔
100x better than ghost adventures
If you want some things straightened out/much much more detail backed by loads of evidence, the podcast Morbid has 2 hour-long parts about this case that were just released! They're amazing!
The bed moving next to Ryan is so scary. I've had that happen before at my grandma's house in Poland. I was alone in a room and I heard the bed squeak next to me and when I looked over the sheets were dented as if someone was sitting there. I didn't break eye contact with the dented sheets as I slowly backed up towards the door. Then I sprinted downstrais to tell my grandma and she pretty much said "lol yeah my house is haunted hehe"
I remember binge watching these series everyday back in 2017 or something, when life was good. So glad I found them again!
One of the best spiritbox activity.. shame that they dont acknowledge the same man voice coming through
You need a shirt that says  quite...unquiet
Hey guys hope all is well ......So as far as the mirrors being covered it is believed that mirrors are portals/gateways for spirits It is practice in some cultures to cover the mirrors for a certain amount of time after someone has passed.
at 23:04 i head "helpless body" when he asked "why are you here?" aaAa
That’s the most amount of audio evidence that actually had me truly invested in this. And from what it was saying, definitely is the killers’ spirit there.
Maybe the ghosts were wondering what the audio recorder was lol since they’re from 1912 “what is it”
I’ve literally been waiting for this forever
You guys should start bringing pets to the sites to see if they sense anything
Certified Iowa Post ✅🌽
I’m from illinois too and I go to school in iowa. It’s literally a giant haunted prairie. Even the living people there seem to think it’s still 1930 🤣
Idk why but I keep getting this feeling that the murderer was invited in maybe a “weary traveler” it’s the only thing that makes the bacon thing make sense like maybe he was a salesman or something idk. Anyway I think it was personal and they were patient.
i love these videos
The creepiest thing in the house is that damn purple boobah in the closet.

*Hey, to you reading* .. you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
I could almost hear the ghosts scream "I'm TRYING!!" when they constantly asked them to switch the lights on and off..
9:30 Shane has some ROBUST vocal chords!
The father did it calling it now
Vgyyuhhh
jfc every time that damn box comes on i want to chop off my ears with that very axe 🪓
"Shane, was that you?"   "No, I'm in the closet..."
#postmortem As a native Iowan I have just one question. Did y’all enjoy the shocking amount of cornfields you probably had to drive by on the way there?
Bittersweet that we're slowly counting down until there are no more ghoul boy Fridays 😭
You know what makes me happy? That these two legends are still doing supernatural videos
Near 26:56 there's a man who is watching the tall man . But it's very dark to see. Near his hair
#postmortem maybe the killer was some sort of traveling tradesman but instead of taking coinz, they were taking lives. that could explain why the murderer was never caught cause they were already in Illinois or some other state nearby for the next killing, because you know... "hard to stop." That reason would also explain why the family wasn't robbed cause there's really no reason for killing them... it's like the guy's addiction maybe?
Shane looks like a cowboy with that mustache, That's so sick and twisted that in upwards 100 people per day came to see the mssacre before the bodies were cleaned up and removed with people being allowed to hold the axe. WTF!!  Who are these twisted sick Iowa freaks? Why the f$%^ did the town Marshall let this happened? I guess this was before preserving a crime scene. So a town of 2,000 people and 1/4 wanted to see 8 people chopped with an axe..That is perhaps as frightening as the murders themselves.
“fcking brain” … “stop me” … “can’t stop” … “i’m miserable” … sounds like someone with a severe mental illness or victim of a possession, depends on what u believe in lol
Don't know why Shane's so down on the spirit box, it clearly was way more compelling in this location than ever before.
I'm a Shaniac but I reckon Ryan is the braver of the two. He even goes by himself despite believing in ghosts whereas for someone like me or Shane it wouldn't be brave because it wouldn't be scary because we don't believe.
My theory: the family had an issue with the Marshall or “police force” in the town. They unalived them and left the bacon cause pigs=police. Then got anyone and everyone to come in which covered up all the evidence 🤷🏻‍♀️ idk but it’s something  Also think they were knocked out before killing them by gas or drugs or something else
The audio recordings in this episode were so terrifying.
Yeef
People with an unhealthy level of skepticism fascinate me. A random voice gets picked up on the spirit box that seems to be the killer, and you're just like "hmm, nothing".
Wait why would the killer be there if the murder is unsolved wouldnt it only be the  victims in there
MAYBE THE BACON IS THAT THE HOGS EAT ANYTHING INCLUDING PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY ARE A SCAVENGER ANIMAL.
Everyone: *silence* Everyone: *nothing* Shane: Hey, Fucko!
17:16 Hey, its a boohbah!
If Shane does not get some type of scared this season I’ll be a skeptic 😂
for PM: You have now covered three axe murder stories. Which has been your favorite and why? Also Iowa absolutely is the most cursed state.
As an Iowan I was so excited to see this!!!
At this point they’re just entertaining the spirits more than anything😂
Love you guys but not the Iowa slander☹ #postmortem
I want y'all to go to graveyard to do some investigation that will be interesting
Post Mortem: were there other murders about the same time that matched the MO?
Ok but that “I’m miserable” and “helpless (unintelligible)” both sounded a lot like two voices saying “help us all”
Yes I’m glad these guys are doing more episodes!,
For postmortem: I’m a boogara by trade, but a shaniac for my ire towards Iowa as a fellow Illinois resident (Skokie is closer to Chicago than Schaumburg is though, ya scrub. I still haven’t the audacity to claim Chicagodom though)
When eight innocent people lost their lives in a single night.  the person responsible for the barbaric crimes remains unknown. That was insane. 🔥
Unsolved supernatural my least fav gotta do the other ones
You know it will be good if they can end the season with and actual photo or video of a ghost and Ryan should be the one who caught it
#postmortem Is it possible the murderer was close enough with the Moores to have been given a key to the house? A lot of murders are a lot simpler than they are made out to be.
I want to watch these guys play Phasmaphobia.
Ryan the serious type guy Shane the comedian type guy
#Postmortem Hey Ghoul Boys! Y'all are the best. :) I was wondering--if Shane got undeniable proof ghosts were real, and/or if Ryan got undeniable proof they weren't, how would you guys react? :0
I believe he left bacon there because he really didn't have beef
Covering mirrors with sheets after there has been a death is found in a lot of traditions/practices.  Some believe that spirits could get trapped in the mirrors and not be able to pass on.  Other believe spirits seeing or not seeing their own reflection would confuse them
The notion that Shane goes against his own nature to check the entire house to make sure his girlfriend feel safe is so cute 🥺
You guys are great.  But, maybe leave the equipment up and running after you leave to see if you capture anything else.   Infrared cameras would be good, thermometers to catch temperature changes and perhaps even a barometer to register pressure change if any.  IMO currently used tech is very inadequate.   Love your channel dudes.
#postmortem: y'all should try just putting the spirit box in a normal, non-haunted house/building to see whether it will still light up with random noises. you know, as a dependent variable. #shaniac
22:18 Aww omg that’s so sweet
Point with Shane is not just that he doesn't believe in ghosts...he has a very strong mind ...it doesn't let him play tricks on him...
u guys were 2 hours away from me wtf homophobic
I'm convinced
Kudos to Mary Peckham! She noticed something unsual with the Moore's family and grew concern. She even tried checking up on them to see if they're home and safe.  She's wise for calling Moore's brother, I also love her intuition wwww.
I wonder if the bacon and mirror covering was an attempt by the suspect to play an anti-semetic angle to throw off or make a statement (a priest named George Kelly according to Wikipedia who confessed in court was tried twice and later sent to an asylum for sexual assault)... The guests (the Stillingers) are believed to have been murdered last with the oldest believed to have been sexually assaulted. Kelly tought the kids at church and the fact that the town seemed to have had a laugh at the crimescene suggests something wasn't too right in this town... This one could've done with a deep dive ghoul boys
Spirit box is such a joke but I still love it
should've asked about the bacon using the spirit box #postmortem
#PostMortem What if Shane has seen a ghost and just isn't ready to admit defeat to Ryan.  (P.s. Love you both, have a great last season!)
they were killed by the slab of bacon
For Ryan: What exactly is the line for real and fake supernatural creatures?#postmortem
This is fake
#postmortem So why would the killer’s spirit be in the house? #shaniac
The reason for the bacon has been pretty much explained by investigators now and unfortunately it is believed that it was used as a masturbation device. Lena Stillinger had had her nightgown pulled up and her underwear removed after her death and the bacon was found next to a chair in the same room. I'll let your imagination figure out the rest...
2:41 NOW I KNOW THAT YOU KNEW THAT WAS GONNA SCARE THE EVER LOVING CRAP OUTTA SOME OF US. Dang
For #Postmortem, while you're editing this last season would you consider NOT putting your interpretation of the noises you hear up on screen? Once we see those as we're hearing the noise, our impression is forever tainted by the association and we can't interpret it for ourselves without bias. If you played the noises a couple of times BEFORE giving your personal interpretation, that would let us have a cleaner experience and be more able to judge for ourselves.
I live in Iowa. It’s haunted
I’m from Iowa!!
What I got from this video f**k Iowa, no idea why but yea f em.
#Postmortem will the very last episode include a scene of Shane finally smashing Ryan's Spirit Box with a baseball bat like in the movie 'Office Space'?
#postmortem This one's for Shane, why did you say that it was scary alone inside?
This was honestly the freakiest episode so far for me there's something Abt this ep and the axe murder case in general that's just so terrifying
It brings quite a bit of joy to know that Shane Madej hates my home state😂😂  Greetings from Des Moines!
Covering up their faces, the mirrors, and closing all the curtains makes me think there was some sort of superstitious belief involved. Maybe he was trying to "trap" the spirits or something?
My name is Shane I'm looking for the killer HEY FUCKO! 😂😂
Yes ghoul boys. They are my favorite
That moment when the bed moves next to Ryan!! Semi-related story, one of my former bosses is also a professional ghost hunter and a pastor. He was almost entirely sure the old building we were working in was haunted, and a spirit was following him home. I myself am a skeptic, but I’ll never forget a video he took of his young son singing the alphabet while sitting on a bed when the bed suddenly visibly compresses, as if something sat down next to him. He showed all of us the next day. He even predicted exactly what sort of personal/physical problems each of us would start having as we continued to work in that building, and he ended up being totally right. So it wasn’t a big shock to me that Ryan felt something sit down beside him; apparently that’s something they do
Alright ghoul boys you gotta stop swearing around the ghost kids
It is and was speculated that the bacon was used as a masturbation aid.
"Hard to stop" was the most terrifying thing I heard in this whole thing... I also couldn't tell if he said "I'm miserable" or "It was fun"...
The killers spirit probably loves Ryan because he is very nervous and scared - the type he loved to kill according to the medium.
Deadass gonna miss this show😭Ryan and Shane really made the show❗️❗️🤟🏽
This is grim, and I hope it's not true... but the "stop me" and "help me" make me wonder if the murders are still happening like in a loop or there was an impression left in the house... I really hope not though I hope the victims have moved on.
as someone from iowa, i can assure you shane, it’s incredibly haunted lmao
from my many years of experience in behavioral analysis (aka watching criminal minds a million times) it seems like the brother the did it. the sheets/blankets over the faces as a sign of remorse. the bludgeoning of the other family members while the father had a death that was much more immediate plus the door locked the door? makes the most sense to me... #boogaraforever
11:40 over 100 people toured the home. I guarantee you the killer was in that 100 people. I wish I could go back in time and have the police figure out who all was in the home. It seems like they have a pretty close number like they know pretty accurately about how many people went into the home. I'd like to see a list.
Shane: Hey, you sick little weirdo. Spirit box: *oop*  7:15
#postmortem After doing all these things in different locations, do you cleanse the place? Or you just leave them as it is with the possibility that there are spirits disturbed?
I'll never look at bacon the same. I mean, I'll still eat it but, you know, murder and such.
Honestly wish these guys had there own channel or show would definitely watch it. Love these videos.
26:00 hoping that circle pinkish hue on the upper part of the screen is just some dust on the lens
Okay does anyone else find it strange that the supposedly the door was locked and then the brother got in in the morning? Not saying it was the brother but I think that's werid.
I've actually been there, its pretty interesting, there has been a lot of paranormal investigators that have been there too, its cool to see them check it out as well and to hear Shane call Iowa haunted seems legit lol
14:49  No no it said “Let us in”
I wonder if this Ax Killer inspired the one in New Orleans.
Shane came out of the closet lol
For #postmortem. I need more details on the bacon. What's with the bacon?!  Also the equipment on your chest holsters make you guys look legit. Also like dorks. Legit dorks.
what if instead of saying "f--king brain" it said "f--k you Shane"
Touch my axe through the fence baby
this place looks honestly scarier to me than the lighthouse one but ryan in this ep was so much more calm than in that one
Spirit box said "Trump 2024"
go easy on the iowans, guys. we have to live here.
For #postmortem: I hate to cut the police any slack, but at this time, fingerprints weren't widely used as evidence by American law enforcement. That's especially true in a small town. U.S. officials were still betting on bodily measurements being the primary way to ID suspects. That's likely why the town marshall didn't didn't see the fingerprints on the ax as necessary evidence.
https://youtube.com/channel/UCKATsITZa0KTtRsmH38UKqQ
wait. r y'all visiting places u discussed in ur other series?
Shane: If the killer is here pick up this knife and stab me *Ghost stabs Shane* Shane: This doesn't prove anything
postmortem q: Ryan and Shane, what do Sarah and Marie think of ghosts? are they skeptical or believers? love you guys 🐸❤️ #postmortem
Question for postmortem:   Why is the volume on that spirit box ASTRONOMICAL?
Theory: the town marshal is the murderer, he let everyone handle the ax to purposely contaminate the evidence... I don't know what motive he'd have, but I'm just throwing it out there.
You can tell the ghoul boys have matured based on their facial hair.
I wish I’d known you were coming I would have driven down from Des Moines.  That house wasn’t haunted until the current owner bought it…  great documentary was made a few years ago.
That weird vhs holder on their table is giving me an odd sensation of nostalgia. I haven't seen one in ages
Will you two ever consider doing an investigation of the Bell Witch cave in Tennessee?
The ghost who wanted to switch the spirit box got scared of Shane and just ran off.
They should try the estas method
#postmortem how did it feel to sit in the beds of the most brutal murders of all time #boogara
how can anyone believe in spirit the spirit box jump so quickly it's going to make word  fun to watch Shane prove it all fake
they really need to invest in some better flashlights
Full blown meltdown 😂 9:00
I live in Iowa, I have gone here, and its such great history to learn.
#POSTMORTEM The towns marshall is VERY suspicious. Why would he let hundreds of people handle a murder weapon knowing it would mess with the evidence?
Hey Ghoul Boys! What is your opinion about the methods of murder kill every people in the house without one help each other to fight the murder/go away the house?
True crime meets supernatural 🤔
#postmortem If the killer was never found, how did everyone know it was a man? Was there evidence of that not discussed in the episode?
i know for a fact morbid will be talking abt the fact that they just covered this and u were there
#PostMortem could you discuss the ensuing murder investigation + potential suspects? I am a huge fan of the show, so sad it's coming to an end. #alwaysashaniac
A hundred plus years of non violent supposed "hauntings" and one guy goes in there by himself and ends up "attacked"? This was someone looking to build up clout in the supernatural community and hoping to stir up publicity and renown for himself. Maybe even write a book. And if things really worked out for him, become the next Ed Warren and become a celebrity ghost hunter. He's a scammer and I hope everyone can see him for the charlatan that he is.
The town marshal behind it yo
13:05 belt loops weren't invented until 1922
29:36 what’s wrong with shane’s eyes
Why would the killer's ghost be in the house?
8 minutes in and I just had to turn it off. Fake much? You guys are sell outs. And the Caucasian fella’s dry humor is so cringe.
Post Mortem: At 23:02 when the spirit box goes off, in the video y'all had edited in the captions for it to say "helpless", youtube's closed captions picked up, "that was fun" and honestly I kept relistening to it and that's all I heard.
I'm so torn, with this being the last season.....over Ryan's bravery. I'm happy he has grown over the years but I loved the true believer terror he had going into each location. I'm going to miss you guys!!
People keep commenting the Unicorn Ghost thing but not the timestamp. I completely missed it. Anyone have the time stamp?
Aw that’s a cute build a bear! I have the the same one that’s blue with the peace signs on it!
“Hey! Fucko” 😂😂😂😂
22:10 “you do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe” why was that so cute 🥺
you should listen to the podcast Morbid if you want more (and accurate) information about this case! the episodes related to this case are 271 and 272!!
Ryan is looking extra thick and I’m all for it
" I didn't mean to laugh at that, I'm just extremely terrified "
The man who committed the axe murders was photographed the day before the murders with the children. He hid in the attic while the family went to church. that night as they slept he committed the murders.
that “what is it?” is clear asf
I LOVE THIS SERIES. RYAN please don't quit anymore
The Axe man, HELL YAHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QugFqahGQRI
My weeks mean nothing until there’s a new episode. Sad it’s the final season
He said "hard to stop" you should check for crimes near or in that state he might've kill more before the axe house
"He sounded like Michael Rooker." lawl.
Ryan how did you feel when you were alone talking to the killer?
Ax? I'm at the very very beginning and I'm hoping there's an explanation as to why they spell Axe that way.....  Please don't disappoint me
There’s a tradition in ireland that when someone dies you cover the mirrors so that their souls don’t get trapped….maybe that’s why the mirrors were covered!?
Why would the family stay there if they were ghosts? If i were a ghost thats the farthest place id be away from
Being a resident of iowa my whole life, I to hate iowa😂
I usually watch these straight through. This time I had to take breaks. I got goosebumps lol
Ngl the town marshal letting a whole bunch of people handle the murder weapon before the authorities showed up is kinda suspicious
I fuxking love these guys they are hilarious together Shane you kill me buddy lol. The ghoul boys are in!!!
Shame this wasn't a true crime episode, the suspect's and how this was all handled was super interesting !
I LIVED NEXT TO THAT HOUSE BACK IN 2012!!!
hate to break it to ya but it is for sure the brother
covering mirrors, covering the victims with sheets and clothing, and closing the drapes all relate to old funeral customs. specifically people used to cover mirrors after a death in a house because it was said that the spirit of the deceased would continue to wander around for three days after, and could become trapped the mirror if they saw their own reflection. closing the curtains was also a common practice after a death in a house/during a wake. for whatever reason it sounds like the killer arranged the house and victims as you would to prepare for their funerals.
Um, how many people were murdered again? “Eight”
For post mortem maybe it was the work of the axeman
This is an old episode isn’t it
i imagine the family is running around the house with the killer chasing them… every single day… and the family asks for help during all the investigators’ visits but to no avail   #postmortem #boogara
Soooo we all agree.....The Marshall did it! Y else make the crime scene a carnival!
the doll at 6:06 used to to haunt my college dorm and i gasped out loud when i saw her :( i made peace with her tho and she left me alone after that. kinda weird that it's the same doll tho
Yes I love these kind of stories
yknow maybe the town marshall killed them, if he let all the people touch the axe to contaminate it so they couldn’t use it to track it back to him, wouldn’t make sense to let people on a crime scene even back then
5:48 8:48 20:13 22:18
This was like a mix of Buzzfeed Unsolved Paranormal and True Crime series. Neat!
For #postmortem : Do you guys think that the killer must have disturbingly visit the crime scene disguised as one of the townsfolk before the national guard arrived? Also, great work lads - loving this season as always.
You guys go to the MOST proven, haunted house in America and get Bupkis. Good job Shane!
its funny when they taunt the ghost
why people still belive in hunted ghosts .no idea."omg this house is so scary.hunted."  if so scare.just use C4 and blow up20 feets into the air .and build new one.easy xD .all ghost stories just talks.words spread to another. UFO and aliens can be true becoz of the universe.planets.for hunted ghosts nah.so scare and keep the house for century.if there is a house like that near my house.i gonna destroy it.coz of annoying.
Do you think ghosts stops doing things you asks because you get scared when they do it so they choose not to do it again?
Ryan is getting more and more bold with these ghosts.
I live about 2 hours away from there and have been there several times. It’s a very terrifying and sad place. It is crazy that you guys were so close to me! Shoutout from Nebraska!
Shane 8 minutes in: I think you're a loser😎
Hearing the intro.... YUGIOH OH OH  😆
gonna regret watching this at 2:30am
No ghosts aren't  real.
Isn't there some kind of tradition of covering mirrors after a death so the souls of the deceased don't linger? Am I misremembering?
As a proud Iowan, who now lives in Washington, Iowa is haunted not only by ghosts and monsters, but also racists
every time ryan turns on the spirit box i feel sorry for shane because i instantly turn down the volume and the poor guy can’t :/
the mannequin in the back scares me LITERALLY every episode
That neighing horse took me tf out
As a non American can someone please explain this supposed beef between illinois and iowa
Just hope they never run into a genie
The little bit I picked up was when the murderer killed that family he trapped his soul in the house that is why he asked them to release him.
Not me a vintage doll collector pausing to check out the dolls in the house. That little xylophone baby, absolutely precious oh my goodness.
Is it just me, or does it sound like "old times sake" at 6:51
The girl with a defensive wound also had evidence of sexual assault and it is speculated that the murderer used the bacon to masturbate with.
Factoid. The day this video  came out, the news in my hometown Cedar Rapids, Iowa noted that a 17 year old axed his parents to death. 2 streets down from where I live.
Shane annoys me.
#postmortem do you guys think that the field Marshall was the killer? Since he let everyone into the crime scene and contaminate all evidence it could be the greatest cover up and could also be a reason why the murder was unsolved
The comment “one” gave me the idea that maybe there was more than one attacker. Maybe eight?
at around 23:05 you captioned what the machine said as "helpless [unintelligible], but I swear it says "that was fun". YouTube captioned it as that as well
It is said that mirrors can be used as portals. You should have removed the cover and then used the spirit box.
Ok. We have mag lights.  NEVER had them go on and off like that. Like EVER!
Axe murder Is this BuzzFeed unsolved true crime
THAT FLUFFING BED MOVED
#postmortem It's so sus that people where able to come into the crime scene and use the murder weapon, almost as if it was done on purpose to destroy evidence
Love you two!! I'm not sure if you have been to Lewis Flats School in Luna County, NM. The owners turned it into a bar and they claim it's haunted by the Apache, if I have that correct. Would love to see you two explore that place.🎃👻
So they think the perpetrator was pleasuring himself w the bacon.
During the Victorian Era mirrors were covered to prevent the soul from getting trapped inside. The killer probably didn't want that to happen and be haunted...
I’ve been dying for you guys to do this haunting but thought you guys wouldn’t cause it’s in Iowa (Iowan here). My husband and I have watched every episode you’ve done but he has refused to watch this one cause this murder creeps him out. There is A LOT of evidence that the guy hid in the attic for hours waiting for them to go to bed which is chilling to think about.
There is a superstition that says you're supposed to open windows ang doors when someone dies to let the soul out. Mirrors are supposedly portals too. I'm not saying this is really the reason for that, but covering the windows and mirros spooks me out. They could really be stuck there. #Postmortem
for the #postmortem: i'm curious to hear what shane thinks about the spirit box comments in this one because in my opinion, these are probably some of the most coherent voices you guys have gotten, and majority of stuff said lines up and makes sense. ps. prison/asylum ep this season?
day 2 of asking for ryan to tell us the story of him seeing a ghost #postmortem
I feel like Shane has proven that ghosts and demons aren’t real because if they were they would have murdered him already xD
Y’all should visit Vlad the impaler’s Castle
Covering mirrors is a funeral tradition, is it not?
The neighbor was going out of her mind by 7am. My nieghbor wouldn’t notice if I’d died for atleast 4-6 months
the conjuring house energy video was freaking uncomfortable. but this one is okay. like the energy here is harmless.
Weird how the murderer knew what putty was when it was invented 30 years later.
I hope Ryan doesnt pull a muscle from reaching
I wish the Buzzfeed Unsolved would branch out to Asia. now that would be scary to watch
Kinda disappointed they didn't mention the "Man from the Train" theory
Idk where I heard it but I think there was an old superstition about spirits getting caught in mirrors or reflective services. So covering the mirrors could have been about that.
Shane I’m from Iowa shush
'which i used to see as courageous but now i just think hes an insane person'  ah yes, character development
it seems you guys were calling to the muderer most of the time but why would the ghost of the murder come back to this house if he had died elsewere
So the Marshall did it after being called a pig.
I have no idea why people who believe in ghosts don’t believe that literally any old ghost could be in literally any place at any time, from any period of origin. How are we to believe that only contextually relevant ghosts interact with time a dozen ghost hunters lmfao
Luv light n respected all the way from bloody Harlan Kentucky... 🎃👻🎃👻🎃👻🎃👻🎃 🌹🍷🌹🍷🌹🍷🌹🍷🌹🍷
im from Iowa and this is hilarious
Iowa is where all the F'd up stuff happens.
LoL...people in Iowa dont like people in Illinois. I had a contract job in Iowa they talk crazy about Illinoisans.
What’s with houses with quarter moon windows making people murder whole families in their sleep???
Are they gonna do the same thing on watcher once they leave buzzfeed or are they gonna stop doing this type of content ?
I will now be greeting people I don’t like with “hey fucko!”  Thank you Shane
I just finished the last Morbid episode about this, no to have this! Amazing!!
It is immediately clear that there is a feeling stilya👏
Its awesome to see them in iowa since i live in iowa its extremely exciting
#postmortum Unrelated to the vid, but I really miss Stan Lee and I want to know if you missed Stan.
I’m with Shane, the spirit box always sucks
So, go during the day
this feels like a wombo combo somewhat true crime while also being defiantly supernatural
For post mortem, could the killer have been a guest that was invited to stay over some reason. This person could have drugged them to make killing them easier.
The voice recorded after Ryan asked for their parents’ names sounded like “Fredrick” to me
Did Shane really feel like the house felt different alone?
I love you guys, but I was hoping for the last season you guys would take it a little more serious. I mean think about it if your a person... Would you wanna talk to someone whom is yelling at you or calling you names. I wouldn't. And that's what ghosts are, or were... is just regular people before they died. I don't know I guess I was just hoping for more silence, listening, and more technics to capture stuff. I really do love y'all tho, and I'm sad this is the last season.  P.S. I believe because I lived in a haunted house, and unexplainable things happened. To not only me, but my parents as well. Anyways I also have a picture of my dad standing behind my mom AFTER he passed away from cancer. It's something that gives me chills just thinking about it. Because one of the last things my dad said was he would never leave my mom. I'm not saying that every place is haunted, bc I'm sure it's not. I'm just saying I've seen and heard things I've never been able to explain.
Lol Shane is the best non-believing paranormal investigator ever, would make any haunted house a funny experience
I missed when this came out again because I think Friday in Australian and not American 😂
I did an overnight here when I was in middle school. There is definitely something creepy about that house. I didn't get any evidence but I remember that the people I went with all went and stood in the closet of the guest room and said they felt like a super oppressive feeling. It was this overwhelming malignant presence and they were pretty sure it was the murderer in some capacity.
8 people were murdered in the house… Shane: THIS HOUSE HAS GOOD VIBES!
You  Guys  both  Make & Are this Channel! If this  is  your  last  season -  Will  you  now  start  your  own  Channel (or 'TV-sow)
OMG THE BLUE PEACE SIGN TEDDY BEAR. I HAVE THE SAME ONE OMG.
After listening to the Morbid podcast and hearing their theory about the bacon, I can only be disgusted every time I hear it mentioned now🤢
Did anyone else hear the scream at 7:34 ?
#postmortem #myhandleistooboringfortheghoulboys Okay you young bucks, do you realize that you just did a crossover episode of your 2 famous series?  I half expected Ryan to say that the mystery AND whether the house is haunted shall remain unsolved.  Good luck lads.  The bacon bit was great.
When you asked “is there anything you want to say to us” I thought the box said no not help me
Please. Please investigate Mrytles Plantation...
I swear there is a distinctive vibe im getting from that covered mirror. Anyone else?
anyone else think that maybe the town marshal was the murderer and he let people contaminate the scene to cover himself? even though i doubt there would actually be enough evidence to point in his direction, a little more disturbance to the area wouldn't help. just a thought!
The bacon did it.
I'm just waiting till one time they solve a murder case with the ghosts help.  Like how cool would that be for a final episode.
I honestly went into this with a open even though I already greatly dislike this entire network but now after watching by this I can honestly say I still dislike this entire network/channel even more now
#postmortem this case is specifically gruesome to me. it seems to me the information in this case points to the killers enjoyment of these murders. using the back of the axe for 7 of the murders is a detail I think points to someone truly psychopathic, possibly without any real motive besides the excitement of carrying out these awful actions. I mean they made up a wholeass meal afterwards, almost like a celebratory dinner or something. Perhaps the one they used the front of the axe for was the one they felt should be spared the most pain? I also think the covering of the mirrors could be more of a religious thing of some sort. I know some people cover all the mirrors in a house where someone has died, because they believe if the ghost sees themself in the mirror they can get trapped, tarnishing the mirrors reflection in spirit. so I bet the attacker was religious in some way.  #boogaraandshaniac  (love y’all) p.s I watched this episode with my Iowan mother. watch your back Shane…
Hey boys. Has anyone considered the possibility that one of the members of the family did the killing? I’d think it’d explain the element of shame or guilt and the axe being off to the side in a bedroom could be a result of the townsfolk being allowed to handle the axe and some lousy crime scene protection. #postmortem
You guys should have went to the whispers estate
Dunno if this is relevant but from the audio bits it kinda sounded like a regretful person or that they didn’t want to do what they did yet it all happened so fast and now it’s too late #postmortem
$Tepp100
Finally! i think i requested this one years ago. I've actually been to the villisca ax murder house, didnt personally experience anything out of the ordinary but its neat to check out
“You do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe” awww Shane 🥺 what a gentleman
MAYBE! It was the town Marshall? That’s why he let everyone walk all around the house and touch the axe!  Just a thought
I love how this episode had remnants of unsolved true crime because they talked about the case as well as the haunting.
I hope one day when the unsolved paranormal finally end with Shane getting thrown by a ghost after all the episode it finally end with shane actually believing ghost are real
For the postmortem: Covering mirrors use to be a common practice in the olden days when there was a dying person, or death in a home. It was believed that doing so would prevent the spirit from becoming trapped in the mirror. That being said, it’s certainly odd for a murderer to show that sort of respect for their victims. Given that the father had the most brutal demise I suspect he was the true target. The rest of the family were collateral damage, metaphorical lambs(or pigs) to the slaughter. Perhaps that’s why they left behind the bacon.
This killer sounds like they was very mentally ill (possibly with personality issues), and part of their mind regrets this act, which is why they are still in this house. Maybe a more violent personality killed the family and the host(don’t know if that term is correct or not) and/or other personalities feel horrible because of it.
Okay but 31:28 I hear a click as Ryan is talking. Volume up listen closely!
Uhh so...this doesnt really have to do with the video but my sister was walking around in one of the empty rooms in my house and it was getting dark. She said she saw her shadow walk in the opposite direction of her when she was walking (there was no mirror). What does this mean?? should we move out?? #postmortem
It really did sound like Michael Rooker 😂
No way. I literally saw the bed move when Shane was in the closet and Ryan was on the kids bed. The wrinkles got smoother I think. Wth.
nobody:  absolutely nobody: shane: hey, fucko
did you return to the scene of the crime to yuck it up or whatever? lmao
This is some of the most compelling evidence of ghosts they got. All the stuff said in the spirit box just made a lot of sense in the conversation and the words were clearer too.
Wait, this is fake right? 😂
alright but the ghost saying "8" specifically really disturbs me, especially since that's the amount of people who died. maybe the person that killed everyone was an old friend of the family and thats why the spirit says it's miserable.
Did anyone notice at 10:46 the flashlight was moving??
What's up Shane and Ryan? Im a big fan and just wanted to know are you guys going to adopt? and when are you guys getting married?? Keep up the good work #ShaneGaras
Hands down my favorite episode since the goat man
But why is this the last season?? 😩 on the real though...how long do y'all wait in real life for a response from the ghosts? Like with the spirit box and flash lights??
I feel like Gordon from supernatural  was here in the house qnd killed the people.
will you be visiting the st. ignatius hospital in washington?
I feel that the final season would not be complete until we hear back from Holly Horsely. Bring back the horse!
Why would the axe murderer's ghost even be there? Wouldn't it make more sense that the house only held the ghosts of those who died there?
#postmorten Maybe the Marshall let the townspeople handle the axe and around in the house because he was the murderer and wanted to contaminate the evidence.
Alternate theory for the killer's identity: Sentient axe
"A medium picked up a presence" I'm sure...
Idk, it might be the neighbour or the brother
For #postmortem: Who inherited from the family after their death? Also, did they have dogs? The fact that the mirror was covered would seem to suggest the killer felt shame at his actions, and covering the faces of the victims also shows shame and remorse; possibly then the killer was someone who felt they had no choice in their actions but hated what they had to do, a serial killer would more likely feel elation and pride. I was thinking maybe a family member who was desperate for money, and the brother was mentioned as having a key so could easily access the property, so who inherited after their deaths?  As for the bacon, whilst cartoony, carrying strong smelling meat might be a good way to enter a property unheard, with pet dogs sniffing and happy rather than barking and whining. Cigarette butts are a red herring what with so many people going to have a look, I bet a few of them would be smoking.
“Bye bye.. hey-“
For Post Mortem: It could be possible the axe murderer believed in mirrors being a spiritual portal, hence maybe why he covered them knowing what he was about to do/had done. Maybe to prevent the family’s spirits from leaving after dying or maybe to prevent his from coming back? Or maybe just to ward off any evil energy that could be associated with his act. #postmortem
That what is it gave me shivers
Places that Shane has deemed Haunted: Spider Island, Mines (Hypothetically), that one house that had the “Not Haunted” on the For Sale sign, Iowa.
#postmortem For Shane: Have you ever been genuinely scared for Ryan or yourself? If so, which episode?
I’m convinced the bacon wrapped in a towel represents “pigs in a blanket”. With that being said I think “pig” represents a police officer/cop or some other type of law enforcement & the blanket is either supposed to be the “protection” provided by the police or the blanket represents a “cloak” because they were undercover or “under covers” (as in under their bedsheet covers). This leads me to believe the parents were working with police or other law enforcement officials & had made an enemy by doing so.
Oh no, the killer dropped his pocket bacon
For #postmortem do you think maybe the Marshall could’ve done it? Maybe he allowed people to hold the axe & inside the house as he knew it would contaminate any evidence
#postmortem  why is it that the people think  the murderers spirit is in the house? That always intrigued me. And why would he be there?
An interesting note- in some folklore (I'm thinking Romanian but probably other places too) when a person dies, anything with a reflection is covered to prevent the deceased's soul from becoming trapped in it. Might be an explanation for the covered mirrors and the closing of the curtains
Never left a #postmortem before, random thought was what if they were gased or poisioned before, what if it was actually the sheriff who had an affair with the wife thats why her husband got axed but maybe she wasnt poisoned so shes the only one that got up, & thats why he let everyone contaminate the evidence. Just a random wild thought.
This Johnny Houser guy is a champ. I could never
Why would the murderer's spirit be in the house?
Wonder if they could have been sleep gased or something that they didnt wake up.
#postmortem What if the killers spirit is trapped forever in the house, playing the killings over and over? Forever forced to replay that night over and over and that’s why he’s miserable and begging to be helped?
Question for postmortem: Shane mentioned this but why would the killer haunt that house? I can't imagine he died there. Also, it's kinda inconsistent that the medium and other visitors felt the killer enjoyed killing, but then there's the spiritbox saying "stop me," and "im miserable." Like make up your mind loser
Ok I gotta say, sometimes the “voices” are less than convincing, but that “what is it” is pretty clear 😶
Does anyone else get really, really bad vibes from this place? Like, worse than some of the demon episodes bad? No? Just me then lol?
Love you guys seriously, but sometimes I wish y'all would cool it with the negative talk (sorry Shane). Say for instance the only ghosts in there is the family, they died in 1912. A very wholesome, quiet, mainly cuss free time. If you honestly want good evidence, talking to them that way is just going to scare them away. Just my opinion of course, I do love you guys and your videos are amazing!
Why do Shane and Ryan's flashlights always turn off without being touched? I have never had a flashlight that would just turn on and off on its own as much as theirs have 😂
what if it was more than one guy. what if multiple people killed at once and left one axe. #boogara
why is he asking the ghost of who murdered them why would he be in the house
At this point the ghosts are already familiar with Shane and Ryan's foosteps.
This show is so good that you cant watch it in the dark , this gives awesome chills
That “What is it?” EVP was the clearest evidence on this show. I usually listen to the audio recordings without seeing the subtitles so I don’t just hear why I read, but that was clearly heard even without subtitles
Another couple things A.Ryan should teach elocution lessons, he's basically that good. B. Shane- you sit like a chick sometimes. Still luv ya though.  And last- remember my covered mirrors comment in the other comments section- Yes, it's true as my grandmother used to do it and it was a BIG  cultural/religious thing in the South to do when a person passed over but the windows MUST have all been opened or the 'spirits' would remain stuck inside the house for eternity. Always cover all the mirrors, stay the hands of any clocks and open the windows to set
narration goin hard this season
I've never been into horror...but it's the last season so *Saddle up once more lads! We've got Ghoul Hunting to do!*
“Hey fucko!” 😂
can someone point out to me where the bed movement is? you can definitely hear something, but i replayed it like 5 times and didn't see anything
The Man from the Train - Americans worst serial killer.
The killer was obviously a zompire a zombie vampire who had thirst for both blood and brains the mirrors prove it
14:03
#postmortem - hopefully I get a question answered in the final season! Do you have anymore thoughts on the female voice that came from the parents room? It’s sounded so clear. A point for the Boogara’s?
Watching this after listening to the Morbid podcast!!!!!
The bacon makes me think that whoever killed them stole some of their food and left behind the bacon
That 'stop me' could be one of the murderers being cocky
the scariest thing was that black and white shot of a horse
Just listened to morbids so so excited for this one
#postmortem: In the last post mortem you said you've seen a ghost before. Can you please elaborate on that?
If you're really Brave go to a plantation
Jesus Christ. Not the attic. I refuse to go in mine & joke that there is a murderer when I hear a noise 🥴
you 2 need to make a movie about ur friendship
please pick me for #postmortem cuz i need this question answered!!! shane what’s ur beef with iowa?? i know nothing of the midwest please let me know i’m actually quite curious. did iowa kill ur entire family of something?
I hate to be thar person but i swear on my life i seen that flashligh move just slightly when it turned on at 10:53
I dunno, I don’t put much stock in the spirit box. It’s unintelligible most of the time. Hearing it over and over would make you prone to create meaning out of it, but your own biases might come through. The St. Augustine light house spirit box was I think the only time I was actually convinced.
in the last #postmortem ryan said that this episode was packed with evidence ryan i’m sorry to inform u of this but there was no evidence. ur acting like a silly goose #shaniac also shane i dig the mustache it’s a look
23:02 Spirit box: _""Helpless" [unintelligible]"_  Subtitles: _"[Machine] That was fun."_   Ok.
Typo at 4:24 in the title. Instead of “their” it’s “ther”
Doesn't a giant bundle of bacon mean the killer either visited a butcher shop or worked at one...? The fact that it was wrapped up gives me the feeling that it was mocking the image of a baby. Could this be a clue to the killer's motive, if there had been a child born out of an affair with him..? It's such an odd thing for the killer to go out of their way to do... #postmortem #boogarababyyy
#postmortem it's common in judaism and irish cathocilism to cover mirrors with cloth or sheets after death to stop the deceased's spirit being trapped in them, i think it was a murder for hire from someone who knew or maybe wanted revenge on josiah which would explain why he was so brutally attacked compared to the others, josiah's brother-in-law threatened to kill him and after being gone from villisca for years he was spotted in town the week the family was murdered, hiring somebody like a transient whilst he cemented his alibi would clear him of suspicion and help him get away with their murders
You guys really don’t seem like you give enough time for communication with this spirit box
this is like a smash up of true crime and supernatural
For #postmortem: This case reminded me of Xavier Dupont de Ligonnes' murder case. He killed his whole family one by one with a gun while they were asleep, this was after sneaking in sleeping pills in their food. Maybe the family was drugged in some way that's why they weren't waking up.
the murderer was a ghost that already haunted the house
9:30 Ryan's face right here is GOLD
For post mortem: will you guys take unsolved to watcher? Or will the show itself be put on a future episode of unsolved true crime?
I really sad this is the last season 🥲🥲
Soooooo are we not gonna talk about the "what is it" picked up by the recording? Easily the most chills I've gotten watching this series by far
Ryan sounds much more braver then he was when he last did this
TRENDING PAGE YAAAASSSS
the real horrifying part of this video was those horse noises
there was a whole boobah in the closet????????
Iowa is haunted confirmed.
Shane's influence is spilling over to Ryan his courage grew some lol
Post Mortem: Was the town marshall investigated? Their allowance of turning the scene into a joke is  far worse than lazy police work. Makes it seem like a cover-up. Like they did it or know who did.
When is Shane going to play Walter Cronkite in a movie? 😀
What do you think of locations like the vilisca house in relation to the stone tape theory? #postmortem
Team Illinois! Boo Iowa lol
I'm a hardcore sceptic, shaniac all the way. But these episodes always makes me think twice about turning of the lights.
hey ryan, are we gonna hear from ricky goldsworth at all before this is all over?? i need my fix, man. (ps: i'm a shaniac)
i requesed they go this and im sure other people did. thanks i really wanted you guys to go there
wait, so the brother was never a suspect? the neighbor called the guy's brother because it was locked which was unusual and the brother had a key. i didn't think too many spare keys were really made at that time because didn't people just not lock their doors at all until maybe the 1970s? the key he had might not have even been a spare. #postmortem
Just listened about this place on the Morbid podcast! 😊
buzzfeed unsolved supernatural has been just one long series of exposure therapy for ryan
For post mortem: I wonder if the sheets over the mirrors could have some sort of religious beliefs behind it. Since they are known to be a portal to the spirit world or after life, could he have covered it to block all of the family members from going?
"Most feared ghost hunter alive" lol. More like "Most Fearful ghost hunter alive".
Why would the murderers spirit be in this house
It sounded like the spirit box said "beep beep" at 31:57 and I think the ghosts just saying beep beep is hilarious
#postmortem ryan last post mortem u said there was a lot of evidence in this episode, and I was wondering what parts of it were compelling, like the spirit box? because it sounded kinda blurry like all the 'help me's and 'stop me's sounded the same (genuine question not trying to sound obnoxious love you guys sm)
For the Postmortem: If you two were camping in the woods, and Bigfoot suddenly wandered into your campsite and said "ghosts aren't real" and then booked it back into the forest, never to be seen again, would you believe Bigfoot?
FINALLY I requested this three years ago lol
This seems more like a true crime unsolved, similar to the Hammersmith Ghost
#postmordem THE MARSHALL DID IT, CONTAMINATED ON PURPOSE TO COVER IT UP. P.S. ghosts are not real. #shaneiac
What if it was the father and he was possessed, that would explain why he kept saying "stop me." It also explains why the father was the only one who had been hit with the sharp end of the axe. It also could be that the father had poisoned the other family members? Idk this is kind of a stretch 😅😅😅
I wonder if I put a fake "Ax murder house" sign in front of my house it would raise the property value
The murder that the Fugitive was based on had neighbors in the room as while the body was still there!
Now sometimes those Whispers that Ryan hears are very debatable, but that "what is it" was pretty darn clear. I'm not one to jump to conclusions, but to quote Shane "I've jumped"
Love this. It's like Supernatural and True Crime combined.
wait... Y'all were in my state!
One of the weirder theories I’ve heard of for the bacon was that the killer masturbated with it while watching the girls sleep before axing them. Wacky.
Anyone else staring intently at the mannequin in the office background waiting for it to move again.
9:28 absolutely sent me lmao
postmortem now that unsolved is nearing its end, is there one moment that has felt the closest to a proof that ghosts exists? And for Shane, a moment that would be the closest to convincing you ghosts were real?
When you just finished listening to the Villisca Axe murder episode(s) done by ash and Alaina from morbid
Go hawks
did anyone else not see the bed move? I just heard the sound
LET’S GO BRANDON
11:15 That sounded like dumbledore
laying down on the floor with the ghosts in a murder house really can be something so personal
I mean, I've operated a good amount of flash lights and I never see them randomly go out unless the battery is loose.
#Postmortem: Was there any type of  toxicology reports along with the investigation to signal that the family may have been drugged? It's hard to kill one person in their sleep without waking a soul but if they were drugged the night before perhaps it would be a little easier to believe.
How is it possible that no one heard a thing, 8 whole Victims in a house where you can hear if someone breathes loud in the next room over (exaggeration) , is it possible that if the killer was in the attic could they have slipped something into what they ate prior to their deaths? Hmm 🤨
For postmortem : Will you guys ever do ghost hunting on Watcher or is it something you aren’t going to do on there?
@15:02 the audio recording could be heard as "Had to stop" this could point to the killer being someone wronged by the family and to get revenge they "had to stop" them from hurting other people. Thoughts?  #forPostMordem #PostMordem
My fav thing about this entire video is Shane was more focused on not liking Iowa than the actual investigation lmao
The way this came out the same week that Morbid Podcast covered it is so awesome
Can't belive these guys are moving on from carrying buzzfeed... now that I think about it... I dknt think I've ever watched or even read anything else from buzzfeed...
Please buy the rights to continue this from buzzfeed on your channel
post mortem question: i have family in Iowa so i’ve toured the house before and on the tour the oven door swung open as we were upstairs. do you think this could’ve been the killer since he decided to cook himself food after committing  the murders
#PostMorterm GHOUL BOYS a question from me. Has anything ever happened to you that you thought it could be supernatural?
#postmortem Hi I'm asking if you feel sonething that you think that you're not alone? (exc. for the crew also) or you see something on the sides of your eyes?
#postmoderm GHOUL BOYS a question from me. Has anything ever happened to you that you thought it could be supernatural?
9:28 “ghosts are real”  *Shane screaming in anguish*
Regarding the covered mirrors, back in the olden days some cultures believed that when you passed away your spirit could get trapped inside the mirrors so families would cover them and stop clocks at the exact moment of death too. But what the families of the departed would ALSO do was open the windows to 'set the spirit' free so if a murderer is covering the mirrors and not opening the windows then maybe he wished for all their spirits to remain trapped inside the house... Idk. Maybe he did open up the -or- A window. Since 2000 people trampled through the evidence, God knows what the hell truly happened after the murders. But the covered Windows are a very old religious/cultural custom that still happen in some homes in the South when someone dies. Just fyi...
My great-great grandparents were a murder-suicide in 1911. The scene was raided by neighbors immediately after the incident.  They toured the house like they were at a museum.  It got so crowded that the police started beating people with clubs to get them out so the coroner could get to the bodies and the morge could take them away. We found articles about it in the St. Louis Post Dispatch and the Globe Democrat.
I know I'm late to this comment section, but I think it is worth  mentioning and pointing out that there seem to be some similarities between the Villisca axe murders and S1E2 Unsolved True Crime 'The Terrifying Axeman of New Orleans'. Maybe this is a stretch, but for both crimes all the victims were asleep in bed, nothing was stolen, and the axe (weapon) belonged to the victim.  New Orleans is directly south only a few states away and the killings occured 6 years after the murders in Iowa. Another weird thing I noticed in the New Orleans case the killer said "I am invisible" in a letter he wrote to the police. When Ryan was investigating he got audio that was recorded "I am miserable" but at the time I watched this episode I thought I heard "I am invisible" (just a weird connection I made). I think it would be worth taking a look at other axe murders that occured between 1913 and 1918 heading south from Iowa to New Orleans.
I just imagine the killer's axe getting stuck in the wall and the killer strugging to get it out like "Damn it!" so he accidently kills one with a bit to much force when he rips it out of the wall
do you think that maybe the town marshall was somehow involved because he let people contaminate the crime scene?
Ok well.. the killer definitely haunts that house
Nah it definitely says “Katherine” at 19:05 when they quote “stop it” 😳
Me in middle school 17:59
when he asked whos your parents i heard fredrick
Shane and Ryan are the gems of BuzzFeed who agrees with me? 😊
Yass BuzzFeed supernatural >>
Y’all need to play Phasmophobia together that would be ✨immaculate✨
I LIVE for the day where Shane gets terrified or even remotely scared when they go to a location. 😅Is there any location or time where Shane has genuinely felt scared or not at ease? #PostMortem
*out of topic.. western people should stop saying 'jesus f*ckng christ'.. its not good and is a sin..in case you people did not know this.am just saying tho.no need to get angry or exaggerrate..take my advice in a good way or bad,doesnt matter..am saying this to devoted christians..#peace#
while ryan is turning that camera all around him in the dark it actually looks very scary at one moment please help. also this looks like one of the actual real evidence in the unsolved series!good job, ghoul boys! much love #postmortem
*Yeef*
Muy interesante estuvo el video
He might have been using the towel and bacon to hold over their mouth to stop them from screaming
So either Ryan got a new spirit box or this was a very vocal ghost (the "8" was actually creepy tho)
18:16 “I’m in the closest…when should I come out of here?” Same, Shane, same.
i can't get over the fact that they were in my state and i didn't know about it until now
Yessss ur back
Lets go
I’VE BEEN WAITING SO LONG FOR THIS
“You do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe” is the cutest thing I’ve heard
I don't understand why the murderer would haunt the house. Do you have any possible theories for that? #Boogara
To both shane and Ryan do you think it's possible that the marshal was the murderer, and that's why he let people handle the axe, and is it possible that the unicorns helped him? OwO #PostMortem .-.. --- ...- . / - .... .. ... / ... . .-. .. . ... / -... - .--
More reasons to never sleep again.
I can believe that Shane has claimed countless skulls in the turf war..
#postmoretm I’m loving the positive energy that Ryan is bringing this season. You go funny ghost man! Hunt those ghouls!!!
did ryan shave his eye brows
what happened to holly horseley?
“Somebody stop me” *Jim Carey’s voice 😂😂😂😂😂
I wonder if they ever really go extra hunted by a identity 🤔
6:05 *Is that doll posed the way Lena was found💀*
#postmortem what has been the scariest place for you guys so far?
🤣🤣🤣"but I'm from Illinois, so they can go f@$k themselves. 🤷🏼‍♀️" 🤣🤣🤣 So far the best line of the video.
So happy with this episode Ryan is more like himself this episode. Brings back the great dynamic between the ghoul boys I’ve missed
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT 14:47 ITS SO CLEAR IT EVEN SOUNDS LIKE A WOMENS VOICE!!!!! USALLY ITS JUST NOICES THAT KIND OF SOUND LIKE SOMETHING. THERES NO WAY THAT WASNT A WOMEN!!! RYAN I HAD A HEART ATTACK LISTENING TO THAT
ryan be like “oh we’re getting a lot of spirit box stuff let me turn it off in 10,9…”
looks like the bad dream house from the Simpsons Treehouse of Horror
Shane probably has obtained "countless Iowa skulls."  Don't mess with this man,Iowa.
It’s funny how when Shane went on his own it felt normal but when Ryan went I actually got nervous
Why does this have to end and don't say cause all good things come to an end.
For post mortem: axeman origins?
In the parents room  the spirit box said “hard to speak” not “hard to stop”
Shane just scaring away the ghosts and ghouls :/
#postmortem: im surprised you didnt talk about the theory that one of the kids did it. i think its probably one of the most solid theories on this case
-->https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzAUj5DNHXSkV2jxoRVVlyohxphQK-S9R --->https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzAUj5DNHXSlhjwzn3utvcw6XKujKjb0C
So far, it would seem they go out of their way to antagonize evil spirits with absolutely no response. Which is what really makes me angry about people like the Warrens. They claim so much activity all over from ghost and their momma, but any average Joe can't illicit a response of any kind to save their lives lol. People love making money off peoples gullibility.
:/ haven't we done this story before?
WHY IS NO ONE THINKING OF THE CARE TAKER??? he had the access and could've murder easily
PIGS IN A BLANKET
Years later they did it
You slaughter pigs to make bacon
For #postmortem. Not a question, but a statement. Idk why, but ever since you walked into the house, I had this very convincing idea that it was the killer who haunted the house. Especially after all the replies you got from the machine. I didn't have a doubt about it.
This is probably my favorite episode of all time
Idk if they just didn’t research well enough or they just couldn’t say on YouTube, but the bacon was definitely used to M@st3rbate with…
They covered mirrors back in those day because they thought it trapped a soul
Lmao good cop and bad cop
Could they have believed back then that your image could be captured on the mirror so he covered the mirrors up while committing the crime?
For #postmortem: The Villisca Ax Murderer is actually most likely an uncaught serial killer. A few years prior to Villisca there was an ax murderer killing families along the train line from california to texas, it went on for years and he was never caught, and one day he just seemingly stopped for no reason. That was until a few years later when the ax murders picked up again in small towns in the midwest. Both murder sprees have similarities like the killer using the victim's own ax and sticking around after the murder and making a meal in the kitchen.
In the most recent episode of post mortem Ryan believed the idea that humans have energy and this could be the reasoning for ghosts and the supernatural. Do yall think that ghosts are more prominent in areas where people are more frightened because the ghosts feed off the negative energy and use it as fuel? Could Shane's energy counter these ghosts and thats why there is so little evidence? #postmortem
This was definitely a scarier one than usual
Hey welcome back ghoul boys! Ryan, why did you decide to change your voice for the voiceovers? It sounds softer and a bit deeper than in previous seasons. Shane, I'm loving the vibes you're giving off this season keep it up! #Postmortem
Yess , the Ghoul boys always make my day !
I know this is the final season and all, but I always wanted them to go over the "evidence" (i.e. evp's, etc) and discuss during the postmortem but they usually never do! 😩🤷🏽‍♂️
I'm gonna be so sad when this series ends!
Question for post mortem: why would you ask the murderer what he did if he left the house?? Why would his spirit reside there??
Ryan always turns off the spirit box too soon and it makes me sad
YES FINALLY
crazy thought, maybe he thought the mirrors could "see" him kill the family.  so he tried to cover his steps?
Great episode as always, but did anyone else think this should have been a True Crime episode as well? I want to hear the theories of who did it and why.
okay but that "what is it?" evp was so clear. i need to hear Shane explain it away!
I’ve never felt such a hurt in my heart until Shane said “they can all go fk themselves” 😭
The side of the house reminds me of the Amityville one
Is there any evidence showing it wasn't a member of the family? The familiarity of the killer around the house (knowing where to get the food/bowls), the house key to lock the door, and the victims not being alert to a trespasser honestly makes me think it was the dad. It was his ax that killed the family, the other members wouldn't be scared of seeing their dad/husband up at night, and the way the killer had to disconnect himself from the victims and his own actions by covering the mirrors/faces. I still don't get the thing about the bacon though. #postmortem
The best part is the guy made love with the bacon ... yummy!  Breakfast!!
Whoever bought that property and put a giant sign that says “Ax Murder House” Is fucked up
Boring!!
Question for Shane. Since this is your last Unsolved season, out of all the houses you've investigated, which one do you think is the most likely to be haunted? Did you ever almost believe that something might've been supernatural? Also, out of all the places, which one can you say with the absolute most certainty possible wasn't haunted? And at the end of the day, what  was your favorite location, haunted or not? #boogara #PostMortem
It was very common in that time period to cover mirrors in a home where someone died so that the spirit of that individual wouldnt become trapped in the home.  This to me points that the killer was a superstitious and or religious person.
Hmm, it might be a bit obvious, but this definitely sounds like it was personal... If this was the only killing like this, then it seems likely that it was targeted. It almost seems like the killer had a personal grudge against specifically the one who was killed with the sharp end of the axe.  He covered up the mirror because he was ashamed of looking at himself. The bacon was most likely a message of sorts, what it meant, who knows.  The killer felt comfortable in the house even after he committed the crime, he made himself a meal after he killed, not something most people would do, it was probably in that moment where the killer got the bacon and took it back upstairs. I suspect it was someone the family trusted, I think the killer knew the layout of the house, and even how the floor made noises, honestly, I think it was a family member who did it, most likely on the side of the parent who wasn't "axed a sharp question", they killed their family members and was ashamed of it, hence covering up the mirror. 6 kids is a lot, and maybe someone in the family felt angered by this, wrapping up bacon in a cloth is a weird message, unless the main message is the cloth, maybe it was trying to mimic a baby after being born and then wrapped up in a cloth. I suspect the killer was an angry father, or a brother who felt betrayed.
Question: Axe murders always intrigue me. Compared to the Axe Man murders of New Orleans, were all the murders and wounds reported to have been used by the same axe or by different ones? How deep of sleep do you have to be in to not hear pounding going on around the house?
#postmortem My last name is Moore, so this episode was really weird hearing the freaking ghoul bois saying my name lol
1 minute in and I’m fairly certain Shane was the ax murder /j
I read somewhere that the unsub used the bacon to jerk off into but idk if that’s true
9:25 shane had a stroke
oh hey, anyone else just listen to this episode of morbid? so cool to see it not just hear it
It's so weird that no one in the house woke up as the killer was getting through everyone. Is it possible that the killer gassed the family so no one could wake up? I'm also guessing the murderer knew the family since they felt comfortable enough eating and smoking in the house.
Whats turning the flashlights on and off tho?
Why didn’t you guys investigate this for your true crime?
How are they just joking around in there😂
Post Mortem:  Why did the killer CHOOSE to return to the house? That just doesn’t make sense. He clearly died somewhere else, or did he? Was he ever at any point in the house since no one knows who he is, it could really be anyone. There is no ruling out it’s the brother himself? Also: when Shane said did you choose to return he clearly effected the flashlight then. Also Also: Shane is masking fear this season? Did Ryan finally plant doubt in his head but he is fighting hard not to let his shaniacs down? There is more honour in admitting defeat.
Sometimes I feel like ghosts are intelligent enough not to do any massive activities while being recorded. Every fearsome experience occurs when the person is alone, vulnerable and without any recording device. The criminal mindset never goes perhaps. To do things in isolation and secrecy
The killer brought home the bacon.
Of course this murder took place on my birthday (Well before I was born ofc) LOL
Says written by Liza Palmer? This isn’t the boys talking freely? It’s scripted?
#postmortem even as a shaniac most of the time, the bed moving is probably one of the most compelling evidences
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos 🎈
Listen here Shane Iowa is better than your little Illinois
The only way to make Shane and Ryan argue is to bring up "Underwater Area 51".
They finally come to my home state and I   don't know until a new episode? How rude, I went down the buzzfeed unsolved rabbit hole again.     (Just joking, and Iowa is better shane so sorry not sorry )
'You do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe' is I think the sweetest thing Shane has said during this entire series
That doll suddenly appearing behind Ryan scared me 31:45
I've never understood the idea that if a murder took place in a certain house, then the murderer's own spirit would be haunting that house with the people they killed. Wouldn't that have to mean they died there, too? It just doesn't track. Or maybe they are so tied to the house because of the crime that when they died later on their spirit ended up there. Not sure.
14:47 that is SO clear holy crap!
The actions of the town Marshall makes me think he's a suspect the way he contaminated the scene.
Maybe it was the town Marshall, and he let people in and touch everything to make the evidence useless.
Shane’s a demon protecting Ryan. Unsolved is solved.
The tall lanky demon really doesn't want us to believe in ghosts 😦
For postmortem: It just occurred to me that you guys film these with the lights off, for no practical reason... is this just to fabricate some spookyness or am I to believe ghosts are only active in the dark?  #gonnamissthisseries
https://youtu.be/GHIMASbscXA
Ryan, you’ve said that you’re one of the most feared ghost hunters alive, does this mean you believe there are also ghosts who go around hunting other ghosts? #postmortem #shaniac
Oh.... no  Last episode is gonna be tough
To Shane’s thought on the flashlight thing, I work nights, I’ve used a LOT of flashlights, the only time I’ve ever had it turn off and on is when the battery is dying. Flashlights are pretty reliable now days. Idk, that’s just my experience 🤷🏽‍♂️
Man gotta love the Ghoul boys. I’m already missing them.
#postmortem have you considered that maybe the ghosts are colorblind
tbh i think this is one of those places that are just Not haunted, just because a family was brutally murdered doesn't mean their "ghosts" will continue to roam the house they were killed in, maybe they found a nicer house to haunt in a nice island or something, after all ghosts don't have to pay taxes
do you ever think the ghost wish people asked them about stuff non related to what happened. like maybe they wanna talk abt their favorite dish to make or their favorite color idk
as a fellow midwesterner(MO), i have to agree with shane that Iowa as a whole is just haunted. but sois much of the midwest. if you're within a couple miles of corn fields, there's probably something there. but it's more of a 'leave it alone, if you don't bother it, it won't bother you" type deal.
Shane's "you do whatever to make your girlfriend feel safe" 🥺😭
#postmortem Why is/would the murderer’s spirit reside in the house?
Lets gooo! This show is back and I’m hyped
Pigs in a blanket. That's what the bacon in a blanket is.
For Postmortem : Why do I always think that the spirit box catches radio frequencies from nearby cars or something and not from any so called 'spirit'. 🤣
Post mortem: if the murders happened in 1912, and you say the house is creaky now there is a large time gap so back then it would probably be easier to sneak in.
this one obviously isn't the most active, but it's a very interesting episode. i think there's definitely something in the house, especially considering the fact that the voice on the spirit box changed throughout the rooms but stayed the same in the same room
Still can't believe this premiered on my 18th birthday
Dude!!! That "What is it?" is so creepy. It's so clear and one of the best audio recordings I've heard from this series.
i’ve been here multiple times, what is creepy is they have built the town around this house. like the house is just there around newer houses. it’s creepy
19:40 I hear clear as day Fredrick
This was like a true crime/supernatural episode rolled into one, and I loved it.
wdym! Bogaras +1 with the flashlight thingy
Why do you turn off the spirit box so quickly? You got soooo many answers this time
the fact that shane got spooked to me means something is in that house still wish shane would have something happen to him to make him believe
#postmortem Ryan I always wondered, but are you saying "end quote" or "unquote" cuz the subtitles say "unquote"?? LOL
“Let’s see if I end up in a pool of my own blooood!!!”
Instead of “release me” it sounded more like it answered “pleased me” when asked why they did the killing
why would the killer still  feel be in the house tho? unless he died in the house why would his spirit or whatever reside in the house?
“i dont believe in ghosts but iowa is haunted” welp fellas he admitted it. we can finally put ourselves to rest
As someone who was born and raised in Iowa, I can say with no doubt in my mind that  All of this honestly sounds like something Iowans would do
Last season let’s make then most!
i dont think shane knows flashlights arent suppposed to turn on and off on their own
:::Shane listlessly picking at the attic floor:::
#postmortem I’m a hardcore Shaniac but that evidence of the voice saying “what is it” is the only one that’s actually freaked me out…like I have no idea what that could be. Shane explain please
Based on how the town Marshall let the crime scene get contaminated, I’ll assume a cop did it.
So these 2 in "haunted places" ??? Nothing will ever happen ghost aren't real. Shoulda stuck with other format.
How does the flashlight thing work if it werent a "ghost"?
Omg Shane 😂 calm down 🤣 9:26
This is the one I was waiting for! Thank you for that! Why you didn't spend the night here?
shane is so BRAVE.
Shane really built different 😂😂😂
Are the mag lights set up in a different way to make it easier for the "ghosts" to manipulate? Because I've never once in my life seen my mag light flashlight turn on and off without someone doing it. That would be compelling evidence the place was haunted to me, but they act like it's not that big a deal.
#postmortem Shane, when you went in alone and the killer ghoul confirmed with the flashlight that he’s in the house too, how did you stay so calm and continue to talk to it so casually? btw love this show, you and Ryan!
You should have brought a fake knife and slept in the house to see if anything abnormal happens #postmortem
I just want an entire tv show of Shane and Ryan doing things that terrify Ryan and Shane blows off like it's no big deal. Skydiving, swimming with sharks, etc.
I don't believe in ghosts and these houses don't usually affect me but this episode and the tragedy that happened in this house really got to me
It has been reported that the slab of bacon was used as a masterbatorial aid.  That his main target was the little girl with the defensive wounds.  She was targeted for sexual assault.
Have they been to amityville house?
As an Iowan I know this story by heart and have seen many specials and things and nothing creeps me out more than the thought of someone sneaking into my house and lying in wait for me without my knowledge. It's such a creepy story!
“Hey Fucko!”
I think this episode would’ve been better if there was more spirit box. It’s definitely the best way to capture them ghastly ghouls.
Ryan really getting buff damn
this is the only episode so far that actually terrified me. Non stop chills the entire time.
Participated in a overnight investigation several years
I live in Iowa, I've been here quite a few times. Neat place.
I don't think i'd ever heard about the 2lbs of bacon...adds even more strangeness to this case.
"You do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe"
I stayed there about 4 years ago ... seen nothing , felt nothing .
The “What is it” sounds like a female’s voice- so maybe it’s Sarah’s?
Lena was the only victim found in a position that implied sexual intention; it’s widely believed by experts that the bacon was used by the killer to pleasure himself near her body. DISGUSTING in so many ways. Why bacon.
They should seriously go to a Mexico cemetery it would be hilarious mexico ghosts are another breed
I’m a shaniac but that voice at the start did sound like one dude
I'm from Iowa and Shane is right. That place is evil
the "stop me" sounded more like "not me" to me. also its crazy that it was repeating itself.
Did any noted that there toys that are not from that era???
Can you imagine being nosy because someone wasn't awake at 7 am
I'm gonna add the town marshal to the list of suspects; even in 1912, a lawman should know you don't turn a crime scene into a tourist attraction.
For the #postmortem, for the record, total shaniac here, but Ryan, how do you think both the killer and the victims coexist in a house together? Do you think they all sit down together and have breakfast? Do you think he’s relegated to the attic? How do you think they interact?
well hello from iowa
As someone who grew up in Nebraksa ... we were born and raised to hate Iowa. 🤣😂🤣
Old timey detectives be like "bloody boot prints from the murderer? a slab of bacon? he sat down and made an entire meal for himself? hmm, Weird. Shame we don't have any clues guess it's a cold case :/"
omg not the morbid x unsolved villisca investigation
I really enjoyed how much you guys used the spirit box in this episode, especially because the house was so active. What makes you decide whether or not to use the spirt box in a room, and how has Shane never held it before(?!?!?!)? #postmortem
#Postmortem why do you think that the spirit of the murderer is stuck in that house?
It makes sense for the ghosts to stay behind, honestly. I’d be pissed if they played with the weapon that killed me
Shane just chilling in the closet
Maybe the killer had a beloved pet piggy who runned away,and the family found it.and because they where a big family they decided to eat the pig.then the killer found out that the family has his little piggy.he then sneaked into the house by night,discovered the bacon and lost his mind...
havent clicked on a vid in a bit and ryan lookin 👀
As someone from Iowa, we do indeed have beef with Illinois residents and Nebraskans.
Is no-one going to mention the 'What is it?' at 14:47, I heard that without looking at the subtitles on screen it caught me off guard.
bailey sarian did a video on this too if anyone is interested! i loved it!
The morbid podcast just released two episodes about the villisca house and they did an excellent job. Really does a great deep dive and now I’m certain they were actually killed by a serial killer.
since iowa is in the corn belt, THERES CORN EVERYWHERE n going out to the country side gets very scary
The bacon was probably use by the killer to pleasure himself while he did whatever he did to Lena. It's horrific to think about, but thats the only explanation that makes some sort of sense.
#postmortem was any sort of toxicology report done on the bodies ? Is it possible they were poisoned or at least knocked out so they wouldn’t wake? It seems improbable he killed all 8 when the house is so sensitive to movement and to kill (bludgeon ) someone while the other is in the same bed, and they don’t wake up?! Doesn’t make sense at all.
I believe in ghost but I also understand that one night doesn’t prove anything you need more then one night to actually see things they just don’t show up when you want or call them..
since you're in Iowa make sure to check out the squirrel cage jail!
#Postmortem Shane, what do you think could have made the voice saying "what is it?" I'm curious as it is really clear and close, keep up the good work guys!
June 10 really?  my bday is gonna mean a whole new thing now 🤣
Another great episode guys ❤️❤️
wait, i thought the last video was the finale?? there's going to be more??
#postmortem Ryan when you felt something on the bed was it like the furniture was giving in cos no one had sat on it for a while or did you feel something move on the bed. Keep up the amazing work guys, great show
I think it was the Marshall. Letting everyone touch the axe to remove evidence of his own fingerprints &/or dna.. Maybe 🤷🏽‍♂️
I’m guessing that the person who said switch was a farmer on a radio
As a #Shaniac this episode had some legit creepy stuff in it. Maybe that was just from hearing the horrific story behind it but still.
Is it just me or did all the responses coming from the spirit box in the kids room sounded like the same person each time?
Theory: the 2 pounds of bacon could be reference to paying your "pound of flesh". There were 2 victims in that room and neither was part of the Moore family.  They may have been unintentional victims and the killer was "paying his pounds of flesh" for the 2 innocent (as he saw it) people he killed
brotp
#postmortem Ryan, why do you turn off the spirit box so quick?
ugh i didn't realize how much i missed this series 😭💞
All you prove each time is that ghost are not real. Pro Shane!
morbid:a true crime podcast just did 2 episodes on this case. i would love to see you both as guests on their show!
Ryans new hair style makes him look kinda weird XD
Sometimes I feel like Shane is just as scared as Ryan but just copes by making jokes and acting indifferent
Mirrors are believed to be portals (to the afterlife i think?) Maybe the murderer wanted them to stay trapped in their house or something. Just saying
Not me making bacon literally as I was watching this 👀
It was common back then to cover all the mirrors and close the drapes after a death. I guess the murderer was following protocol.
Pov: you hit your ankle with the scooter 9:29
i think the bacon is irrelevant, like maybe the girls were supposed to take it home and they wanted to make sure it wasn't forgotten
"Shane was that you? 😳😳😳" "No, I'm in the closet 😊 just chillin" Had me dying
I'm from Iowa and I agree the state is haunted 👻
#postmortem Where would be a place you guys would never go, even if you got invited to do an investigation.
Can we all just appreciate how good the spirit box was in the attic? Like I’m a shaniac, but god damn, that spirit box was spitting some schnasty bars that even made mostly sense with what Ryan was asking.
I have a question..   why so juicy boys?
Loved the Ep. Loved the attic. Loved the house. Loved the lore. #Postmortem #Reeder
Yooo is no one talking about the voice at 14:46 it's so crisp I yelped lmao
THAT MOMENT WHEN RYAN SAYS YOUR NAME LETS GOOOOOOO
Aww man, seems like the Axeman went on a tour, think he told them to Jazz It before he smashed their heads in?
i think the killer covered the mirrors because of old beliefs about ghosts being trapped in mirrors. dying in front of one meant that you would haunt the place, sleeping in front of one made you vulnerable to possession, etc. if we're to get a bit more into the superstition, that could be why the presence of the family isn't felt, while the killers is. all of the mirrors were covered, they couldn't be trapped.
Maybe they didn’t wake up bc they were drugged ?
does someone else hear "i'm stuck here" at 6:50 or am i the only one? also them saying "release me" after makes so much sense.
#POSTMORTEM My only thought about the Marshall letting people handle the ax is because maybe he was trying to see who could swing it; like ive been told that police will advertise that they are holding a funeral for victims in hopes of the killer coming back to relive the murders. It’s something sick that they do. So thinking back; that the murder probably came back there at least one day to relive the murders…. Chilling honestly
Maybe the town Marshall did it
Do you guys believe in fate? My friend’s great-grandma was friends with Katherine and was invited to sleep over that night, but she was sick so she stayed home (and thus survived.) Kinda freaky!!!
“you do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe” im crying that is so cute, as he should tbh
I know you guys did the demonic episode of the season already but man am I hoping you guys go back to the Sally house as the series finale lmao
For #postmortem is there a possibility for a goul boys podcast? Because I personally would love that.
I bet no one told Ross Moore life would be this way
I lived near here growing up and always thought it was so morbid how they profited off of the murder by letting people stay in the house where it happened. Especially the fact it was 6 kids and they left out how he left one of the girls, idk I think people should respect the people who were murdered there. So so sad.
Dang now I wanna see a Buzzfeed Unsolved True Crime Episode about these murders!! 🤔
#postmortem The  creepiest thing about Villisca is the train whistle! The train goes through every night at 2am, he waited for the train whistle to start killing to hide the sound! The train STILL goes by at that time. Did you hear the train? Love you guys
In the documentary, they believed that the slab of bacon was used as a masturbatory aid. They believed that Lena was assaulted by the was she was found.
17:59 *sigh* me too shane me too
shane are you doing good? you lost your mind at 9:30 LMAO
*enters haunted house *    HELLLLRRRORORORO
what if Josiah did it?
For the #postmortem do you have a special spooky filing cabinet where you keep all of your case files?
At 22:58 it sounded more like "invisible" instead of "I'm miserable." Just a thought. Happy to see you came to my home state!
RE: sheets over the mirror, wasn't there a belief that mirrors in a decedent's home was to be covered so their spirit may not be trapped?
Seeing this after I just got done listening to the two new Morbid Podcast episodes about the Villisca Ax Murders. Did you guys plan this? Lol
I love these guys but I just have to ask…where does Shane get all of these nice jackets? Lol
Hey, Iowan here 😂. What did we do Shane? 😂. Also I was a florist for a couple years. The descendants of the Moore family order flowers for their graves every Memorial Day from the shop I worked at. I delivered them to their graves. It was very surreal, thinking about how they died. Many people leave pennies and such on their headstones now.
the amount of spirit box activity in this one was impressive o_O
Why didn't they ask for the killers name???
I would have rather seen this as a true crime episode, tbh. I'm very curious about how it was investigated and how those court cases went. I guess this is one I'll be researching myself! :-) #Shaniac
well let's see a marshall lets people touch the murder weapon and a group of 100s of people show up after the murder   i feel like marshal was the murderer or very least the murderer was in the crowd
They have a movie about this place.      A spot i wouldn't mind checking out. Just too chicken to find out 🤦🏻‍♀️🤣
That “what is it” recording sounds not at all like a random faint brushing sound of something, that is absolutely a voice of some kind. There is no way it can be heard as anything else. It’s a voice clear as day.
I can't believe you guys were in Iowa and I didn't know :(
How did it take Shane soooo long to scream!? Lol
why is shane slowly evolving into jim gordon
hey at like 23:04 the captions say "That was fun." instead of "Helpless" like the red text says?? idk just confused me ;w;
#postmortem I wonder if it was the town butcher that killed all them. The two pounds of bacon kind of sounded to me like a fulfillment of an order that the Moore’s might have placed with the butcher that they were not on good terms with.
"I'm from Illinois." *Me, an Ohioan*
If Shane was a ghost he wouldn't do what you told him to do with the flashlights either. He'd be like screw you I'm my own ghost, not your puppet.
If Shane was a ghost he wouldn't do what you told him to do with the flashlights either. He'd be like screw you I'm my own ghost, not your puppet.
As an Iowan, Shane, you're not wrong.
Question asked through spirit box should not be presumption and suggestive ....
Already I'm suspicious of someone doing laundry at 5am.
I was born on June 9
Lol Shane shut that ghost right up ! 🤣 called him a loser
How was that recorded voice not open and shut? Like it was so clear?
They should add a carbon monoxide detector to their ghost hunting kit.
Very Midwestern of that man to apologize for getting stabbed
I kept waiting for “What unsolved mystery do you want to see next?” to pop up at the end It’s so surreal to not see it
*my fiance every time Ryan asks about the murders*: "Stop calling it "IT"! They're murders! Face your own mortality Ryan!"
For postmortem: you both seem less impressed by the flashlight activity than you used to be. Ryan, are you questioning if it’s good enough evidence? Or have you seen enough that you’d prefer more solid evidence? #boogara
i read about this in class
31:55 the response almost sounded like 'made me.' if that was a ghost and that was what it was trying to say... things may have gotten a bit more interesting
Maybe the spirit of Annabelle IS trapped in Shane and all the other spirits are shook AF
Kinda funny how the New Orleans Axe Man had such a terrible batting average but this guy killed 8 people with an axe no problem. Also, love that we sort of got a bonus True Crime episode this week with this one.
Morbid Podcast also covered this case this week. We need a collab for the final season!!
For #postmortem: Ryan, do you go to the gym?  Or do you get enough of a workout from jumping to conclusions?
I read that the main suspect was Henry Lee Moore. I would love to hear your guys’ thoughts about it. Ps. Lots of love from Poland❤️ #postmortem
ryan’s little monologue at the end was lowkey badass
what they need to do w the light is sit for like 10mins without saying nothing and see what happens
i know how this series ends shane gets unpossessed
how dare you end this series :(
<3
In the conjuring House portmortem Q+A you say theres alot of evidence in this one, idk if i agree tbh or maybe youre referring to a later episode?
I couldve sworn i heard a voice say sarah at 17:54 right before Ryan jumps up
Had Stillinger girls not joined them for a sleepover that night, they might  have not met the same faith.  I do think the murderer was insane. If this was a case of some rivalry, he could have easily gotten away with the murders of the family. But he decided to attack the other 2 stranger girls in the other room.
Just curious if that "putty in his hands" bit was a direct quote from the murderer ghost or paraphrased interpretation from the medium - the use of the word putty in that sense wasn't common until the mid-1920s, so depending on how long the murderer lived after the killings, that might be slightly anachronistic phrasing for their ghostly self to be using - unless ghosts can pick up slang. (I could be wrong, of course, maybe they lived a long life and continued acquiring new vocabulary until they croaked and headed back to the murder house to flounce around in the dark or whatever ghosts do.) Regardless, ghosts aren't real and mediums are predatory charlatans #postmortem #shaniac
Why are they ending the show? Isn't this the last season?
Stop taking the Lord Jesus’ name in vein.
I’m so glad you decided to do this location 👍🏻 It’s a tradition to go there every Halloween
“I don’t believe in ghosts but I do believe that Iowa is haunted” as someone who lives in Iowa, I can confirm this to be true. Iowa is 100% haunted
I was literally just listening to morbid podcasts episodes about this
Am I the only one who feels like Shane has Sue Sylvester energy
Ryan is so much evolved now because of Shane...I still remember when Ryan would freak out by flash lights turning on and off...now he just sits there chilling ....
I wish these guys would play a little Phasmophobia. Just for shits and giggles
Why would the spirit of the murder be there??
Gonna certainly miss these videos
For postmortem: what happed to the elder parents who checked in with the fifty year old who stabbed him self?? Maybe they stabbed him 🤷🏽‍♀️
Morbid covered this case and I get a buzzfeed unsolved video on it??? Same week??? I AM SO HAPPY
Whether or not you believe in ghosts you have to admit Shane is in fact, borderline fearless
idk why they’re still looking for evidence when “spaghetti” and “apple tater” are enough
Shane is crazy..
I'm gonna go ahead and assume that Ryan is gonna lose his  Mind, not because of the ghost. But because vasilla is a tiny tiny town in the middle of nowhere and I'm sure Ryan will be scared of not being a big city. Plus I think the Midwest in general is scary to him. Oh and Shane, being from Illinois, is going to  have a rivalry with Iowa.
The ghoul boys were in my state?? I'm only like a minute in, but Shane is correct about it being haunted here
There used to be a belief that souls could get trapped in uncovered mirrors after someone passed away which could explain the mirrors
When they said the bacon was wrapped, I thought maybe he did practice hits on it with the blunt side before they came home.
A lot of sources say the bacon was used by the killer to..uh how do I say this..pleasure himself.
Okay I’m personally always really skeptical about audio recordings, but the one in the parents room was freakishly clear
Ryan left the doll on the attic on the floor the last time they were in there and when he went in alone it was back on the chair
My question is this, what was the order in which you filmed these scenes? Because you told the ghost to switch the flashlights on and off and before this in the video you heard the ghost say “switch” on the radio talking thing? Any link? #teamshane
Just in time for bedtime 😄
#postmortem covering mirrors was traditionally done to stop spirits becoming trapped in them, so they could stay with their bodies for burial :) maybe the killer covered them to stop the spirits becoming trapped & telling people who did it?
Honestly I think it was the town marshal, why else would he want other people to touch the axe other than to hide his finger prints
*their beds
You should do the benevolent ghost of Jones Creek Texas
It’s definitely feeling like a bones day if I woke up to this
the day a spirit turns on the spirit box to curse shane is the day ghouls existence is confirmed #postmortem
I definitely believe the spirit of the murderer is there and is the main presence in that house. He most definitely regrets his actions. I could feel it when he tried talking to them saying things like "Stop me" over and over again. Also the fact that he replied with "miserable" when Ryan asked him how he felt about his crime.
How is this episode unsolved ?  If this episode was about finding the killer then yes, it's unsolved. But if  about finding  ghosts, then the  episode is solved because no proof of them  yet again.
Ryan don't you think on some level you chose to stay in the attic when you were alone because thats the one room in the house thats not really certain had anyone in it? whereas people deffinately walked around and sadly died everywhere else...
18:14 I just want to congratulate Shane on having the bravery to come out of the closet on this episode.
For what it’s worth if I were a ghost I’d feel very comfortable talking to you both
Excluding the bits in the kids’ bedroom (which didn’t seem very intelligible to me), this episode had the most clear, intelligible responses on the spirit box I’ve ever heard. I was on the other side of my room doing chores and not looking at the screen for some of them, and could still understand exactly what was said without subtitles.
unless the murderer died in the house i don’t see why their spirit should be there
the audio recordings in this one are STRONG
Is the killer related to the New Orleans Axeman?
this sounds like a ritual kinda killing... covering the bodies, and making sure the mirrors are covered as well? closing off portals or preventing spirits from escaping
Do you and the rest of the crew do anything in particular like trying to make sure no one follows you home (spirits) after ghost hunting? #postmortem
Please can you cover the mysterious death of Bruce Lee.
Please i dont want the ghoul boys to end :(((
As an Iowan, there are plenty of haunting sand assholes here. I will say WHY DID I NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS!? THIS IS 113 MILES AWAY
There’s an old superstition that when someone dies in a house you’re supposed to cover all of the mirrors in the home. This is supposed to keep the spirit of the person who passed from being “trapped” in the mirror. Maybe explains why he covered the mirror.
You have to go to the Heritage Square Museum in california PLEASEEEEEE
Ok so I’m thinking that the killer had some serious mental health issues and either they didn’t want to kill them but was “forced” to anyway or just enjoyed it to much. By the way when the killer said it was year 8 does that mean since he died and/or started haunting the house? Could the killer be staying at the house out of guilt? Could something be trapped in the mirrors? I have so many questions and ideas. #postmortem
Just realized this, some man took his ELDERLY PARENTS to a murder house? Forget whether or not it has ghosts, why drag your parents to a house where an entire family was brutally murdered? How did he pitch that to them?  “Oh you wanna take a nice day trip? There’s this old house that seems kinda cool.”
I’m guessing this was a crime of passion; he was probably a psycho already, and had to urge to kill someone, not because of a grudge or that he wanted cash, he wanted to satisfy his bloodlust. He had the instinct in him, and after he committed the crime, maybe felt like he was an animal? Probably chose this family since they were well-known in town to be one of the picture-perfect, happy families, so his crime would gain a lot of attention. Still can’t believe the authorities allowed so many people to go into the house, and the town Marshall let people handle the murder weapon, such a disgrace 🤔😒
Shane kills me😭
Ryan saying that the killer couldn’t have snuck around because the floorboards are squeaky. My good sir, the house is now probably 120+ years old. It was new back in the day lol
As an Iowan (shots fired, Shane) living in Illinois, the fact that Shane is scared of Iowa is hilarious! This house is terrifying and I've been waiting for this episode. According to popular story, these murders took the sinking of the Titanic off of the front page of newspapers. Of the suspects, who do you think the murderer was?
Love that it’s progressed from “ghoul boys” to “ghoul brothers”
IS ANY OTHER IOWAN FREAKING OUT RIGHT NOW...no just me #fuckIllinois
Do you guys ever think you never catch something of absolute proof because the spirits know your using cameras to film everything and therefore won’t reveal themselves love the videos:)
OMG I LOVE THIS SERIES, PLEASE CONTINUE!
13:50 I'm not so sure but here in my country we believe that you need to cover the mirror/or anything that has reflection whenever there is someone who died, but in this case I don't know if the killer cover the mirrors before or after he killed the family... beats me
I will never accept the fact that this is the last season. 😭💔
#postmortem Since the brother opened the door that means he had a key. So is it possible that he committed the crime and that’s why he went unnoticed in the house.
#postmortem Do you think that ghosts just tend to enjoy your company and so just watch you two try to investigate instead of actually trying to make contact?  Love you guys! Keep doing the great work 😇 #buzzfeedunsolved #boogaras #shaniacs
This may be a stretch, but do you think the Town Marshall did it? I can't think of any other reason on why he wasn't so cautious about the investigation unless he wanted to tamper with the evidence on purpose with the town's people so he wouldn't get caught. You guys are hilarious and the reason why I can see scary stuff like this! #postmortem
THEY WERE IN IOWA AND I DIDNT KNOW
So..ok ok ok, murder and stuff. But. Is ax spelled like..that? I thought it was axe? Does it matter? Is ax the right way to spell it?
#postmortem About sheet over the mirror. There is an old slavic tradition (maybe not only slavic idk I am telling it because I am a slavic myself). People cover all mirrors in the house during funerals or right after someone dies in the house. It is believed that the soul can be trapped inside the mirrors.
19:28 kinda sounds like "Probably."
"you do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe" 🥺
Why does Shane sound like Kevin spacey lol
I'm like Ryan I believe in ghosts and spirits but like Shane I'm not scared of them I just feel really bad for the family especially the children who didn't deserve this at all
You should go see father Thomas in this season
Fuckin hate Iowans. I'm from Minnesota so like we're better than them. Not by much though. When it comes to Iowa and Wisconsin, it's literally the only time I'm actually like prideful of my state because at least we're not them. I mean what the hell is in Iowa? Corn fields? Hillbillies? I mean the most exciting thing you got is a goddamn corn maze down on Old Mr. Bill's farm down the road. Can't stand Iowa
YESSSS! Been wanting them to investigate the AX Murder house since the show started. I can’t believe you were in Iowa and I didn’t get chance to meet you guys.
Always thought Louisiana would be charming. Finally got there, and it was just downright creepy. Couldn’t breathe until we crossed the state line away from Louisiana.
im pretty impressed the buzzfeed unsolved turned me into more of a skeptic
For the post-mortem: what would you do if you had the chance to be with the crowd that went inside the house the day after the incident happened?
Why would the killer haunt the place he murdered when we was still alive and why this place whe he eventually dies?
My youtube captions translated "helpless" into "that was fun..." hmm?
What do you think of the possibility that the family was drugged before they were killed which is why none of them woke during the murders (except for Lena)? Also, Shane please tell me at the end of the season you destroy that spirit box like they did with the printer in Office Space. Still love you tho Ryan. #postmordem #shaniac p.s If you have trouble pronouncing my name it's Mo-luh-sar and honestly dw about the last name tho I'd like to see you try.
I feel like much of the murderers behavior actually at the crime scene combined with the multiple “stop me” and “I’m miserable” like sounds we got from the spirit box indicate someone regretful of their actions rather than proud/giddy.
The science to the mag light has to do with the contraction of the lens. There’s a whole video somewhere in this site that explains it.
This series cannot stop :(
I’ve known about this case for years yet I never knew they let people in the house while everyone was still in there
You guys cant end this plssss
For post mortem: Is it possible that the victims had been drugged before they were murdered? If the murderer was hiding within the house it’s possible he could have added something to their food/drinks which would explain why they didn’t wake up while the murder was being committed P.s thank you ghoul boys for all the laughs and goofs over the years
This episode was quite interesting. True crime plus supernatural. Awesome!
OMG IVE BEEN THERE
For postmortem: The bed did not move Ryan.
#postmortem I love it when you guys mix True Crime and Supernatural! I have two boogara theories and one shaniac theory for this one: 1) since the killer was so unnaturally quiet and is supposedly haunting the house despite not dying there, is it possible the killer was actually a ghost or demon? 2) it was relatively new, but there was definitely finger printing in the 1910s, so the fact that the investigators let a 100 people in the house and test swing ax is so incompetent, I wonder if it's a clue that this could have been a Hot Fuzz situation. If every townsperson was a suspect at one point, maybe there was good cause? And this last theory is admittedly nonsense but 3) considering so many people got to play with the murder weapon, what if there's some sort of time rift in the house and the murder is a paradox, where all of the killing blows are test swings from rando townspeople during the investigation?
The blue light! Really that's the bad one, Boooooooo!
The killer appears to have been superstitious by covering the mirrors.
#postmortem: Are you going back to the goatman bridge this season? If not would you go? also am sad this is the last season. :(
I have a theory that these murders may have been an act of antisemitism. Wrapped bacon placed in the home may be a sign of being impure and added to that the mirrors being covered. In Jewish tradition when someone dies as a sign of mourning the family must cover all mirrors in the household for the duration of their mourning period. Was this family of Jewish decent?
I’m from iowaaaa this makes me so happy that y’all investigated here!
The poor camreaman
This episode actually gave me chills good job ghoul bois
I am not usually a big fan of the spirit box but it is interesting that this time the voice sounded the same in every blip. Usually I feel like it changes. Weird.
It was the Town Marshall idc
For post mortem: if you were to put all the demons you’ve investigated so far in a battle royale, who do you think would win?
4:24 'Ther Beds'?
Kinda surprised Ryan actually spoke to mr. murderer
I don't know, but the scariest part to me would be the movement that Ryan felt on the bed while shane is inside the closet. Yikes!
That excited “Lets see if I end up in a puddle of my own blood”
Umm don’t know how I feel about them using that type of language in the girl’s room, if they are there, imagine how scared they are with two grown men coming in to try and rile it up. I’ve never minded, but yet again, they’ve never been inside a room of young children they know were murdered in there
#postmortem idk if this was a thing back then but covered faces, covered mirrors, and closed windows are all definitely things about not letting spirits escape/be free
One of the most memorable things about staying here for me was visiting the Casey's up the street for some pizza and seeing a dog just chillin on the roof of someone's truck while they were inside
after so many seasons of no ghost sightings i have concluded that the ghosts are afraid of shane.
#postmortem Shane, you seemed really nervous this episode. Is it just because of being in Iowa or is there something else?
These mfs don’t know how to treat spirit
the amount of joy these bring me
Ryan be like: “valor morghulis”
I requested this one a while back, I was so excited when I saw this posted!
The bacon wrapped in a dish towel refers to the food “pigs in a blanket” and it makes sense cus the girls were killed while sleeping with the blanket over there head your welcome
I think they were all drugged by something they ate or drank at the church service.
These guys need to show more respect to the departed.... Their behavior is annoying and rather elementary.
#forthepostmortem Do the you think that the murderer could have come back in with the townspeople to tamper with evidence before the national guard arrived at noon? Chilling thoughts! Love you ghoul boys! #shaniac
Covering the mirrors, covering the victims eyes and closing the curtains says to me the killer was very superstitious and spiritual. But that's just me. Ryan.
for #postmortem  would you rather spend a week in this house or in The Conjuring house?
6:10 "sorry I needed to kill your kids too, here's some bacon"
This episode doesn't makes any sense if you listen to the story carefully
I’m from Iowa so I love this!! When visiting the Axe murder house my dad ended up taking some photos that made us very uncomfortable. Definitely think there’s some children playing around there.
you're telling me this ghost is a switch?? 😳
Very curious to know about Shane’s reaction to the bed sheets moving or the “what is it” audio recording. I hope they cover this in #postmortem
more ailen stuff
Why didn't you jump out the closet while you were in there to scare Ryan??  #PostMortem
i actually did a haircut on the owner's nephew back when i was in hair school and i asked him if he had anything happen to him. he just said he pretty much just heard noises and voices and he acted like it was no big deal.
Um, about that bacon...it seems to me like it was probably used...come on...don't make me say it.
This why my dad didn’t want me sleeping over at my friends house?
is this  true crime x supernatural episode? lol
This episode was a good reminder that I have bacon in my fridge I should cook
Im from iowa🤣 and can confirm its haunted
Morbid Podcast just did an episode on this and the thing with the girls and the bacon is way, way darker.
Morbid just did a podcast about this
Iconic quarter moon windows same as Amityville, no one reacted during the murders, just like Amityville... If you want to live....  buy square windows 😱
I'm so excited let's go
The fact no one else woke,while others where being bludgeon. Sounds like the Amityville murders...the murderer used a rifle yet no one was awaken by it. These ax murders could of been family as well,Any one look at the brother?
The “hard to stop” was terrifying to think about.
“(yeef)” is certainly a new one
I knew there was a reason for me being #TeamBoogara despite not believing in ghosts. I could smell the Illinois on Shane. #Iowaproud
Shane looks like someone’s annoying uncle, the obnoxious one who thinks he knows everything 😂
This one was hard to watch, those poor innocent girls. I don't think the killer is haunting the place, I think he's in a special spot reserved in hell or whatever afterlife judgement there is for awful people like him. I hope the family haunted him until the day he died. I lean toward drugging the family theories simply because I will often wake up at night to small sounds and check the house. Also the town is sus.
just listened to the Morbid podcast ( they also just covered this the past week) they pointed out the bacon could have been... ehmm... a way for the k*ller to ghoul themselves after the kills which is disturbing. do you agree with this theory? #postmortem
my brother is in college in iowa and so i’m sending him a bunch of videos to show how weird and creepy it is. this is added to the list
Not a question, but I am just so pissed off at how they handled the (probably many) forensic evidence in this case and completely contaminated the scene🤦🏽‍♀
#postmortem did the killer really choose to stay in the house after he died? Or was he sentenced to his own personal hell? Also, doesn’t it seem like he’s alone in there? Where are the victims?
As an Iowan, I’ve been waiting for this episode!!!!!!
I remember the guy who owned the house years ago and did tours said that they think the bacon was used for it’s grease for gross purposes 😐
I just finished the villisca episode on the morbid podcast, this is a great follow up!
6:53 it says "show us the meat"
So wait they didn’t leave buzzfeed let’s go
Can shane speak "Demon"? Or maybe Ghoul?
FINALLY YOU DID IT
I just want to know,  Shane did you feel at least a bit nervous going in to the house?
9:29 The cry of a distressed demon
#postmortem How do we know it was just one guy doing the killing. I mean 2 people make much more sense on how no one woke up. Also The marshal allowing people to roam around the house contaminating the scene is sus.
Let's gooo Ryan
Shane, Shane, Shane bro.  You need to fire your hair stylist, seriously.  I'm not trying to be mean, just matter of fact.  You already have an upside down triangle shaped head (nothing wrong with that) but whoever does/did your hair doesn't need to "poof" it out making the top of your head appear even wider than the base of the triangle already is.    Also, I'm going to be sad when you're done with this season.  I enjoyed you 2 and your crime and ghost stuff.  You guys take care and be good.
Sheets over the mirrors was believed to prevent souls from being trapped inside them when someone dies. When families who hosted a wake in their homes would cover all the mirrors for that reason.
ok but this is the only supernatural episode that had my stomach in knots and WHY IS THAT. rlly eerie story
These guys somehow manage to make quality every episode.
i swear im going to make a t-shirt that says "Unicorns aren't real. Ghosts are real." and then put shanes screaming face under it
Please tell me they checked under the bed!!
Ryan not considering that maybe a house was less squeaky 100 years ago is very funny to me
When Shane says he's collected skulls in a turf war, I genuinely believe him.
omg
Don't believe in ghosts but Iowa is haunted?
"unsolved murders"... So is this a double episode of "Unsolved"?
The spirit box was like amazing in this one damn, chills.
Rip to everyone murdered that night my heart breaks for the babies 💔🙏
Nobody scared of you two Clown 😆
The spirit box stopping just as Shane started holding it is really helping these fan theories-who knows maybe Shane is a greater demon and gave the spirits in the house specific instructions beforehand of what to do
I actually got scared from this one
I got chills this episode holy hell i love it
#postmortem : Aren’t mirrors said to trap souls? So like he wanted them to be able to move onto the great beyond or whatever? #boogarabutiloveyoutooshane
This isn’t actually the last season right
#postmortem i dont know how you guys arent scared cause im scared just watching this, ryan did someone sit on the bed??
Absolutely no one: Shane to ghosts: Well Howdy 🤠
The town marshal or a police officer did it,or even a bunch of them.
Personally by the "help me" and "stop me" I feel as if the killer had an undiagnosed mental condition and didn't really know what he was doing. It's clear he feels very guilty for a) maybe liking it as in the "giddiness" and b) the fact he did it. To me him putting a cloth over the mirror and the victim's faces just seems like the killer as awful as he is had some problems that no one accounted for.  Btw this doesn't make the crime any less awful, that poor family I can't imagine how horrible it was. And the fact their town didn't care one bit was just even more terrifying.
Here’s the thing with flashlights.....I’ve never had one randomly turn off on me??? Let alone two???? Never had one blink on and off in all the times I’ve gone camping with one???? So I get ‘random’ activity doesn’t show a presence that can act with intent, but I’m still inclined to believe that flashlight activity indicates SOMETHING is in the room??
I absolutely love them, it's really a pity they won't continue making this series :(. But happily we get to enjoy the current content
Man, can you imagine being the brother? Discovering your brother, sister-in-law, and all your little nieces and nephews like that? I think I'd have lost my mind.
Im suprised that that there were sleepovers in 1912
I'm sorry, but Shane's reaction to Ryan saying ghosts are real and unicorns aren't had me crying 😂😂😂😂
This was a really lackluster ep when it comes to evidence, huh? I thought this was gonna be the season of proper evidence all around! Still a gruesome case and horrible story.
Well this show turned into a literal garbage
I love you guys. Please never part ways.(I'm hoping guilt will work.)
Iowa is a horrifying place. So brave of y'all to go.
32:09 I like to imagine that talking through a spirit box takes "skill and talent" for ghosts. So, when our ghoul boys try to communicate, the inexperienced ghosts be like flipping out in the background screaming "wtf do you want me to do? How tf do I use that?"
as an iowan i can confirm this state is haunted, but because of this we will win the midwest terf war that is going on between iowa, illinois, and wisconsin.
I’m so vulnerable right now oh my God
I honestly think the killer somehow drugged the victims and that’s why no one woke up. If he is theorized to have been hiding in the attic, waiting for his chance, maybe he put something in whatever food or drink they might have had before bed.
May I suggest Hell's gate in Lubbock Texas for a future visitation?   I really believe you'll find quite the interesting stories from townsfolk and the history of the location as to how it got its name. :)
What was the reason for killing them though? If it wasn't for money than what was it for? #postmortem
Fact: A few times in my life, I have had ghosts sit next to me on a bed. That feeling is unmistakable. Only if someone experiences that will he or she believe it.
I love you guys!
pls do the queen mary !!! its rumored that it will be shut down soon ):
“Weak and easily manipulated” like someone that believes in mediums?
They think Henry Lee Moore was the killer,he murdered his mother and grandmother after the Moore family murders with an ax,he was no relation to them.
As an Iowan who now lives in Illinois I do not know how to feel about the Iowa Illinois turf war.
Anyone else think Houser the caretaker seems a little suspicious?
The Marshal definitely murdered them.
i am so happy that this show is back
It was the Marshall… he let everyone in to contaminate the scene so that he would never be found out.
That spirit box is annoying as heck. It's too loud, and gives me a headache. I think Ryan needs an occulus.
With that 2014 incident...there are couple of plausible explanations aside from paranormal one. A) He did it to make it seem like a ghost attacked him but accidently hit something vital or stabbed too hard. I mean who the hell carries a hunting knife with them for a tour like this? Knife isn't gonna save you from a ghost. B) It was planned suicide but he survivived and maybe felt embarassed about it, people tend to be esp. men C) The injuries weren't self inflicted. It was mentioned his parents were checked in with him but then he was alone. Maybe one of his parents stabbed him, maybe not even intentionally but like because they had dementia and got scared and he tried to help them like calm them down and got stabbed. He might've insisted later he did it to himself and blamed a ghost to cover up. I mean people tend to do that when their family is involved.
For postmortem: why would the ghost of the murder even be in this house? Just makes no sense
as a person from wisconsin I do confirm there is a turf war and I have several skulls from it....and scars.
#postmortem : the voice says things like 'stop me' and 'hard to stop'. Do ye think this is the killer saying that he didn't want to kill, or that he couldn't stop? PS I love you guys
I really wish there were Funko pop figures of these two
The doll in the background of Ryan's solo scared me the most.
My anxiety rises when Shane taunt the ghost cause I’m so afraid something somehow might happen to him even though nothing will 😂
Too much goofing around here.
#postmortem  About the sheets covering the mirrors: the killer most likely did it because it was a Victorian tradition to cover the mirrors if someone died in the house. So when their souls left the bodies they would exit through the window and won't end up being stuck in the mirrors for all eternity.
Who else only watchs the vedios Shane and Ryan are in?
I struggle to understand how the killer made no sound if he was in the attic
#postmortem What if the killer was apart of the family? Like a teenager who had been orphaned, someone the family brought in to help? The amount of remorse he showed by covering the mirrors suggests he may have cared for them or at least there souls. Because covering mirrors was also a form of mourning/Superstition back then.
Bro!! This is what I live for! Let’s goooo
Shane : says anything  Ryan:”that’s not true” 😂😂
Shane asks Ryan if this place feels different from other locations. Ryan says no but "the concentrated dread here" is unusual. Really? If no haunting us actually there, then why is there concentrated dread there? In other words, why is Ryan afraid to state that a place is really creepy?
You need to use a spirit Lite Brite if you really want to communicate with ghosts.
for final episode they should revisit sally house
So I saw someone comment that there must have been another person, but if so did they use the bacon? If they did use the bacon, how in the world did they kill someone with bacon?
14:30 haha shaniacs ur fucked.
Surprised they haven’t t done an episode on the Clutter family murders in Kansas. These murders inspired the book In Cold Blood by Truman Capote.
they released this at exactly midnight in my time zone and i watched the whole thing. i couldn't sleep bc of the random creaking noises in my house after watching this and i'm pretty sure i invited summ into my home through this video😅 but once again a great episode and i'm sad that this series is gonna end soon.
👌👌👌🌟🌟🌟
Jesus it sounds like the spirit box was relaying the conversations of that night
Not a believer in the slightest but 14:48 is insane how is nobody talking about that
There could be a reason for the covered mirrors/windows. In some cultures when preparing for a death they cover mirrors to prevent the deceased spirits from being trapped. The killer could feel slight remorse and helping the family pass on.
AYO I WENT THERE LITERALLY A DAY B4 YOU GUYS LOL
I work in radio for the Navy and seeing them use the “spirit box” to try and communicate with ghosts kills me 😂 All they’re doing is rapidly frequency hopping and picking up fragmented radio signals to try and make sense of it. Made me weak AF when Shane said it’s a POS technology. It actually works well when used in the right setting haha.
Omg I was just there a couple of months ago
at some point somebody HAS to prank the other right??
Yeah, I don’t think that the family’s spirits are occupying the house to the this day… it’s definitely the murderer..
Let's go Brandon
For #PostMortem  The town marshall looks kinda sus to me cuz he pretty much let everyone handle the axe which led it to get contaminated. So he probably did it intentionally so that the evidence gets contaminated and get away with what he had done
Anybody else is absolutely baffled that this is their final season? i mean the only good thing about the whole Buzzfeed is the Unsolved Network & these 2 guys.
So I know no one wants to hear this, but the biggest theory is the bacon was used for…. Pleasure
I would suspect the Marshall! Good idea to let the townspeople touch the axe!
Anybody else is absolutely baffled that this is their final season? i mean the only good thing about the whole Buzzfeed is the Unsolved Network & these 2 guys.
Nice new plywood on that roof?
Shane gives me some Professor Lupin vibes 🤔
Iowa is one fkd up state,there are more missing people than anywhere else(i follow cold cases)makes you wonder what is in the water there,,,actually i hope the murderer's spirit is not in there with any of the victims,that truly would be hell.
29:22 my tinder bio
#postmortem was the town marshal investigated as potential murderer?  Letting people mess with murder weapon and walk around everyone sounds like intentional incompetence for the marshal
I feel like he covered the mirrors so their souls wouldn't get trapped. Also what if it was so dark that he didn't even realize he was using the wrong side of the axe? #outofbreath
Wasn't it like a religious thing to cover the mirrors after someone dies?
#postmortem When the spirit box said “eight” in the attic, wasn’t it referring to the number of victims?
“Unicorns aren’t real and ghosts are real” I don’t think my boyfriend and I have laughed so loud watching this.
Iowa folk: -instantly become Boogaras!- Uh ohhhh! Also being from Iowa, it's totally haunted.
I keep waiting for, when Ryan says he’s going to turn the spirit box, a voice just shouts “NO.” That would be cool
Shane's frustration that he has to explain AGAIN why the MAG lights don't work as evidence is so relatable. 😂
These blokes have some terrible flashlights
postmortem: maybe the killer's spirit is still in the house because it was HIS house? Like maybe a previous owner or another relative of the family?
9:30 Shane finally looses it
#PostMortem you guys should listen to the podcast 'morbid'!! they cover a lot of really interesting cases and their most recent episodes have been a two parter on this case, and they have a lot of really good information on it too!
I chuckled out loud when Ryan said "I'm the most feared ghost hunter alive"
#postmortem 23:03 it's a girl's voice saying "HELP US, RYAN"!
The bacon could have been brought in case there was a dog to distract it from barking.
My money's on the  marshal ... what better way to cover up your involvement than letting everyone in town come in and tamper with the crime scene.  0.o
The boys! 👐
I heard please leave please leave when they took out the spirit box- then I heard move
Nobody talking about the bed moving? no??? ok
#postmortam How do you think about the people being drugged? Because it wouldn't have been possible to creep around that house. The fact the killer could have been hiding in the attic creeps me tf out cause one the hole to get into ours is in the room next to my bedroom... not getting much sleep tonight 😅😂.
consider: Ghost Unicorn
"They found a slab of bacon near the corpses"  Me, making breakfast: "oh, good idea, I'll throw some on"
I may not have been the only one who thought of this over the years but I think that it was the Town Marshall who did it. I figure he did the deed somehow stealthily in the middle of the night, then when they were eventually found  he allowed the townsfolk to "handle" the weapon to cover up his involvement. I mean kinda seems suspicious to me
bacon may have been in case they had a pet.. idk  thats weird
Last Season Hype!
To be fair the spirit box was definitely more active in this house. And the fact that Ryan felt someone sit on the bed next to him? That house is definitely haunted
It actually was assumed by the police and investigators the slab of bacon was used as a "masturbatory item" - hence why one of the girls night dress was pulled up but she wasn't sexually assaulted.
Town marshall might have done it and let people contaminate the crime scene to cover for himself
Am I the only one who thinks that the ax mark on the wall is weird? Like the mark is vertical, who swings an ax up right above their head? Not to mention how tall the person must've been to have the mark that high up..
it sounded like it said pity 31:55
#PostMortem. At 31:20 i'm pretty sure i heard "yeah" after ryan said "we're at the halfway point here." #Shagara
Which room was the ax found in? Maybe the father did it, he was the only one that died by the hit of the sharp edge of the ax which could've been self inflicted and not immediately deadly. He could've dumped the ax and bleed out on the bed with his wife. And maybe he locked the doors prior to the killings so no one disturbs him. And it would explain the 'clothed' mirrors. After all, it was his family, but, as he claims, he just couldn't stop.
I never get used to that mannequin at the back, still gives me a mini heart attack whenever i see it 😂
#PostMortem are we not going to talk about how the elderly parents of the dude who got stabbed in 2014 just disappeared?
this is truly disturbing
The only reason why I watch their video is because they funny
28:01 Look at the big window upstairs🙀
Funnily enough, Ryan means little king so ya I guess Ryan is the king of the dolls
Shane calling someone a sick little weirdo is appropriate......
What if he was color blind. And facing away from the lights when asked. So your right would be his left!!!

The reply 'Eight' is not good not good at all. the number eight looks like an infinity symbol and anything that replies to a question related to year or age (usually when playing ouija board) with the figure 8. Is demonic in nature
…IM SAYING IT! None of those sounds that come from the spirit box sound like actual words. If the writing wasn’t there I wouldn’t be able to tell. Honestly madness….
question: Hypothetically, If ghosts are real, why would the murderer haunt the house?  #shaniac
22:55 I think it says am I invisible maybe it was standing next to them like it doesn’t know it is
I heard “police man” not  “release me” when they were using the spirit box. Later on, they revealed the town Marshall allowed people to handle the ax. I really thought that was interesting.
do the willows weep in indiana!
What if the killer was Josiah? It was his ax. It would explain why no one was alarmed or yelling when he entered the room. He could’ve easily gone through the family and they wouldn’t have been afraid.  But I can’t explain how he would’ve been axed too, idk if that’s possible to self inflict.
Well it was surprising to hear Shane say, *Word of warning,*  *It doesn't feel right to be in there alone.*
Tried to watch however the rudness . Not impresive. Show respect. Wont watch.
i dont live far from here and this has always been on my list of places to visit 🥴🥴
Most of the comments I see are talking about the spiritbox dialogue, which I'll admit is pretty solid--but can we just talk about that "what is it" whisper? That was CRISP. CLEAR. From an AUDIO RECORDER. I'm more inclined to believe that piece of evidence than anything out of the spiritbox im not gonna lie
Dude 666.k views and is 12:30 pm  this is ominous

we all need a shane in a scary movie that just doesnt believe them, and he still lives at the end
A main suspect in this case is Paul Mueller- aka the Man from The Train. He was a German serial killer obsessed with prepubescent girls. A lot of things from this case match up with previous victims of his. Look him up if you want to know more.
wow that was quick

When I went to the house in high school we sat on the floor and rolled a ball to each other, the ball went outside of the circle and then circled back and rolled to us 😂 I was outtt
#postmortem I believe the sheets on the mirrors and the faces of the deceased could suggest that they showed remorse or they didn't like what they were doing. This could relate to the "hard to stop" message. If the spirit of the killer is actually there could this be them saying "stop me" and could they be reliving their remorse and guilt? #boogara but giving me the proof a Shaniac needs
"You do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe. " 🥺🥺🥺
There's a book titled "The Man on The Train" that exposes a very good hypothesis on this and other similar cases all around the USA during that time.
Sounds like the marshal did it.
The Morbid Girls are gonna go insane that they covered this case the same week this Episode came out
#postmortem I'm genuinely surprised you 2 haven't bought a haunted house and moved into it yet.
#Postmortem. Could it be possible that the axe found in the home wasn't the main murder weapon. If the killer or killers planned on murdering the family before entering the house then they would have brought their own weapon. Or it could be possible that the killer drugged the families food or drinks while the family was out so no-one would wake during the killings. If there was any evidence left of the crime do you think forensics could solve the murders?
OK the "I'm in here" in the attic legit freaked me out.
Someone correct me if I'm wrong but didn't people used to put sheets over mirrors in rooms/houses where people passed away because they thought their souls could get trapped in the mirrors?
The scream by Shane after Ryan proclaims unicorns aren’t real but ghosts are 😂😂😂😂
I would personally like to thank Shane for that insane scream of frustration he let out. I have never felt so represented in the face of someone WHO WONT BELIEVE SCIENCE !!!!!!!
I enjoy every episode regardless…but what evidence was Ryan talking about in the last Post Mortem recap? 🤣 I still think the lighthouse episode had THE most evidence. I wonder why some spirits have more energy to communicate than others
#PostMortem  Because of Shane, I now find myself coming up with more logic outcomes in every situation of my life LOL.   "Hey, I've just been robbed!!"  "No, those hackers just borrowed the cash from your account. They'll give it back eventually."-Me   You guys are the best, are you suuuuuuure you don't want to stay for another season?!?!? Or two or three! Ryan congrats on your engagement! So happy for you!
a bit sussy
I give you guys the benefit of the doubt that what we are hearing in the video is unaltered. Sometimes I wish you would remove/lower background noises to bring the voices forward more clearly from the box in post edit for closer analysis and stop using the added heartbeats and music, as those just obscure things more. The combination of all the noise from the box and how it works, plus added noises for dramatic effect, causes me to dismiss anything from the box. However, as a non-believer in anything spiritual, the 'what is it?' Was the clearest thing I have ever heard in a show like this (I was not looking at the screen and clearly heard 'what is it' without the power of suggestion from the added text. It was clear enough that I turned around and rewound the video to hear it again). I would love for, in #postmortem, you guys to explain if any women were with you on the set, if so, where they were during that scene and if anyone was monitoring outside (in case nosey neighbours or something came by and were outside). Because that was a clear voice and if no women were around, that's is creepy as heck and I will give ryan a win in the 'maybe' evidence column. The 'I'm in here' and 'eight' responses were also creepy, but the box just doesn't do it as real evidence for me.  Edit: There is a theory that the killer in this event was a serial killer who used trains to get around (look into that ryan, it may interest you), so the 'hard to stop' answer to you asking why he did it, is interesting. But again. Spirit box.
Y at 18 18:08 theres a replay of shane saying the same type of thing as if its all planned out 😢
You guys are the funniest! Only you two can make this content hilarious! I love it! Always looking forward to new stuff! Thx!
Shane out here looking real vulnerable
This house definitely felt not as regal as the Conjuring house. But the spirit box here spoke too much. And was consistent as well. The whole convo in the downstairs room and the attic made sense. But literally do you guys think the 2014 man was actually tryna pull an act that failed? #Postmortem
BESTIE WAIT IM LISTENING TO A PODCAST EPISODE ON THIS CASE LITERALLY RIGHT NOW OMG
I still think Can’t believe this is the last season! What will our Halloweens be like from now on!!😭
Everytime Ryan and Shane ask the ghosts to give them a sign again, i can just imagine the ghosts going  "uGH AGAIN?!" (& somehow i imagine them saying it in john mulaney's voice, like when he says "ugh, this ought to be good")
all the voices they heard were really clear and even the flashlight part was really cool
It's depressing how many people believe ghost are real, although it's mainly Americans so it's probably their education system.
You are both looser
what if he was color blind or a simple man that didn't know his colors and that is why when you said left he did it? (flashlights)
Hopefully someone noticed when Ryan went back in there the doll was back on the chair in the attic even though they took it off of it 💀
#Postmortem to argue with Shane on the flashlight debacle, as someone who has watched nearly every episode of this series, the flashlights only go off and on when directly speaking to the spirits or demons. What if you guys tried candles? See if the spirits have enough energy to blow the candle out?
There's peace. Don't judge me
can’t believe you were in my state and i didn’t even know it, rude
Josiah B. Moore? Be more what?
#postmortem i think the bacon was supposedly used by the killer to m*sturbate over lena and that’s why it was in a cloth so he could hold the bacon and why special attention was put on her and she may have woken up. VERY icky…. what do you think to this theory ?
Josiah is my real name and i got scared to hear my name😂
#postmortem have you guys heard about the theory that this was the work of a serial killer?
:)
New upload!!! I was just watching videos of Observe examining your body language
Watching this at night, wish me luck
This question goes out to Shane; Have you ever, even for the slightest moment, after an episode, doubted that maybe just maybe spirits, ghosts and demons are real? For example, was there any place or episode you actually felt like lightheaded, unsettled, or uncomfortable during/after filming? #PostMortem
I toured in high school, kinda disappointed? And I'm on the Ryan level of scared
the "what is it?" voice sounded like a woman in my opinion
Love a good true crime + supernatural crossover. The thing is i'm mostly a shaniac but i wouldn't have laid on the floor with my eyes closed. No way.
at this point I just know that if Shane saw a ghost or whatever he just wouldn’t admit it to make Ryan feel more safe. but also because he wouldn’t wanna let Ryan be right lol
The fact that Shane is more focused on hating Iowa than the investigation is so funny to me  I feel like I have to make it clear that I do not hate Iowa and the fact that I am British
kind of convinced don't stop me now by queen was playing on a radio channel in the area during that spirit box session and it just cut all the don'ts because of how fast it was going lmaooooo
He didn't say leave.  He said Igby.   He did it because of a 2002 dramedy starring Kieran Culkin.
anybody else get anxious when the do solo investigation
White man dork... Hah hah hah... Asian man,very sensitive...
I really hope that one time when the use the “spirit box “ the person will like insult the.
I know Shane has said it before but like Ryan is super brave going into these situations like Shane just thinks he’s talking to dust meanwhile Ryan is going through a house where at least to his knowledge the killer still resides in
19:33 patrick
(spoilers for s3 of "you")   the axe murderer was love quinn, no i am not taking criticism for this theory
I read in a couple places that Josiah received more blows than the other victims, do you guys think this was for a specific reason? I agree with the theory about it being a personal/possibly business related motive, because the town was so small as well.
If something ever happens to Shane during these videos I’ll be convinced 😂😂✋🏽
Kinda wanted them to visit zack bagan’s museum
A marriage of Supernatural and True Crime that  really scares me.   'Upwards of 100 people in the house...with the bodies still inside' is MUCH more terrifying than any ghost. Good God we humans are messed up...and clearly always have been. There were child victims here...bad mojo....ugh!   On a positive note, I've been binge (re)watching True Crime and I ALREADY MISS IT! I'm an older fan who loves both of you, Shane and Ryan!
I heard “very distraught” instead of “hard to stop”
21:51 the way Ryan moved the doll 👌🏽😂😂
Shane's in the closet??? :0 /j
#postmortem do you think maybe the killer knock out the family with some sort of pill or something in their food and that’s how they were able to get around without waking anyone up?
I feel like bacon wrapped in a towel could be because the killer thought they might have a dog??
the medium said that the killer said "like Putty in my hands" even though Putty was invented after the murders Villisca Ax Murder - 10 June 1912 Putty Invention - 1943
#postmortem wait why is there both a “manager of production” and a “production manager” listed in the credits? My fourth grade spanish teacher would have said that’s the same thing…
This was actually terrifying that the spirit was actually replying...to the spirit box.
the voices are so clear wtf
How ironic that Morbid just did an amazing series on this whole story and Last Podcast on the Left referenced this in the "With an Axe" episode. Love it
just listened to the Morbid podcast on this!
Those mustaches are looking sharp
The different color flashlights test was pretty smart
For the post mortem, have either of yall ever react to the time yall are alone on walk through? Have you ever wished you did something differently or how funny Is it to watch Ryan trip out? #postmortem
Yo I literally just finished the morbid episode on this place ????
Plot twist: At the end of the series Ryan becomes full fledged ghost hunter and Shane becomes a believer lol
#postmortem What was the heating situation there at the time? Could a gas leak, purposely done, have debilitated the family enough to make them unable to react? #shaniac
#PostMortem Yey the ghoul boys are back!!! It’s been to long now 🤗 By any chance do both of you plan to visit any places in Arizona? I would love to see you guys explore the ghost city also famous and known for Jerome the Grand Hotel. I stayed there twice and had some pretty interesting experiences over night. Maybe we can get Shane to become a believer in the season finale. By the way this episode was crazy, why on earth would they have everybody hold the murder weapon? That part made no sense and clearly we understand why this case has never been resolved. 🤦🏻‍♀️ Thanks for all the laughs and wild adventures my quarantine was definitely not the same without some good ol Ryan and Shane hauntings lol  Michele from Riverside, Ca
Why did I think the Lizzie Borden crime was the only one that deals with axes
I've always wondered, do ghosts need their own spirit box to be able to communicate with humans?
To me it sounded like the voice said Fredrick at 19.40 in answer to 'what are you parents' names"
Sad this series will be ending - its been so much fun with the goul boys!
Do Burari case too
Was it not the town marshal or atleast he's helping the murderer?? Purposely letting people in the house, getting them to handle evidences is just sus.
Okay, but hear me out: The killer brought a piece of bacon, right? What if that was his alibi? If he was the town's butcher, it wouldn't be suspicious if anyone saw him walking around carrying a piece of meat. Also, there is only one way that no one in the house would not have heard the killer: they were drugged/sedated. If the killer was indeed the butcher he could have sold them meat with drugs in it and then went into the house to commit the murders after they eat. What do you think? #postmortem
I would really miss this content so much once it's finally end
I'm confused about the attic part. I thought they found an imprint in the hay in the barn right next to a hole in the wall that had a perfect view of the house?
#Postmortem How is the killer's ghost still possibly trapped inside the house? Didn't he escaped after he killed them?
Anyone want to see Ryan go in by himself at the very beginning? I think the spirits actually hate Shane and they may talk to Ryan if they don’t know Shane is also around.
Let it be noted this was in a time prior to video games, proving people, including the idiots who handled the axe for fun, are just messed up
I know it’s not a big thing but the spirit box picking up “8” was something that hit me. Especially since it was when talking to the killer. I also think that him saying “I’m miserable” to the question of if he liked doing it makes sense because covering the face of victims is usually a sign of regret. The covering of the mirrors would also suggest that he couldn’t handle the fact that it was him doing the killing and he needed to hide that. It would be interesting to know if there was blood on the mirrors which would show if he killed them before or after covering and give us another look into what this man might have been feeling. I watch too much criminal minds, please don’t mind me. Edit: some reply’s asked for this so #postmortem and thank you guys for the discussions!
LMAO SHANE JUST MADE MY DAYS BETTER! THANK YOU
As an in iowa resident: iowa is haunted. Confirmed.
#postmortem why are so many of these homes so well preserved with the details of the crime scene years later, such as the covered mirror and the dolls? Is it recreated later on?
Did the family of the two girls that were staying over ever give a statement or anything? Everytime I hear about this they never mention the two girls family.
I love them
Buzzfeed is probably the best “ghost haunting” show there is since we get te perspective of a sceptic and a believer
The boys are  here!
#postmortem Was the town marshall ever a suspect? Maybe he let people handle the ax to contaminate the evidences  And he would had an excuse to "patrol" the house, so he could find a way in
Do you enjoy stealing from Morbid Podcast Buzzfeed? 😂😂 trash
#postmortem How does shane feel about the evp saying "What is it?" it's so incredibly clear.
@0
#postmortem Did y'all personally get disturbing thoughts invading your mind when you visited this place? It has such a dark history
It kept saying help me /stop me in the one room if that were true maybe the killer is trapped there. Like a hellraiser film trapped living that night over and over again in hell. And he wants someone to stop him from doing it. That it I just like this movie idea now 😂
#Postmortem If you ever proved that ghosts were real, would you let Shane ever forget that you were right? Cheers from Portugal!
def a no bones day because now i can rest and watch the ghoul boys 🤍
And this is why I have a axe a sword and a dagger next to my bed!
Illinois, Montana... hmm, reminds me of a certain man
Should monitor your heart rate and show it on screen. I bet Ryan's heart rate is through the roof 😂🤭
How Ryan can still believe in ghosts after all these seasons really says something about him….lmfao
can someone tell amazon prime I'm not gonna watch their dumbshit movie and if they keep interrupting the video with their annoying unskippable ads I'm gonna make sure no one watches it
#postmortem .. I am still wondering, till now, Why these spirits or appartions hadn't followed you upon returning home or atleast visited your dreams...
#Post-mortem the bacon was apparently use sexually, a meaty fleshlight. If I have to know you do too.
#postmortem every time Ryan says he’s the most feared ghost hunter in the world I just can’t help but giggle. Also can one of you please adopt or even borrow a dog and take them on a hunt to see if they point anything out to you or act strange. Thanks for all the hours of entertainment.
Ryan is really going for his bucket list and I LOVE IT
Just listened to the morbid podcast episode on this case, investigators think that the bacon was used for…pleasure………
The cloth over the mirror is actually an old Victorian mourning tradition. You were supposed to cover the mirror to prevent the soul from becoming trapped in the mirror.
"hey, fucko"
I would love to see you two try the Estes method during your investigations. It’s basically were you connect noise cancelling headphones to the spirit box, one person listens to the spirit box, and the other asks the questions. The person wearing the headphones can’t hear and doesn’t know the questions being asked which makes the responses genuine. Some people wear a blindfold, skeptics might look at that and say there lip reading. Happy ghost hunting👻👻👻
"you do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe" stan for shane
I lived in Villisca in the 90s just a few blocks away from this house. It was up for sale at the time and no one would buy it. It always gave off the creepiest vibes.  But the real kicker is that during Villisca Days (the cities yearly celebration) they would put the actual axe out on display for everyone to see.
Who just heard morbid cover this????!!
Lets go Ghoul Boys...!!!! Stay Blessed 🙌
I'm confused. 8 people murdered and nobody saw anything and the murderer was never found. So why are the ghoul boyz trying to communicate with the murder suspect!?
#postmorten It seems to me that it doesn't make much sense to end on this season, although whilst I do's respect it, maybe due to a change in attitude or confidence or maybe the places you've gone so far this season, but it seems you're getting more solid evidence than ever. The evp's in this episode were in the same voices throughout which makes me believe it isn't a radio channel or something else interfering. But somebody... somewhere
what if you go to a spanish or mexican family murder in an area where there is no spanish radio station and in the us and  ask them questions in spanish then if they respond in spanish then it disproves the idea that all the spirit box responses are radio interference since your in an area were there is no spanish radio stations #boogara #postmortem
Not a great commercial for Maglite
9:29 i thought shane was about to have a seizure #postmortem
*Shane just called the ghost a LOSER*
9:30 *OHH YEAAHH BABY THATS WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT*
You guys should team up with Ghost Adventures for an episode!😂
Shane is a skeptic and so am I about alot of things involving the paranormal. But every episode he goes to these locations and plays along and is a good sport because A. The channel makes him money and B. He respects others beliefs even though he doesn't totally agree with them. I wish more people were like Shane.
Conclusion: Shane's disbelief in ghosts is as strong as his love for his girlfriend and as much as he hates the spirit box.
okay so it was clearly the chief marshal who did it. like who allows such mishandling of evidence???????? #buzzfeedunsolved #postmortem
#PostMortem The murder happened in 1912, wouldn't it be more appealing to the "ghost" if you dressed up and talked the way they did in 1912? Also, will you investigate haunted places that are more recent (e.g., the murder happened in the 2000s).
I don’t remember what its for but I’m Irish and when we have a Wake or a Corp House we cover the mirrors and the tv screens for some reason i can’t even remember but if u do research you’ll find out
Great episode.  But the murderer was "the man on the train"
For post-mortem where is the compelling evidence ryan was talking about in the post-mortem video for the conjuring house? I wish we could have seen something which will give the shaniacs a run for their money #boogara
i hate shane’s ignorance in trying to reach out to spirits but doing it in the most disrespectful way. so many episodes i’ve seen they’re screaming and being loud or disrespectful, and then wonder why they don’t capture anything. it’s cringe at this point
#postmortem so the weird thing is , the house is way to squicky?  …. So how did someone sneak in and did all that , what if it was more than one person??? Or even the town marshal??  Or the brother’s job ?
08:53 - 09:30 describes perfectly how Shaniacs are in touch with reality and Boogaras are not. Even Ryan's reaction "Unicorns aren't real" is just so accurate, just how every Boogara reacts, missing the point completely. There's no proof that ghosts don't exist, which is true, but there is also no proof that unicorns don't exist either. But one is more believable than the other?? GTFO. Good lord I've been in this exact same situation in Shane's place.
So many chilling spirit box notes, blood boils from the works of the Iowans & yet the only thing concerns me is that AX without an E..🙃🙂😑😑
The guy comes into the house to taunt the spirits and gets stabbed Shane: Hey fucko
LMFAO Shane was like "YOU WERE SO CLOSE TO THE POINT!"
The guy who stabbed himself just sounds mentally ill. He took his elderly parents to stay in a murder house instead of, IDK, Boca Raton? He clearly had a fixation on the house and the violence that took place in it. He probably wanted to become part of the story. #shaniac #postmortem
Nice.
Huff noises and huff prints 🤣
#postmortem my mother used to cover all the mirrors, and close the curtains in our bedroom before we slept, so that evil spirits couldn't come into the room. do you think this is similar to what the axe murderer was doing somehow?
To turn of the right colored flashlight
The fact they aren’t terrified by the fact the that the flash light is actually turning on and off is horrifying to me
Maybe that ghost is colorblind
I wonder if the sheet over the mirror was some sort of a superstition.
9:29 This is my favourite part
Ever since I saw black box tv do an overnight in this house years ago, this house has always filled me with so much  fear. Even if there are no ghosts, just thinking about the horror undergone by that family, those children, fills me with such dread
#Postmortem what did the parents of katherine's friend say about the incident?  They have any idea who did this?
for #postmortem: You guys said the killer is still in the house, along with the victims... Do you think they're talking to each other? Like... they're basically living together, so they might have conversations...?
Not sold that I believe in ghosts but if I did I would deeply appreciate the fun little poltergeist energy of saying "switch" and making Shane hold the god awful spirit box. That's how you reap misery boys.
that “what is it?” was so crisp
I'd live in that cute little house if it wasn't in Iowa.
I'm gonna miss them
And nothing ever happens…
Why is the voice a Microsoft voice?
'Amityville' like windows...Do ghost like windows like that?
Is nobody gonna ask how the brother got into the house if the murderer locked the door and took the keys with him? No? Just me?
ok, but seriously rn... Shane is literally fearless
Pigs 🐖🐷🐽 in a blanket
#postmortem As a Shaniac, I am begrudgingly willing to admit that the “what is it?” Whisper is probably the most solid piece of evidence from this series. Would like to hear what Shane has to say about this.
May the ghoul boy bond be with us all. 😽
Pstt... It was the aliens 👽 #postmortem
Shockingly cut short ehhhhh
what’s even more chilling is the similarities this case shares with hinterkaifeck
Just hats off to Ryan for being such a courageous person as we all know it's not easy to get over our fear and Ryan Did that for us.  Thank you Ryan ❤❤
I REQUEST PLS DO THE Chernobyl incident it would be awsome   Ty pre from the philippines :)
Even if he doesn’t believe just hearing Shane say “I’m terrified” makes me scared. He never gets scared so if he says it I’m preparing myself
feel like the just pummelled this episode into this season for content when it should really be more of a true crime episode
That's such a creepy attic
Just an anime character about to lose their mind 32:16
Awesome having you guys back ghost busting. I saw a doco on this event, and there was the theory that it was a travelling priest who had been at the service that night. He may have been invited back for supper after the service. Modern researchers did a study of other ax-type related murders and attacks in surrounding areas and states, and found that wherever this very dodgy priest went, ax attacks followed. Apparently his general demeanor made people very uncomfortable, but being a man of the cloth gave him easy access to peoples homes - ahh, sweet, sweet Christian obligation to trust priests in your home around your kids!
There is something eerie about this episode for some reason
31:53 omg the doll over his solder!!! I freaked out for a moment there before I realized what it was 😂
The bed moving was actually scary af
I wonder what would happen if Ryan and Shane invited  their girlfriends to tag along with them in a haunted house
"you do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe" so cute <3
The EVP. "Stop me", "Help me". Could both be the killer. It can not stop itself from killing, so it is asking you to help it, by stopping it, and getting it help to stop these murderous urges.
Ryan ‘Are ghosts real?’  Me waiting for Shane to shake his head ‘No’ 😂
What if he was a hobo? The kind that rode in box carts of a train?
If anyone is like a ghost professional or something, can you explain why a ghost (the murderer in this case) would remain in the house rather than the place they actually died?
For some context on the covered mirror, it's a documented thing that very mentally ill people when experiencing an episode will cover mirrors. From what I know it's because they either don't recognise themselves, or they're too ashamed too see themselves but it could be for many other reasons. Hope this helps anyone confused by that :)
Shane: As I said, you kinda successfully did all the murders here and then chose to haunt this place?  He kinda sounds like a boss questioning the decision of his employees. He is like, "You could have been better than that."
How do his brother know that it was an axe?
i think at 19:56 when the spirit box says something "one", i think they were trying to say "there was more than one"  (referencing the killer) , probably trying to tell us that there was more than one murderer.....
At 31:50 I could have sworn that in response to Ryan asking why did you do it , Swear I hear it say “Envy” instead of “leave”
I can recognise it  from mr ballen
for #postmortem :   at 31:58, when ryan is alone in the attic, ryan asked the spirit box "why did you do what you did here?" the answer sounded to me like "giddy" and my mind went immediately to the part where shane and ryan were both in the attic talking about if the killer felt giddy about what they did. coincidence?   also I was wondering how the answers of the spiritbox get 'identified'? does someone listen to the whole clip with the context and then identifies what was said or do you let someone hear what the spiritbox responded without the context as to maybe make the answers more credible?  anyway I'm really enjoying the episodes so far, I'm sad that it's gonna end but I love the memories I made along the way!
Yes!!!! I have been waiting for this!
Maybe the marshall killed the family and then let everyone onto the crime scene to mess it up to cover his tracks
Hear me out, maybe the family knew what was going to happen to them. What if the service they went to earlier that day was all about sacrifice and death. However, even though everyone agreed to it, at the last moment one of the victims wanted to back out, which is why there was trauma. This would also explain why the town marshal allowed the public to access the crime zone, to cover up the sacrifice or something.
The ghoul boyz are aging nicely
Maybe the town Marshall did it and letting people contaminate the scene/evidence was his cover up.... or he was one of the biggest dumbasses in history
For post mortem: I think the fact that the killer stopped to prepare and eat a meal in the victims house really shows how confident the killer was that they wouldn’t get caught. Wouldn’t it have been crazy if they choked and died on that food in the kitchen that night? (Edited to add: like on an avocado pit?😂) Anyway, what kind of post mass-gruesome-murder snack would you make if you were a deranged killer?(: happy final season!!❤️
I don't get why the soul of the murderer would be present in the house...
Flashlights, spirit box, yelling in the middle of the room and demanding sh*t.  I don't believe in ghosts, but at least try something new while you're there...
I'm here to see Shane shaking his head and saying "no" to "are ghosts real".
Postmortem: Why would the axe persons ghost be in the house, like the family?  Sure, whatever, but if you killed a bunch of people with an axe would you really want to spend your entire afterlife just chilling with them in their place?
hi Ryan and Shane this isn't really a question more of a new way to get proof that the paranormal exists. its called the Estes method, you put headphones in the spirit box and put them on, you also cover your eyes and call out every word you hear. you cant do this by yourself you have to have at least one other person there. the other person askes the spirits a question and they for the person with the spirit box to answer. the person asking questions should write down every word he hears come from he's friends mouth. and you cant do it for long because it can make you go crazy. but yeah I learnt about it too maybe help you with your "are ghosts real?"
Me after hosting a movie marathon night: Why are you still here? What year is it?
Axe*
I mostly just come here for Shane and Ryan being entertaining in these places not really the ghost hunting but that voice recording of “what is that” had me shook. Wasn’t even looking at the screen and I actually understood it no subtitles
Imagine the killer was at the crime scene with the axe trying to recreate how he did it the night before  "Nope I swung with my left not the right, can we retake the picture?"
Normaly you hang something over the mirror so that the ghost won't get trapped in the house, but why do you think that the murderer should also be trapped in the house? If that wasn't his only victim's than why should he get trapped in that house? And not there where he died?  And I am sorry if I wrote something wrong, English is not my mother language 😁🇦🇹❤️
🧟🧟🧟
I just got done listening to morbid podcast about this murder! I’m so glad you guys are covering the haunting!
maybe it was just a beef over bacon this whole time
#postmortem for the individual walk bit, why does Shane never take the spirit box with him?
Why does a non demonic house have more than a demonic one man! 😂
#postmortem Shane were you worried that when you opened your eyes you'd see Ryan stood over you with an axe with a crazed grin on his face
pog video #postmortem
who else has this irrational strong feeling that somehow it was the father...
14:46 that doesn’t sound like ‘what is it’ that sounds like ‘let us in’
For postmortem, covering up the mirrors is often done to prevent the spirit being trapped but it's also believed that looking into the mirror (where someone has died) could cause their own death. So potentially the killer was trying to make sure they didn't meet the same fate?
THEYRE BACKKK
How do they know it was only one murderer and not a team of people?
If you guys are really interested in this case and want more detail the podcast Morbid has a recent two part episode that goes into better detail.
Not perfect anymore
The covering of mirrors used to be done because they believed that spirits could come back through the mirror. I'm sure it's done more as a prop to add to the spooky vibes, in this case
Listening and not looking at the subtitles and that spirit box is not saying what they say it is lolll. "Help me" I heard "probably"
At 31:23 was that someone laying on the bed or a doll?
this is one of the most haunted places they've ever been, so much spooky stuff happening
This house hands down has had the most activity of all of them
Wow nothing happened while Ryan was inside? All that build up? This house got trumped by that lighthouse in one of the old seasons? 😮
#PostMortem Ryan, how are you one of the most feared ghost hunter if you yourself are fearful of ghost? By the way you and Shane rock either way. Definitely one of the best duos ever.
Wonderful to see you all
Ghosts are demonic , be Leary what you look for 🥺
#postmortem ,  why would the axe murder disembody spirt linger and haunt the house . Did the murder come back and cursed the house with his evil spirit
ryan: 'because unicorns aren't real.' shane: '........' ryan: 'ghosts *are* real.' shane: 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA---'
I’m from Illinois but I live in Iowa so now I don’t know wtf to do
#buzzfeedunsolvedpostmortem would it matter if the townspeople handled the ax if DNA testing was so limited back in 1912? Genuine question, I have no clue
Don't get me wrong, I love spooky stuff, haunted houses and murder houses, but having a huge sign plastered in front of a house where so many people were gruesomely killed is just tasteless. Lots of people know the story of this place anyway, why not show some respect for the deceased and not make it look like a billboard? Wouldn't a small plaque have sufficed? Such an American thing to do, idk...
Sadly isn’t this the scene where the police thought the bacon was used to as*alt one of the girls
It really sounds like they were possessed by something or like "forced" to murder them
ok ok ok ok but shane and ryan playing phasmaphobia??
#postmortem: Well, I too believe that the murderer dropped his breakfast, 'cause who would leave bacon on the floor like that?? Probably comforted himself with the Moore's leftovers... Also, we're getting some real nice EVPs this episode, although nothing will win over the "Spaghetti-Apple Tater" ghost.  P.S. : Investigations then may not have been conducted the same way as today, but the town marshall though... what a nitwit.
You want me to leave? Well if you don't talk then I will *looks intently at spirit box*
Speculation busted that Shane is a demon all along because Shane was wholesome when he said “You do what you gotta do to keep your girlfriend safe”
"This house is all set up like it was a hundred years ago" but I literally have that blue Build-a-Bear with the rainbow peace signs. Suddenly all feels WAY less scary XD
Plz get a Netflix show😭‼️
Bedtime Stories already solved the Vilisca axe murders   Well kind of
Maybe the town marshall was trying a Cinderella type thing with the axe?
Town Marshall: alright, now that I've let almost 100 people to touch the murder weapon, we can begin the investigation! 😆😆
This season seems incredibly rushed? Like y'all don't hold still/quiet long enough for the ghosts to do or say anything.
Ax murder
If there were spirits, imagine how upsetting it would if they were the victims as the investigating team assumed you were the killer.
For Postmortem: Could it have been the dad who committed the murders? He was the only one who was struck by the sharp part of the axe. Maybe he bludgeoned the rest and then the only way to kill himself but still look like murders was to use the sharp end on his own head.
its probably the townsman? the one who made everyone take turns doing the same ax thing 🤔
You should come to Ireland and investigate Loftus Hall
They were all probably drugged much earlier or it was a multiple man job.
#postmortem: nice job, ghoul boys! all this talk about sneaking around unnoticed made me wonder if the killer hadn't perhaps drugged some of their food before the family came back from the church. as you said, the floors are too noisy for nobody to have heard someone exiting the attic, let alone move around, but if they had no qualms eating their food after the murders, they might not have had any drugging them before hiding upstairs, either.
idgi, why would the murderer be in the house? I thought you stayed where you died? @7:05
I bet the marshal was the killer lmao
32:24 I’m sorry but wtf is behind Ryan??
for #postmortem, what if the killer was the Moores friend? what if he was sleeping with the Moores like uh guest? secretly killed the Moores and maybe to be safe killed off those girls? and for shane, what would you do if the killer said your name back using the spirit box? [ i was horrified when the box picked up, "i kill him" ]
Not to *not* be a skeptic Shaniac, but doesn’t 19:56 kinda sound like “Moore” ?
#postmortem Shane's won... Ryan's stopped believing we see it in his eyes 😂 he doesn't even tear up at flashlights any more. Are ghosts real... Nope.... Solved 😂
#postmortem I think the person who did it was poor and went to steal the bacon. I think they wrapped it up to steal from the house one of the girls fought back and he just forgot his bacon in the chaos. Iv solved the motive of the whole crime. Your welcome
Just listened to morbid do two podcast episodes about this! They did really good it’s worth a listen!
I nearly had an heart attack around the 32:00 mark. When Ryan is crouched in the attic, by himself, and there is a figure behind him. 😂
I don't know why but I get happy when ever someone mentions my state.  Buy Shane I'll fight ya, Illinois is dirtier then Iowa.
I'm not just brushing past (yeef)
Wasn't there a superstition about spirits being trapped in mirrors when dying and hence why the killer might have covered them before killing?
The bed moving honestly gave me goosebumps ngl
POV  murderer was illiterate and didn't know he was being counted down🤣
There is one other thing that has hooves, it walks on two legs.
You know shits getting real when Ryan starts quoting Father Thomas
The axe is either Thors’ stormbreaker size or the murderer is huge for the axe mark to be that high on the wall
Why isn’t anyone talking about Shane screaming at 9:30 😂😂😂
#PostMortem hi! Is Shane a little convinced about the existing of ghost now? I mean...those lights turning on and off, the voices...
Question for Shane - The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be destroyed, when a human dies where does that energy go?
that voice saying what is it was so clear?
That was some of the most convincing EVPs I ever heard.
What type of unstable person brings his elderly parents to a place only to stab himself cuz he wanna provoke ghosts
Shane Really is The One Who Was Sent To ward off All The Possible Evils From Ryan & Discard All Of Ryan's Ghost Theories 😂😂😂
Why isn't anyone talking about the bed movement? That was so clearly visible and creepy as hell
How s everyone so calm in the comments?! The voices and the lights turning off? Wtf
i dont think putty existed in 1912...
Question for #postmortem: Do you believe that the family and the two girls meals had been poisened because if the killer had used that amount of force to kill them then how could the person next to them not wake up. Or anyone in the house for that matter
I love you guyssssssss
To me the spirit box voice around 6:50 sounds very clearly like someone saying "Look, I'm stuck in-" and that being followed by "Release me" was v spooky in my humble opinion #postmortem
I want what Shane has. That courage
The evp is so clear, I love it ✨
Does anyone not suspect the caretaker ? Definitely piqued the interest of people and must have earned a lot. Stab victim may have been drugged
#Shane i have a question for u..why did u choose to be a ghost hunter when u believe that there are no ghosts??dnt u get bore of it??  And whatever anybody does the people who believe that ghosts exist would keep believing it😅
#postmortem why do you blur the faces in the photos? sorry this isn't really related to the whole murder house thing but its been on my mind for a while #boogara
What if he was a dinner guest drugged them and that’s why no one woke up
do Americans spell 'axe' without the E ?
Petition for Shane and Ryan to visit the Chris Watts murder home.
It was probably the axe man of New Orleans on vacation. Walked past and they weren't jazzing it so he butchered them
What if it was a team of bandits and not a seriel killer
What if.....they were all killed somewhere else, brought into the house and then left there for authorities to think they were murdered in their sleep?
Did anyone else full screen the part where something sits next to Ryan? You can see the bed indent where he said something sat down. You can also hear the springs of the bed.
With the mirrors being covered, it used to be tradition when someone died to cover mirrors so the spirit didnt get trapped in it. Could have been that the murderer was superstitious!
Return of the Axe Man and Razor Boy??? #postmortem
Anyone else listen to morbid: a true crime podcast?
love the spiritbox in this one, so talketive
#postmortem Did Shane missed the q and a of the last episode because he didn't wanted to be questioned about the door opening at the conjuring house that their staff saw ?
Why does nothing ever happen to shane???????..those place are so deadly but when they go there it's like the ghouls know that they would be on the internet so they dnt show up😂
#Postmortem  I usually listen to the spirit box session with my eyes.closed so that I can interpret what I actually hear and I heard " hard to stop" as "had to stop" .
Shane Madej, a non-believer and the original boyfriend material
#Postmortem This one is for Shane - Throughout all the seasons of Unsolved Supernatural, has anything ever even come close to being unexplainable in your opinion?
Literally nothing happened
Could you please talk about the suspects in the Q+A? I think it's a pity you didn't develop this aspect.
Anyone else here agree with Shane but wants Ryan to be right?
Dude killed 8 people in a house not by swiftly cuting them but instead blunt force trauma and none of the ppl woke up...just how freaking strong was this dude?
You know what he did with that bacon wrapped in the towel, alone, in the attic,... excited about what he was about to do..... come on...
shane take care
they should try the estes method that would be cool
Why did nobody check the caretaker, because wouldn’t he have key to get in the house.  it would make more sense to me more then someone hiding in the attic for god knows how long. #postmortem
For the #postmortem are there any suspects for who the murderer was or any other cases that might have also been them?
Thumbs up if you saw this place on Junkyard Digs’ channel!
Plot twist:- the serial killer was actually dreaming about hunting some boars for a big feast while also sleep walking into the house and chopping them all up
On quote , quote on quote
Please dnt quit this channel. It’s contents are so awesome!!!
"IM SOOOOOOO VULNERABLE RN OMG"
This was True Crime x Supernatural
ryan, NOW you think he’s insane? mans has beeeeeen insane
The brother did it. I'm calling it.
Imma be real with y'all, this is probably the least haunted site the ghoul boys have visited in this show lmao, this is a crime scene more than a a possessed house/area
Don't stop doing what you do PLEASE.
Why would the murderers soul or ghost be there?? Wouldn't you assume there would only be the souls of those who DIED there in the house?? Also the covering of all the faces is a very interesting detail like he couldn't look at them anymore but why is a question with multiple possibilities.
what if the murderer was possessed?
For #postmortem what can Shane say about the audios the spirit box picked up? Do you believe that those are actually from the killer and the Moore family?   Also it was very nice that Shane checks the rooms in their house to keep Sara safe
Mary Peckham was hanging laundry at 5 a.m. in the morning!!! 😵
I think the mirrors are covered because it was/is a common belief that if a person died their soul would become trapped in uncovered mirrors or something to that effect, so maybe the killer covered the mirrors because they believed their souls would become trapped in the house otherwise? Or that they would haunt him? I think it was a random killer who just picked their house that night. #PostMortem
As I was expecting it to occur * the movie depicted no insight into the killer possibly living in the attic! If memory serves me,, wasn’t it thought the dad murdered them?
18:41 Ghostb "No I can't, there's no space between you and Shane!" 🤣
Has anyone investigated Frank Lloyd Wright's Taliesin Home in Wisconsin??? Six people were brutally murdered by a handy man with an ax then he set the house ablaze. Wright rebuilt the house.  The victims included Wright's mistress and their two children.
#postmortem can u give us any hints to the nest episode (the year or place ect)
If the killer was quiet enough to sneak around the house, what if it was a woman?
I havent watch every season but out of the ones ive watched this is the most audiable spirit box usage ive ever seen
At 19:40..does anyone else hear a scream after stop me?
How they could kill the family? Drugs?
Before y’all end your series can y’all PLEASE cover why so many people go missing in our National Parks, and NO ONE talks about it, missing 411 covered it but I feel like y’all would make an amazing episode out of it, thankyou guys for your work!
#postmortem  Do you think the killer could have been Jesiah's brother? And why do you think the killer stayed in the house?
#postmortem In a small town like that, in 1912, it would have been easy to figure out who went in while the family was at the church function, by figuring out who was missing at the function. In those days, nothing else would have been going on, everybody went to those things. There are probably still places  in Iowa where people don't have to lock their doors
Hi Ryan and Shane! Not just you… I’m from Nebraska and the feud against Iowa is real. #yikes
#Postmortem  I think the town marshall is a good suspect, bc if you think about it he literally let the people ruin the evidence/ fingerprints on the axe. I don't know if at that time police took fingerprints of from the killer weapon but if they did that would explain the "pick up the axe" game the town folks did.
Ryan Looks Terrified When He Is Alone
that what is it was so clear
"Iowa VS Illinois" Indiana: Am I a joke to you? #postmortem
what would you say the vibe in the house felt? and do you really feel that the murderer's soul still resides in there?
You both seemed aggervated from the start of the investigation... Such a small house and the history , I felt anxious and suffocated just watching you guys.  I heard only 1 male voice on the spirit box that was consistent the entire time. The Evp sounded like a female tho.
I watch a LOT of true crime and cold case shows, but I have never heard of this! Nice to see something new (not that tragedies are nice 😅😬)
Maybe you need to have an open mind to comunicate, i don't belive they exist too but i am an open minded person, maybe Shane go to the places and block the interactions because he is so closed minded about that, remember its a spirit experience...90% of the events happen when Ryan is alone, and to me that shows that being open minded is better than closed one
#postmortem I love how the worst thing that happened to Shane in these locations is the fact that he had to hold the Spirit Box.
Ryan's hair still lookin fly
so many killer quotes in this episode, my fave being - “he just seems to have no fear, which I used to think was courageous but now I just think he’s an insane person.”
Shane napping and waiting for a ghoul to smack him silly is the only proof you need that ghosts are weak af. He was right there, and they didn't have enough energy to even blow a hair out of place
WOOOHH! GOD BLESS FRIDAYS THANKS TO THESE TWO GOOFBALLS OF SUNSHINE, WITH THIS AND ARE YOU SCARED ON WATCHER ❤️😭🍻
For the postmortem, is it possible that the whole family were drugged that night? Then it make sense that the victim were all lay down on the bed. This is only my theory. Since all victim were hack on their face/head does that indicate that the murderer hate to see their face? The murderer also covered the mirror which indicate the insecurities of his own face. From the interaction with the spirit box, it can be concluded that the killer is indeed haunts the place. Is it because he is proud of his act? So why does the murderer does not commit his act again after this event?#Postmortem
For Post Mortem: Why does Shane dislike the spirit box so much?
For Post-mortem:  Ryan, this isn't meant to question your logic, but I'm just genuinely curious as to your reasoning; if you (and the entire ghost community) believe in ghosts being real, and that they're sentient beings trapped someplace and are begging for help, then shouldn't we be investing more money and research in trying to help them? I mean, they're practically people asking for help and we just runaway from them. I'd kinda be pissed if I were a ghost.   Regardless, thanks for all the years of ghosthunting.
#postmortem Ryan don't you think we would have been able to see the sheets move or shift if something sat on the bed next to you?
Since this is the last season, I have a question for Shane. I know that you don't believe in spirits or ghosts...but out of all the places that you have investigated, has there ever been a specific incident  to which you couldn't affix a scientific explanation? Like you don't necessarily consider it to be an evidence of the supernatural but can't really explain it to yourself.   #postmortem
I know the closet is supposed to be scary, however I can't help but notice there is a boohbah toy there hahaha🤣
As someone who has lived in a room with angled walls for almost three years, that axe murderer must have been a short man or average sized woman to scratch the wall and not catch the angled ceiling on the upswing.
#postmortem, why are the evp sessions so short? You've gotta give the ghosts some time to answer
This one is probably one of the only places that made me feel uncomfortable, though I feel like it is just the situation itself and how gruesome the story is.
Dude I swear like 3 years ago we did a buzzfeed unsolved recreation: we called it “bizzfeed unsolved” for an IT project on video editing and we did this exact case and idk why it got me so excited T-T
FOR POST MORTEM: MAKE RYAN GO BACK # shaniac
#postmortem I don't understand what happened with the bed at 18:07 and why they zoomed in on the bed....I don't see anything...am I missing something?
Sounds to me that the Town Marshall could possibly have done it.
omg morbid just did an episode on this perfect timing
so his a theory:    The  law allowed everyone in to handle the evidance    was it  someone  in law enforcement  that was the killer  tainting the evidance?
ok why would the ghost of the murderer be in the house i dont get it.. and it could also be a woman
"AhahAhaHah … I didn't mean to laugh at that"
Where the 2000s ghosts at, the ring but with a haunted disc of Spider-Man 2  #postmortem    Also One of you in dbd
for both of you: this episode had some compelling evidence, but why would the murderer choose this house to haunt in his afterlife and more importantly how? could there be any possibility that the murderer died in this very house later on? #postmortem
May have gotten some kids EVps is Shane maybe shaves that stache……… rule # 32 ghost hunting no mustaches allowed
It must have been so easy to get away with crimes in the olden times. Literally just don't be seen in the immediate area at the time of the crime and skip town for a little bit and you're golden.
#postmortem Hey Ryan, so scholars estimate around 100 billion humans have lived throughout history yet something like 99% ghosts are from the Victorian era. Do ghosts have an expiration date? why’s there no ghosts of Sir Galahad jamming it out on a lute?
This town Marshal sounds like Chief Wiggum “OK OK nothing to see here folks! Oh wow a plane crash, come on crowd around, let the kids see this!”
imagine sending ur kids over for a sleepover and they are murdered like this case, and the keddie cabin and I'm sure more
He voice sounded British sometimes, was defo reverend George Kelly….
Ghost:I have stab a dude and let him lay in his own blood  Shane:well Ryan it's a real free estate
"Except for the murderer... we do not want to party with you" thats an odd statement to make from someone who doesn't believe in ghosts
Ghost: "switch" maybe the other one will show me some respect...  Shane: f*** no  Ghost: ....
I think I watch this show for the wrong reasons. Shane is like the dream killer. I always want ghosts to be real but he basically proves that they most likely are not. I'm always like "Maybe this is the episode where something will finally happen?!!" Then we get to the end and I'm totally bummed out lol.
That Marshall blew it Lmfaoo
For postmortem, Shane saying he checks all the house rooms before going to sleep to make his girlfriend feel safe should've officially (and unfortunately) debunked the fact that Shane is actually a demon. Love the series btw.
What makes you think the killer's spirit has a CHOICE in staying there. Maybe he doesn't. It's interesting how he did answer you when you asked him if he was there.
#postmortem just wondering if any of you placed the doll back on the chair in the attic I might be wrong and forgot but I am wondering if any of you put it back on the chair.
#Postmortem: what's up with the torches. I've never seen torches turn off and on as much as they do on this show. Do they react the same way when just in use outside of the houses?
Atlast they are back
I've probably been watching too much Criminal Minds, but covering the faces of the victims suggests remorse and that the killer knew the victims. I'm suss on the dad's brother.
For #postmortem it seems the killer is talking most of the time everything the spirit box says seems like something the killer would say
Looking for the killer Hey Fucko  Holy crap 😂😆😂😆 I can't
Or maybe the slab of bacon was used as a cold compress
i like how this show essentially became taunting ghosts and putting them in their place
The fact that there's a theory that the murderer entered the house via hiding in the attic, reminds  me of the Hinterkaifeck murders, when the murderer had been living in the family's attic for months and then killed the Gruber family and their maid with a pickaxe. Extremely terrifying. I hope the victims are resting in peace. The murderer is a disgusting piece of filth.
9:25 - 9:30 this sums up the entirety of this show and all of its seasons XD truely a master piece.
The house didn't move like that over a hundred years ago.
What were you thinking. @ 25:52 Ryan says he was thinking something and then there is a cut, Now I will have sleepless nights until is hear the rest #PostMorten
The spelling of axe in this episode pisses me of so much 😭
for #postmortem what if the poor ghost was colorblind or couldn't see well because there wasn't enough light so they were turning random lights on and off hoping it was the right one?
My all time fav show ! 🤍 you both make add the delicious flavor to it
hows no one talking about 14:46
Shane's little breakdown over the Maglite thing was priceless. You can literally see his brain shut down and reboot as he realizes he is once again having to explain this lol
Why weren’t the cig. Buds or the food checked for DNA or fingerprints ?😳😳
for the #postmortem, have you heard the theory that the bacon was used by the killer to...*ahem*..."enjoy" himself? I heard it on a podcast recently, and thought it would be the kind of weird thing you guys would have mentioned. Y'know, killers be weird dudes.
Man Ryan would hate reading about what we say about ghosts in Islam
Jewish people believe that if you put a sheet on the mirror after someone dies the spirit can't hunt you or so you won't see them in the mirror.
I WANNA SEE U GUYS INVESTIGATE THE BURARI DEATHS PLZ
For the #postmortem hey Boys! Since this season's tagline is 'get ready to get wet' (thanks Shane), does that mean you will finally get to share a *working* jacuzzi tube? Or a hot tub?
#postmortem Good Day Ghoul boys, just wanted to ask if why did the town Marshall told the people to hold the axe until the national guards arrive? Would it make sense if the town Marshall were the one who killed the family? Lastly, why is there a BACON??
I wish this was a true crime episode! #postmortem #shaniac
I have been wanting them to go here since they started this show~~~~ yay
For post Mortem. Do you think this and the ax man of New Orleans are the same person?!
Dude the bed moving was really creepy. I'm wondering how was that possible? #postmortem
Finally.
For #postmortem what if the town marshal was big braining it and seeing the people react to the scene and swing the axe to see if anyone if them was the murderer
Unicorn are not real ghosts are..aaaaagh🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😅😅😅😅 BUT WHY BACON???
sounds like only the murderer is trapped there. we can hear his voice in every room.
“I do bring good vibes” Says the guy housing a demon in his rib cage
For post Mortom: Did anyone else see that the blue Mag light in the Girls room got nudged abit at around 10:50. It looked like it slipped off the edge of the dresser so that could have turned the light on. But it did twitch a little, like if you pushed it with your finger. For the record, Massive Shaniack. Just thought it looked strange, haha.
Man I hate those Amityville horror looking windows I'll never own or stay in a house with those style windows They creep me right the f*ck out 😁
after seeing the face of the clown doll move as shane was in the closet... and then ryan freaks out about the bed moving...  great job ryan,shane and company for leaving buzzfeed. #postwhat
Shane doesn't believe in ghost and demons but believes in Unicorns. 😂😂
Maybe when they said switch they meant switch places
I want a good “we outside” in this one
14:46 OH MY GOD. That is 100% a person whispering into the machine.
Guess to much hate cant post my question #postmortem I do watch, watcher... So whats the deal....
I loved this🥰🥰
Ryan: it felt like a ghost sat down on the bed also Ryan: sits down on top of the ghost right away
#Postmortem Have you ever felt sad about a place you’ve been to?
I'd say it's the Marshall.  Fingerprints were known about so getting dozens of people to handle the murder weapon would obscure his guilt.
*shane screaming like the demon he is caught me off guard but it was fracking hilarious lmaoo-* 😂
would you ever try to reach out to the ghost of c.c. tinsley to help you solve all these cases? i bet he'd get them all #postmortem
So... has this case ever solved? Or has ever came close to solved?
The bed really did move.. it was weird
Maybe he killed his family and then killed himself with the sharp part of the axe… just saying
sad they didn’t get to meet the cat 😞
they spelt ''Axe'' wrong on the sign 'AX'
Everyone from the midwest knows that Iowa stands for Idiots Out Walking Around
Wait.. why do they think the killer is a ghost in the house?
#postmortem question for Ryan: why existence of a horse with a horn is less believable to you than ghosts? Love watching you guys, stay safe ♥
That 👍:👎 ratio is wild (99.5%). And rightfully so.
I loved every minute. Ya know, what if they combined a ghost investigation with the Too Many Spirits format? 😆
Definitely was the sheriff, surely he'd know not to contaminate the murder weapon - so obviously he got everyone else to handle it to cover up his crime😜
I think the radio device is just picking up random FM frequencies and the so called magnetic torch might be responding to electrical cables, devices etc.
I've heard the bacon was used by the murderer to satisfy a sexual urge. Due to the way it was made into a particular "shape" and that it was wrapped in a towel.  I believe the murderer was attracted to the girls but due to his religious beliefs didn't violate the girls.  Wasn't there a traveling preacher who was a suspect?
Shane: "if you're the killer..." Ad: "This party is gonna get LIT"
spirit box session was so consistent at 18:50, a lot of the same answers, what’s that mean?!
Hey guys. Have you guys ever heard of the Jinn in Islam. I don't know if ghosts exist...but I know for sure the Jinn exists.  They reside in abandon homes mostly and I think those are your "ghosts". Please read about them in Islam. Some are harmless, some are harmful. I don't think Shane should be taunting them. Anyways sad to see this is the last season here. Love you guys. See you in Watcher.
c.c. tinsley would have solved this case even after all the meddling
shane reminds me of de niro for some reason.
👻👻👻
Love that Shane has finally become the Commissioner Gordon that we know from the comics this season.
For postmortem: When you asked if there was anything he would like to say to you, you heard "Help me" but it sounded more like "probably" to me. #shaniac
Welcome to Iowa bois
I have a theory that the person who murdered them had a compulsion that he couldn’t fight. He had to murder and he blamed himself and hated that he couldn’t fight it so covered up the mirrors so he wouldn’t see what he became and covered their faces as a sign of remorse. When he died he chose to haunt the house as retribution and punishment for his actions
(yeef)
Am I the only one who heard "let us in" instead of "what is it"
You know…all that sounds very much like the Hinterkaifeck murders.
Perhaps the murderer wasn’t sure whether the family owned a dog and he simply had the bacon with him in case the dog attacked. Just a thought
#postmortem it kind of sounds like they want to kill the murderer but they want to be stopped. Or that the murderer wasn’t in control of themself
The spirit box: jojkojpjpioupgyts Ryan: OMG he just sang Germany national anthem!!!
Marshall looks mighty suspicious letting people play with evidence
they guy sounds ill, like schizophrenia or OCD :( also the voice sounds the same in all the recordings
“Ohhh that’s a ghost thing” iconic
sometimes i thought that their aproach of getting to interact with the ghosts are wrong. rather than going there in the middle of the night adn waffling around, they should just come in at morning or just come as a normal family and see if anything happen without them trying to communicate with them. idk i think i have too much free time.
#postmortem Dear Ryan and Shane , can I know how many episodes are there for the last season, and can you pls go to the Chris Benoit murder house, people caught evps there that was crystal clear. Pls, it can answer a lot of questions to the families and friends involved.
Idk what it is about this episode but it made me feel sick to my stomach and creeped out the entire time. Obviously what happened to the family was horrendous and disgusting (hence the obvious discomfort) but just watching the boys roam the house made me feel an uncanny sacredness that I’d never felt watching an episode before. It truly feels like you were talking to the murderer through the spirit box, there seemed to be so many other voices too. How did this house actually feel guys? Did any of you or the crew have arguments or bad mental states during or afterwards? #postmortem
If ghosts exist, there's one thing you can say about them for certain: they don't perform for ghost hunters. If you're afraid of ghosts, just set up cameras and EVP equipment everywhere. They'll leave you completely alone.
#postmortem why haven't you guys slept in the house? Was it not permitted by the caretaker after that 2014 murder?
bacon wrapped in a dish towel = pig in a blanket  : P
idea for your final episode: Stay two days and three nights in a demon infested house, to make sure you get the evidence you need
I love it!! I’m from Iowa and have always wished y’all would go here, thank you!!
Ryan's character arc has really shined this season. Handled that solo like a champ. #postmortem
When Shane was in the closet in the kids' bedroom I fully expected him to jump out screaming like the caretaker did
Enjoy these while we can Boys
#postmortem :Hey guys. Not a question but I just wanted to say, i've wanted to see you two cover this hose since the very beginning of supernatural, and I just wanna say thank you for the amazing series you two put up.
It would be fun to see Ryan’s face if Shane ran out of the house after being there alone pretending he really felt the presence of a ghost.
@postmortem: I'd just like to point out to the boys that upon hearing Ryan say "Or he missed breakfast" I almost spit out my coffee on my dad's 120 year old Persian rug. Greetings from Luxemburg
It’s the last season and theres no ghost. Where the believers at????
In 23:04 , It said " That was fun"  Not helpless
KEEP THE GOOD STUFF COMING!!!
The fact that no specific person/s is theorized to be the murderer, makes it more fascinating.
How are they NOT freaking out about the flashlights flickering!???!??!
I know things were different then, but if one of my neighbours was awake at 5am and banging on my door at 7am I'd be the axe murderer in this situation.
Can we talk about the amount of EVPS the ghoul bois caught in this episode!!!!
Shane coming out of the closet and having to duck down so low is funny to me.
I don't believe in ghosts or demons or whatever, but Ryan’s monologs to them during his solo bits are getting better and better! #postmortem #shaniac
the spooky boys are back
#roastmortem Shane giving off real Sheldon Cooper vibes, "I've never held this thing before, I don't enjoy it".  Good job, harrowing location.
Go to bobby mackys
9:26 Shane started releasing his demonic form that's why they cut his scream
im not my fear  im stronger than my fear  lmao
The "something one" sounded kinda like I am the one
Whoever transcribed "rsh rsh" as "release me", are they someone forced to listen to the spirit box sessions enough times that they'll just take any sound to be a word? Because there have been some reaches before, but that took the goddamn princess cake. #postmortem
#postmortem it's super suspicious that the town marshal just let people handle the axe. Maybe he was the killer and wanted the axe to be covered in fingerprints?
For the postmortem: Since the town was so small it was probably someone who lived in it. So imagine them heading over with everyone else to see what happened and just watching everyone touch the evidence and just knowing they will never know it’s them and that they will never be caught.
This Illinois boy acting like they ain't only well known for the one city.
My god that town marshal is just annoying.
#postmortem this really sounds like a time traveling hit job.  maybe this family grew up to be very powerful in the future and harms innocent people  because it seems they knew about DNA and were able to swing all at once to kill all of them in bed at the same time without making noise?
Spelt axe wrong...
9:24 Ryan's arbitrary standards for "real" showing up again.
Keep your eyes on the top left window around 28:00. I know it's probably just trees in front of the window, but I'm still convinced something moved inside the house.
There was hardly any evidence in this video
Know what's Scarier then ghosts? Someone killing a family, Blaming a ghost and getting away with it.
this is probably the only good series buzzfeed ever made
When Shane says he doesn't believe in Ghost but he believes that Iowa is haunted...  huhhhh?
When Shane says he doesn't believe in Ghost but he believes that Iowa is haunted...  huhhhh?
What if the ghosts just want to talk about their ghostly day but everyone is just asking them about their death :( Also how likely is it that the killers ghost is in the house of their victims?  #Postmortem
not me hyped because Morbid the Podcast just covered this case and now u do too 😊
People split up cause of disagreeing and arguing? That’s the Ghoul Boys strength, along with some good natured mockery to lighten the mood.
Thank you for coming back. i missed you guys so much.
Ryan, in the words of Carl Sagan: "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence." Do you think you have found evidence that defies all other explanation?  #postmortem #shaniac  Edit: Wow I didn't mean for that to sound so mean. Changing the tone.
Mirrors being covered up is a Victorian death custom.
Will you ever have another fan art show case in the near future? :D #postmortem
Shane is so aggressive 😂
I think the killer waited in the attic and poison them with something, waited for it  to knock them out so they could not hear him hacked  the person next to them and the killer probably locked the door behind him when he left or they knew the person
The house looks kinda scary at night... maybe it's because of the lack of street lights, but honestly other than that it still looks cool to me. I adore cottage-style small houses like this, so to me this look comfortable af. Can't believe this could be haunted Imao
"What did u say?"  Ghost: "one" Ryan: one? Ghost: two Shane: well he's reading us the numbers.. Ghost: unintelligible Ghost: unintelligible.. Ryan: well I don't know what's he saying Ghost: five, six... Shane: pretty close to doing his daily lessons Ghost: seven..... Eight... *The door slams shut...* Someone please write a creepy pasta with it 😂
Wait...Ryan can't figure out how a house would be more creaky in 2021 than it was in 1912? Wow.
#postmortem...as an Iowan myself, we are haunted. That is all.
#postmortem As a Shaniac (sorry Ryan) still don't believe ghosts exsist HOWEVER the full on spirit box conversation you were having with the _ghost_ was great pretty cool and I think one of the most clear ones you've gotten yet. So I guess one point for the boogaras. (Shaniacs still quite in the lead)
No forced entry- they knew the person and owned the door for them...possibly letting them stay in the attic for whatever reason. Everyone goes to sleep. The deed gets done. The Marshall let's people handle the murder weapon and walk through the crime scene.  Did the family let him in and stay? Did he kill them and that's why he allowed the public to contaminate evidence?  I'm also high so these questions might not make a whole lot sense lmao
The spiritbox said... IM THE ONE! They were talking to the murderer not the victims. #postmortem
Really gonna miss you guys! And also for anyone who doesn't know, Shane and Ryan have created their own channel with Steven Lim! It's called the "Watcher" where they create loads of new content :) #postmortem
(yeef)
Shane is impossible!!!!! 👻🤣🤣
Maybe the killer drugged the family before he killed them🤷 that’s why no one woke up
the covering of the faces and the mirror is the killer showing shame/guilt about the killings suggesting they knew the victims. and the mishandling of the crime scene suggests dirty cops. town marshall? #postmortem
One of my absolute favourite horror movies is based on the murders that took place in this house, this was an amazing investigation and I am sad to see the boys go but I am excited to see what they do with the watcher and will be continuing to watch the buzzfeed spooky channel uploads
#postmortem I'm really surprised I hadn't heard about this case earlier! It seems like there are no substantial clues even though the whole thing happened in the confines of such a small house. Really surprising how no one heard the murders happening or even saw a bloodied man walking out of the house at night.
I am going to miss this A LOT
#postmortem is it possible that the murderer had drugged their food at some point which caused them to go into a deep sleep so he could kill all of them without them waking up?
#PostMortem whilst I am 100% Team Ryan #Boogara I do love and appreciate Shane as well! But I do believe in ghost!!!
What a treat after the morbid podcasts about this very case. Noice!
From what was said on the box “stop it, stop me, help me, helpless, I’m miserable” if that was the killer it could be a case of the person feeling compelled to kill by voices or “demons” rather than malice
to me, it is the scariest episode ever
gosh i hate the spirit box
The only reason we don't see much is because Shane exists. The spirits see the devil in him
Wait so after this season what do we do? Like r u guys making a new show?
You know what, I bet that ghost was color blind.
Wish they would go to the haunted hotel in Copenhagen
For #postmortem what goes into booking locations for shooting? Is it hard getting places to let randos from the internet investigate their locales? #shaniac
#postmortem yo why wouldn't you guys do ghost hunting in Asia maybe they are more willing to show themselves and (have shane question himself with his beliefs of being a #shaniac ) since its the last season you should choose an Asian country to ghost hunt, there is a specific spot i can choose is which is the Villa Nabila in Johor Baru, Malaysia
#postmortem back in de days, when someone died in a household people would hang sheets over the mirrors during the mourning period . This was so the ghost of the deceased could find it's way to heaven and didn't get sucked in the spirit world.
covering up mirror's is a Victorian thing about souls being sucked in..
It's really creepy how much time the killer took into ceremonially covering mirrors and faces, how they managed to kill all those people without anyone waking up. I have a very strong feeling that they were very close to the family, like a friend, neighbor, or most likely a relative/family member even one who lived there. Hell, even the brother who came so quickly and managed to walk past several rooms before finding the girls upstairs sounds pretty sus. I wonder if he changed anything or moved anything in the crime scene. He could have even discovered the ax in the hands of one of the family members, since it came from one of the house, the killer was inside and didn't break in, and they likely wouldn't leave the ax  behind if they didn't want to get caught. All he would've had to do was move the ax from their hands to the room it was found in. It could've been one of the sons trying to wipe out the family and then turning the ax on themselves.  Regardless of theories, God I wonder what it was all for, killing off an entire bloodline.
Those investigators described the killer as an evil ‘giddy’ psychopath, but your interactions with him make it seem like he was somewhat remorseful or lacking understanding for what he did?
could someone please get Ryan something to make him looker even nerdier than every Iowan ever born. Sarcasm for you out of staters and someone explain sarcasm to Shawn plaes..
This case would be great for true crime too
23:04 sounds like "help us all" #postmortem
Why would the killer be haunting the house?
Love that i listened to the morbid ladies cover this yesterday and I get to see the ghoul brothers actually film there!!!
Damn son!!
May I axe you a few questions... XD
#postmortem I think it's highly likely that the victims were drugged or something so they didnt all wake up when others in the house or even the same bed were beaten to death. If the killer was waiting in the attic while the family & friends were at church, he could have slipped something in to the food in the kitchen guessing that they would have a snack or a drink when they got back. Lena Stillinger might have had less of whatever was drugged, and so woke up from the noise of her sister being killed or someone entering their room but wasn't able to put up much of a defense. Another theory, the killer might have started with the Father as the head of the household using the blade of the axe, then tried the back when he saw the wife didn't wake up and thought that might be more "fun".
30:07 something like a face can be seen peeking behind Ryan. What is that?
What about the famous cousin of Josiah? Jonny B.Goode
“Fucko “ 😆😆😆😆😆
There's no way that the victims weren't drugged. Having so much force being applied to someone beside you - you'd definitely wake up
No no, Ryan. Everyone's favorite tool is Shane.
After the ghoul boys leave buzzfeed, buzzfeed is gonna go bankrupt
Finale Episode of the Ghoul Boys, Shane finally reveals he is a high level ranking demon
Do either of you believe that you rarely get evidence because of the short stays? even in your stories it takes sometimes years for the ghost or demon to start playing around.  #postmortem
I'm really gonna miss this. But I'm also glad they are doing their own thing now and enjoying it.
Just something interesting on the covered mirrors, in Ireland when someone dies we have a ‘wake’ before the funeral which happens in the house of the person usually , and the mirrors in the house get covered as a superstition/ tradition coming from a fear that if the persons body gets reflected in the mirror , their soul won’t be able to move on to heaven (or some variation of that reasoning) not sure what religion is dominant in that area but might be something if Christianity/Catholicism is dominant
For ryan: I dont believe in ghosts, but you handled that solo mission like a champ. Also, why did you gloss over how the man who was stabbed said he was alone when Houser said he checked in with his two elderly parents? #Postmortem
17:30 this episode kinda spook me out especially this part-
I live in Iowa and since trump I'm still waiting for intelligent answers
For postmordem. Could the killer have gotten in through the storm doors? Or are the doors newer then 1912? #Boogra
When the spirit said "switch" I think he wanted you two to change seats.
I thought you guys were done searching ghosts this season XD
#postmortem I don't have a question, but I just wanted to say thank you to both Ryan and Shane for all the amazing seasons of Unsolved, that you have blessed us with. It was one of the best paranormal investigation show ever and we will miss it dearly. Thank you!
#postmortem I’m just waiting for the day where Ryan is counting to turn off the spirit box and the ghost joining in and going “zero “
no sir
Covering the faces as well as the mirrors could have been done by the people coming into the crime scene before it was secured. Covering the brutalized faces of the victims makes total sense. It is also an old superstition that souls can get trapped in mirrors after death so they would cover mirrors in the house of the deceased after they died to prevent this from happening.
Its baffling how the house's interior has been preserved for more than a 100 years
they did it for Bacon, the rout of all killings..
You guys should go to the Haunted Old South Pittsburg Hospital in Tennessee! I went down there in November of last year with my dads ghost hunting group and it was really spooky.   I felt heavy walking on some floors, and fear was running through me. Also one room the lady loved dolls so she got mad when we wouldn’t keep the dolls in there. Lots of thing would move and lots of areas would just be straight up weird vibes.   I would love to see Ryan and Shane try to speak with some spirits in the hospital
I have been waiting for them to do a true crime episode on this because it is an unsolved murder.
shane: *lying down on the floor of a haunted house* its actually really calming
#Postmortem since we all gonna miss this show, can you guys visit town that have cryptid thingy like the mothman episode? maybe y'all wanna see the famous fresno nightcrawler. and oh boi, shane gonna love that one
Best one yet
during the investigation. Did they check the people that live in Il.? I bet it was those scallywags..
That wasn't 'help me' at 19.28 that was 'gobble', I am now convinced there is a turkey 🦃 haunting that house.
I really want to know that is the spirit box really caches real ghost voice or its just a fake or something like that #postmortem
#postmortem : do you guys think it’s possible that ghosts are stuck in a kind of death loop which is why they don’t respond to very specific questions or interact in response to what you say
Are we not gonna talk about the very clear voice saying “what is it?”
9:29 THAT ROAR WAS GENUINE I COULD FEEL HIS FRUSTRATION AND I BELIEVE IN GHOSTS LMAOOOO
Shane, when there are no ghosts in a room: I do bring good vibes!  I mean sorry to burst your bubble but they are probably terrified of you honey.
Every episode of unsolved supernatural just provides more and more proof to the theory that Shane is indeed the demon protecting his lil friend Ryan..............
just the average Iowa Family home...
Ryan usually walks into every place likes he’s walking into AHS murder house, but when he actually goes to a murder house he doesn’t * seem * scared.
They should investigate St Albans Sanatorium in Radford Virginia.
It sounded like it said “police man” rather then “release me” which would make sense why the authorities allowed people to walk through and touch everything, ruining the evidence ???
you think that's scary come to my house.. and we eat people from Il. mostly women
Now that I'm done watching this episode.. I can't wait for the next episode
love ryan's little affirmations.
I'm ready for another spooky episode!
Cassette tapes and a rotary phone!!🙂
Ryan what did you hear in the parents room? Also that audio recording has to be the clearest one you’ve ever had, it actually sounds like a voice. Love you guys and the show!
For #postmortem Do you believe whatever the spirit box says is actually the spirit communicating to both of you? And if not how do you explain the voices coming from it answering whatever you asked the ghost or spirit? #boogara
What murder scenes from our time do you think are gonna be made into attraction sights?
Ngl this had some pretty solid stuff
Iowa is a scary place, the midwest I wars continue on
oh my god the "what is it" at 14:46 is one if the clearest disembodied voices I've ever heard on this show. that was spooky.
#postmotem is it just me or is Shane crazy
Hello!! #postmortem which places scared you guys the most?
i really wished they went to amityville
#postmortem I'm thinking the murderer's spirit or soul was tied to the house since he killed 8 people all in one night. So, it doesn't matter where he was when he died because he basically tethered himself to the house.
Listen now I’m scared. I’ve never seen Shane screem with that amount of anger. Yup not the Ax murders scare me, it’s Shane’s genuine screem cx
A group of people killed with their own axe by an unknown murderer? Guess someone didn't jazz it.. #postmortem
Does anyone ever think that during the flashlight test the ghosts are saying "DUDE! YOUR LEFT, OR MY LEFT!?!?"
18:10 Imagine Ryan left Shane at that closet door.  Then Shane surprises the demons as he kick to exit the closet door.
Putty wasn’t invented until 1943. How could the killer describe manipulation as something he shouldn’t have knowledge of?
Hopefully this gets on the buzzfeeds post mortem. But what if the bacon wrapped in the towel represents the victims like the towel being the bed cover and the bacon is them! Like a sick mind game, also I wonder if the victims where seduced in any way from someone who can actually get into the house and tamper with food or drinks before the crime? #Postmortem #Shaniac
Shane’s frustration is the most entertaining thing I’ve seen in a long time. Happy this is the last season, Shane? 😂
Shane why does all the corn in Iowa lean east?     Because Illinois sucks
I wish there were more season ur videos are amazing
#postmortem You two changed a lot throughout the whole run of buzzfeed unsolved supernatural. The main goal was of course to prove ghosts are real, but was Shane's side goal to become that one uncle who is really cool but drinks a little too much on Christmas and gets you only off brand Legos from gas stations as gifts? Cus if it was then good job, you did it #boogarawithashaniacattitude
It’s strangely elegant the way Shane said “ I’ll go in there “ at 17:13
Why do i get the feeling that a demon will appear to Ryan and scare him to avenge the professor
So I live in Iowa and have been here. I must say that when I went it was terribly boring and I was even told there wasn’t much activity in the house.
I like how Ryan grew more confident over the seasons.
I wish we have the same esper from the Hannah Williams episode. Maybe he’d pick up some conversations or ghostly memories of when the murder was happening.
12:15 lol, what if the town marshal did it and let people contaminate the scene
What's bad is how unprofessional they act
Shane to the murderer: "we do not wanna party with you" The murderer:  👁️👄👁️ #postmortem
(Yeef)
" I'm in the closet " "you can come out now" out for context, those lines are very funny
this is the most compelling i've ever seen and believed
From Minnesota here and I agree with Shane's statement on Iowa.
When the ghost said switch, that’s it i got me proof shane is the king of hell!
The spirit box said, "I don't want to." When you asked if they could tell you something about the killer.
Postmortem  can we all agree that Nebraska is the worst midwest state
That damned mannequin in 8:56 made me jump hahahahhahaha
:) yay
"you do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe" -shane. we stan this man
You should really use voice canceling headphones for the spirit box
Hahahaha, nothing AGAIN 😂
#postmortem 19:55 “i saw one” was what i heard. maybe it was multiple people? I don’t know if there is any evidence proving not.
can the next t-shirt be just Shane’s good lookin’ face and it says above it “Shane Madej…he brings good vibes” ? I’d buy that now!
Aren't we gonna speak about how they've never had such clear recordings?
Could they have been drugged or something? Like how to you kill 4 people in the same room without any of them waking up? Or 8 in one house?
i thought they were done with the series. did they change their minds?
The Morbid podcast is doing more of a deep dive on this case if you want to learn more!
I'M SO VULNERABLE RIGHT NOW... 😅
“Fucko”  - Shane
Bacon ghost 👻
why are they calling out to the spirit of the murderer too?why he/she will be there?
“Unintelligible”  “Unintelligible”...but slower!
Maybe the killer brought bacon in case they had a dog, to distract it
this would be a really good true crime episode there are so many theories about who did it. for #postmortem who do you guys think did it?
To me the killer was calling himself the mad butcher with the bacon lying on the ground that is what I got from that
for #postmortem: how come yall talked to the ghosts like the murderer is one of them? Didn’t he leave the house alive because of the breakfast and bloodied footprints the morning after?
18:50 yondu lmfao merle.... 💀
Post Mortem question - do you think it could have been a whole city doing? With the mayor being the murderer then letting the towns people get rid of any evidence, he may have also had a key to the house!
They should of brought some bacon to really egg on the ghost's 🤙😈
new (wheeze): (yeef)
For postmortem- is there going to be a continuation of this series/type of this content on your watcher channel? If so then I lv u guyz
You both HAVE to be best friends with Ash and Alaina from the podcast Morbid.
You guys should wear those pulse tracker things when you do ghost hunts
3:48 if I just give a little..,,, stomps as hard as he can
The spirit box makes Shane wanna put an axe to his head
#postmortem The deaths seemed very ritualistic, it seems unlikely that a killer could sneak around, and nobody heard any screams? I think it's very likely that the killer's ghost is still at the house.
It was the Axe Man.
17:53 I thought something was moving under the bed or sounded like that. 😅 This episode reminded me of the eerie vibes of the Keddie Cabin investigation like... an intense sense of dread...and feeling trapped. The mirrors being covered is really creepy. If that guy removed the veil in order to provoke the 'house' - he could've psyched himself out and then stabbed himself.
do they know that sheets over mirrors is very much a superstition  from olden times - when a death takes place in the home, the mirrors are covered and a window is opened because people believed that ghosts could get trapped in the mirrors, like they would get lost on their way to the after life hence the mirrors were covered and a window opened so the spirit of the deceased could safely leave.
For #Postmortem is there is any possible way to make you guys continue the series? love from Indonesia <3
I don't think the "what is it" was the killer, it sounded like a woman's voice whispering. Maybe the parents woke up and heard something and that's the wife? Idk. But the "hard to stop" sounded like a man with a bit of a country drawl.
I honestly feel that the the town marshal who let the public inside the home is responsible. That should have been the primary suspect.
Is this the compelling evidence that Ryan talked about? 😭 I used to believe in ghosts until I started watching the ghoul boys
10:10 imagine if the ghost was colour blind and was getting pissed at Shane telling them they can’t follow instructions
What if the town marshal was the killer? Why else would he allow people to contaminate the crime scene and hold the murder weapon?
ok i'm only at 5:48 and the slab of bacon in a towel makes me think that maybe someone had drugged the family with the bacon for dinner? could explain why (almost) nobody woke up. the killer might have been trying to remove the evidence but was interrupted.
#postmortem  Do u think the murderer intentionally chose to murder the family when the stillingers were there, so tht he would have more victims? #shaniac
One man cannot quietly kill eight people in the same house in their sleep with an ax without waking at least one of them. It's much more plausible that he had at least one accomplice. This also had to be a crime of passion, since it was done with an ax, no money was taken and there were no other attacks. Gonna miss seeing these guys hunting ghosts and solving crimes <33 #postmortem
I think it was the Town Marshall. Sure maybe he wasn’t worried about DNA or stuff like that because those methods weren’t developed yet but maybe he could’ve accidentally left things/ evidence and just to make sure it is efficiently discredited or destroyed he let everybody in the house and compromised the crime scene.
Lol Iowan here-   I’d like to just point out that this video proves that there IS indeed more to do here than just pick corn for fun…😂😂😂😂😂.  Also Shane stop being salty AF LOL the only people we despise are the Nebraska cornhuskers, so enough with the garbage gutter Midwest alpha trash-talk 😬
I felt Shane's scream of frustration because I wanted to do the same thing hahaha
I can't help but hear "kirk to spock" where they heard "had to stop"
#PostMortem In what ways would you prefer, or not, this house over The Conjuring House? Great Episode. Love You Guys, since 2017.
Ryan - I’m the scariest ghost Hunter around Ryan’s face - 😳😟
#Postmortem what is the difference between your investigation now Villisca Axe Murder and The Axe Man of New Orleans, is it possible that the same man is responsible? Mabuhay Ryan and Shane from The Philippines. 😁
Bruh when the box said stop me I put my leg up from hanging on my bed LOL 😂
The Devil himself wouldn't dare to mess with Shane.
Question, Ryan were you afraid that the house would make Shane’s mental state worsen, yes I said worsen, and you would be in danger? I always feel like you place your fear in the wrong direction.
As an Iowan, can confirm hitch hiker ghosts
Bring back the buzzfeed unsolved murder cases
Why does this ep remind me of a irl phasmophobia
9:30 my mental health representation.
Why is this guy apparently talking about putty when it was invented 33 years after the murder took place...
The guy who stabbed himself just needed psychiatric help. #Shaniac #postmortem
can u do a Q A about this house
#portmortem What if the entire town were all in on the murder?
#postmortem would shane start believing in ghost if he got the chance to haunt Ryan after he dies?
Yall made us look forward to Fridays thanks for the memories
As someone who lives in Iowa, I totally get what you're saying and it is haunted but at least stop at a Casey's for some real good pizza.  Also I've been to the axe murder house and it does have a certain dread feeling to it.
Mirrors are considered as a portal to another dimension. I think the killer is preventing them from traveling to that dimension, thus trapping their souls in the house wandering around, while covering their faces is a sign of remorse which means that the killer is probably someone who knows the victims.
Hey Shane, here's some science for ya: there is energy in sound, and much like all heavenly bodies that pulse and display these sound waves throughout the Universe, so do people when they shake their heads and scream.  Now who is to say that the afterlife isn't just an extension of each and every human beings' capacity to hold onto their souls of pure energy and attempt to be heard by us, much the same how they may be thinking on the other side that we are the real ghosts and not them?  Try to consider these things for yourself so you don't end up popping a gasket between those ears brother.
Ghost 1 I’ll kill him Ghost 2 stop it Ghost 1 stop me There basically flirting
Ryan: Why did you do what you did here? Ax murderer ghost: Peepee :)
#postmortem From the earlier comment about Ghost hitchhikers, have either of you had any creepy experiences while traveling to haunted locations?
#postmortem: Ryan bow did it feel when the bed moved!? By the way the stuff you guys caught was crazy! #boogara
Never heard anyone say Iowa is on their bucket list
Okay but like I hate the fact that the investigations and the show in general kinda really affected Ryan's mental health in general. But ykw? Ryan's overcoming his fears and being so fuckin brave and we're all really proud of him !
Genuinely curious, but why would the murderer be in that house? Was he killed in there too? I thought ghosts only haunt where they died or were buried? I don't understand why the murderer would haunt that house.  Even Shane questions it 🤣
why would the killer return to the house tho unless they died there?
Ngl I was half expecting that doll in the chair behind Ryan at the end to just pounce on him
I’ve been asking for this for years and they finally do it! 😭😭
Bacon wrapped in a towel.. Is this the origin story of the phrase "pigs in a blanket"? Ha
Ok but why would anyone bring the old parents into a haunted murder case house 🤨
Shaniac here : Keep doing the lord’s work my friend.
What if the whole town was a part of this, like a cult or something
#postmortem. Mr. Shane! have you ever encountered anything that's made you question whether you may be wrong? I'm going to miss this, so I hope you plan on carrying supernatural on Watcher! Maybe the town Marshall did the killing or knew who did and that's why he let all those people handle the axe.. If the father was the only one to feel the sharp end of the axe and everyone else was bludgeoned, how did the daughter end up with the cut on her arm?
Villisca Axeman is what New Orleans Axeman WISHES he was
im both a shaniac and a boogara, so every episode is a win for me
#PostMortem Probably not the only one who wants to know this. Will the ghoul boys travel to asian countries for the ongoing investigation of "are ghosts real?"
I had the closet door in the kids room open when I visited
Y’all came to Iowa and didn’t even tell me
the way that shane glimps for a sec and screams "unicorn exe isnt real"
Question: Is this really the last season of the ghoul boy? WHHYYY?  But still this is the best Ghost Busting show ever, other show just fake it up or add stuff for the sake of it but y'all don't. Even though I have experienced creepy stuff and might had seen one, I still sometimes don't believe it lol..   #postmortem #shaniac #boogara
for postmortem: i don't understand why there are SO many dolls in the house. i mean, they're there even in the parents' room and attic. were they put there by other people for the spooky effect? #boogara
Why did this series has to end? WHY
How do the flashlights turn on and off anyway
#postmortem Victorians would close curtains and cover mirrors after a person died to prevent their spirit from getting trapped in the reflection. There’s also a belief that spirits exit the body from the mouth, so sometimes people cover their faces. I think the murderer was superstitious and even after brutally murdering the family still felt the need to respect their spirits. If there were any suspects, it might’ve helped to indicate who the murderer was. #boogaras
shane hoof prints: arguing with my girlfriend
Why do I feel like there are no ghosts of the victims but the ghost of the killer is the only one there
So…that story is basically old-school Amytiville but with an axe instead of a rifle.
#postmortem out of all the haunted places you guys have gone to , which one does Shane thinks is the most posible to be ' haunted' , and for Ryan which place do you think ' yeah there is no ghost here '
Will you bring back the Ovilus!? #Boogara #AimtobeaShaniac #BlessedThereBeNoHotdaga
“I don’t believe in ghosts but I do believe that Iowa is haunted.” spoken like a true son of Illinois, bless u Shane u doing Chicago proud.
Im from Iowa and ive only heard people pronounce it Valaska lmao
I just don't understand why the murderer would be the one to haunt the house and not the family that was killed there ??
I love the titanic references in the news articles these people really know there facts
life will never be fulltastic again after this final season....sigh
I love this series sad to see you guys go, Shane cracks me up, but I hope you end the series with Shane witnessing something that changes his mind
You guys still work for Buzzfeed? I thought you started your own thing.
for the #postmortem is it possible that the person the murderer intended to kill was Josiah Moore and the others just happened to be there when the murder took place? Considering the fact that Josiah was killed with the sharp edge while the others were bludgeoned.
What if it was the sheriff, and by letting the people destroy all the evidence he got away with it, or maybe he was covering up for the murderer, OR maybe the killer slipped something into the family's dinner the night of. I realize none of these theories fit well (more like at all), but the drugging of the family would explain a lot, and also I really got nothing else. Ryan, Shane...I genuinely will miss this series, all Ryan is right about everything
Maybe the town marshall did the murder He let evryone use the axe because he knew it would contaminate it and wouldn’t be able to find the prints
😂 I live 20 minutes from villisca; i would have enjoyed being able to say hi to you guys
When the spirit said "switch ..." I think he meant "switch this f machine off" lol
"When you hear hoof beats; think horses, not zebras." -some doctor, long ago
for #postmortem. Is it possible that the Town Marshall is an accomplice? no? oh? okay..   The Town Marshall was kinda sus because he lets the people touch the murder weapon   btw keep up te good work and for spooking me. (Ｔ▽Ｔ)
"Hey fucko" I'm crying lmfao
Before I begin to watch this video I want to let you know that I’ve been praying and hoping for you guys to do this! I’m from Iowa myself and traveled to the axe murder house years ago and had some spooky things happen to me there. I hope in this video you guys find the same!!! Keep on spookin
Man...the fact that he killed most of the victims with the BLUNT end of the axe just adds another layer of horrificness to what happened....
i only just listened to this case on morbid 2 days ago :o
#PostMortem Do you think that the killer used some type of sleeping pill to make their victims fall into a deep sleep that's why nobody woken up when the murder took place? and waited for it to become midnight so it could be much more settling for him/her to do the act?
Being that this is the final season. Can one of the "ghouls" finally give Shane a real good scare and change him to a believer!?!? Or just give him a good scare. That would be a great ending to all of the seasons😄
I assume when your contracts are up you'll do something similiar on watcher? The ghoul boys can't end yet . it would simply be a shame.
it would be freaky if the spirit box turned on on its own
#postmortem: so you're telling me that there's a chance Shane doesn't enjoy the classic 1945 musical film "State Fair" because he doesn't like Iowa??? Sad.
Does anyone automatically reduce the volume when Ryan brings the spirt box up??😂😂
#Postmortem I gotta say, even though I'm not much of a believer in ghosts, this is definitely one of those episodes that I'd count as a win for the Boogaras. There's something really eerie in the way the spirit box comments were all so consistent, almost as if the killer was unable to stop themselves and really guilty about it. It would definitely line up with why the mirrors were covered up and the window curtains were drawn, like they were ashamed of themselves. Maybe that's why they would linger in the house, even though it's unlikely they had died there themselves.
I dont want BUN supernatural to ever end . I enjoy it a lot 😭
God- this story just makes me really sad. Those poor kids.
Please tell me I’m not the only one that has gone back to watch the previous seasons
For the postmortem: why don’t y’all turn on the lights in any of these houses? I feel like the flashlights are unnecessary…
"You do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe." Terrible ghost hunter, best boyfriend 10/10
My color blind self doing the flashlights: “could y’all gimme a hint as to which one is which?” 😂
Why aren’t we all talking about the fact this the last season each episode I feel a sense of dread and sadness please continue you this on your guy’s channel
I don't get the logic that somehow the ghost of the murderer would be there.
Y'know, the "profile" of this killer kinda reminds me of Billy from the original Black Christmas movie
Shane talks to the spirit of the murderer like a juvie center volunteer talking to an angry teen .
I think maybe it was the Marshall who committed the murders and that was why he let everyone into the house, so he could cover his tracks
#postmortem question for the big guy// which is your worst nightmare: living in iowa for the rest of your life or listening to the spiritbox for 1hour every day?
Housekeeper- "I'm gonna prank this guy good" *ghost walks in  Housekeeper- "BOO!!!! Wait what?" Ghost- "Can't out prank a spooky boi"
This is my state! We learned about in class
Lmao Shane. “You look like a little king in here!”
the fact that the spirit box stopped speaking as soon as Shane took hold of it, is proof that Shane is a demon feared by spirits
Omg, I literally said earlier today I wished you guys would do an episode on this place!!! Love you guys!
#Postmortem how did you come up with the "brilliant" idea to dress up as cats in the last episode, but couldn't think of bringing bacon to your seance on this one?
The town marshall did it. He let the crime scene be contaminated on purpose.
When True Crime meets Supernatural :)
The time is 11:11
For #postmortem about the time stamp 14:40 you say the audio recorder picked up someone saying "what is it" but you did not specify that it wasn't a crew member. It sounds like it was just that.
#forthepostmortem i wantricky goldsworth to go on an investigation
(yeef)
i went there. my cousins live 30 min away:)
The season finale will be the place where Ryan summoned Shane from the underworld 😂
The Axe Murderer. Lizzie Boden. Ax Murder House. The holy trinity!
the doll behind ryan‘s head at 32:00 is unsettling
This was a disappointing episode
In the kindest, non-creepiest way, Ryan is really looking built! Just look at those arms! Wow! Nice job, Ryan!! ^ ^ #PostMortem #Boogara
maybe the cloth placed on their faces had smth on it to knock out the family. thats why they didnt make any sound bc they were unconcious. so no one woke up
Never thought you guys would come to iowa
hey guys umm I was wondering how come you didnt ask the ghost killer why did they leave the bacon? thats the real question , not the flash light thing lol
#postmortem nice
#postmortem seems like a demon house to me. Ryan other than the holy water guns, what do you do to shake off the bad juju from these places?
#postmortem what after this series? What will you do?
#postmortem why did you do what you did here
Maybe the ghost are colorblind? Lol
#PostMortem The fact that the spirit box said "Eight" in the attic (or killer's room) is quite spooky considering he killed eight people that night.
Morbid x Unsolved fans got a double serving of this case
As an Iowan and a Shaniac I am now very torn.
As a person from Iowa I can tell you right now Shane  None of us care about Illinois we’re to busy bullying Nebraska.
DAMN!!! BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!
loved ittttt
This case reminds me a lot of the Keddie Cabin episode. A scenario with a whole family and the children's friends staying over - and the victims all taken out at once with with no witnesses in an extremely small community. Likely done by someone who was from the town.
“Maybe you bring the good vibes-?”  “I do bring good vibes :D”
This is single-handedly the only show keeping buzzfeed alive
Didn't they already cover this family's murder on Buzzfeed Unsolved?
Only a minute and a half into this video you can see just how much time they've spent together. Breaks my heart thinking this is the last season.
For postmortem: I hope you will have international unsolved supernatural episode or season 👍
postmortem: Isn’t there a tradition where you cover the mirror during a wake/funeral? After looking it up, The tradition varies from not wanting the person’s soul to escape this reality to not wanting to focus on your appearance when you should be mourning. So honestly, it could be the killer wanted their souls to never pass on. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Morbid podcast and BUN are in sync and I love
21:57 The name Ryan actually means Little King
I just know that zac bagans is envious of you guys and how rad and real your evidence/ show is.
the mirror thing; what about old timey grieving rituals? they would cover mirrors during wakes because they could trap the souls departing the bodies, if i remember correctly. what if the guy was superstitious, didn't want the souls sticking around to rat him out? or he didn't want them trapped and did, in fact, want them to move on
#postmortem I agree with Shane how on earth nobody else wake up looking at the house it's too small and made out of wood... Know what I've been thinking the killer used sleeping gas or something that the victims are in deep sleep. Anyway Boogara from the Philippines! Love your show guys keep it up!
25:54 what the hell is behind Shane #postmortem
This case is really similar to the Hinterkaifeck farm case
I remember I was told that when someone past they would cover the mirror and open the window so the spirit can leave in peace could he have wanted to trap them.could he have none them ant that’s why he was tried to make it fast and did want to see what he did when he looked away
I'm so happy they were here!  I live pretty close by and toured this house.  It's pretty eerie if I do say so myself.
Part of me wonders if it was one of the family members/ the dad who did it. Usually it's family to do such gruesome crimes. Might explain why the dad was the only one to take the sharp part to the head. Also maybe an indication of the self inflicted stabbing in 2014. How does somebody go room to room wacking people and nobody is even stirred out of their beds?
Ryan Bergara? Psh, More like Ryan boo-scared-ya! Ha! Roasted  Get it... Cuz he believes in ghosts... And is scared sometimes.   -me someone who has sleep paralysis and is terrified of ghosts. Haha love ya Ryan
For #postmortem, I agree that the bacon is in reference to some dispute. But it was put in the Stillinger girls' room? Is it possible they were the main targets of the murderer and the family was (excessive) collateral? By the way, great hair 10/10
how was your vacation Shane ? #PostMortem
Punching air lol
Shane’s right. Illinois is vastly superior to IoWa. The turf war continues.
It makes me so happy to see these episodes but then I get sad it's gonna be the last season.
#POSTMORTEM  These words on the spirit box  " I'll kill him "  "stop me"  "Help me "  Just makes me think what if the same murder scenes keep on repeating themselves again and again in the house . Just like a recapitulation . What if the ghost of the murderer keeps haunting the spirits of the victims ?
I claim no negative energy from this video in the name of Jesus
I bet the killer brought bacon because they were gonna cook breakfast after the murder #postmortem
THE "WHAT IS IT" WAS SO CLEAR EW EW EW
#postmortem: okay...Last season...But  is this the end  of the  Ghoul Boys? Is there any chance of  seeing you guys hunting ghosts somewhere else?
I totally knew theyd visit  this i mean how could they not
omg I wanted you guys to do this one since this series started!!
Some believe that if someone passes away in a room with a mirror their spirit can get trapped inside so when someone passes in a room as such they cover the mirror to try to prevent that. So the killer did this make sure they did not have a chance to "haunt the place" I'm assuming he figured using cloth other their faces and windows is another way of helping them "move on" if I make any sense to others.😂
Im convinced that shane is a demon and is just warding off any ghosts. That's why there's not a lot of evidence
Post Mortem: Ryan, how much would you give to prove to Shane and all the other non-believers that ghosts are real? #shaniac #bringbackthehotdaga
#postmortem The question is why did the murderer choose to haunt THIS house in particular after they died? Sounds like the hauntings started a couple years after which could probably indicate that it only became haunted when the murderer died. Geez. Out of all of the places he could've chosen to spend his afterlife.
the spiritbox was actually terrifying in this episode
Yep, this house is definitely haunted
Ima just say it i think it was the marshal
The Axe man has returned!
I'm confused....shouldn't this be a Unsolved True Crime?
For #postmortem, Hey Shane and Ryan! I know you both have long-term significant others (which I adore btw), I was wondering, do they believe in ghosts, or no?
watching this at 12 am will i regret this
I am that kinda person who watch Shane and feels ehhh, I am strong, ghost doesn't exist and then f*****ng  cry if I have to go to a dark room and turn on the lights if nobody is there at home.. even Ryan is stronger than me What is wrong with me 😓
For #postmortem, from the voices heard from the spirit box, it kind of seemed like the ghost of the murderer was regretful? or even somehow like it was not his fault? Perhaps, he himself was possessed by a demon that made him commit the murders? The "couldn't stop" and "I'm miserable" were very interesting to hear!
9:24 for the exact moment what was left of Shane's soul left his body 😂
before i go any further in this video: the bacon thing is literally a pig in a blanket. people call cops pigs, children are supposed to be swaddled in blankets, this was found in those 2 children's rooms as opposed to the parents or any of their kids. i feel like there's something there
ryan counting down while circulating the camera around his face had me wheezing
As an Iowan I will tell you Shane is 1000% right about all of Iowa being haunted.  All of Iowa is a massive portal to hell.
Okay hear me out.. the town marshall let people contaminate the scene and evidence.. why? To cover up for someone.. another cop maybe or even himself?.. and that's why the bacon was there.. cuz ppl say cops are pigs.. maybe some one in that family(the father perhaps or mom I guess) had some beef with him and called him a pig.. orrr someone left it there thinking it would throw people off somehow..
the "i'll kill him" "stop me" and then "help me." gives me chills.
Shane: " this is the last season of unsolved supernatural"  Demons *whispering to each other * - thank god he's gone .  Shane : but we'll come with something interesting on Watcher  Demons : f***
21:52 he moves the doll  32:23 did they put the doll back on the chair?
Shane being from Illinois explains a lot…
Sidenote, how do ppl think unicorns not exist? Like have you even seen a Giraffe? If thats possible i dont think its impossible for a horse to have a horn.
For people interested in this case, you should read The Man On The Train. It illustrates a theory that this crime was one in a large pattern of crimes that were very similar in a relatively close time frame. Great book - also says in the book the slab of bacon in the girls room was there as a masturbatory aide 🤮
4:26 nice typo buzzfeed
It's so creepy that ryan is sitting in front of a baby doll. Also, a new Are You Scared is released with this video! What a great day
I wonder why it was exactly 2 lbs. Of bacon.
Postmortem Question! Has anything followed one of you outside of these investigations? Like any creepy things at the air bnb/hotel or at your own homes? This is a great season so far! You guys are phantastic! #postmortem
It kills me every time Shane does something completely reckless for Ryan, like laying on the floor with his eyes closed, and then Ryan is horrified by just being there🤦😂
**wheeze**
Ryan - do you ever turn the spirit box on in your house or the office, basically a non-haunted place to see what it picks up? that would maybe help us see whether that thing is hooey or whether there's some legitimacy to it! #shaniac
"It's back."   Not more than a minute in, and already making me  LMAO!!!
Hells YEAH!   SHANE AND RYAN BOO-YA!!!!
#postmortem Something interesting is how the ghost of the murderer is described as manipulative and anytime he spoke during this video is seemed he was making it out as a mental issue or as if he was forced to in some way with things like "help me" "stop me" "I'm miserable" really goes to show what kind of person he was, or if he was telling the truth during this video and was a tormented soul. Guess that remains *unsolved*.
18:36 there was an orb or bug or dust above Shane's head and ik how Ryan feels about orbs but just something interesting I saw also it moves about the same time Shane's head moves so it could've very well been dust.
Very sad this was never on the True Crime series... out of all the murders to go unsolved this is the one I personally point to and say "I really wish I knew who did it and why" I dont know why that is for me but I just would like to know why.
"what is it" sounds like a woman's voice to me  gotta say, I think this is the spookiest episode they've done
#postmortem Bacon grease was a common sexual lubricant for a very long time. I honestly hate to point that out considering that the slab of bacon was found in the room with the two youngest girls, but I would bet that they had both been sexually assaulted.
9:30 might be my favorite part of the episode
Iowa is haunted I believr
Shane Madej the Illinois Demon
#postmortem Not sure what made me think of it, probably something about Ryan going back up to the attic by himself. I got the creeps thinking about what if the killer returned to the attic after the murders. Then since the public was being let into the crime scene, he could have blended in. I think that's probably unlikely, given the amount of blood that would probably be on him...but still the thought sent a chill down my spine.
7:47 proof that Shane has a demon in him that scares ghosts away
At 3:24 you see a figure on the reflection off the door
#PostMortem if last episode you wore cat ears, then can we expect any maid outfits in future episodes?
#Postmortem :  with the spirits of the victims who were brutally murdered  in the house and , Was it nice saying things such as 'I think you're sick and I hate you ' just to get a response on the spirit box ? #boogara #buzzfeedunsolved
I think Ryan and Shane once away from buzzfeed will Finally be able to stretch thier wings and go on to do great things
That "what is it" sounded super clear to me, but doesn't seem to be an intelligent response. Do you guys think this could be the remnants of the energy of the people who live and ultimately died in the house? #boogara #postmortem
this might be my favorite episode of supernatural. it combines elements of both shows
#postmortem - my theory is that someone poisoned the last meal they ate and came back at night to axe them out. The poison either killed them or put them in a deep sleep. Explains why no one woke up and only one victim had defensive wounds. The poisoner would have likely only planned to kill the Moore family and perhaps poisoned the pot of food the family would eat, not knowing Sarah would share it amongst her daughter's two friends as well (Lena and Ina), so perhaps Lena got a lesser dose of the poison and that's why she woke up during the attack on her sister.  My guess is that it was the brother, Ross (perhaps over a hog gripe). He would know how to move around his brother's house without making a lot of noise, and know he could hide in the attic. And maybe he felt so guilty after killing everyone, he ate the food he had poisoned hoping it would kill him as well. But it didn't, so he came to the rescue when Mary called on him the next morning. The Town Marshall is an idiot. #shaniac #fuckIowawithametaphoricalghostdildo.
9:28 SHANE’S SCREAM PLS HE’S SO DONE💀💀
The Ghoul Boys are back,I'm enjoying this series!
For #postmortem the story of the man who stabbed himself must be a compelling evidence that the house affects the mental stat of its visitors . I would like to ask if anyone one of you felt the same
There was a lot of activity going on with the ghost box this episode. How do you determine what ghosts may or may not be saying (and separating it from radio chatter)? As someone with severe audio processing disorder, I can't hear what the box is saying even with subtitles. Do you guys have a system for determining speech, or can you just hear better than me? #postmortem #boogara
BACON!
Okay I don't want to accuse anyone of anything because I LOVE this show but that voice at 14:46 just sounds so fake to me
I’m sitting here so mad they were in Iowa and I missed them!!!!!!!
Morbid just did a podcast episode on this. Now I get to see what everything looks like. Thanks guys
Here's a #postmortem question for the ghoul boys. If you had the option to spend a night in the Villisca Ax Murder House, would you do it?
I love how Ryan talks to the air like it's a real person
Yea you could come out the closet lol though about South Park
It should've been a True Crime and Supernatural collab episode!!!
#PostMortem "I'm in here" might be the clearest, most immediate response we've heard from the spirit box. That killer really is proud, & you could tell it was the same voice speaking through the whole night besides the Moore children bedroom session when it sounded like Josiah said "I'll kill him," "stop it" before the killer replied "stop me" in a taunting voice. It sounds like the killer is tormenting the family in the afterlife, and Josiah is in his children's room trying to protect them. The children never spoke because they are frightened/hiding. #Boogara
This genuinely creeps me out. 😱
Any more theories about the bacon? #Postmortem
These murders feel really similar to the Axe Murders of New Orleans
11:44 - im sorry - THA FUQ???!!!
I'm from Iowa I'm gald you finally get to visit my home state
Welcome to my corn state! (We don’t except Shane)
22:40 Sounded like Bobby Moore.  Oddly enough, a relative of the victims who recently had an interview is named Robert Moore according to Google.
As a native Iowan I believe in ghosts solely bc Iowa is just haunted as hell. Shane is right
Hell yeah! I saw this house on Scariest Places on Earth back in 2002 in middle school and it was so creepy it stuck with me. I was hoping Shane and Ryan would do this one eventually!!! 💖💀👻
I already miss the Ghoul Boys,   I love watcher
Waiting in the attic would explain why he made a meal afterwords, he was probably starving from waiting all day. And if there is no motive, maybe someone crazy just snuck in. That kind of home invasion is pretty common, and would be easy to get in. Kids forget to lock doors all the time.
The spookiest part of this episode is that Morbid Podcast also did a two-parter on this case this week... Where are my other Weirdos at??
Hold up why were you trying to contact the KILLERS ghost in the house? That makes NO sense 😂😂
I’ve been hoping for this one since season 1, let’s go!
I got no beef with Iowa, but Minnesota on the other hand…
Born and raised in Iowa and I’ve honestly never heard of this house😅
The fact you were two hours away hurts my heart so much omg Edit: 1:33 in and I now rescind my comment. Illinois sucks. Good thing im a boogara. Edit: 12:20, not a proud moment lol
unicorns are real ... they are just fat and we call them rhinos
What if the girls didn’t know their  lefts from their rights? I sure as hell didn’t at that age. I was still eating glue #postmortem
This is wild because Morbid just did a podcast about this!!
#postmorten cats are really perceptive of spiritual energy, which would help on these investigations. but would it be ethical to have a ghost hunting cat?
The ghoul boys in my state, I am honored!
Why are they asking the victim why they murdered theirselves?
Welcome to Iowa! Hope you didn’t hate it 😅
For #postmortem , did you guys check the bed after Ryan got surprised because its moving?
I’m a shaniac but with the spirit box voice was the same voice everytime is kinda strange.
"I'm surprised we don't hear any screams right now."   😆
#postmortem What do you do when it is a no bones day?
Just heard the episodes on this case on the Morbid Podcast ! Now I can see what the house looks like
#postmortem I've heard some sources say that they believe the bacon was used for masturbation. Very gross, but the way that Lena's body was discovered makes this theory somewhat make sense.
Well there ya go. It was Brian because bacon. Mystery solved. We got em, boys..
#postmortem Just saying, my mom's from Iowa and I lived there during grad school and gotta say... we don't hate Illinois, we hate Nebraska. Also, Shane is it the large cornfields that make Iowa haunted?
Hey I’m just remembering something before the next door lady went to check on the mores she heard the horses acting up and they found evidence of the killer eating before leaving. He could of escaped through the barn onto the street and ran off. Something had to of spooked the horses but we don’t know what.
Aye they killed this, he he no? My bad ill stop, but aye I have some freestyles on my channel if yall wanna check them out. If not its cool and stay up ghoul boys🙌 (p.s I was born in Iowa and I 100% agree) 💀🥴😂
The sheets covering the mirrors is so that the spirits of the deceased don't get trapped and unable to pass on. (In some cultures they also stop all of the clocks in the house)  You guys clearly aren't fans of P!ATD
Yeah Shane is really Inshane....
I would like never to see the spirit box again. can we go back to mystery's??
30:54 legit looks a head in that bed. Sent a shiver down my spine big time. Super creepy place!
Could have at least used Amy and Adam's pictures when talking about their show! lol.
* Ryan freaking out inside the house * Cut to Shane saying: Most of my time in the house was spent napping
they're back!!!!!
He guys. Just wanted to let you know I found a great doc on YouTube about this axe murderer. And if fact it is an axe serial murderer. The doc is called Axeman in the Heartland. And actually did kill a family in Illinois. So, yah for you Shane.
9:08 - LMFAO. That is all.
For postmortem: Whats with murders/ supernatural activities and axes? This one, Amityville, Axeman?
What if the Marshall, motive unknown, was the murderer? Why would anyone in their right mind let citizens hold the murder weapon? Thoughts?
Shane, do lights turn in and off for *You* all the time? Lights don't turn on and off too often I hope you know that
Thats the most we've got out of the spirit box to date. Glad to see a juicy video
For anyone who is confused about the bacon thing: it’s speculated the bacon was actually used by the killer to masturbate as unfortunately Lena was partially undressed (the only victim to have this happen) she was only 11
You guys are absolutely killing it! Thank you for this, it brings me so much joy. #notashaniac
As an Iowan, I have been waiting years for this and it did not disappoint! And Shane, Iowans love Illinois. It's actually Nebraska we take issue with lol.
I feel like watching the episodes late night has a different vibe to it🔥 but sad cause we are facing endgame for the show💔
#postmortem maybe more of a question for the last port Mortem, but for Ryan: what do you feel is the BEST evidence you’ve gathered after all these visits?
#PostMortem I think the slab of bacon was a kind of To Kill a Mockingbird type bartering system exchange. I think it’s possible the killer owed them for some kind of favor during hard times and decided to kill them instead of paying up I guess? but then why not take the bacon with you instead of making it a clue. It’s honestly strange.
Can you do an episode at Cecil hotel
I'm surprised the Ghoul bois didn't bring and/or ate bacon during their investigation.
Shane's back with the camera holder on, over that shirt........🤤👌
The flashlight wasn't even invented in 1868. How would the ghost know what a flashlight is?
Instead of "I'm miserable" I heard "debatable"
What was the scariest part about being in Iowa? #postmortem
People used to cover mirrors with sheets when someone died so that the souls wouldn't get trapped in them maybe that why the killer covered the mirrors in the house. This episode was definitely a win for the Bergara boys.
"You do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe" That's the sweetest thing I've ever heard
The town marshall sounds sketch for letting other DNA onto the weapon
the house isn't haunted until shane showed up
Morbid Podcast just came out with an episode about this home! So sad & creepy
#postmortem Do you think the killer was a pig getting revenge for their friend getting turned into bacon? The bacon on the floor was a taunt.
Why does the spirt box make Shane so mad ? #postmortem
Here's my two take on this: 1. A close friend or relative did it. Its impossible the family not notice a trespasser hiding in the attic for a long time with a low head space. 2. Or the family is hated somehow by the townspeople, who on earth makes a murder scene a spectacle and let's other people tamper the murder weapon.  PS. I think Shane is the real Ghost/Demon deterrent. He is the only who gets in your face with the so called entity and in the end the entity gives up and crawls back to hell's b*tth*le 😂😂😂
How is it that Ryan and Shane get the least amount of evidence compared to other investigators
The guy was probably like can I axe you a question and the peoples faces just got to close. Donate bread #bread #pm
For #PostMortem Is there any case in another country (true crime or supernatural) that has really interested you but you weren't able to cover it?
Idk why but these videos will never get old
YES FINALLY I WAS WAITING FOR MY STATE 😂😂 also we always gonna beef Shane 😂😂😂
When it comes to things suspected of being said by a ghost, I felt this episode had better quality sentences and answers. When they were questioning in the attack, those were some clear answers, not just "that kind of sounded like ____"
#postmortem will we ever get a deep dive into what Ryan feels like went home with him after certain investigations? He’s briefly touched on it. Would love to know more about his experience. #boogara #shane-is-the-perfect-counterpoint-to-the-boogara-ballad
The machine said Poopie at 32 mins in I can't be convinced otherwise
“I’m so vulnerable right now, oh my god” same Shane, same 😂
OMG YES. IVE BEEN WAITING SO LONG FOR THIS!!!!
Y’all are AMAZING. I MISSED YOU SO MUCH!!! watching conjuring house now!!!! Omg I’m dying.
27:23- best part of the whole video
It’s crazy that Ash and Alaina are covering this exact case in the Morbid podcast this week!
I'm a skeptic and still am but this video creeped me out
Will you guys ever visit ghost locations outside America? (Asia, specifically) #postmortem
Ryan really should read The Man From the Train.  The authors theorize that the same uncaught serial killer did both Villisca and Hinterkaifek.
If you forget they're ghost hunting, Shane and Ryan are just talking to their flashlights like crazy people lmao
That mark from the backswing gives me very bad vibes. Like "my chest hurt for only the time it was on the screen" kind of bad vibes
I'm so proud of Ryan.  Season 1 Ryan would have been shitting bricks at the flashlights.
She was doing laundry at 5 a.m.? Was she on meth?
For #postmortem , after staying in these places, reading the stories and experiencing some spooky things, do you ever feel scared in normal situations after? For instance, after walking around a creepy murder basement, is your own dark basement still frightening?
i’m from iowa and the iowa-illinois beef is DEFINITELY real
I’m screaming. I’m from the Midwest and I’ve been dying to go there.
Creepiest spirit box yet
Regarding the covered mirrors and windows, these murders happened in 1912 so the murderer would most likely have been raised with Victorian Era death superstitions (that are seen across many cultures with significance of rituals varying slightly). Mirrors were covered in the house of the deceased (and definitely room where death occurred) to prevent the deceased’s spirit from being trapped. It was also believed one should open the window in a deceased persons room so their soul can escape, (this one am pulling from “Alias Grace” by Margaret Atwood but has credence in superstitious rituals post death).   General summation of beliefs from communities that cover mirrors after death  are that ghosts could carry away souls through mirrors and never rest. Another is that people believed the deceased could harm the living by entering the physical world through a mirror. Finally some cover as its to keep thoughts present while mourning and looking at ones appearance during this time is considered vain.
For post mortem: Do you think, perhaps, you might see more, or any paranormal activities if you turned the lights on while investigating? Or are you making a conscious decision to leave the lights off during your investigations for more of a spooky effect to scare the bahjesus out of Ryan? Cause I'm here for a good ole Boogara freak out and panic attack. Btw, still wtg for those choo choo pickle pies to drop.
God weekend🇩🇰
Be aware a man named Kevin (junkyard digs ) drove a Monte Carlo here beware
As an Iowan, iowa is definitely haunted
spirit box: somebody stop me shane: *jim carrey impression* somebody stop me! ryan: *serious tone* i dont think it’s jim carrey… IM CACKLING 💀🤣
This has been my all-time favorite episode! The audio picked up may be the best evidence that Ryan has gotten yet.
Yalls backs must hurt carrying buzzfeed like this
#postmortem What if the town marshal was the murderer or was friends with whoever did it? Then turning the crime scene into an attraction wouldn't just be incompetence, it'd be him purposefully sabotaging the investigation! Just saying. #shaniacs #butryanisawesometoo
My mom said Shane is a Buzz-kill lmao
The man has a mustache now but still has the voice of a teenager
The New Orleans Axe man should have taken notes on the efficiency of this guy.
Yessssss i called it!!!!!
I hope they go to Gettysburg at some point this last season! That place is supposed to be hella spooky
#Postmortem So umm you do realise that ghosts or spirits only have a limited amount of energy , if they did have a lot of energy then they could possibly be seen as a ghost or an apparition all the time, then why does Ryan ask them questions and then ask them to repeat their reply within seconds?? (idk if yall get what i mean!)
for #postmortem: could we see shane's reaction to the footage of the bed? would be interested in what he thinks of it
Oh shane  ,,,, did u have to do a couple days house arrest ...
Pleeeeeeease keep this series going. It’s literally the best thing ever. Or at the very least keep Ryan and Shane together doing at least something. But the supernatural ones are my fav.
I just finished listening to a 2 part podcast on the villisca axe murders by Morbid: A true crime podcast. So excited to watch this!! Perfect timing!
Look the only thing which can convince me is the fact that miserable is a long word which prolly cant randomly come out
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE
4:24 Typo in the group chat  Okay I couldn't help myself, but Shane is Too Comfortable lying on the ground next to a bed where two children were killed jfosijf
WHAT THE GHOUL BOYS WERE SO CLOSE TO ME OMG 😫 thanks for visiting Iowa! lmao 🤣
I am easily scared, so I might faint if I have to stay in there alone... But really it's just sad that no one will ever know what truly happened that night.
Shane, couldn't the ghost not mess with you BECAUSE you dont believe. If ghosts are real, then they would need some source to "feed" off of, and the most metaphysical actual thing humans have that we know are real are emotion, like how people can literally bring the mood down by how they feel. So maybe Ghosts, if real thrive off of strong emotions, explaining why even potential non hostile spirits still haunt, because they need it. But Shane is like a Elephant, would it be good feedin, sure, but the amount of effort and work wouldnt equal out in the end.
6:09 cool number
I can't swim  ,,,, my gills are packed ....
That's very true, the Midwest states don't like each other. LOL
Anytime they do the spirit box and it says like “stop me” or stuff like that, it made it seem like the killer didn’t mean to kill everyone in the house like the two girls that stayed over…
“AHHHHHHHHH” - Shane 2021
The fact morbid literally did their episode for this week on this case.  Wow
I dont know about you guys but when i see a new episode with the ghoul boys it makes my day.
postmortem: do you think the killer used a sedative on the family?
#postmortem For me to believe anything that comes out of the spirit box, it needs to be tested. Would people be able to interfere with the spirit box if they had the right radio tech?
Well I was Ryan when I started watching BuzzFeed unsolved but thanks to Shane now I'm completely agree with him.
Since the house was said to have a negative effect on the mental state, can you tell us further about the dynamic for that night, on and off screen? Any ruffling of feathers between you two or the crew? I know if it wasn’t worth noting you guys wouldn’t have put it in, but just a little curious of how everyone was doing. Thank you everyone for your hard work! #postmortem
It seems counter productive to me Ryan, that you regularly carry holy water and seem to invite God's protection over you when you enter these types of places,  but then you frequently profane the very name of Jesus. Not quite understanding this ....
Make a BuzzFeed Solved Supernatural or true crime video lmfao #Postmortem
anybody else just listen to this case from the morbid podcast?
True crime meets supernatural right here
#postmortem do you think this was an inside job? Maybe someone was actually with them, someone they trust. My suspects are the neighbor and the marshal or someone whom they think can't do the crime an innocent looking person
Maybe the town marshall did iy
Nothing can really explain that bedshoot moving when Shane was sitting on top of the bed......
17:35 real head next to ryan's bed 😨
Love how my 20th birthday is on a Friday, AND I get a new episode of buzzfeed unsolved!!!!
I remember when Bailey Sarian talked about this house in MMMM. She said people would ask the ghost to move things or open and close doors if they were there with them in the house, and the Ghoul boys did just that lol.
Town Marshall = officer Barbrady
I have been recommending this place since season 1!
Wow that "what is it" was clear as day, probably the best one they caught yet. The ghosts must be confused at the strange modern device
For the #postmortem: Maybe when he said "switch" he meant in the same way that the spirits did in the lighthouse ep, but instead the spirits of the kids just got a good ole ghoul boy spanking from Shane ?  Lmao, lots of love guys! #Boogaras
*”8 PEOPLE MURDERED IN THER BEDS IN VILLISCA”*  Uh oh, somebody didn’t catch the spelling error
I may like Shane, but as an Iowan I will throw hands.
All the Shaniacs in the world are gonna have a breakdown when this series is finished
#postmortem Do you think that the force that made the man stab himself could’ve been the family not the killer? Sort of punishing him for bringing that knife and acting so aggressive in their house after what happened to them?
U know they are hell for that demon.
“HEY, FUCKO!”
Post mordem: if you ever see a face out the window of any place you are ghost hunting in, how would you react?
THIS IS TWO HOURS AWAY FROM ME OMG!
What year this happen?
The town marshall probably killed em
#postmortem why is iowa haunted? Im not American what's wrong with iowa
I hate how dominant the “murderer”’s voice and presence is in the house. geez get outta here already and let the spirits of the poor kids and parents roam alone ;-;
i know itd ruin the validity of the show but i hope the last episode is just Shane coming out as a demon and everyone dies
I really want Shane to see a ghost.
A suggestion for a next episode or if you ever reopen the show, why not wear heart monitors?
I feel awful for thinking "or, he missed breakfast..." so funny Also, for the postmortem...Shane, what were you thinking when Ryan said "but unicorns aren't real!"
#Postmortem: hey Ryan do you go to therapy after visiting all these haunted locations because I think that might be a good thing for you man
My mom’s cousins lived there somewhere between the murders and when they turned it into a public attraction.
is it the hiatus? or especially how horrifyingly tragic this case was? or how unnervingly present the presence of the murderer is? I’m more creeped out than I’ve been from an unsolved ep.
Why would u keep two guests sleeping over at ur house who were friends of ur child downstairs alone tho
#postmortem: Shane, why do you hate spirit box so much and Ryan do you think the spirit box gives good pieces of evidence?
Please collab With  morbid !!!!!!
can they like go to Japan and visit all of the haunting places there?
Are we also not going to talk about how the murderer managed to kill 8 people, some of which were sleeping IN THE SAME BEDS??
I swear this is why ppl say to be Friends with or atleast know ur neighbours
Ohioan here, the Midwest turf war is real. We may seem innocent enough with our “jeez” and “ope” and “let me squeeze right past ya”,  but do not talk to me about that state up north. I blame football for all of this.
“Hey…Fucko!” 🤣🤣🤣
WOW! I JUST FINISHED LISTENING TO MORBID PODCAST OF THIS CASE😲
Pls do the Burari deaths :)
So is ryan shanes girlfriend?
24:42 best part of the video lmaooo
Odd that only one person was actually axed. I’d say he was the killer if iy weren’t for the footprints downstairs.  Unless they were planted and then he did the rest of the killin’
Those Windows! Same as Amityville
I was just thinking after the last episode,if you guys had ever been here and I couldnt remember ever watching you  guys do this place and then next episode..wala here it is..haha
to me, the most compelling part of all of this is that the spirit box consistently sounded like one voice... normally you can't quite tell but this one felt like it was the same man speaking throughout the episode. very spooky
for the postmortem: not question but i just wanted to say that evp is probs the best one they’ve ever gotten on this show, and that “hard to stop” spirit box response literally gave me chills #booganiac
For #postmortem: I don't think I've ever heard of the Villisca Ax Murder House until this episode. It is truly horrific what happened, however, I can't help but be intrigued by the mystery of it all. My question is if you had done a True Crime episode on the Villisca Ax Murders, what would be your theories about what really happened there?
How to break Shane 101. That’s what I learned this this episode.
I’m from Iowa it’s definitely haunted
Someone add Shane screaming to that 'scream then disappears' type of compilation  These types of compilations: https://youtu.be/g7p3KT_LXsk
SHANE! I'm a Northshore girl turned Central Illinois turned Alaska. =)
In Iowa the name Shane “Skull Man” Madej is synonymous with fear and death. I’ve lived here my whole life and 1/10 deaths in the state are caused by him. The other 9/10 are caused by sheer boredom because it’s Iowa.
For postmortem: m guys my dudes my broskiis. Hope this isn't too late cuz ryan I think you'll be interested. Now I might just be seeing things, (living that shitfish life) but at 17:54 or 18:04, when you felt the bed move, I saw some movement on the pillows. Like the sheet on top was brushed or tugged in some way. Zoom it and slow it just to see. Also Shane I'm loving your energy this episode y'all give me good 🌌vibes🌌
How was the town marshal not suspect number one after he fucked the crime scene up like that??
love this show so much but these mf's always turn the spirit box off once it starts to get interesting 😂
This season is gonna be lit 🔥 it gaves me mix feeling about it.. But i'll stan with the boys
"Im one of the most feared ghost hunters" Smh ya take One demon bridge 😂
It terrifies me to think the murderer fixed himself some food and covered the mirrors. Something about these actions gave me chills! Shows how sick that person really was
HI THIS IS A REMINDER IF YOU LOVE RYAN AND SHANE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN YT CHANNEL "WATCHER"
#Postmortem I believe that the sheet over the mirror thing was from a common Victorian superstition which asked you to cover up all mirrors in the house when there's a death so that the spirits escaping the bodies don't get trapped into the mirrors.  If this is the reason, what do you think this would say about the killer? I mean he was careful to carry out custom.
The sequence where they give the "ghost" specific instructions and the blue flashlight just keeps going on and off randomly is the best evidence that the flashlights are useless.
The ghoul boys asking the ghost to turn off the blue or black flashlight: 😌🤔 The ghost, whose colorblind: ☹️
use a medium who can see and talk to spirits
as an iowan i’m ok with this iowa slander
"Hey Fucko!" Shane has no fear.
the funny thing to me is that ive never had flashlight issues like yall have lol! i dont think it means theres ghosts but maaaaaan, what kinda flashlights are yall using lmfao
Shane is actually a demon lord ngl. He literally can argue with any demon in the world, even when Annabelle threatens to kill him a few years ago. He literally went on with that statement, with not even a slight bit of fear
For #postmortem:  did you guys peek under the sheets that covered the mirrors? I felt like if you really wanted to agitate the killer that would have been the move. Also, maybe the bacon was a clue who the killer was? Maybe the town butcher or someone the Moores trusted to revceive gifts from? I thinl the killer brought it with him as an alibi if someone saw him snooping around the house. LOVE YOU SHANE AND RYAN!
Shane, as a Nebraskan, I super appreciate your hated of Iowa 🤣
9:29 As a ghost non-believer, I feel this scream. It speaks to me soul. It's me reading these comments.
for #postmortem , the person who stabbed him self in the house and forgot everything went in with bad intentions to mess with the ghosts. do you think it was something with his mental health or something more sinister since he was trying to set them off? btw huge fan of y’all 😁
Ryan holding the spirit box: *literally speaking clear* Shane holding the spirit box : *absolutely nothing* _we don't know if ghoul evidence is happening but SHANE DEMON evidence is_
omg this is close to where i live 😭 i wanna know when they were here i would’ve been so close to meeting them
My favorite episodes are these ones that are half true crime and half "let's see if the victims are ghosts now"
just one question:  WHY ARE YOU GUYS DOING THESE TO YOURSELVES? 😭 #postmortem
For both of you guys: why are we so certain the killer's spirit is in this house? I can only imagine they lived and then joined in with the onlookers the next morning to muddy the waters. They may not be attached to the house, unfortunately. #postmortem
I'm so vulnerable right now oh my God. You could really take a whack at me I tell you what. Bdsm talk lol
Are ghost real?
I would LOVE to see them play Phasmophobia together once the season is over 😂😂😂 please!!! 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
IN FACT, I'M ONE OF THE MOST FEARED GHOST HUNTERS ALIVE.  yeah...put that on a T-Shirt! #postmortem
Guys the jokes.  The jokes !!  Are some inappropriate????
Wow two episodes and in both there were little to no activity
As a fellow Illinoisan, I agree with Shane’s thoughts on Iowa
I'm surprised that I've never heard this story before.
Love how this is like a mix of Unsolved True Crime and Supernatural
Considering the fact that no one woke up, is it possible they were drugged? Given 2(?) girls were visiting, maybe their dad slipped some sedative in the tea or left them some drugged food and instead of leaving just went to the attic and waited #postmortem
Shane be like: it is not science. Does he even know that the equipment they use for communicating ghost is made by engineers? Also. EM (electromagnetic), radiofrequencies are in science.  The fact they use the spirit box is also with science. So shane.. wtf you talking about? #PostMortem #Boogara
Oh believe me ghoul boys..........I was there with my family the whole time...
THIS IS THE ONLY BUZZFEED UNSOLVED VIDEO I STOPPED WATCHING MIDWAY I CANNOT
#postmortem this was one of the most consistently chatty places you’ve gone to, how does that measure up as evidence when it comes to ryan (trying) to prove ghosts are real?
I NEED TO STOP WATCHING DURING BROAD DAYLIGHT BECAUSE WHAT SHANE IS DOING IS BEYOND MY HUMAN COMPREHENSION I MEAN BRO ARE YOU EVEN FOR REAL YOU REALLY ARE SOMETHIN 😭
OH MY GOD I CANNOT BELIEVE SHANE WOULD DO THAT 😭 SHANE ARE YOU EVEN FOR REAL, THAT REALLY IS THE UNSOLVED QUESTION
I mean, it was the cop wasn’t it? He called as many people as he could to tamper with evidence
The ghoul boys are the only that is keeping me sane through quarantine..
#postmortem Ryan don’t you think telling the ghosts that if they do something, it’s be caught on camera or threatening them with holy water will be detrimental to the investigation
They should do a half hour of no equipment to really experience it. Shane would tell the truth of what would happen I feel since he is such a skeptic
this has got to be the spookiest video ive ever watched here on buzzfeed unsolved supernatural, despite the fact that we've all been kind of "desensitized" bit by bit bc of all the videos we have watched 😭
Omg I've been here. So wild! Love this, huge fan of you guys!
During 31:54 the doll behind Ryan scared me lol
5:38 I was more thinking of it as a joke with the dish “Pigs in a planket”
It's funny how the ghost sometimes talk or listen and it's always to Ryan but when Shane talks they go silent...
The bacon wrapped in the dish towel might be to distract a dog, that’s of course if the family had a dog
For #PostMortem : It had to be the Marshall, right? He contaminated the crime scene by having everyone in town swing the axe. As a housecat who learned to type during quarantine, this reminds me of when I bat the coffee mug off the table, and then invite the dog to put his paws on the area around the spill.
My boys ❤️❤️❤️
Y’all were mentioning some thing about the mirrors being covered. There are some people especially in that day and age that would cover mirrors when people passed away because there was a Superstition or A belief that a spirit could get trapped in mirrors. So they would cover a mirror when they knew someone was about to pass away or as the person was passing away. A lot of times they would also stop the clocks in the room because it was documenting the time of the passing. But I’m just mentioning this because this was another tradition or whatever that they would do when someone passed away but it also causing a lot of weird superstitions because people would say that it must’ve been the spirit to stop the clock… But it was actually someone who stopped the clock to document the time of passing.  Also you mentioned some thing about the victims having their faces covered with clothing or blankets. Usually when someone does this it’s out of remorse or because they knew the person and they had shame in what they did. So I’m thinking it was a high possibility that the person who did this knew the victims. I have always been just,…I don’t know if I would say fascinated,… But interested in the story because I just couldn’t believe the horrific violence. It’s bad enough that they killed the parents but to go around and kill the children and even the infant child! It’s not like that baby was going to be able to be a witness.  I remember that one of the people of interest was someone who the husband knew and they believed that this man had a grievance with him but they could never prove that it was him.
Hahaha you guys are great. Shane just lays down eyes closed, “I’m about as vulnerable as can be!”   Nothing happens.  These ghosts just need to be tempted better.
From a psychological point of view, the covering of the windows,mirrors and the bodies is a sign of shame, he doesn't want to see what he did or be reminded of what he's doing. However coupled with the breakfast thing which shows either detachment or malice, I'd guess this person is delusional or psychotic. Someone local, knew of the family an adult with a low IQ. Maybe had a fight over something trivial. Probably didn't live very far away either.
AHHHHHHH AS A BORN AND RAISED IOWAN I CANT BELIEVE THEYRE AT THIS PLACE, I WENT WITH MY BROTHER IT WAS TERRIFYING
"Turn on the blue flashlight"  The colorblind Ghost:  ;-;
For #postmortem what is a place you two wanted to investigate but never got to? Much love for you both.
#postmortem what if the killer went through the front door and then left. There are no ghost in the house your most likely to talk to a unicorn then a ghost
for #postmortem: is it possible that Shane had a reach point where he got scared while being alone inside the house but wont admit it to himself because he entirely believes that ghost aren't real?
This episode has some of the most compelling evidence yet. Gotta give this one to Ryan. - conversations & the same voices + 2&3 words on the spirit box (responding to questions?!)  - clear EVP ‘what is it’  - movement on the bed + flashlights
Anything they say could go on a t-shirt and be hilarious. I love watching these guys
Bro I suddenly love the change of tone in the closet scene, it really went "Bye bye:)" to "ᴴᵉʸ :("
Please keep this show going!
Shane dissing the Iowans is accurate, and I should know, I am one.
Im sorry, did I miss something? Why is no one mentioning that they were probably drugged somehow? Its way more plausible than one person creeping around silently bashing in heads. The one that woke up could have gotten a lower dosage or processed it faster.
We need to talk about the 2014 stabbing. WHAT the heck? Ghost murderer possession?
For #postmortem: What do you think happened to the bacon? Do you think somebody might've taken it home for their personal consumption? Maybe it ended up on someone's breakfast table.
Yes they finally did it good job
Could the flashlight flicker be Morse code like they asked? 10:12
i love you guys so much! please continue doing this! love lots!!!!
I hate the spirit box too but the captions for the box when it’s on is: “Machine hissing” and it’s just so cute I can’t help but love it now 🥰
#postmortem : So Shane, can you thoroughly explain why you don’t like/believe in the flashlight method? Are y’all’s flashlights different from every day household flashlights?
I lost it when he quoted the Mask at such a tense moment 😂😂
For the Q & A, I'm assuming that all of the episodes for this final season have already been filmed but have you guys thought about bringing back the ovulus?
Morbid podcast's, Alaina, beautifully just did this haunting true crime story. It's so cool to see this episode happen at the same time :)
The conversation in the children’s room is astonishing to me. It sounds like a mans voice, and then a DIFFERENT man, similar tone to the one from the other room asking them to ‘stop’ him. Followed by a childs voice saying ‘help me’. The idea of the murderer and family being trapped together in that home is awful.
Ryan you are so not scared anymore that was the most evidence ever and you only had big scared eyes like once
Note to self: make sure to never build or purchase a home with Amityville-style double arched windows, please and thank you.
It's so sweet of Shane to say that, but in truth Sara strikes me as the kind of gal to sleep with a pocket knife under her pillow, Shane and Sara are just so cute together 💕💕💕💕
#postmortem I find it hilarious that whatever entity or entities are stuck in this house wanted to speak to Shane, but then as soon as Ryan handed over the spirit box they basically said NAH HARD PASS. Such is the power that Shane holds lol. #heytherespiritsitsyaboy #ghoulboys
Shane: Illinois vs Iowa Massachusetts vs Rhode Island: Finally a worthy opponent (Edit: IDK how this got even 24 likes lol)
I wasn't looking at the video at 14:47, but I definitely heard (and understood without captions!) "What is this?" and it 100% sounded like a person saying it! Have you actually found evidence this time? #postmortem
God dammit y’all were practically in my backyard and I had no idea
Anybody know where they get their spirit box?
For #postmortem really surprised that the "evp" @ 14:47 didn't cause more of a stir. I don't believe in the supernatural, but that was probably the best evp I've heard among all these ghost hunting shows in general. Ryan said before that "when people say that it seems like I'm faking evidence, that's a high form of praise", and this one is a good example of that. Granted it could be an audio artifact from the recorder or something, but I'm willing to say that this one is genuinely unexplained. I would like to hear Shane's opinion on it, tho. Thanks y'all.
For #postmortem, I know I’m being cruel to the victims, especially to the children, may they Rest In Peace, but what if the family wasn’t all that innocent as the media portrayed them to be? They had to be killed for a reason. They must have done something to the murderer for them to make all that effort to kill EIGHT people seamlessly. Maybe the children weren’t included in that act but he still had to kill them anyway because they were at the wrong place at the wrong time, like collateral damage, which is why he covered the mirrors because he felt disgusted with himself killing children?
Well when the killer sat for hours in the attic waiting, just feet from the parents bedroom for them to fall asleep, you can see how he didn’t need to sneak around. My house also makes a lot of noise every time you take a step, and for that, I am grateful. Also, Maglites are not hui, I have owned many over the years and they are reliable in every situation. I don’t know a more sound flashlight brand.
For the question thing: Shane's style is like "dad mowing his lawn in the 70s" but cool
postmortem: use my comment as a segue to the hotdoga
#postmortem : hey guys! Why haven't you used the Ovulus since Hannah Williams? Also how come you haven't used a medium in any other episodes, or why did you only use a medium for that episode? I thought a medium might be able to help with some of those unsolved true crime cases. #boogara
i'm still not ready for this to end. i still want them to got to haunted places in asia. im crying
Ghosts are real Frustrated Kermit the Frog scream
For #postmortem I know Shane doesn't believe in ghosts, aliens are iffy, and I guess unicorns are a no lol. What supernatural/cryptic/extraterrestrial type things do you believe in? Also for Ryan, if Shane's a demon why didn't your holy water gun do anything to him? 🤔
I think the goul's are just scared of Shane
Iowans feel the same about you Illinois folk Shane.
Yeahhh babyy, LESGOWWW!!!! 👻🎃♥️🇵🇭
At 32:36 you can see a dark mist passing. From Left to right😱😱😱😱
(Yeef)
9:28 Ghosts fear him
for #postmortem do you think the town marshall had anything to do with the murder? cause who in the right mind would let the whole townspeople just enter and touch the murder objetcs, esp the axe, maybe he was trying to cover up someoe's fingerprints?
21:00 not sure if this what the murderer supposedly said, but.. i don't think the murderer would know what putty is actually. the murderer committed this crime in 1912, while putty was invented in 1943. i doubt the murderer was interested in meddling with new inventions during the war era, if he was still even alive then. the medium was probably making up stuff. or they might've just given a general description of the murderer's favorite type of person and didn't quote him word for word. not sure
Iowa… Idiots Out Wandering Around
I've been waiting so long for this Bunsfold Unseed. ^_^  My auto correct is dyslexic.
The theory about the bacon is that the killer used it to pleasure himself, as it were.  Also, why would the killers ghost be there? That doesn't make any sense.
I’m not missing any new videos for the last season.
Why would the killer be haunting the house?
Anyone else think a small hand was gonna come out from under the bed when shane was laying on the ground?
3:23. wtf is that in the window?!?!
The town marshal seems sus AF tho....
#postmortem Shane you said it didn’t feel right in the house alone. What do you mean? What would it take for you to believe in ghosts? #shaniac
Why did you use Lizzie Borden’s picture for Sarah Moore? Did you think there was a connection between the two crimes? Or were you guys just feeling lazy lol
Say we are camping and a horse walks by and leaves hoof prints in the ground, we wake up and I say “it looks like a horse walked by” and you say “it must’ve been a unicorn” and I say “…wat 😐”
clearest spirit box evidence i’ve ever heard
I am going to miss you guys and your investigations both of the series unsolved true crime and supernatural-
I’m just crying laughing at the thought of the guy who killed them just screaming in Shane’s voice”somebody stop me”. Lmao
It's funny how Ryan goes in after Shane has probably pissed off the spirits.
Wtf is with that Barbie in the closet
Shane is turning into Walt Disney# Shaniac #postmortem
For the #postmortem, what will you guys miss the most about Buzzfeed Unsolved, Ryan's storytelling, Shane's denial that ghosts are real, or the knowing fact that Ryan is Ricky Goldworth's and Shane is a Demon who wrote a Hot Doga? #Boogara #UnicornsArentRealButGhostsAre
#postmortem with the theory that ghosts are echoes of past events, the repeated 'stop me' sounds like it was something the killer was whispering before killing each individual person in the house, knowing they couldn't - kinda like a sick motto or something
#postmortem ryan i’m so proud of you for getting braver! i would be completely terrified and losing my mind if i was in that house. how do you continue on even when you’re scared? (also please bring your cat cosplays back)
For post-mortem: What does Shane have to say about that, “What is it” whisper because that was 100% a whisper by a human. It was chilling.
i think this ghost is racist... it only wanted to talk to shane
Ryan has a story arc where he becomes the most feared ghost hunters in the world.
#postmortem What are your best theories as to why the killer may have haunted the house where he killed the people in? wouldn't it be awkward for the killer's ghost and the ghost of the family to just be coinciding with each other?
SO much evidence but they weren't that impressed!? 🤔  even Ryan!
Shane you make Illinois proud!
Not gonna lie, this episode gave me hibby jibbies compared to others
Shane: “Somebody stop me!!” Ryan: I don’t think it’s Jim Carey
#postbordummmmm…..guys I’m dissapointed 🥱….your hearts ain’t in this are they 😠
I understand they want and need to not turn on lights and only use flashlights for the atmosphere but do you know how much scarier it would be if you saw something with all the lights on?
Can confirm, Iowa is actually haunted, and Illinois sucks
Post Mortem: Wait but how did the police know that it was a man who killed them? Because an ax was used? I guess I didn’t know that ax use was gender specific lmao…Maybe they never found the person because they were too busy assuming it was a man. That’s probably why she’s pissed, she’s like god damn another man taking credit for my work. Okay and also we kinda glossed over the bacon, two pounds… just sitting there… that is strange, they did that for what??? Hahaha
This sounds alot like the Amityville Murders. All murdered. No one woke up. Weird...
#Postmortem Do you guys feel like you are able to conduct a full investigation of these places, or do you feel as if you need either more time, equipment or a better approach to communication? #Shaniac here, but scientific method yadda yada, I'm curious if things were approached differently, whether you would get better outcomes if ghosts were real?
@buzzfeedunsolved #postmortem  This sounds similar to the axe man of New Orleans, if he did use their own axe to kill them. This happened in 1912 and the New Orleans axe murders took place from 1918-1919. Thoughts?
pov: you and shane are taunting demons while ryan crys in a corner
I’m pretty sure the killer was one of the family members or someone they knew like a relative cause I’m pretty sure the parents would of notice someone walking around or at least hearing the deep breath of someone swinging a axe up and down
#Postmortem I think the killer and the family were both in the room with you guys at 18:58-19:16. The audio recordings sounded like they were having a heated conversation. ("Stop it", "Help me", "Stop me")
“ I don’t believe in ghosts, but I do believe that Iowa is haunted.” 😂 plz
Why wasn’t this in true crime?
“I’m in here” was pretty clear there. Interesting clip, if everything else didn’t seem so conclusively negative it would be even more compelling.
For #postmortem I am from Iowa and what the hell Shane? I thought you were a pretty cool guy but I'm not so sure anymore. #shadyshane
What if just what if....the murders are all happening in the past and ryan and shane are the ghosts that the murderers see  and he is driven to madness and killed all eight of them.
Herman!? Well he got the short end of the stick when it came to names
Shane reminds me of a Muppet that became a real boy!
I feel honored they even entered the state that I live in, no one goes to Iowa willingly
#postmortem Unsure if you have mentioned or answered this before but, can we hope to see any ghost hunting content on Watcher at any point in the future? Or is this the ghoul boys last hoorah before retiring??
Woaah an unsolved true crime and supernatural all mixed together!!!
I've claimed more skulls for the state of Iowa
Ya know what be funny is what if all ghost where like never ever show yourself to these two like some small town and each one sending a signal to another one something like that Idk
#postmortem.. Do you think more ghost equiotment would help shane be a little more convinced that there really is spirits in the places you two visit?
#PostMortem This episode captured very interesting voice responses that easily connect to what happened in that house. Shane, what’s your opinion on that?
Definitely check out the book "The Man from the Train" if you want to learn about the possible serial killer who committed this crime. It was a very interesting theory and one of the creepiest look at cold cases where families were murdered all throughout the US in the 1890s through 1910s.
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]   *[UNINTELLIGIBLE BUT SLOW]*
If the killer left why would he still be there?
They can hear anything except “help me” also in the previous episodes.
It was the sheriff. You murder an entire house of people and then let the town mess with the evidence. You feel guilty for killing them even though you wanted to and instead of staring at their busted faces, you cover them with a rag, and go about killing the next set. I could also make a joke about cops and bacon… 😉
That evp was so clear and hearing it with headphones…never gonna sleep again <3
I HOPE YOU INVESTIGATE ONE OF THE MOST HAUNTED CITIES IN AMERICA, ALTON, IL. ON THE MIGHTY MISSISSIPPI,  THERE ARE BRICK STREETS, HILLS, VERY BIG, OLD HOUSES, AND A LIFE SIZE STATUE OF THE TALLEST MAN IN THE WORLD
Hope you read my questions, one for Shane, one for Ryan- Shane, did any of the houses or locations ever feel uncomfortable to you so that you thought there might be something to the haunting? Ryan, was there a location you thought was all hype and definitely not haunted?
No one’s going to mention The Man From The Train ?
13:24-13:30 Someone she knew or the family knew or probably someone who has a disdain for women
Plus if Shane doesnt still believes in ghost let him go to rooms with his eyes closed and facing the corner for 7 minutes
I think this is really incredible evidence, those evp's you got are amazing, the fact you even picked up something in a room you weren't even in, I would be really freaked out.
Hanging laundry at 5am!!!! Lordy
Now that’s something I can’t wrap my head around. What kind of disturbed disgusting individual goes around depositing perfectly good bacon everywhere? True evil.
it really did sound like michael rooker lmao
Loved your episode on swat
I have never met someone as fearless as Shane...
Best episode yet we communication baby!
Good to know Illinois and Iowa have the same beef as Minnesota and Wisconsin
Ryan: "Why did you do what you did?" Spirit box: "Warnted bracon"
The bacon in a towel is definitely a nod to pigs in a blanket. Nice touch axe murderer
Tbh I think people would watch it more if there was sometimes no cuts, a little less background music, more technology(antana with senser), and I think less lighting, and more paused and long silence while asking questions, and cameras in rooms the whole time
Is that a boobah on the shelf-
Love those Amityville windows😂😂😂
heres a question, if you had to choose the most terrifying place you've visited? Once you've chose it would you go back?
Shane, have you started to believe a little bit more since you guys started this series? Ryan, has your belief waned any since the series was started?
4:23 "murdered in ther beds" ugh the typo is bothering me more than anything else.
When Ryan asked what year is it and the stinker said "eight" he meant "I'm so 2000 and eight you're so 2000 and late"
Someone needs to write a story/make a show about some guys like Ryan and Shane that make a ghost hunting show and one never believes in ghosts and the other does. Then, for the last episode of the show, the one who doesn't believe in ghosts gets killed at a location. It's the investigation of the one who does believe in ghosts as he claims it was ghosts and Proof that ghosts exist but he has a good motive for killing the other, as he's now famous and many more people believe ghosts exist. At the end of the story, it leaves off with the case unsolved.
Viewers: Whoa, scary Among us viewers: The house is sus
I just wanna know what happened to all that bacon?!?!
For post mortem: was the town Marshall ever considered a suspect? idk anything about the case but it's weird that he allowed the house to be open to the townspeople with the bodies still inside, as well as let them handle the murder weapon. idk it's just a bit sus. Also my younger brother had the same toy dog that was in the attic.
They did WHAT while the bodies were still WHAT?
The murderer is the Town Marshall.. That is why he allowed towns people to contaminate the crime scene and handle the ax.
The only good buzzfeed channel
#postmortem : it doesnt make sense that the killer would haunt the house when we doesnt even know where they died. But maybe the house 'is' the monster and the house is the thing that made people do terrible things
For #postmortem :   Ryan and Shane, how do I get the ghosts' attention? I have been brutality ignored by them and had been given a blind eye every time, despite my family feeling their presence.
I don't know why but Shane's look weirdly reminds me of Edgar Allan Poe. There is just something about it.
If you could go back in time: would you go back to get answers or to stop the event? Knowing your actions have concequences, ie laws and whatnot.
From now on I will only address people as: HEY! FUCKO!
That "what is it" at 14:47 is a great evp. Gave me chills.
Ahhh! I wish they talked about this in Unsolved: True Crime! This murder is one in many similar murder cases, all committed by a man who traveled along the train system and killed families all across America. He was never caught, but there are theories of who it could be. The book "The Man From the Train" talks about the Villisca murders and the rest of the murders he committed, it's a great read for anyone interested in true crime!
its pigs in a blanket, cuz they were sleeping
Seeing Ryan didnt freak out over the light went off made me wanna say “you’re doing great sweetie” #postmortem
shane madej must be protected at all costs, love you ghoul chaps
Shane checking the rooms at night before bed for his girlfriend is so sweet! 😭😭
yeef
Mirrors are covered when someone dies, so their soul doesn't get trapped. I think they must have been drugged so that they slept
For #postmortem: Has anything happened to you guys or the rest of the crew with you guys at any of the locations that you didn’t catch on camera? Examples: hearing noises, doors opening, etc
“I’m looking for the killer! Hey! Fuck-o” literally cried 🤣🤣
The baconator....his calling card
When the ghost was heard saying "what is it?", do you think they were talking amongst themselves about the ghoul boys? How does shane explain the flashlight game? 😒 #PostMortem
3:23 is that eyes?
Hypothetically, what if it was someone the family knew & they let them into their home for dinner and they were then all drugged? That would explain why no one woke up while everyone was being killed, maybe the young girl who had a defensive wound barely ate dinner and therefore was drugged less? Also, did they investigate the brother enough? I feel like he could have been involved somehow. #postmortem
Uploaded same the same day that Logan from youtube chanel Observe uploaded part 2 of his body language of Ryan and Shane.  I think Logan really likes the Ghoul Boys - he is most likely their newest subscriber.
Axe^*
Love from Nepal 🇳🇵❤️❤️❤️
What if this was axeman of New Orleans-
To anyone who wants a better in depth backstory, watch the NEW episode about the house on Kindred Spirits it’s amazing
mary did it
I have bee told that a traveling preacher was in town. Some believe he did it. However there is no proof. It is puzzling that no one in the house heard anything.
Sounds like when the ghost said what is it they were talking about the audio box since it sounded close
Shane's just made the ultimate point. I sure dont want to sleep in a house where 8 people were axed.
The editing in this season is really, really good.
#postmortem Shane, how is Annabelle doing in your ribcage?
For #postmortem: I wonder if the killer had used some kind of drug or sedative to knock out the whole family? Maybe that's why he was able to "sneak around" and people inside without them waking. And maybe Lena (?)  somehow woke up mid-swing so she had defensive injuries?
I sure hope there’s a lady ghost in that house who’s up to date on pop culture so she can pull the “I am no man” line with Ryan
Needs more Professor
Since it's the final season, can we get a bloopers reel? #postmortem #prettyplease
Have you read the book "The Man From the Train" by Bill James? It really gets into the possibility of who the murderer was and connects them to other serious crimes committed by a man killing families with an ax and putting fabric over the mirrors all across the United States. It's really intriguing and I think you both would like it.
"I don't believe in ghosts but I do believe Iowa is haunted." Absolutely killed me right at the start.
For the postmortem - it was actually the wife Sarah who was the only one to be hit with the sharp part of the axe, her face was literally chopped up (gross i know) so there are a lot of theories about whether or not she was the target of the killers rage… many people also wonder if Lena was the main target because there are also theories that her body was moved in an attempt to SA her.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'd love to see shane and ryan camp out at a national park where people go missing, referring to "Missing 411"
“Except for the murderer… We do not want to party with you.” best line ever
I am sad that Ryan is becoming more confident as the series continues. I thought It was funny when he got scared, I feed off of his fear #Shaniac
Me: "I haven’t even watched this episode yet"  *posted 4 hours ago*
When the alleged spirit of the killer said putty I wondered if they already had putty back then so I googled and it said it was discovered around 1943. That part seems sus.
Yea it's admitting it likes to return to relive the killing. He enjoyed it or that's his punishment.
"how many skulls have you claimed in this turf war?" "Countless." Can confirm, Shane is a turf war war hero. We've got a statue of him  Source: I'm Illinoisan
Shane lay down on the floor "u can take a whack at me.. split in two"  Ghoul : yep this guy insane
#postmortem I enjoyed the tour and Shane's screeching, but why didn't y'all cover the theories, the trials, and the suspects of the murder?
#Postmordem This feels ceremonial, the individual approaches the "alter" (house), prepares the sacrifice (covers the faces and mirrors), commits the act. Then partakes in a "feast" post sacrifice.
Listen to the Morbid podcast 2 part episode on this place!
#postmortem ya know... when the spirit box said "release me" i heard "please leave" and when it said "hard to stop" i heard "it's because" both times i wasnt looking at the video because i'm doing something.. i still heard the same thing even with the translation on the screen. maybe they really are trying to communicate xD
the town marshall did it, he messed up the ax on purpose so it couldnt be solved
I think when we heard 8 it might be referring to 8 people the killer killed
#postmortem Ryan you said someone sat next to you, how would you test for that if you wanted to validate the experience?
For the #Postmortem: Hey guys big fan! I think the house is only 'haunted' by victims 'ghosts' and not the killer. Why would the killer stay back? And why was the father only hit by the sharp end and others blunt . Could it be a case of alien hand syndrome,  the father killed everybody and then himself.  Just a theory!   Or maybe it was the sheriff who did it , it's one thing to be bad at your job and another to just contaminate all the possible evidences ,with so many people visiting  the scene he could easily remove any incriminating evidence.  #Shaniac #HumansDoHorribleStuff #TheSheriffDidIt #Unsolved
Yea make sense he killed them all then himself. But doesn't mean he was himself 😖
I feel like Shane might have been a lil scared in this one 😏🧐
hope you guys do more of this outside of buzzfeed, think of all the haunted places outside the US. If there are any spirits, isnt it more likely they'd exist in countries with more than 400 years of modern history? js, it'd be a shame to waste the resources & platform you have, if you're serious about proving ghosts and the afterlife real that is🤔
finally, some iowa slander  sincerely, a fellow illinoisan (who lives very close to iowa and hates it)
BOOGARAS unite!! 😃  -you know like "Avengers Assemble" but better... 😳 👻 👽 😱 PS... did you finally break Shane during your commentary? It sounds like the flashlights finally pushed him over the edge. 😂
Ah yes my favourite two people ever
I've never been so late to a GhoulBoys episode. But in my defense I adopted a black kitten today. So...
Post Mortem question: I wonder if the murdered was a relative of the Moore family? Family strife can be a motivator for murder.
Ooh, the Morbid podcast just covered this. I highly recommend.
this house is indeed a real murder house.
has anyone ever asked how the ghosts are?
question for both ryan and shane: since the show is unfortunately coming to a close, what is the most scariest place either you have visited so far, or is it in a future episode..? love you both #postmortem #boogara #shaniac
that mannequin reflection in the studio when shane is talking is really creeping me out
#postmortem  how were the vibes in each of the rooms of the house? Did it feel like there were presence in each of the rooms????
the fact that dozens of people treated such a tragic event like an amusement park attraction is truly horrifying i genuinely can't imagine something like that happening
Yooo the one place I’ve been to in this whole series
Will you two continue ghost hunting after this show is over.
#postmortem  Ryan have you considered being a motivational speaker? The way you console yourself when you’re alone in a location , if turned into a speech would be pretty cool just saying now that this is over  #wewillmisssupernatural #wearewatcher
#postmortem :Shane, if you were ever scared or creeped out in a erie place or maybe just had felt a strange unsettling feeling that you never talked about, what place would it be? (it could be you being logically concerned as well :)) #shaniac
Maybe the bacon meant "pig in a blanket"
I didn’t see the bed move
27:20 💀🤣 that's how I approach ghosts, demons and "god."
9:28 HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Watching Shane's brain literally explode when Ryan asks why the flashlight thing isn't credible literally made my life! Ahahahaha!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That poor color blind & dyslexic ghost is super confused about what it did wrong with the flash lights....
I think the killer knew the family and stopped by and drugged their dinner somehow.  That would explain them all sleeping through it.
iowa sucks! indiana too!
19:29 that sounded more like “Follow me” than “Help me”
illinois ftw
For post Mortem. I have a client who used to live in Villisca and her and her daughter say the entire town and all the locals were very strange and off. Did you guys get the same vibe being in that town or no?
26:38 Shane and I think alike. I said this exact thing at 6:56. 😂🤷🏻‍♀️
#postmortem Just a thought, has it ever occurred to you guys that the spirit/s may be color blind and don't really know which color of flashlight is which? I wonder if some of the spirits you have possibly encountered are. Also, what would you call someone who is both a Boogara and a Shaniac
“Shockingly cut short” y’all-
That laugh at 29:00 🤣
please investigate the burari deaths in india i dare you :)
#postmortem I always thought this was the work of Henry Lee Moore an axe murder who was on the loose between 1911-1912 broke into people's houses and killed entire families with an axe. Its probably been looked into before but just a thought.
My hypothesis is that the giant hunk of wrapped bacon meat could have been used as a makeshift muzzle that kept them laying down and quiet before the murderer came down with the axe...? The towel around the meat could have been a way for the murderer to keep their grip on the greasy meat. 🤔🥓 What do you both think is the reason for the wrapped 2lb bacon? #postmortem
#postmortem . Ok so a whole family and no one moves but one?  It makes me think they were drugged. That way each one could be killed. The house was not secured after 8 people were axe murdered screams coverup.
So I have solved the case. They had a squatter (as you do) and he was possessed by a demon and he murdered all those people. The demon had the man stab himself and the spirit of the murder lingers cause that's where the worst thing he ever experienced happened.  Or the brother did it idk
OH NO! SHANE! HES BROKEN!
28:29 me @ the shibuuya incident hoping i would run into toji
As an iowan i was not expecting that ATTACK less then two minutes into the video
#postmortem During the many spirit box answers you got from the ghosts, did you hear different voices, besides the voice of a boy and girl?
That ghost pulled an uno reverse card on Johnny the caretaker
Imagine sleeping over at your friend's house expecting to have fun, braid each other's hair but what you get is an axe to the head instead
This episode has more evidence than every season together 🤣
I wish y’all covered this in True crime series
I request for the ghoul boys to have new ghost equipment since this is the final season,I hope they could have such thing as REMPOD or some kind of method like Estes Method to be able to reach out clearly.
26:10 Just barely now? I knew Shane was insane from the get-go and _that's_ why he's the perfect partner for you, Ryan.😂💁🏻‍♀️
I've been waiting for you guys to do this for years. My mom always tells me stories of when she grew up in that part of the state and their high school or something was close enough they'd have Halloween parties and lock ins every year.
For postmortem: was this place the most active house/place y’all have ever been to?
#postmortem 31:58 it kinda sounds like the ghost says, Eat me
do you guys ever feel like the reason less of the children spirits interact with the spirit box/the flashlights is because of them being intimidated by two grown men announcing themselves as the “ghoul brothers,” or do you think that shane’s good vibes comforts them in a way? #postmortem #boogara
Okay, the fact that some of the voices we hear sounds like young boys and girls is actually creeping me out
For post mortem: Why do you guys cut the spirit box when it gets good? Do you guys just not hear it because of how loud the scrambling channels are?  #postmortem #ryantists
shouldn't this go into the true crime seasons?
hell yeah, new episodes just in time for spooky season 😎
What is the device they use at 6:39?
Caretaker: I kick the door open and I scream. Nothing. Not. A thing. As soon as I do that . . . Me: You crap your pants
What’s the deal with axe murder houses?
You should've brought a very dangerous weapon into the bedroom alone and then attempt to provoke the 'ghosts' just like that one guy did
THERE’S A BOOBAH TOY IN THE CLOSET LMAO
This place is only 45 minutes away from my town and we go there on field for school but because of COVID my class didn’t get to go still love the history of it and have been wanting you to cover it
That "help me" "stop me" felt really sad.
#postpartum, What if this the axe man's doing.
The morbid girls just coved this on their podcast!
for post mortem: theory about the bacon, maybe the ax murderer brought it to deal with possible dogs as a bait of sorts?
24:42 As Ryan finished saying that the man tried to "provoke the spirits," I knew it would be followed by Shane saying something, but to my amusement, he said like Genie from Aladdin. Was expecting it, but also surprised at the same time. 😂
I live in Iowa and it's eerie and gloomy and it really sucks.  I think the whole state is cursed.
For postmortem: Incase Shane abandoned Ryan again, whats in store for next week?
I’m so heartbroken 💔 this is the end. An unwanted breakup unlike the ones where u can’t wait to dump there a$$. This is a sad one 😞. My nights will never b d same 🖤.
johnny houser seems like a swell lad.
#postmortem:how do you feel about your growth in the ghost hunting world also hope you guys have a good day😄
“My name is Shane, I’m looking for the killer—HEY FUCKO”
putty wasnt invented till 1942 or 1943 and so the ghost person lied
That many people and it seems like noone heard anything. Weird. You'd think they would be able to fight back. There was more then one intruder and a gun was also involved.
not gonna lie, real suspicious that the town marshall was like "everyone come and grab onto this murder weapon real quick!!!" especially when fingerprinting was already a thing then
My theory on the bacon is that the killer was expecting for it to attract flies or even rats so they would eat the bodies and leave less evidence
What if, on the night of the murder, the murderer heard Ryan and Shane trying to communicate with him? The "ghosts/spirits" you were talking to would feel like YOU'RE the ghost/spirit haunting them.  In fact, what if all the supernatural evidences out there, specifically footsteps, tapping, voices and things moving were just happening because two different timelines overlapped for a few brief seconds at those moments?
For #postmortem but do you think the town marshal was the killer? Why else would he let an active crime scene be contaminated and ruin their chances of finding a serial killer?
#PostMortem What are the guidelines that you guys typically set for the spirit box? Specifically what settings do you find get the best results and how do you go about discerning what is “evidence” and what is “radio static”? #BoogarasAllTheWay
I love Ryan’s line: “I am one of the most feared ghost hunters”
Town Marshall did it
This is one that could have been part of both Unsolved: Supernatural and True Crime.   Villisca Axe Murder House, which is a national landmark, is nortorious and  infamous for being an unsolved mass murder site and for being the site of dark hauntings.   We will never know what happened that fateful night and the house will always be stained by the tragedy that befell it.
Guys We in CT Love you! Hope you guys continue to Spook hunt!! Love your Stuff!!
Town Marshall did it.
Wrong it's a charge or energy or the absorb the energy to turn it off
22:16 get you an S.O. that cares about you enough to go around checking every room in the house before bed. 😍
I just recently investigated this location my experience was quick bursts like a child it would interact with an item a couple times then get bored so really hard to record
I love your channel I just want to see a spotted you on the TV show ellie swapped I think you're both really good actors
for #postmortem: since this is the last season of supernatural, did you guys find some nice compelling evidence?
im sorry but the slow reveal of just a chonk of bacon wrapped in a towel at 5:20 sent me
#postmortom big believer here, I gotta ask, Shane why you don’t? I mean Ryan got lots of proof
With Unsolved ending I really hope we get a new Watcher series something along the lines of Watcher Solves, where it’s basically the same structure but instead of the episodes ending with “xxx for now will remain unsolved” we just get the a puppet saying “Shane and Ryan have cracked this one. Ted Cruz is the zodiac killer. Solved!” Or “there ain’t no ghosts here, the Warrens were just frauds, Solved!”
Boys, do you think the voice on the box could be the killed and was compelled to murder somehow? Maybe the house itself is cursed and predates the murders.
That is incredibly eerie that the gash in the wall is still there...
17:14 BooBah spotted
How are these houses so clean? Even the conjuring one
For #postmortem : How come with most ghost sightings or evidence, the ghosts are relatively modern. Why are there never any cavemen ghosts wandering around grunting? #shaniac
Yay THE BOYS!!!!
For PM: 90% sure Shane just has such strong demonic energy, all other spirits don’t dare to make themselves known in his presence.
I’m sorry but the “what is it” made my heart stop it was so clear wtf there usually just weirds sounds
What the f^ck I live like an hour away from here and had no idea regardless of literally hearing about this house before. Road-trip soon.
Yo I commented to go over this mystery a while back and here it is thank you so much
Ryan is slowly becoming a Shaniac. I love it!
Literally listened to a podcast about this today
I'm from Iowa and I fight Shane for the Midwest title
the slab of meat came from the family's freezer, and i think its been theorized that it was used for um. certain acts. if you know what i mean
For #postmortem I think the ghost only talk to Ryan when using the spirit box which Proofs this theory I have that ghost only reach out to people who believe in them which can explain why it didn’t say anything when Shane was holding the spirit box
At 31:22, I kept thinking I saw a person sleeping there. But I do have bad vision, so my mind could’ve made that up.
What are you doing after this season is done?
Love a good True Crime & Supernatural crossover
#postmortem What gets me, is if this was personal to the family themselves, then why choose a night where they have 2 other guests, victims or witnesses?
I LOST IT at 9:30 I cackled like an idiot for a while
Is this the case that one of the suspect linked to the hinterkaifeck murder case?
Shane is one of those people like my dad who did surgery. Cuts people  open everyday to save them. It really desensitizes a person. 😂. Anyway I think the late great Urologist is either a ghost or singing in heaven right now.  It's harder to scare people who are just watching and are not there in the dark in person. If you go looking for it as vulnerable people, you tend to "feel more". I have not experienced such either. Was Shane's voice shaking a tad? LOL he knows no ghost would be able to penetrate that big, thick ☠ of his. I think he should go with Ryan and go with the kids at the Johnson /Wilson House in Vermont. Mucho activity there. Ghosts, spirits a😁and what not would bounce right off. So much for contacting them. 💖the 👻👻👻👻👻 Boyz! Way to end the season. Man up, Ryan.
They gotta quit using pop culture references when trying to talk to a dude from 100 years ago
Honestly I think you have both the murdered and the murderer in that house. I also think that the voice who asked what was that is the wife.
ive been asking for this episode for years and now i wish i hadn't.... ive been there and all the video evidence of ghosts has me like 👁👄👁 i welcomed the devil into my life!!!!!!
Yea this house would freak me out too 😱😱😱
Why is this the Last season?!!!!!!!!!????
The word 'Villisca' makes me uncomfortable. I'm squirming now.
Shane didn't notice the CLAW MARKS all around his head on the floor of the kids room???
Can I be on a Q+A
hmm..so maybe why no ghosts ever show up is because shane is either controlling them and telling them to stay away..or the fact that shane's a demon, the ghosts are all scared to show.
The house has the same creepy half moon shaped windows that the amityville horror house had.
Omg Morbid JUST did a couple episodes on this but that won’t stop me from listening to the history again
Why would you think the ghost of the murder is there?
#postmortem: If you had to haunt one of the places you've investigated, which place would it be?
Shane there’s no science behind any of this! That’s the beauty of it!
FINALLY IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
12:18 The shade.  the shade of it all. Love it! 😂🤣
#postmortem Can y'all talk about some of the possible suspects? What are some possible motives for someone to want to kill this family, did they have any enemies, or was it totally random? I know it's not the season for true crime but it seems like something worth mentioning.
So everyone laughed when Ryan said he was the most feared ghost hunter tight?
Why do like none of the houses they visit ever have power or electricity?
I wanna know Shane's reaction to that voice that said " what is it " ... please 🥺
Anyone know what kind of boots Ryan is wearing? I really like them
this is insane!! I was just down in that area for a wedding and talked about this place with my dad! what a coincidence you're there just after I go back home heh
What if the one saying "stop me" was the killer, and he was forced to do the murders or something like that, he wasn't enjoying it
Can't believe how perfectly this lined up with Morbid just finishing their two parter on Villisca
Shane really went "if you hear hooves, think horses not zebras", or whatever the doctors say
Ryan, for the sheets over the mirrors, there is an old idea that if you cover the mirrors when someone dies you prevent them from being trapped in the mirror and allow the spirits to pass to the other side with ease. Maybe he didn't want to risk the family staying around and haunting him?
Both here &watcher 😍😍
ive been a boogara just because in a world of infinite possibilities, why rule ghosts out. that being said I heard a quote that is a very solid argument for shaniacs.. if ghosts were real and could hurt people, there would be alot less white people
"If we do it enough times, it'll be perfect"
#postmortem have you guys thought about getting more reliable flashlights?
I don't believe in ghosts, but this story is a damn tragedy. Murdering children is disgusting and repulsive.
Why dont they use that other spirit box that they used for their friends house. That worked better
Shane's turf war skull collection.
I love that someone had the Boobah in the closet face away from them lol
wow i never thought you go to iowa for a episode
The Moore family standing in the corner like: "Well they're not talking to us so we'll just keep quiet" 🤷‍♀️🤦‍♀️
I gotta admit, I kinda miss Ryan’s screams.
Doesn't ax have an e in it (axe) or can it be either way or is it just the deodorant?
#postmortem Is there a reason you guys don't use the Ovilus more often in your investigations? I feel like you've captured some pretty compelling evidence with that tool.
26:52 exactly my question!! Why would the killer stay there if he died somewhere else? Btw, how did Lena and Ina's parents deal with that?
Those mattresses look awfully new to be the "actual beds"...
They did it!!! They went to my favorite supernatural house ever!!!! I can’t believe it!!!
So happy for new videos.
mannn im gonna miss this series when theyre done with it.
Nobody’s gonna talk about how the knife guy got checked in with his parents but then said he was alone
Town marshal was the killer, letting people handle them is a smart move
#Post Mortem  How fast were both of ur hearts beating during the spirit box sessions . (BTW im new to doing this and also a #Shagara) 😅
6:56 why would the murderer be haunting their own crime scene?
Did everyone have that cassette storage case?
Shane: I bring good vibes   also Shane: FUCC U GOATMAN!!!!
Why are we dismissing the flashlight situations so easily? If you leave it on in your house, it doesn’t turn on and of by itself. What more proof do you need that that is not normal???
#postmortem what theories do you guys have about who murdered the family?
7:17 lmfaoo he said WHO? 🤨
I would pay so much money to see Ryan revisit the sallie house
#Postmortem At 14:17, the recorder picked up a voice saying 'What is it? and I'd say it's probably the clearest recording I've heard on this show, did Shane listen to it? Do you think it's a bit of proof that ghosts are real? We're gonna covert you into a believer of ghosts before the season ends!!
I am seriously so upset this is the last season. I really hope they continue this on The Watcher! Poor Buzzfeed, this is all they had left.
I feel like all the seasons combined have a pretty compelling case for Ryan.
31:29 i heard a noise in the back.
Sounded like “Malcolm Brady” to me
Gotta turn the lights off for these guys.
Spirit: *Switch.* Shane: Okay? Spirit: *Oh my god, that voice…it’s him. It’s really him, what is he doing here, as a human!?*
I literally just listened to the Morbid podcast episode about this
I will never be on board with the spirit box.
I would kill to come to this house
"you do what you do to make ur gf feel safe" BRO THAT WAS SO SWEET WHAT
I believe the killer covering the mirrors before the killing might be so the victims souls don’t get trapped in the mirror
i may be a nebraskan, but i sleep better at night knowing shane and other Illinois folks share our disdain for Iowa.
I have been waiting for this location forever. Can’t believe no evidence was caught. Why didn’t you stay over night ?
So nice to see Ryan’s confidence after all this time. He handled that solo mission like a pro :D #postmortem
As a nice person in Iowa I can assure you I have never seen a ghost or anything paranormal, so as a Shaniac I feel betrayed
@BuzzFeed Unsolved Network Ryan, it’s been 7 seasons. Do you ever fake your reactions when you enter a haunted place? And Shane, are you a little bit unnerved when you enter a haunted area alone?
I'm watching this alone and I have to say that this is by far the scariest Season of buzzfeed Unsolved. I was shitting bricks in the speculation about the killer's mean's of entry
Omg nooo not Shane shitting on my state 😭
14:46 Why does the voice sound so much like Brent?? IS BRENT THE AXE-MURDERER??? #postmortem ????
I feel like I would have gone in there and just went off.  They should have done more agitating to try and get a big result.
NEW BFU VIDEO FROM 4 HOURS AGO -- time to watch
Ryan, upon entering any haunted place “How the frick did I end up here?”
You should do a reality tv show where you spend 3 months living at a haunted location
Unicorns were actually real, an ancestor of modern day rhinos.
the 'what is it' at 14:46 just sounds like 'lettuces', so maybe the ghosts are just making a grocery list 😅
glad the boys are back at it ... and that house is just plain spook fest
Are ghosts real? after seeing a few seasons of this show...the answer is...no.
I live 2hrs away in Des Moines and I've always wanted to visit this place.
why... why would the ghost of the murderer be in the house??
#postmortem What if the killer is the Mayor, and that’s why he let people play with the axe, to get rid of any finger print evidence.
As a fellow Illinoian, I absolutely agree with Shane, Iowa has always been sketchy 😒
I’ve been waiting forr the ultimate duos
For Post Mortem: how exactly do the flashlights that y’all use work?  Also, is there anything legally keeping Shane from continuing the Hot Daga, or has he just not felt like it.  Keep up the great work y’all, I’ll miss this show!
are we not going to talk about how creepy the audio recordings were and especially the clear ones?
8:23 "THER BEDS"
for #postmortem : Shane,  has there been a moment across all the seasons where it has been hard for you to come up with a rational explanation, or made you question the existence of ghosts?
I always amaze me that the flashlights turning on and off doesn't creep them out.  Flashlights don't normally turn on and off if it's just sitting there.  So obviously something is affecting them.  But it's like just a casual little game they play with ghosts now.
sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh FU sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh   !!!!!
#postmortem I lived in Iowa for 4 years (originally from Chicago). And let me say Iowans are so repressed emotionally that truly any of them could snap at any moment and axe murder an entire family. And since they’re all related to each other, they’ll protect that “nice” axe murderer.
#PostMortem “what is it?” sounds like something one of the victims could have asked another if they heard movement, presumably before being reassured and going back to sleep.
are the camera people shaniacs?
Ryan isn't Ryan in this episode. Just sayin 😊
Honestly whoever watches these guys has to 👏 applaud the lack of bs, not trying to freak out at every little thing. Love Ryan, and Shane.
#postmortem Hey also check out the burari death case there is a documentary in Netflix recently about the burari death case the documentary is called ‘house of secrets’
if shane doesnt claim this house like he did the Goatman (Former) Bridge i swear-
#Postmortem If the spirit box just flips through radio channels, aren't all the "speech" sounds that come from it just bits and pieces of things on the radio? Also, the noise coming  from the spirit box is VERY annoying there must be a less irritating way to call a ghost.
Ooh boyyy this one is spicyyy (but I’m still a #shaniac)
IM SCREAMING IVE BEEN THERE AHHHH
New ghost theory; Ghosts are all short and therefore indimdated by Shane's height and attitude. Living short people are feisty, but being murdered might change that attitude around ya know.
Spirit: “Switch.” Also Spirit when Shane holds the spirit box: “‘Aight, I’mma head out.”
#postmortem Shane do these locations ever unnerve you? Regardless of whether or not you believe in ghosts, does the idea of being in the same place where at some point something really terrible happened upset you a little? I’m super paranoid so I feel like if I was there I would have an irrational fear that I was about to meet the unpleasant end of an axe. #boogara
How was Ryan and Shane LITERALLY 3 HOURS FROM ME
This episode is a like a two in one, True Crime and Supernatural. ✨
This episode more than any other made me realize the two of them are like antitherapists, they really walk into these people's homes and keep bringing up major trauma
can someone make a compilation of ryan and shane being fruity for each other at least once bro
for #postmortem : the fact that Josiah was the only one to get the sharp end of the axe me think that the killer had a soft spot for him or something. Getting cleaved by an axe is probably a much quicker and less painful death than being bludgeoned- but its also completely possible that the killer wanted to get the strongest person in the house out of the way. Could it be possible that it was a relative of Josiah's? Thank you guys so much for all of your hard work! #boogara , but #shaniacs make some pretty good points too haha.
Well if the bed that ryan was sitting on move by itself I'm suppose that the murderer could had snuck in the house from under the bed just my guess I mean who knows there could be a secret underground door under the bed where ppl could just sneak into the house without anyone knowing
#postmortem about the sheets covering the mirrors, it was a tradition back then when someone died they would cover the mirrors with sheets to prevent their spirit from being trapped on earth instead of going to heaven, this might explain why this person did it but still weird …. also love you guys !
Ryan! Please tell what are the boots you are wear!!
#postmortem why didn't you sleep in the house?
What if the sheriff killed them and contaminated the axe evidence on purpose? Might be a stretch and if I'm being honest my logic is just bacon=pig, pig=cop, cop=sheriff, but it's still smth to think about I guess
Ryan: I dare them to try and split us up Shane and Ryan: Can't be done  Shane: We are Ghoul brothers  Ryan: that's a bond that lasts forever  Awwwwww🥰  Also Ryan and shane Ryan: Unicorns aren't real. Ghosts are real  Shane: screeches in disbelief
it would have been great if this place was haunted by the 2 pounds of bacon. tasty ghosts are the best ones
think the murderer was the marshal
"again with the meer" - ryan, 2021
14:87 sounds more like "let us in" to me which is... well...
I'm glad that Shane made it clear to the murderer that they weren't invited to party with them
Lmao! Oh man.
Tis the season to be spooky 😈
that evp in sarah and josiahs room was terrifying
Shane- this thing sucks..😂
for the #postmortem , Ryan, is there ever a time you were scared of a place you went to for a reason other than anything “paranormal”? if so, what was the strongest incident of this? #Shaniac
#post mortum  Do you think the killer was anyone in the law enforcement? I find it odd that in so many cases that law enforcement is either lazy or does nothing in these unsolved cases
For #postmortem: I have watched so many of your episodes but not a single time did a ghost do what you asked them to do except turn off and on a flashlight. My conclusion, ghosts are too lazy to do your bidding. I was also curious if Ryan had met the other Ryan Bergara from the Philippines
for #postmortem: I was thinking what if the bacon was used as a gag or something to stop them from screaming and he dropped it while the girl was struggling ?
The killers calling card is pigs in a blanket. Sorry not sorry
Not me living in Iowa 🥴🥴🥴🥴
anyone else just listen to the morbid podcast about this but watch this anyways lmao
Thought I saw something 29:46 - 48 behind Ryan
There were so many sweet moments in this episode 🥺
why do they have flashlights that don't function correctly? do they need new batteries?
#postmortem The murderer might be someone they know and trust enough to willingly allow inside, thus the absent signs of forced entry. Covering the mirrors and the victims’ faces may show that the killer was ashamed of what they were doing, and the strange presence of ham in the victims’ rooms may be a sign of the killer’s psychosis. The fact that the killer ate after the murders were done may mean that they felt like what they were doing was normal or necessary, as it’s usually difficult for people to eat when they’re distressed.   If I may propose a theory, the killer may have been doing what they think is a mercy kill, believing that the victims were possessed or something similar, and so they split the victims’ heads open to free the spirits or demons. It would make sense in this time period, if the people are clueless enough to let strangers contaminate the crime scene before investigating what would be an unsolved murder.
Shane-- as an Iowan, my turf war has always been with Nebraska. But now? It's on, baby. Y'all better have fun hiding out in your fancy Chicago penthouses, because we're ready to children of the corn your asses.
For the postmortem: hi ghoul boys! I was just wondering why you guys stopped using the Ovilus on investigations! Thanks for being your kooky selves & happy spooky season!
You get a pass Shane, we always get a bad wrap lol
i don’t think Shane still believes ghost aren’t real after this one,  i think now he’s a ghost cop trying to catch the bad guy.   it’s a supernatural true crime cross over
Kinda have mixed feelings about this last season. I know for the most part it is “scary comedy” but it feels like they are more or less just trying to make fun and have joke after joke then take it “seriously”. Still love their content
are the thumbnails with the blacked out eyes for the people accurate?
#postmortem was there a female on the crew for this investigation? If not how do you explain this one tall bean 🧐
im gonna have tobwatch a tourist trapped after this one foks, what a mistake it was for me, someone with a deep fear of home invasion, to watch this in a dark quiet house on a Friday night
Awww, born and raised in Iowa. You guys are awesome for doing this 🏠... I wondered if you would.
Ryan, was there ever any theories or any thoughts on the slab of bacon wrapped in a towel? Thanks!
Supernatural & True Crime two-for-one
10:00 ryan was lowkey turned on by authoritative shane, notice the wink at 10:09
For #postmortem - Dear ghoul boys, why do u believe people are afraid of ghosts? Shouldn't it bring comfort that it would mean there's an after life?  Ghosts can't hurt or touch anyone, are we just scared of the unknown? Seeing a ghost walk down the street would prove there's something after this life, but who knows. #thanks
Postmortem - what did you hear that wasn’t captured on audio?
I remember Bailey sarians video on this
The bacon could have been in case the family had a dog, and simply fell out of his pocket. A dish rag would make it like a dog toy as well. Just a thought, love you guys, gonna miss you!! 😭👻
31:49 why does it look like someone is behind Ryan? Maybe my eyes are playing tricks on me but I keep making out this whitish silhouette of head and shoulders behind him. Or is it a doll? #postmortem
Man how I am gonna miss Ryan's "Are ghosts real?" And Shane shaking his head.🙁
"Ghosts aren't real" but "IOWA IS HAUNTED".... by what, Shane????? BY WHAT!??!? YOU!?!?!?
For #postmortem: Could the wrapped bacon be a clue left by the murderer? I wonder if the family had beef with the butcher or something and the butcher paid a hitman to take them out.
Ryan, did at any time feel like someone was actually there?
They could've found DNA, today,  on the cigarettes and stuff, if they preserved the crime scene better.  Of course it would have to be traced to great, great, grandchild but that would've been awsome!
Yalll really feeding us with this content😩😩😩
"It doesn't feel right being in there alone."  Hearing that from Shane is terrifying. Not necessarily because it means that ghosts or a malicious spirit is there, but because it confirms what the housekeeper said about the house having a negative effect on people's mental states.
Shane had a good point though, how did people come to the conclusion that the murderer is haunting the house. Is it like a comic hell thing where his soul trapped there because of what he did? Did the murderer kill himself there? Quéstions. #boogara
#postmortem I have so many questions I think id need a whole buzzfeed unsolved true crime for these murders. No way you kill 8 people brutally with an axe and make a dent in the wall that can be seen 100 years later and nobody in the house wakes up? and the weird oddities like the mirrors being covered up and 2 pounds of bacon on the ground and then the killer making himself some food. Just doesnt make sense
I do believe that the killer was a person who knew the house very well, most likely a close friend.  Could it be a guy who had mental issues and had feelings for the wife?  What if he killed the whole family out of jealousy?  Or what if it was the husband's brother?
So the family may have been drugged at the picnic/service by a neighbor with a gripe, a farmer or butcher or  something, so when they got home they all fell into a deep sleep where the killer butchered them in their sleep?
I'm gonna go ahead and assume that this is not the #1 scary place in America considering we have places like Detroit.
Have you guys heard of the  Hinterkaifeck murders? Some people connect the Villisca and the Hinterkaifeck murders  to  other similar murders ...
I dont understand how their flashlights always turn off. I've never in my life had a flashlight randomly turn off. Are ya'll buying dollar tree flashlights?
That 19:10 bit cracked me up 😂👌
Morbid Podcast covered this case this week and knowing what the bacon was supposedly used for is......not great
I love how Ryan refers to Shane as “my big tall friend”
9:29 he finally mentally *snapped.*
‘just as an example like me make a little’ *STOMPS*
do you think the rustling on the bed could’ve been a rat or something similar?
This seems like a lot more activity than usual honestly, and consistent sayings of things that make sense
Anyone a fellow Iowan???
I would have bolted the moment the "stop me" happened.   Jesus.
12:48 *”The motive for the murders was unclear, as there was no evidence of a robbery or any other reason why [they] would have been targeted.”*  Of course not, there was nothing but bacon and death in that house.
"That's what makes me question if the killer snuck in". RYAN. RY AN. IT WAS 1912. ITS NOW 2021. OF COURSE THE HOUSE IS GONNA CREAK A TON IT'S A HUNDRED PLUS YEARS OLD, MY GUY. THE HOUSE WOULDVE BEEN YOUNG AND NEW BACK THEN LOLL😭😂😂😂
27:24 “HEY FUCKO!” 😂😂😂😂😂😂
It was the sheriff
it honestly seems like the murderer was, for whatever reason, hyper fixated on this murder and he just couldn't stop himself from continuing. when they're in the children's room, he asks ryan and shane to help him stop. this makes sense bc if he was covering mirrors, it seems like he was remorseful about the fact that he couldn't stop. i think it's the murderer that's haunting the house. to me, it all lines up
That “Release me” gave me chills
I think the mirrors were covered because of the belief that the spirit could get trapped in it. Seems like whoever the murderer was highly superstitious.
Yo what was that thing behind Ryan when he was alone in the attic at the end of the episode. I know it wasn’t ghostly or anything cause ghosts don’t exist #shaniac, but still looked creepy as hell
it's been so many seasons of the ghoul boys but that slenderman mannequin still freaks the f out of me
Cant be done. We're ghoul brothers. lol.
Shane scared? Omg and this is the last season.
Literally watching this during a thunderstorm in the middle of the night, and the EVPs and spirit box replies are just giving me goosebumps.
I don’t necessarily believe in ghosts. But I do believe when something traumatic and unexpected happens, there can be echos of that event. This episode really struck me, the killer thinking he’s unable to stop killing, the woman’s voice “what is it?” Perhaps rolling over to ask her husband when she hears a noise. Just that this unseen event can have echos like this is heart wrenching.
“Or he missed breakfast” Shane’s facial expressions after Ryan said that is too much 😂 5:47
This felt like a true crime episode AND a supernatural episode. Also: Boogaras: zilch / Shaniacs: 50😎
Kinda eerie how the spirit box voice was exactly the same every time...which, given how a spirit box works, is quite unlikely
Guys I'm a huge fan, love every episode, but the one thing that kinda bugs me is how every time you guy use the spirit box, you guys sorta tend talk so much that goulies cant get a word in edgewise...  every time y'all ask a question you dont really give "them" time to answer or you talk over the response (albeit with hilarious witty banter) but yea.... maybe it's just the editing in which case disregard and continue to do great things!!!  Ok that is all...  🙃👻🙊🤫💜
The killer covering the mirrors with cloth can be something like, he doesn't want to see himself being a murderer.
I heard that you talk a lot if you are scared
As a resident of Iowa I can tell you Iowa is haunted… still better than Illinois tho
17:16 I have the exact same purple toy! It’s from the show BoohBah from 2003!
It's a very old tradition, you put a cloth over the mirror in the house of the deceased to keep from their spirit being caught in the mirror itself? Perhaps the killer was supersitious? Very strange to feel remorse over people you just murdered.
For #Postmortem: This is for Ryan. Out of all the season’s of Buzzfeed supernatural, what are your top 3 places that have scared you the most and why.
For #postmortem:  Why do ghosts never haunt places where people have fun? its always somewhere perceived as being a scary place. If i were a ghost, id haunt the bar, or a rave
#Postmortem #Boogara  did anything take place in the basement of the house?
For the postmortem: how loud were the attic floors? I wonder how no one heard this guy hiding in their attic
About the mirror coverings: some cultures/religions believe spirits can get trapped in mirrors, so after someone passes (or if they know someone is about to pass in the home) they will cover the mirrors to try to avoid trapping the spirit. Whether that can override the horror of something that happened trapping spirits is a whole other conversation #postmortem
Four more episodes, I am not emotionally ready for this to end! :'(
The theory that the killer was hiding in the attic gave me chills😳
honestly i can't take the spirit box seriously - it runs through radio frequencies and it often sounds like talk shows coming through. like the same voice could easily be just a radio show host and it just manages to 'seep through' loool
they remind me of shawn and gus from psych
Who hangs laundry at 5 am?is that a thing?
It would be pretty funny if for the season finale, they go back to the Sallie House!
IOWA: Idiots Out Walking Around
3 hours ago, that's legit 1 AM for me- HOW TIMED IT IS OH MY GOD
Do you ever think when you invoke the spirits or leave them offerings you are giving them more power? I bet annabell is practically a god by now
I want vintage murder bacon
The spirit box is getting a lot of recognition this episode!  Edit: At 14:43, when you picked up a voice in the Moores' bedroom, I heard "Let us in" instead of "What is it?" Spookey!
#postmortem. Hey Shane! I have a question. Has any unexplainable thing happened at any of these places? Which place would you say is most likely haunted if ghosts exist. You can answer either or both of these questions. It would be much appreciated #shaniac #lovingthenewseason #ghoulbrothers
for #postmortem :  who do you think committed the murders? is it possible it was someone involved in law enforcement ?
He don't care he want you to leave anyway
I really want to see you guys do the burari deaths
*He was able to sneak around because it wasn’t creaky 100 years ago*
Had to be someone short for that axe to hit at that spot on the wall.
The murderer sounds like he has a lot of the aspects of a sociopath. He has a way he does this stuff. He's covering things up I think and made himself some food, well that could be that he just sees this as a normal day. He went to work, cleaned up, had a good meal and left. Despite using an axe, he seems very meticulous about how he went about everything. As to how people were not awoken, that could just be because they were all one shot kills and he probably snuck in very quietly.
As an Iowan, I can say that Iowa is far superior to Illinois BECAUSE of our hauntings. Nowhere else can you find so much space for ghosts to roam.
i love you guys :)
What if the Marshall let others touch the axe to cover up his own actions
Hey, ghoul boys!  Love the show's fantastic run. Sad to see it in! for the #postmortem, seeing how this is the final season, I always wondered if the flashlights were tampered with or adjusted in a way similar to this https://youtu.be/wqNwGeXTQJk, by either crew or by Shane or Ryan. I feel like Shane had more to say on this topic.
Fake as fook
it's probably been mentioned elsewhere, but mirrors and windows have spiritual significance in many cultures.  You open a window to let the soul out after someone dies/let their ancestors come to take them away.  Mirrors are also considered spiritual portals and depending on the religion or culture, they're covered after a death (or just in general) to keep souls or spirits from entering the place or, alternately, to keep them from leaving the place.  Along those lines, doors were also left unlocked so a spirit can pass on, and buddy said NOPE to that as well.  Though it may not have been reflective (NOT an intentional pun) of the Moore's faith --the wiki said they were at a Presbyterian church that night-- it could be the killer was intentionally trying to keep the spirits of these people from passing on, even if just symbolically based on his/her own beliefs... which is spiteful AF.  No clue about the bacon.  The covering of the faces could be seen as a sign of respect, though it was mostly likely out of superstition, with eyes also being believed to be portals and even the belief that the soul escapes through the mouth.
Good old parlor tricks
#postmortem Ryan, do you believe in the spirit box? Have you ever seen or heard of anything that you genuinely believe shows spiritual use? As I’m with Shane on this tool. #Shaniac
19:39 i heard “Frederick”
Wait...wait...wait...did u guys just add make up & hair budget?? 'cause y' all look fiiiiiine #postmortem
Props to Ryan for not screaming at all while doing his solo investigation!! Despite being a shaniac, I don't think I would've been that calm LOL #PostMortem
Iowa is definitely haunted
you hear "I'm miserable", I hear "capitalism"  ... same difference
Just as a prediction, the person responsible for the killings here was more than likely the "Axeman" from New Orleans. #postmortem
Not me watching this at 3am 😅
Watching this at 3 am and lights off is very scary
For the #Postmortem: Shane how do you explain the audio recording in a empty room of a voice saying clearly “What is it?” Seems like pretty compelling evidence to mr. #Boogara #Ghostarerealgetoverit
Wow you guys are really there!  It's on my bucket list :)
Not me laughing when Ryan says he’s one of the most feared ghost hunters around
6:51 sounds like "I'm Giuseppe" #postmortem #shaniac
are you ok
theirs no reason the murdered ghost would be at the house only the victims right?
For #postmortem - Dear Ryan, what if we are the ghosts?
For postmortem: If you were were famous serial killers what would your names be and what would be your weapon of choice?🤫😈
Ryan: "How'd I get myself into this" Ahh I've missed this haha
My question for #postmortem - Dear Ryan, if ghosts were real, & there's been billions of people who have died on this earth, do you think we are constantly surrounded by ghosts no matter where we are? Or do some stay & some pass on somewhere else? Is there animal & bug ghosts running around?
"In fact, I am one of the most feared ghost hunters alive."  Now that's a mood.
Did not realize this place was in my home state!  For #postmortem, was there ever any theories about who could have committed this crime?
Illinois should've went bankrupt
I hope they understand how much energy it takes these ghosts to do things like turn flashlights on and off. That’s pretty good proof. They (whoever it was) literally tried their best lol
#postmortem: I know you guys have a list for this season but you guys should go to The Queen Mary again since there’s a chance that nobody may visit it again. Room B340 is an actual room unlike the time you two went. I thought I should mention it, anyways good start to the season.  #Bergaras #Ghoulboys
That "what is it?" whisper is disturbing clear.
Shane is FRIIIKINNNG CRAZYYYY
9:29 when I have a perfect chain of spells to execute in MTG and the opponent uses cancel.
Why is no one talking about the bed moving? That's one of the few pieces of evidence they've shown that's sent chills down my spine 😬
could've ended the entire series at 9:27
I was so underwhelmed when I went to this house. I got no spooky vibes. Of course it was during the day
For #postmortem this is kind of like the axeman incident just wanted to say
Ryan, do you believe there is a time limit on a haunting? Do ghosts eventually get to move on or are they doomed to stay here forever?
23:04 damn we got a hamilton fan in here ⁉️ /j
22:56 it sounds like he said a little bit. he could’ve been saying that or I’m miserable #postmortem
Shane seemed kinda scared this episode, thats kinda more terrifying
Postmortem: What if the bacon was put there when all the people who entered the house got a show for free!
What if the murderer is the town leader and he purposely let the citizens hold the axe to ruin his fingerprints or something lol xD
What if ghosts can't see color guys? How are they suppose to know what blue and black is huh? 🤣
Dear Ryan, why you gotta get my hopes up in the post mortem saying this episode was full of evidence, and then give us 34 minutes and 30 seconds of absolutely nothing? Not cool man, not cool. Sincerely, A Deserting Boogara #postmortem
YYEEAAAAA WE GOT BEEF!
I dont get it. I yell at my flashlight and it doesn't turn on and off??
These are actually tourist attractions rather than haunted places let's be honest.
Honestly, the consistency of the murderer's vibes via the spirit box is asounding, with the constant "stop me"'s and the "im miserable"
Why did you ask the killer questions?🤔🤔
#postmortem I half expected this place to be a supernatural/true crime double feature. Did you find many suspects in your research?
13:30 It's really amazing & fascinating the ax mark is still on the wall from that night over 100 yrs ago. From someone raising it above their head & than chopping at a person in bed. That does actually creep me out
YES THE VILLISCA AX MURDER HOUSE....... GODS I HAVENT EVEN STARTED IT AND IM HYPED YES
I think Ryan has a spiritual energy about him. That's y he experiences the ghost evidence when Shane doesn't.
Coffee, check. ✔ Cookie, check. ✔ Buzzfeed Unsolved, check. ✔
I'm curious if Ryan would ever be willing to go to a life regression hypnotherapist.
The part about the caretaker hearing someone enter the house and enter the two girls’ room, but see no one in there was creepy af. It reminds me of those scenes from the Conjuring or AHS when ghosts/spirits reinact the events in death…. 😬🥶
For the post mortem: Ryan, why are you so sure that unicorns don't exist? I don't think they do either, but I'm curious as to your reasoning!
Josiah be more what?
(yeef)
I'm now perpetually on edge because of what Ryan said in the last post-mortem about evidence this season.
Oh my gosh I went there a few years ago! We visited their graveside as well and thought the blowback marks in the ceiling were insane.
"I'm one of the most feared ghost hunters" lolz 😆
14:46 wow that's so clear
29:45 lmfao
maybe the town Marshall was the killer and let everyone touch the axe to hide his own finger prints?
Good ima miss these guys!!!! I grew up watching these two bruh living legends
You guys should go to sloss furnace next
So the Town Marshal allowed the evidence to be ruined. Yeah the Town Marshal did it.
am i the only one that is enjoying shane being somewhat calm and respectful when talking to the ghosts? you guys have never failed me, really enjoying this last season so far! #postmortem
Shane’s aggravated scream is the highlight of this entire series prove me wrong
#postmortem- I mean...if I flash light turned off and on just once in front of me...I'd be running out of that house SO fast. Why is it like no big deal? I've never seen a flashlight turn off and on on its own besides like if the battery was dying
Ryan: Please turn the black one off, and the blue one on! Ghost: I'm colorblind you *sshole!
Yooo my favorite podcast jus did this case , go check them out . Morbid podcast
Ryan: I dare them to try split us up.  Shane: Can't be done. We're ghoul brothers.  Ryan: That's a bond that lasts forever.
"you gotta be brave. do you remember how to do that?" [makes a face] - THAT'S NOT A YES, RYAN
#postmortem Why are you asking for the ghost of the murder? Why would the murder's ghost be in that house? Maybe the person died in ww1 or somewhere far away from the house. It doesn't make sense if the murder's ghost is there.  I do believe in ghost btw.
Sheriff: “Step right up! Swing the axe for yourself!”  Shane: “F****n’ Iowans”
Lamb house go there The Ghost of Carmel Maine
For #postmortem WHY IS THIS HOUSE SO CHATTY? Also please will you two consider a future Unsolved: Fairytales spin-off and delve into this unicorn issue?
Timestamp 17:37 and about 17:20. Right beside Ryan. Is that a doll or a face?
Murderer really fixed themself a whole breakfast, but left perfectly good uncooked bacon on the floor of the downstairs bedroom lmao
Has anyone ever noticed the similarities between this and the Amityville murders? The house even has those creepy windows.
Omg how can you LIE NEXT TO THAT BED. ANY BED! That was the scariest scene ever.
#postmortem you should make Ryan wear a heart monitor
for #postmortem, For this episode do you have any theories of who might be the killer? I have a theory it could be Josiah himself. Due to the circumstances when they were killed and the difference that the ax blade was used on him  but on the others it was the blunt side instead.
Shane looking like Nicholas cage in Raising Arizona
For some reason this just popped up on my recommended after not watching BuzzFeed Unsolved for almost a whole year lmao, and it was posted today, hell yeah
I love the idea of it being really hard for some reason to do the flashlights as a ghost. So in the spirit world its just a ghost sweating bullets and cursing under their breath, trying to follow the instructions as they're getting relentlessly bullied by shane and ryan lololol
Post-mortem question: what does Shane think is the most compelling piece of evidence collected throughout the entire unsolved supernatural series? #boogara #watcher #beenwatchingsincethefirstseason #lovefromaustralia
omg at the same time as morbid podcast
Was watching this in my bed then my airconditioner suddenly turned on f*king freaky
Another Moore that involves a knock on the door. Also, Ryan saying unicorn isn't real reminded me of the time he said black holes are unicorns or something.
i was wondering why they werent doing this one.   WELL WELL WELLLL HOW THE TURN TABLES....
Are you ascared of us? Lol
For #postmortem An amazing ep all in all. For both of you, which place would you like to revisit? And which one would you NEVER even think of going back to?
He is in the attic
2416 comment!
ok but can we talk about how much the spiritbox did pick up though?? that's some of the most frequent its gone off and actually said things that related to the scene; not to mention how clear that one audio recording was
yall were in iowa and I didnt notice. im dissapointed in myself
I dont get the flashlight thing tho. Like why do they just turn off. Let’s say ghosts defo don’t exist. I’ve never just been walking with a flashlight and it’s just randomly turned off
This house Is so damn creepy
Shane looks appropriately old timey, suprised the ghosts didn't talk to him more.  "The town Marshall even let people handle the ax." *facepalm
For #postmortem : hey Ryan, the mag light is hooey #shaniac
#postmortem I'm a little sad more time wasn't spent trying to reach out to the victims. I don't see any reason why the murderer would haunt the house. Oh wait, it doesn't matter either way since ghosts aren't real. #Shaniac
YYYEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Use the necrophonic
For #postmortem: What evidence would be concrete proof for Shane that a place or person is "haunted/possessed by a demon"? #shaniac
19:25 kinda sounded like the ghost said Hamilton lol Edit: 23:05 sounded like “help us god,” thought that was kinda spooky :/
as a fellow illinoisian, i totally relate to shane's hatred of iowa. why do they have so much corn there? what are they doing with it? suspicious. #postmortem
For #postmortem why did you guys make this a supernatural episode and not a true crime episode? I’d love to hear more about the suspects and the legal proceedings
Is this the Supernatural and True Crime collab we all wanted? For #postmortem: Shane, what are all the demons held within you? Ricky: hows it goin'? Haven't seen you in a while.   Edit: forgot to put hashtag
I'm. So. Pumped!
Well it has happened   MORBID podcast actually covered a case BEFORE Buzzfeed Unsolved
For #postmortem: If you guys were going to be given the complete information as to what happened in a particular case you discussed throughout all the seasons, which case's story would you like to know?
Anyone else feel like these murders bear a crazy strong resemblance to the Hinterkaifeck murders in Germany in 1922?
does anyone think that shane was a little bit spooked internally after walking out of the house by himself? especially after telling ryan it didn't feel right in there
“Hey ghouls the boys are here!”
Im just trying to see who from Iowa got offended...
#postmortem, Shane, what would it take to convince you ghosts are real? Also, hey guys
I'm going to miss this shyt so much!!
ryan should just keep a go-pro and a spirit box in his back pocket just in case all the demons he's baited come back for him later.
Finally!!! I've been asking for this video since like season 2 lol!! And I know you did it *just* for me 😆
as someone who lives in the Midwest I'm sorry Shane but Michigan better than Illinois but you're still better than Ohio haha  on a serious note though I have a theory that the whole town hated the family for whatever reason and there murder was a town effort and the reason no one heard anything and almost no one woke up was because it was actually 8 of the townsfolk collectively murdering at the same time I don't know just a thought that popped up in my head 12 minutes into the video  edit: never mind if it was the fathers own axe there goes my theory
for #postmortem in case yall didnt know, covering mirrors was common superstition to prevent spirits from getting trapped in them
Does Shane remind anyone else of that one guy from criminal minds
Those are some of the clearest spirit box voices I've EVER heard
I actually gagged at the fact that there was 2 pounds of raw bacon on the floor. As someone who knows the smell of raw bacon left to sit for hours (it's a long story), I had a visceral reaction to that statement.
That was honestly some of the best spirit box evidence from any episode, ever
This one just feels too sad
Unspeakable axe. I get it.
(For the postmortem) At 1:11 on the George reeves postmortem Shane admits to the existence of ghosts by saying he agrees they kill ghosts he is implying he believes they are real ergo they kill them so he in fact believes in ghosts shane if u do not explain  yourself your a coward and the Iowans win #boogara
every haunted, scary place they visit is Disney Land / World to Shane.
It would be bonkers if the town marshall was the suspect and him letting the towns people go inside the house to contaminate the crime scene is a high IQ move to destroy evidence. #postmortem
A demon finally set foot at Iowa
I love the idea of ghosts being scared of Shane
Why do people think the killers ghost would be there when he/ she wasn’t captured , surely it’s only the family who may reside there
I heard that there were ax murders at a house in Villisca.
23:13  8 could be referring to the number of people killed
For #postmortem: Shane, was there ever a time that you were truly creeped out in a place that you actually wanted to get out as soon as possible? Or is there literally no drop of fear at all whenever you explore these places?
God, I love these 2 humans, i’am going to miss them. Also, congratulations Ryan on your engagement!
Why would the murder's ghost be in the house?
So I'm excited you guys are finally doing this but I'm so sad that yall were two hours away and I didn't know 😭😭
The ghost box session freaked me out. It goes along with your theory about the mirrors being covered and the killer being ashamed or something. With it saying, “I’ll kill him” “stop me” “stop it” etc it sounds like what the killer could have been saying to himself in the moment talking him through what he was going to do to the family and maybe questioning himself.
hey guys! big fan of the show here and i'm glad i got to be here for the last season. i got questions for both ghoul boys ryan, how likely do you think it is that the reason you guys haven't had too many encounters with ghosts/demons is because shane scares them away? and shane, how do you feel about people calling _you_ a demon?  stay spooky :) #postmortem
Y’all were in my neck of the woods without telling me?? Lame. Hope you guys had some dank gas station pizza from Casey’s and enjoyed Iowa!
me living in Iowa...
Ghost aren't real, Unicorn is.
For post-mortem: For me, that woman's voice you guys heard at 14:46 really did it; that is SO CLEARLY a woman's voice whispering "what is it" SHANE DID THAT CONVINCE U. And for Ryan, who do you think that female voice could possibly be?
"That's the town marshal!"  lol yeah, goes to show cops were always incompetent
The town marshall is suspicious for letting the townspeople handle the ax. You would think he would have known better than to do that. I think he may have something to do with the murders. #postmortem
a more light-hearted question for #postmortem: You pointed out the creepy dolls, but there also seem to be a lot more modern toys around the house, i.e. the Boobah in the closet. Inferring these were left for the children by recent guests, if you had thought ahead, what would you want to give the kids? And has anyone ever reported paranormal interaction with these gifts?
No crime goes unpunished. They may have gotten away with murdering 8 people but their ghost isn't invited to party with Shane.
Ryan "unicorns aren't real, ghosts are real."  Shane "rrrrAHHHHHHHH!"  that's it Ryan you've finally cracked him Shane's gonna need therapy by the end of this season XD
#postmortem I find it furiously hilarious that the one time Ryan experienced something like the bed moving, Shane couldn’t see it because he was hiding in the closet.
Great video
As someone who lives in Iowa, HOW HAVE I NEVER HEARD OF THIS HOUSE BEFORE??
how and why r these places accessible to the public?
These past two weeks I've been so sick and miserable, but you guys really got me through it. I rewatched every single episode of unsolved supernatural and true crime over and over again until I felt better, and after watching while awake and while I was asleep I feel recharged thanks to the Ghoul Boys. So I'm very grateful to you guys and sad that it's the last season, but I hope for the best for both of your future plans.
Shane came out of the closet....literally 🥳🥳🥳🤗🤗🤗🤗
for #postmortem : i think the killer brought in the ham/bacon in case the family had a dog, distract the dog with the meat so when he’s striking the victims the dog doesn’t howl and let the neighbors know what’s going on 🤔
#postmortem Did you go through all your footage very meticulously?  I think you should because  I thought I saw some movement from whatever was at the bottom of the bed Ryan was sitting on when he thought someone sat down beside him. It could be just the shadows from camera and such but that place has a strange vibe.
#postmortem did y’all not see the crooked neck lady behind shane on the far right of the chair in the last episode when he was alone in the basement? cuz i’m still trippin on that and no one else is 🥲
The “what is it?” And “hard to stop” WERE SO CLEAR MOM COME PICK ME UP I’M SCARED
in the last episode i vote shane just smashes the spirt box
#postmortem: Josiah, the father, was the only victim who was killed with the sharp side of the ax? That indicates there is something different about that victim. I wonder if daddy had a boyfriend, who killed family out of jealously and what not... In the good ol' days the villainization of LGBTQ+ people would've driven me insane, maybe enough to kill my boyfriend and his beard.
Come india for Ghost hunting
9:08 ... wait for it. You're welcome 🤣😂🤣😂
LETS GOOOOO
ILLINOIS REPRESENT! Knew I was a Shaniac for a reason
What if the Marshal did it? He ruined the evidence and left pig at the crime so 👀
For Buzzfeed Unsolved, whats the chances, do you think, that the axe murderer then moved to New Orleans? the time line is right and also using the families own axes #boogara
Shane is the definition of the saying "ignorance is bliss"
I just had top surgery (chest masculinization) today and there was a problem with the pharmacy filling my prescriptions so I was just in pain for hours with the anesthesia wearing off before I was able to get my painkillers. Feel a lot better now, but this video helped distract me from the pain while I was waiting, and it might be my favorite episode so far, I love the blend of supernatural/true crime elements and the impressive spirit box evidence. Thank you, love you.
I swear even the ghosts just get scared of Shane and hide
Ryan every episode so far this season, telling the ghosts he's the most feared ghost hunter alive. We love the confidence, hope he keeps that up. #postmortem
9:29 just me reminding myself there will no more episodes after this season
#postmortem:  Why didnt you guys focus more on the “what is this” voice? That was the clearest voice ive heard on this show
Why do u hate iowa
This series went from ghosts, to constantly learning how wholesome Shane and Ryan are. I am not complaining.
is this the murder house from ahs
I’m very vulnerable. I’m sooo vulnerable right now, oh my gawd! 28:29
A question why do you guy visit these places with a big group and not just ryan shane and cameraguy? Don't you think you would get more "evidence" if you were a smaller group? #shaniac
13:49 It used to be a really common belief that you had to cover all the mirrors and open a window in a house where someone died because you didn't want their spirit to be trapped there forever. Maybe that's why the mirror was covered?
The cloth or sheets over the victims' faces...was chloroform an available thing back then? Or a similar substance? Would they have known to check for that? Could explain why no one woke up... #postmortem
what if the murderer then moved to new orleans
Wow they've grown cool mustache the ghost busters is getting old now
#postmortem if the killer died somewhere else, why did his soul come back to haunt the house?
#postmortem so i get that the idea behind the spirit box is that it bounces from signal to signal, creating a sort of garbled mess, and sometimes a voice comes through.  why do we think that voice is a ghost and not, maybe, a truck driver on his radio, or a farmer a ways away on a walkie-talkie?   the midwest in general can get pretty barren, and you’d be lucky to have enough cell reception to send a text, much less call someone if you were in trouble, so those types of radios aren’t exactly rare out there
#Postmortem What is your least favorite location you’ve been to? P.S I will miss this series.
Let's Go Ghoul Boys.
I'm going to start responding to questions like a spirit box.  "Who's here with us?" "Me." 🤣
23:04 the text says 'helpless' but my captions say 'That was Fun' and i can hear 'That was fun' more than i hear 'helpless'
#postmortem Shane is there any bit of evidence that has made you question just once that ghost could be real?
That "what is it?" I mean come on that is, I mean that is so god damned clear.
can anyone explain to me the whole flashlight deal ? if a flashlight is turned on , with a button, how is just turning (sometimes slowly) on and off ? how does that happen ???? when they hold flashlights they stay turned on . no flickering or anything . im so confused
U know what would be freaky if the singer sewing machine started up
I would love to be able to go into a house that has such tragic and gruesome history and fully believe there isn't some sort of residue or imprint of the events left behind.  If you don't believe in some form of a afterlife, you can be fearless (in a situation like a 'paranormal investigation'.  I would not be able to stay in there very long or even enter. My experiences inform me, we are made of energy and we leave a trail of energy behind.
#forpostmortem: Do you guys really have to discontinue the show? Why? Can you please find a way to make more seasons? Just the supernatural ones would be great too.
Shane: *you do what you have to to make your girlfriend feel safe* Meanwhile Ryan's girlfriend makes him quit unsolved for his safety
At 18:37 after Ryan feels someone sits next to him, Shane’s flashlight is turning on and off :) #boogara
You gotta be reeeeal confident in your local property values to call a place the AX MURDER HOUSE directly on the sign. XD
Shane never has any actual analogy that makes sense. That unicorn thing was nothing like the actual situation 🤦 just denial to greatest extent
#PostMortem I just wanted to say that I've enjoyed watching all the content you both have produced over the years (even the scarier in my opinion supernatural episodes). I'm sad to see these BUN episodes go but I'm excited for the new content over on Watcher. #GhoulBoys
The most unnerving thing about this incident was something I picked up from an episode of "Ghost Adventures" Baggins and crew were interviewing residents of the nearby house if they every hear/experience anything but they kept getting interrupted by the crew setting up for the upcoming night investigation at the "murder house" according the the current residents it was nothing out of the ordinary and they quite often hear tour groups moving about the place the implication of course being that when the murders went down the original residents of the house would have most certainly heard the murders happening.
for post mortem: "shane, im on your side, but do you secretly hate the spirit box so badly that you avoid any serious inquiries and "mouth off to the demons as a way to make them shut up". maybe its a form of trickery youve been hiding hahaha. it works every time and they seemingly sense ryans fear and speak nonsense to him much more often. whos behind the box? who did you hire shane? as a shaniac i demand to know the truth!"
Something that comes to mind is how strange the Town Marshal acted. He must have known the family while understanding the rules of investigation. He could have allowed these people inside the crime scene and allow them to handle the ax and possibly other things to get rid of the evidence of the killer.... My guess is that the Town Marshal knew the killer or he himself was the killer.
For post-mortem : ghosts hate flashlights and cameras why don't you try to record only voices and try ask questions ... because it seems like ur recorder only catch voices when there is no cameras and light
“So the killer is here. Odd, odd choice to stick around in this house”
Ryan, KING OF THE DOLLS
why am i watching this at 2am
The 3 accused was a reverend known as a peeping tom, and another was a vagrant passing by for work and he was known to sleep with an ax and had outbursts of fury swinging his ax around the other was a politician known for his dislike of jossiah
Iowan here! We got beef! 😂
sounds like someone touring the house tried to steal the bacon but didn't want to get caught walking out with it when the national guard arrived
Makes me wonder why people feel that ghosts 'have' to prove their existence. It doesn't do them any good if they do or don't talk, turn on/off flashlights, or anything else people can think of to try to communicate with them.
The Morbid Podcast girls just did this episode! I get chills when my favorite worlds combine. Morbid Girls + Ghoul Boys
Shane: “it will be trending on twitter for a day or two” !!!!  Yeah, he just summed up the society we live in, in one sentence 🎯🎯🎯
i keep picturing Ryan as Watanuki- a ghost magnet - and Shane as Doumeki - a ghost repellant - (both from XXXholic) and THAT'S why the ghosts and demons hover but stay away. 🤣
me living in iowa 👁👄👁
#postmortem so if Shane is from Chicago, does he listen to Chicago drill music??
I live in Iowa and I have always wanted to go there
8:55 There's no 👏co👏rre👏lation👏.
#postmortem i feel like shane got little more imbued with ghostly scare in his angry overlycalm eyes and ryan has a nice therapeutic progress with fear  boys had character development !?
I do believe that the killer haunts that place, and I do believe that they wanted to stop but couldn’t for some reason. That would explain all the “Stop it” “Help me” “I’m miserable” and “Stop me”. Also why they covered the mirrors, the faces of the victims, and the windows because they couldn’t stand what they did/were doing. And a lot of other things
#postmortem how about the father or brother being the murderer? A little like a joint suicide-murder thing
It freaks me out thinking the murderer himself may have been one of the 100 witnesses stumbling around the crime scene the next morning, internally gloating over his crimes 👀👀
"Hey fucko" is the only way ghosts should be addressed
As an Iowa raised Shaniac, I have to say that I am hurt by Shane’s hostility towards us.   But also, we are absolutely the superior midwest I state. Get rekt, Shane.
You guys are awesome watched you for years. Dont end it after this season
4:05
Every episode makes me sad to know its 1 episode closer to the end. And ive already rewatched every supernatural season 3 times. I hope they do a ghost hunting show on Watcher
#postmortem imagine staying over at your friends house on the day that some dude decides to axe it up in there. Also this episode is going to make me lose sleep tonight. Good job. Love you.#boogaras4life
#postmortem sick bro #shaniac forever
#postmortem hey Ryan, you reckon maybe the townspeople reenacting the murder and stuff might have angered the ghosts and made the place as active as it now? Just a theory.
i wish Shane gets scratched one of this days before the season finale ends😅
The attic windows made me think this was Amitytille 😅
no way this was in iowa😳
Ryan saying "maybe come out now" to shane  with so much relief because he was terrified of the bed moving hahahaha
For Post Mortem— What are the other items on Ryan’s bucket list? #postmortem
When it comes to ghosts, 9:28 is the most shane thing I’ve ever see Shane do 😂
Postmortem: The moving of bed may just be the acting of springs when Ryan sits on the other side. Bed with spring does that, however, I would love to know how Shane will explain the "what is it" on 14:47. It is really damn clear hahaha  let us put another point for the Boogaras 2-1
for #postmortem : At 18:54, it sounds like  a woman's voice making an aggressive statement, rather than a man's; could it be possible that a woman was involved in the murder, or was it definitely a lone guy? It could of course also be one of the older sisters, or perhaps the mother - it's not likely that they're going to be exactly happy and at ease stuck co-haunting a place with whoever murdered their whole family, it could be that the aggression is aimed at the murderer rather than at the family or you guys.
i honestly don’t think rayan is that fearful, cuz i personally would NEVER go into that house alone no matter what, even tho i lean more on the “ghosts aren’t real” side, i still think my brain will play tricks on me and i’d literally lose my mind. so rayan is pretty much brave in my eyes lol.
* jumps * Me “ I swear if he falls through the floor “
where the axe man at??
1:42 My sleep paralysis demon looking over me.
19:43 “What’re the names of your parents?” “shAnE aND…rYaN” “You’re damn right.”
physically laughed out loud when ryan said “i am the most feared ghost hunter ever”
Is #ryaniac a thing? 👻👻💀
i never understood how the flashlights do that, i’d be freaking out
#postmortem Question: What is the scariest/Spookiest thing you have experienced while filming Unsolved Mysteries?
You guys always make me laugh when you do your ghost hunting I love it
Some amazing evidence this episode, I think this may have been some of the clearest spirit box sessions we've got yet! The reoccuring "Stop me" over two seperate sessions is wild.
i wish they could featured that murders in India which is trending in netflix...
Post Mortem question: if you two could go ghost hunting with any person in the world, who would you choose?
Familiar spirits
Shane at the spirits box: You go girl. Give us nothing
For #postmortem : do you think the killer was worried about a pet giving him away so he brought the bacon as a distraction just in case?
#PostMortem one more thing what’s up with the bacon 🥓??? #Boogara
Wouldn’t the ghosts be of the victims? There’s no evidence that the killer died there
going to be incredibly bummed if we don't get a return to the hot daga before the end of unsolved
Shane: “No- I’m in the closet, just chilling”  Me: Same
Who is hanging laundry at 5 o’clock in the morning?
For Post-Mortem: re: hey guys lol! Do you think it's plausible that the covered mirrors were all put on BEFORE he murdered all 8 people? Wouldn't this guy have been, like, COVERED in blood and probably have extremely bloodied hands after, like, one murder esp. with all that force he was using based on the mark on the wall? I know it would have been difficult for him to have snuck into all the rooms to cover the mirrors before he then went back and killed them all. But there was no mention of blood on the mirrors! How could that be!!
I've always heard of mirrors being covered in a room someone dies in is to prevent their spirit from becoming trapt there   Given that That superstition may have truth to it that might also explain why ghost investegators never really picked up a whole lot there and it always seems to be more of the killer haunting the home than the victims
You guys are terrible! OMG don’t mess with spirits! But you’re still hilarious and i love you both
#PostMortem I’m so glad you gentlemen didn’t sleep at this house because it was beyond creepy and scary! Ryan I hope you see this because I’m always on your side I believe in ghost and I will forever be a #Boogara
How come all historic murders are just murders but when an axe is involved its remembered as an “axe murder”? What is so special about dying from an axe vs a knife, gun, chainsaw, hammer, etc.? I never got that
1:26 - 1:43 Iowa residents be shittin rn
Shane is salty
9:24 Did Ryan just pull off a reverse card right there?
The reason the mirrors are covered is  because, back in the day, they covered the mirrors after someone died in the home so the spirit would not get trapped in the mirror. FACT
6:19 the development from ghoul boys to ghoul brothers is warming my heart despite the talk of child murder
Just saying if I was besties with the town marshal or even the marshal himself I'd probably let a bunch of people contaminate the murder weapon and crime scene too. Smells of a cover up #postmortem
#postmordem Given the time frame, has anyone considered if the Villisca Axe Murderer and the Axeman of New Orleans are one and the same???
In this video, Shane came out of the closet...
I swore up & down that Ryan & Shane had tackled this one but realized I’m mixing up the Ghoul Boys w/ Murder, Mystery, & Makeup ☠️
19:24 spirit box: abuh subtitles: Help me. ????
Great episode 💛 too bad it's hosted by a murderer and the guy who wrote the murder ⚰️ #postmortem
"Unicorns aren't real" ok Ryan may not be a demon haunting Shane but he must be evil
The 2 pounds of bacon rolled up could possibly mean "pigs in a blanket". Idk just a thought
That piano music in the rnd is such a relief.
As a person from Iowa, I have no idea about this turf war but we hate Nebraska
😮😮😮😮😮😮
I wonder if maybe the town marshall had something to do with the murders and that's why he let everyone view the crime scene and touch the murder weapon.
Anyone interested in this case, read the book "The Man From the Train" by Bill James. It's a great read, the theories are super compelling, and the Villisca murders are a big part of it. Highly recommend!
I live 2 hrs north of there and can’t wait to go to this house!
I’m honored to know that, even for a short time, we were in the same state. Thank you for stooping so low to come to Iowa ❤️
You guys still left out Hawaii.
So boys, if 3am is "the witching hour," then do ghosts observe daylight savings time?
Based on a theory that some if not all ghosts are sort of living a life or moment on repeat it sounds like most of the spirit box voices weren't so much responses from them to you but rather hearing echoes of the spirits reliving the attack.
I feel Josiah's brother is the murderer. As there was no forced entry, nothing missing, and covered mirrors because he was ashamed of what he did ( killing the family and the girls' friends) . Personal grudge maybe
THE EPISODE I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR!!!!
This is something I’ve been waiting for, especially because I live in Iowa
Can y’all PLEASE destroy the ghost box on the last episode
ohh wow love it
The spirits were asking you to switch places...Ryan, you needed to switch "seating" places with Shane. You guys lost a great opportunity for deeper communication.
My money is on the Marshall i would tell people to touch the weapon i used to murder people if i wanted to contaminate the crime scene before the real police rolled in. He knew what he was doing making it impossible to solve
#Postmortem : Shane, now that all the ghoul hunting is ending and looks like you are not more a Believer, have you ever considered some kind of longing for proving that there are more things. I mean as fellow Shaniac, rational facts and logic, fun at parties and funerals the prospect of having a handful of decades between 2 eternities of nothing else looks like a cruel joke. If u ever have wanted to get proofs of life after death, are you worried of all the demons and ghost that you have taunted along the way? I mean cause if there is, by this point you have to be some kind of John Ahole Constantine with Satan himself coming to get you in person.
I just listened to the morbid podcast episode on this yesterday. Perfect timing.
I've been in Iowa for the last six months and I'm getting out in two weeks and I can 100% confirm the entire state is haunted. Do not recommend.
"I'm so vulnerable right now OH MY GOD" me whenever i see my therapist
#postmortem Maybe the town Marshall did it and that’s why he opened up the crime scene to all the townspeople?
Holy that “what is it” was so clear it gave me chills
Bro, it’s been forever since I watched any of this videos, and if it weren’t for my dogs cuddling w me I’d be pissing myself 🙃
Ryan is too brave now, its not fun anymore 😂
When shane jumped up and down in the house at the very beginning, i honestly thought he would like punch a hole in the floorboards or something.
Must be frustrating being a ghost and trying to ask the living for help! You try asking but the sound comes through muddled in the spirit box all you get from the paranormal investigators is “can you say my name?” 😅
can we go back to the demon house ??? anything but this house please lol
#postmortem Ryan do you feel you got enough evidence from this place to prove that ghost are real?
I can’t seem to see the bed moving? Can someone point out exactly where it moved?
As soon as you mention Amy and Adam from Kindred Spirits, I shrieked a little. I love them!
What’s with Shane looking like a 60’s detective #boogara
When the caretaker kicked in the closet door and shouted, those poor ghosts must have been horrified.
I’m probably too late for post-mortem but hello from Australia
I know Shane has always been the skeptical and tries to show like he’s never afraid but I bet  he has been afraid, there’s old episodes where you can tell he’s like “oh no” 😂
“The room in which their lives were shockingly cut short” 8:28 - I see what you did there.
Maybe the murderer covered up the mirrors so that the spirits of the victims wouldn’t get trapped in the mirrors
Morbid Podcast just finished a 2 episode "series" on this case! So cool actually getting to see it! Great episode guys! ❤️
Hell yeah Iowa representation 😤👍 proud to have been in the same place as the ghoul boys
Iowa treats crime scenes like a party
ryan are those... some therapy techniques I see ?? pls tell me that means you've worked through your fear of ghosts with a therapist I love that for u and the thought of that is also really funny hhbhjnbgf #postmortem
I think the ghost who said the words “Stop me” can just  be the murderer, because a victim wouldn’t say those words in such a regretful tone. (The murderer might just be mad at that time, and later realize what he has done and couldn’t have the courage to face it)
#postmortem Shane, how much evidence from a spirit box would you need for you to believe it? 3, 4, 5 words, or does it have to be full sentences?
The voice that comes through the spirit box is the same voice, across multiple stations, that's compelling
I was disappointed this wasn’t related to the axeman 😔
For #PostMortem : Ryan, you don't believe in unicorns, but are there any supernatural creatures (aside from ghosts and demons) that you do believe in? It may sound ridiculous, but I swear I once heard what sounded like a fairy laugh while I was walking alone near some trees. #Boogara #FinishTheHotDaga
Postmortem: Are you considering the spirit box somehow a bit responsive? I know it's not as responsive as The Lighthouse or even the jail episode, but it's still pretty okay for me :)
No question just# boogara
2,000 residents, "one of the finest CITIES in the state."
Not gonna lie the “stop me” (if that’s what it really was) made me gasp out loud lmao 🤣 so creepy
the way ryan is so casual about the torches turning on and off when once upon a time he would've been pissing his pants and crying out of fear. that's called growth!
Does this line up with when the Axeman was happening? Especially when he told everyone to Jazz It
I’m soo sad this is y’all’s last season! I love u both❤️
So happy that you guys finally did this episode! I learned about this case when I was a teenager (right around the time I was getting into true crime) and I actually went to this house in 2015 (as a high school graduation present, believe it or not) and can confirm: it's haunted. My grandma and I were in the kids' bedroom and while recording, asked that the children roll the ball towards us, and right after we said that, the ball started rolling and stopped right in front of us! We also learned some interesting facts that I didn't know before going, like how a out of town detective/sheriff was asked to take the train to Villisca to investigate the murders and he arrived intoxicated.
For #postmortem Shane what does Ryan do annoys you? And Ryan what is the thing Shane does to annoy you Also I’m a shanicac :)
#postmortem Covering mirrors and covering faces are all things that people would do in order to all the deceased's souls to move on to the afterlife (though typically they'd open the windows and curtains as well). I think it was the brother (because the husband was the only one not bludgeoned and he clearly had a key to get in) and that there were at least 2 killers. One that felt guilty (thus covering faces and mirrors to release their souls) and one who maybe didn't which is why the curtains were closed.
I absolutely hate this episode. I’m watching it at 1 am and I am deeply unhappy
I must say, for your final season, you brothers got the hair styles at a scary level! 🤣
#postmortem you show do a finally episode where you look at funny moments from all 7 seasons, or best evidence of "ghost" is the best pick by your team or you guys.
Did anyone else think the “what is it” sounded more like “let us in?”
While watching the episode my brother and I were discussing the prevalence of axe murders in the late 1800s to the 1920s. Decided to look it up and found out about this book that discusses a German immigrant named Paul Mueller and the authors believe he may have been the Villisca and Hinterkaifeck murderer due to quite a few similarities of the crimes. Here’s the Wikipedia link if y’all are interested https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_from_the_Train
Post Mortem Question: How come shane is never scared, although he is going into a house where a whole family was killed. #postmortem #crazy
#postmortem Ryan seems to be approaching these scenes/potential ghosts with more sass and bravery.  Is Shane proud of Ryan's boldness this season?
I feel like they have to positive of vibes too draw out the ghouls, there is no fear so where is the fun for the ghosts
Ryan you are a little braver
For Post Mortem: Have you read/heard of The Man from the Train by Bill James and Rachel McCarthy James? What do you think of their theory that the Villisca Ax Murderer was actually a traveling serial killer named Paul Mueller who was linked to at least forty murders?
It’s ok Shane no one in Iowa is real
18:37 is Shane messing with his flashlight or something else?
#Post mortem : What if Lizzie Bourden did the murders? #serialkillercinematicuniverse
This is a question I’d love to get answered Shane do you think Ryan is braver than you because you don’t believe in any of this whilst Ryan completely believes ghost are real and the places you are going to are indeed haunted #shaniac
i've been on the borderline between shaniac and boogara for years but seeing that ghost sit down on the bed next to ryan and the bedskirt actually moving underneath it really pushed me firmly into the boogara camp. it legitimately sent chills down my back. that's the spookiest thing i think i've ever seen in my life. also, towards the end, when ryan was doing his solo investigation in the attic and he thought the killer told him via the spirit box to leave, it sounded to me like he said "rigby," as if he were telling ryan his name. i wonder if there was any man in the town named rigby who may have been a suspect?
Wait I thought they left the channel
#postmortem It's said that mirror hold spirits. Do you think whoever the murderer was, was particularly spiritual and didn't want the souls of his victims around after the act was committed? or perhaps he wanted to make sure that the victims wouldn't catch a glmpse of his face, in case they somewhow escaped?
Ok that "what is it" was so clear I got CHILLS
What if the killer was hiding in the attic the entire time people were walking into the house to see the bodies?
Those are NOT the kind of mattresses that existed back then, more likely a cotton cover over straw or horse hair.
shane: if your the killer... advertisement pop up: "build a kingdom in earth or space in infinity kingdom"  what a timing! Great job YouTube on ruining the video
#postmortem 9:29 me
i'm also from illinois and i have similar feelings about iowa, than you for your service in the i-state turf wars shane
are you ascared of us? what are you, 12?
Ryan your hair tho! 😸😹😹
i dont know anything about this case going into this, but like....did the investigators look into local butchers?? Or look at who purchased a slab of bacon recently/on the day of the murder??
Demons been real quiet since Shane dropped that he got Annabelle in his ribcage
For Post Mortem, Shane how do you feel about the same words being repeated on the spirit box over and over again? Along with it being the same voice? This has been the most active location yet- spooky #postmortem
Question for #postmortem: Is there a case you are interested in but would never want to try and cover?
These videos were significantly more entertaining when Ryan was genuinely fearful. His jump-scare reactions would give me secondhand fear and adrenaline when I watched older videos.
For #postportem. Just want to say, awesome as always guys. For possible theory do you think it could have been a coordinated effort. Maybe someone was look out, multiple in the house doing the smackin, and another one who arrived to the scene of the crime and started to mess with the evidence? It's not impossible for this to be a crime of one person, but I can also see multiple people being involved.
Ahh Ryan... You haven't changed a bit and please never do. Shane, you're a gem and we Northwestern Suburban Chicagoans miss ya buddy. If you're in town in exactly a week I got an extra ticket to see Jim Breuer stand up at Woodfield if ya wanna come! Much love and respect guys. I adore the content and am so impressed by the creation of Watcher. Very inspiring to me. Thank you. :)
Shane going for the Edgar Allen Poe look
FINALLY, AFTER YEARS OF ASKING!!!
For Post Mortem: I had just recently listened to the Villisca Ax Murder episode of the Morbid: A True Crime Podcast (check it out, I love their stuff) a day or two ago before you guys uploaded. And in their episode, they said that some of the detectives/investigators theorized that the murderer used that slab of bacon, found in the downstairs bedroom, to masturbate after killing the two girls.
#POSTMORTEM ILLINOIS!! ✊ When are you guys coming to Chicago
I would let Shane do unspeakable things to me
N🚫 SLEEPOVER?!😕
The worst and best part about Buzzfeed  Unsolved is that by the time it is posted, it is midnight on the dot in my country. Makes watching it right away a more immersive and creepy experience.
Maybe the killer didn’t know the family at all, and brought the bacon just in case the house they were breaking into had a dog?
#postmortem Are there any theories out there about the mirror coverings being part of some religious rite? E.g. Jews cover mirrors while sitting Shiva (not saying a Jew did it!). Gonna miss you guys.
Fav duo
#postmortem Shane, are YOU the Ax Murderer? You said you claimed countless skulls in the 'I State Turfwar' so you'd have a good motive. It's a bit suspicious that you mention that in the video about people being murdered in Iowa.
#postmortem can we all just pretend this isn't the last series? Any chance we can carry on the series instead 🥲 I feel like the ghoul brothers are the only trustworthy ghost hunters 💔💜 xx
Ryan: Unicorns aren't real, but ghosts are Shane: *demonic screeching*
Every season Shane makes it harder and harder to believe he’s not a demon
Post mortem question: How come the light house wasn't considered evidence? Shane even stated it in the end of that episode after ryan ran out.
#postmortem : "Do you think that bacon was a message for 100 years in the future for shane because he has "Beef" with Iowa?" #Boogara
#Ryanneko please do the Jersey Devil in New Jersey please
#postmortem question: Have you guys captured anything disturbing off/static camera? #Shanioogara
for the #postmortem: i noticed that shane was actually trying to properly talk to the ghosts in this episode, how do you think your attitudes towards ghost hunting has changed since the start of this series?
I’m so proud of Ryan he’s become way more badass
Shane is fire in this episode
I’m surprised they didn’t try to find a connection with that slab of bacon, I would think they would ask around if anyone bought bacon that morning or maybe a connection to someone with a pig farm.
I would love to do this as a job! Explore haunted places  and research what Shane and Ryan do. I would absolutely love it!
The father was probably banging the murderers wife
I bet it was the preacher or somebody from the church
so glad your back
Covering the victims faces suggests they felt guilty about what they had done. But making themselves a meal in their victims house after the murder suggests that the killer felt powerful/dominant and had no reason to hide or feel guilty.
I’m so bummed this is the last season. Why? 😭
A part of me is glad there's a new episode, but another is saddened that we are one episode closer to the end.
Man from the train
Might want to check the spelling at 4:24 in "ther" beds   xD Love you guys!!!
Being from Iowa I still love and agree with you Shane ❤️
Buzzfeed unsolved supernatural is meant to make me scared of the supernatural, not of people.
#postmortem (for both of you) What is your BEST memory from this series? (The one that you will continue to talk about through the years)
Anyone else just listen to these murders on the morbid podcast!
Shane, just wondering, did your mom cross paths with Kevin Spacey in the past? 🤔
As someone who lived in Iowa for 10yrs, I can confirm Shane's derogatory remarks.  100% accurate
For Post mortem: Why didn't you stay the night... That's clearly when the fun happens in that house
okay but what's to say that there was only one murderer
As an Iowan I can 100% confirm everything here is haunted
anyone else notice the person in the window at 1:07? I did XD    Just to put it out there, who else is happy that the ghoul boys are still standing strong? Science 2014 of February, they made a name for themselves and it brings joy to both me and my friends :) cant wait for the next vid >:]
literally just listened to morbid’s two part episode on this omg
monuments of historic and legendary war generals get taken down today, but an Ax Murderers tribute? that's OK! Society!👌
As much as I love shane I am kind of rooting for a ghost to give hive a wedgie or something strictly for proof. #postmortem #boogara
Some of the spirit box responses in this video are really strange… possibly one of the most solid episodes in regards of evidence?
#postmortum is it possible that the killer could of befriended the family, maybe as a farm hand or a traveler passing through before he killed them?
Well now I need a "Hey, Fucko!" t-shirt.
This felt like a crossover between true crime and supernatural... And I LOVE IT
Can I have a cookie or for Portillo’s to come to New Jersey
where is the axe today? Does Zak Bagans have it under his pillow?
Wouldn't it be weird if the same person who did these murderers then went to Germany and, ten years later, did the same thing at the Hinterkaifeck farm?
This question is for Shane: In the past, you've said that you would go to hanging in 1800s London. Would you go to the crime scene of Villisca's house if you lived in 1912? #postmortem #loveyouguys
Razor boy definitely helped him
I’m just very excited to be here and enjoy the show🤝
YES! Been waiting for this one! It’s such a beautiful house too! Swear something pulled my hair in that attic 👻👻
#forpostmortem what is the "science" behind the spirit box? Any cases of it actually being useful? #shaniac
Hey Ghoul Boys! Loving the final season, though I’m sad to see this come to an end! I was just wondering, why is the spirit box your most used ghost hunting tool? Do you use others (like the thermal cam) but it just doesn’t make it into the video?
Is there any way to tell if you've knocked up a ghost?
OH SNAP
What is Shane scared of?  #postmortem
We enjoyed our over night stay. 👻
Being from Illinois, I personally hate Ohio the most but Iowa and Indiana are very close seconds
Ryan’s turning more and more into Shane everyday
#postmortem: what is the proof that you think will convince you about ghosts being real?
Spirit box just isn’t cutting it this season
Question, is Shane a unack. #Ryandaman.
Yay! I was hoping you’d do this episode!!!
this video is probably Shane's biggest W yet
I love upload day!
for postmortem: despite what the medium said, it seems to me like the murderer didn't feel in control of themself and regrets the murders. assuming the spirit box did channel them, the lines "stop me", "hard to stop", and "i'm miserable" all make it seem like the killer for whatever reason felt like they couldn't stop themself from committing the murders and now haunts the house because they are trapped by their guilt. maybe they had some kind of intense anger issues?
I gotta say, I'm really impressed how much Ryan has grown over the years of Supernatural. I feel like if it was season 1, the responses from the flashlights and the experience on the bed would of had a much more visceral reaction from him. Ryan, do you feel like you've come a long way since the beginning of the series? #postmortem
maybe the killer brought bacon in case they got a dog
ryan really has a thing for counting these days
I literally manifested this video. I was just thinking they should visit the Villisca Axe Murder House the other day.
I’m so glad u lads r back. Makes my Fridays fun. Thankfully I’ve got are you scared to watch after this on ur channel
For #postmortem what is the scariest spirit box answer you have heard?
Its not courage if you don't believe in it ask him if he'd be scared in a situation where its a real fear stay in a jail cell with bubba and tell me how tuff you are
Who hangs laundry at 5am??? She's the crazy one in this story!!!
So glad you guys mentioned the bacon thing and the weird thing about covering the mirrors!  Half the time people gloss over that and it makes the case so insanely strange.
Can you do more series of this show. I will love it  #Ryanneko
I wonder if Shane is extra "brave" and goofy about these situations partly as defense against any inkling of fear he might feel. Like, partly lol.
I bet the town Marshal did it, that's why he let the scene be contaminated
The stache is back
When I read about this case, I believe that Reverend George Kelley did the murders. Whoever the killer was and since his ghost is in the house, I'm guessing that the only suspect who could easily be misled is George Kelley and his short state make sense in terms of him hiding in the house. I don't know though
You don’t tend to use a K2 very much… Might I ask why?
the crazy thing is I just watched the Ghost Adventures episode where they investigated this place
Have you guys ever thought that maybe these ghosts are racist.....so they won’t listen to Ryan 😅🥴
That murderer was such a menace for no reason. They made themselves a snack after killing 8 people.
Why didnt you bring an axe in as a trigger item?
I need to be in one of the postmortem episodes before its over for good. my question is do you like potato salad?
I think this is the only story on unsolved that has actually made me scared to sleep so that’s fun.
Im with shane—why the sam hill would the murderer return to the house…unless he’s a family member…..
HI I WAS LATE SORRY
#postmortem How tall was this family? Y'all look like Giants when in most of the rooms and the parents bed looked short for even Ryan!
how creepy and scary it is that eight people were literally murdered in that same spot tho, freakier than any ghost
FOR THE POSTMORTEM at 1:10 on the George reeves postmortem Shane admits in the existence of ghosts please shane explain yourself #boogara
i like how ive watched like almost every episode from season 3 in like a month or 2 D:
Never ever has a video made me feel this terrible, I started crying.
Placing sheets over mirrors in the home after a person dies was a common practice in those times.   Wonder if he stopped the clocks as well?
You guys should read The Man from the Train. It points out that this murder was only one in a long string of unsolved murders across various states.
Has the spirit box been known to cause problems with nearby radios? The voice saying "switch" sounded like it could have genuinely been some dude wanting to carry on a conversion on a different frequency 😆
#Postmortem Hey guys not really related to the video, but wanna ask if we could please get a shout out on ya next postie,  its one of ya yung-buzz's bithday's, n hes hit 6, he watches buzzfeed with us like clockwork and absolutely loves shane. So if yas can spare it it would be really cool if we could get a happy birthday for seth :) Thanks heaps guys, ill make sure to check the new upload tonight :)
Unsolved lovers are the only people who would look at a video title and go “ooh ax murder! I hope they find something haunted this time :)”
Hear me out…what if all this time Ryan was the actual demon? o.O *gasp* #postmortem
Killer: "Switch" Ryan: *insults him Killer: 🥲
Ya know Ryan, I grew up in a neighboring town, and the running theory back home was that a demon possessed a man to kill the family and then stayed behind in the attic.  So, really, you've done two demons this season.  Or you would have, if ghosts were real.
#postmortem Shane, what’s the scariest place you been to on this show?
What's that machine they use? How does it work? Who made it?
I honestly think that these murders were a team effort. I do not think it is possible for one person to murder eight people and not wake someone up. I think one person was hiding the house and another was hiding somewhere on the property and when the family went to sleep, the other person was let in though a window.
For Shane: was there ever a time you felt scared/very uneasy in an investigation? Something that almost made you wonder? Very curious. Shaniac but I swing Boogara sometimes hahaha
For Postmortem: As an Iowan, I’m going to feed your teeth to the pigs
#Postmortem this is for Shane: So it's the final season, I will miss you both, but Shane what would be the best piece of ghost evidence from the show that would make you consider ghosts might actually be real?
They should've brought some bacon.
It looks like amilty horror house from the side
It’s the Axeman doing a practice run in Iowa before heading down to New Orleans
9:24 HE'S SO CLOSE TO GETTING IT
I think Ryan's real goal for the final season is to break Shane's brain.
jinkies!
Ryan: Wondering how the killer could sneak around such a creaky house. Me: Well it probably helps that it was 100 years younger at the time of the event...
What do you guys make of the voices in the ghost box and do you view it as evidence?  It was pretty creepy that one of the voices seemed to be the same one at different times.  #BoogarasFTW
For #postmortem: Conspiracy theory here,  what if it’s the same guy who was the Axeman. He originated in Iowa, but went to New Orleans to really make a name for himself. lol
The murdered ain't there 😂😂
"HEY YOU SICK LITTLE WEIRDO" LOL I spit my water out hearing that.
#postmortem Could this be the work of the Axeman and Razor Boy??!!?!? BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T JAZZ IT!!!
Sheet over the mirrors could mean they were superstitious. Mirrors especially in the 20’s were believed to trap spirits, even windows so they may have been trying to let their souls pass on. I tried to look up the bacon thing… uh… I dunno about the bacon it was weird
As soon as I saw the teaser for the final season and I saw the front arches of the front porch I knew you guys were going to visit this. I have no idea how I'm going to be after watching this after my experiences there... This place made me believe in the paranormal.  Edit: All this made me want to do was to go back even though I vowed to myself I would never return. Great. Looks like I'm making a trip.
#postmortem Ryan, ever tried Ricky on a mission? Like did you ever think of getting in the persona of Ricky?
for #postmortem : if that psychic felt like the killer was “giddy about what he’d done” i feel like that directly contradicts him covering up the mirrors and the faces of victims. I don’t know it just doesn’t quite add up.
#postmortem the “what is it” sounds like a woman’s voice, possibly the mother?
I’ve been waiting for this day ! I live in iowa and this is one of the most haunted houses in the state . You guys should of went to Edinburg manor also though :(
me: haha ghosts aren’t real lololol *hears ‘what is it’* AYO?!?!?
post mortem question: Where in the hell is the hot doga, it’s the last goddanm season you CAN NOT LEAVE US ON A CLIFF HANGER
#postmortem: Shane, how are you so calm right next to a literal crime scene ? Also Ryan, if you think ghosts are real why not unicorns #shaniac
The wind was intense in this episode
Woohoo! Welcome to my neck of the woods, guys.
Will you guys continue to do ghost hunts on the Watcher? I hope so because I need you guys.
Post Mortem: Maybe the killer covered the mirror because there is a myth that when someone dies you need to cover the mirrors so their souls don't get trapped in there. Maybe the killer believed in that.
I used to think that Shane doesn't need courage because he's got no fear (of ghosts) to fight, but after this ep? After he decided to lay down on the floor near the bed where a person was murdered in their sleep, close his eyes, and just NAP THERE??? I have to agree with Ryan, the dude is INSANE
a new episode, I’m ready to get wet!
#postmortem do you guys maybe think that ghosts won't reveal themselves because of Shane not believing in them/kinda not respecting them in a way + also the fact that you are filming it? Also would love to say it was nice to yk follow the Ghoul boys for a while! This path was and is unforgettable 💙
Post mortem: you guys ever thought about continuing ghost hunting via phasmophobia? Can bring Steven lim along for that ride too!
Okay that whisper actually sent shivers up my spine. Shane, do you have a non-supernatural explanation to for the whisper in the parent's bedroom on 14:46? What about the bed moving? As for Ryan, you're doing great sweetie  #postmortem #boogara
I am a simple man i see a new ghost hunting video i click new ghost hunting video
#PostMortem   Hi Ryan wait what unicorns are not real??
Hello. One for post mortem from the UK. Last week (when left entirely unchecked),  Ryan suggested that the existence of ghosts suggests there is an afterlife and that such an idea is a comfort. I just wanted to counteract that shred of comfort by suggesting that ghosts may not be 'spirits' or 'souls' but may instead be quantum echoes of existence left in time, like an old VCR tape recorded over. The existence of ghosts does not mean an afterlife, it might just be some weird time/physics stuff. #Shaniac
I don't believe in ghosts but my head Canon for this moment 14:46 is the ghost of one of the victims questioning what's going on in there house
Hey guys! My daughter in college and I watch your show together. Love your show!
#postmortem will shane ever admit that ghost are real??
if ur gonna be lame enough to use the blunt end of an axe, why not choose the good ole Sledgehammer instead? Not using the blade of an AXE, is like having a gun & then taking the bullets out & stoning the person to death with them! smh...
I truly think that ryan has become a different person since that one sanitarium. he hasn't seemed as scared since then. he broke that day
28:00 look at the window
Tf, didnt ryan say in his post mortem that this episode was gonna be dope and filled with evidence but theres nothing
Do you think it could be a five nights at Freddy's situation. The murder is trapped by the souls he kills and they won't let him out.
#postmortem I was scared by this episode not because of the ghouls, but because I sleep with earplugs and if someone came to kill my family I wouldn't hear anything either. I already feel Ryan's paranoia  #RealityIsScary
for postmotrtem do you think think it could've been the axeman killer. i know the timeline may not match but its a good thought
Can you imagine if they introduced themselves and then the ghosts says the name of their director/camera person sitting with them? like how much would that freak everyone out.
"Hey! Fucko!"
Im from il. I went to iowa 1 time. Pretty sure every1 there was a ghost or zombie. Weirdest place and peps ever lol.
As someone from Iowa, I'm glad this is where you went!
5:27 pretty disappointed no one made a pigs in a blanket joke
I'm going to the Ghoul brothers so much 😐
Johnny houser probably scared tf out of that ghost..
I was hoping Ryan would start consoling himself by saying "Fear is the mind killer." Lol
#postmortem The town marshall letting the crime scene get contaminated by spectators before the investigation could start? Seems sus...Possible murderer?
I had the craziest thought while watching this episode. What if the reason these hauntings happen is because the “ghosts” think ghost hunters are the ghosts, but you’re talking and interacting from the future. Like when you talk to them, they think the house is haunted at that time from demons, past ghosts, etc. Then when you talk to the murderer, asking them a bunch of questions about the murders in the house, they think they’re going crazy and that these are ghost instructions they have to carry out! What if you’re not hunting the ghosts… but haunting the ghosts? 😱👻
For #postmortem : there is an old belief that you must cover the mirrors in your home after a death so that the spirits aren't trapped there- odd choice for the killer if this was their reason for covering the mirrors- but then again they're a murderer so logical reasoning kinda goes out the window.
For #postmortem :  What does Shane think about the "What is it?" audio recording?
the bacon could've been an attempt to get an animal (a dog) to generalize the bacon and corpses as food to eat
It's not a question but I refuse to believe this is going to the end of the road 😭 how much we gotta pay to keep it going?
About 32 minutes in it sounds like the ghost said “eat me” which, okay
murderer: *covers bodies, windows and mirrors so no one sees what he's done* Shane Madej, lying on the floor for no reason again: sO mAnY pEoPLe wILL seE it
for #postmortem- wild conspiracy theory but based on the spirit box recordings and attic situation and reaction of the town to the murder of eight people (including six children), what if it's a boo radley gone wrong situation... maybe multiple people were aware that it was going to happen?? perhaps this murderer was just out of his mind and the town expected some sort of break to happen at some point. the collective reaction just seems so out of place to me... perhaps the conviction didn't go through because they felt bad about the murderer's state of mind from the very begininng [also plz bring back hot daga and esp the plupples! let them have an encore!!!]
#postmortem what is this beef between Illinois and Iowa???!
The scream that Shane lets out at 9:29 is so good that it belongs in a Tom Baker Dr. Who episode.
18:13 he finally came out guys!!!! congrats shane so proud of you!!!! ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🥳🥳
#postmortem Why don't u guys use rem pods?
for #postmortem: is there a place abroad on your bucketlist that you’d like to investigate but couldn’t because of travel restrictions? i personally think the suicide forest in japan is one of the scariest place on earth, if there had to be a place to make shane believe in the supernatural, that forest would do the job #Boogara4Life
I have decided I will only believe in ghastly ghouls if that ‘ghostly donny’ says, and only if he says, ‘Bacon’ and specifies the weight of the bacon. These are my demands.
1:35 As someone from SD, I can confirm the midwest turf war is a real thing. We all fight over who is the best midwest state, but in the end everyone forgets we exist anyway.  20:02 Little theory: Before this moment in the video, I had had a thought- with this being such a small town, and with the marshall being so nonchalant about a mass murder scene, what if the entire town was in on it? What if everyone in the town just hated this family and decided to go kill all of them? Of course they'd get away with it, everyone in the city plus the police are in on it. When Ryan tried to ask who murdered them, what if the ghost tried to respond with "everyone"? It would also explain how all 8 people could've been killed with no one noticing- 8 or more people were in on it, and they all timed it so they all died simultaneously.  22:38 Oh my god, that "I'm in here" was too perfect. That's actually kinda terrifying.
11:55 Town Marshall (Mr. Frank N. Stein)😉
#postmortem can u guys come to big island o hawaii to investigate the babys cry hospital??  i know its the last supernatural..maybe on ur other channel?
With the flashlight part, maybe the ghost is color blind so they could not tell the difference between the black and blue ones. #Boogara
It's kind of a weird thing to say, but I'm glad they're stopping the show while they're still having this much fun.
IM SO EXCITED
i think it was the marshall, get rid of evidence by letting the whole town tour the house and play with the murder weapon
This just reignited my fear that someone is living in my attic
buzzfeed supernatural > ur mum
Idiot Out Wandering Around (Iowa)
For postmortem: Did they not find any evidence from the meal made and left behind or from shoe prints?
question for postmortem: do you think the bacon could have been like a homemade silencer for the axe? Since most of the victims were killed with the blunt end of the blade, the bacon could have smothered the sound to not awaken the others.
YUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
#postmortem Do you guys think it's possible the killer was never found because he didn't live in Villisca? Could've done this one then hopped the rails to move on to more victims.
for #postmortem: after all that experience do you consider the house haunted by the family and the killer and what's your opinion on the bed moving ryan?
I’m really going to miss this show.
Shane is just a blasé Constantine in our world; constantly discrediting the supernatural but is probably going back behind everyone's back to banish all spectres back to hell. And I salute you!
they’re very Mulder and Scully
Lmao Shane being like "it's quite nice" while sitting on a crime scene- Iconic
#postmortem whats the weirdest case you’ve tackled?
My favorite podcast Morbid JUST finished putting out the part two episode of this exact case  I’m so excited to see the boys do their thing now
I love how Ryan counts down for the spirit box bc he’s too scared to hear more
for #postmortem what was your mindset when going to the house
@22:18 “you do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe” shAaAaAaane!!!!
Imagine a documentary into the supernatural with the ghoul Boys Ryan, Shane, and Sam and Colby and then the spooky boys Shane Dawson, Drew and Garrett. It would be ICONIC having all these making a documentary.
#postmortem. What if the family is actually there and think YOU are the ghosts?
Gotta chalk this one up to the shaniacs
#postmortem: This is the season Ryan loses his belief in the supernatural and joins the side of the Shaniacs because of the complete lack of any evidence at any of these locations
YAAAASSSS
I grew up visiting my grandparents who live just down the block from the house. It’s spooky for sure
Ghosts aren't real kids
Shane is going to climb up a bell tower with plenty of ammo
Post Mortem, Can we get Shane's most "haunted" states top five?
for some reason i thought the bacon was to knock everyone out then kill them .
And Hoosiers laugh as Illinois and Iowa tear each other apart.
#postmortem Ryan, who do you think joined you on the bed? Shane, how was your brief meditation? #Shaniac
ahhh both buzzfeed unsolved AND the morbid pocast's episodes for this week were on villisca!
POST MORTEM. No question, I just really love y’all.
I think the murderer where in through the attic while they were at church
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Are you sure flashlights go on and off when the location isn't haunted?
#postmortem: Why did you just skim over the fact that the killer left a 2 pound slab of bacon on the floor? I can’t stop thinking about why tf he did that.
“Metaphorical ghost dildo”... this series never fails to entertain me.
Post-mortem - Ryan how did it feel to be on the bed from bed knobs and broomsticks?
If you had to choose one of the locations you've investigated to live in, which would you choose?  #postmortem
Should have had a axe body spray sponsor
If I don't get a shirt that says "HEY! FUCKO!" I will haunt you both forever.
For #postmortem: Covering the mirrors can be superstitious because some believe that when a person dies and the soul left their body they can become trapped within the mirror. I believe if the killer was proud of what they did because entrapping their souls would be the way to do it. I’m unsure where the bacon comes in but, what do you guys think of the superstitious aspects of this case?
For #postmortem: not a question but I just wanted to say you guys did a great job at explaining the case! My grandma’s cousins were the Moore family so I grew up hearing this case. I was happy to see you guys covering it!
So Josiah got his head sliced while the rest were bashed in? Sounds like Mr/Ms Killer had a soft spot 😗
How I will say I’m from Kansas City and when you do drive through Iowa it does have a very creepy vibe to it
#Postmortem I'm currently enrolled in courses intended for a Psychology major and I thought I'd give a small synopsis of this character. This feels as if it's two different people given the mediums description of the murders words being straight insane. On the other hand he appears to be struggling with the deeds he did seeing how only one person got properly axed with the rest getting bludgeoned. They couldn't accept their own image in any reflective surface covering windows, mirrors, etc. The strangest thing is the meal being prepared almost as if they were cooling down after a days hard work which is unsettling. This person could be suffering from Multiple Personality Disorder and is legitimately insane without proper control of their actions. Ended up not being a question or anything but truthfully this is a disturbing case with a person lost to themselves.
for postmortem: Why does it seem like there's a little it of a pattern to grisly mass murders like the Villisca Ax Murder House and the Keddie Cabin Murders - sleepovers.
2 lbs of bacon isn't the size of a Volkswagen engine!
For #postmortem : how come you guys never freak out anymore when a flashlight turns on and off so much by itself?
for #postmortem: What exactly happened to the axe? I can't recall you saying, but is it just sitting somewhere in storage now? I feel like the axe would be something that would carry a lot of negative energy with it.
#POSTMORTEM I understand this is the last season, however in the future would you, both Ryan and Shane, consider marking another season?   Also best part of the episode:  Ryan: Well unicorns aren’t real, and ghosts are real.  Shane: AHAAHHAJAAHAJAHAJAHHAHHA 9:25
Metaphorical ghost dildo....i can't😂
(yeef)
For #postmortem Shane what will it take for you to finally believe in ghosts? Or do you think that you'll never believe no matter how much proof Ryan has?
Just a friendly reminder that Ryan proposed to his girlfriend in a strawberry field with a ring box disguised as a strawberry.
#ForPostmortem: Ryan and Shane, which is your favourite episode out of all the seasons? It can be either supernatural or true crime.
For post-mortem,  the bed was the best evidence you've discovered so far. Can you elaborate on what you felt during that experience?
For #postmortem what is the logic behind the murderer haunting the house.
#postmortem are there any places y'all would revisit and try to push harder for the spirits to interact or to disprove any speculated activity?
For #postmortem: y'all better give a warning before including a freaked out horse noise in the background because I pissed myself hearing that suddenly
these are just the best movies to kick back and watch alone. i am both spooked and tickled. i wish a demon would tickle me.
For #postmortem: the covering of mirrors is an old superstition. The belief is that the soul would get trapped in the mirror on its way to the afterlife, so the mirrors would be covered to ensure that the souls are able to leave
hey shane i’m moving to milwaukee for college what’s your favorite kind of herb? #postmortem
ok but the hard to stop and what is it are so clear-
For #postmortem, hearing both "I'll kill him" and "help me" in the same house makes me think the family and the murderer still relive that night on a constant loop, with the occasional "ghost" (ghost hunters) popping up and asking them questions
I like that when they started off doing unsolved supernatural, when Ryan and Shane saw a flashlight turn on and off they were screaming and freaked out, but now they see it happen and barely react and even want the ghost to turn it on and off more
They should try the Estes method!
the scariest thing is the unskippable ads
i agree about the spirit box that thing suckxs it dont really give actual proof but that's imo
Why is this series ending after this season? 😭😭 #q&a
If there was ever an episode I truly believe a spirit box worked or there was genuine evidence it’s in this one, at 14:48 I just couldn’t believe it that was no coincidence.
Why would the persons spirit who murdered everyone else be in the house? That doesn't even make sense
Hello from West Virginia.
Post Mortem: so how do you get those clips? I’m aware you might buy them but it’s very funny to me for someone to be doing that for the show in the studio
F0r #POSTMORE: ok ryan be real here.. on the real. how long were you guys sitting down just listening to static? how long does it take for you guys to get a response on that amazing spirit box. #BOOOGARA also shane ur insane
For the post mortem. Any interest in ghost hunting coming to watcher?
for Post Mortem: will Shane come out and say he is Ryan's guardian angel?
#postmortem  Shane, would you rather say you believe ghosts are real or move to Iowa?
Shane, I'm from Illinois too and I agree about F Iowa 🤣
do you think the town marshal was the one who killed them? i mean since he let a bunch of people contaminate the murder weapon
THERE'S A BOOBAH IN THAT CLOSET
For Q&A: What if it was the Housekeeper that murdered them, and is just keeping close just to seem innocent? #shaniac
for the #PostMortem: ryan exactly how mad would you be if shane rigged the spirit box to say something in a loud demonic voice as a prank?
honestly the dolls in the backround freaked me out more than anything else in this video
#PostMortem  Not a question but it's a super nice touch that the EVP becorder matches to what Ryan's saying, 20:42 !
I feel like Shane is so chill about this because he was the man from the train #postmortem
Kind of sad that your demon house this season was the conjuring house- I was kind of dreaming you'd be the guys to finally get in the Amityville Horror house. Hoax or not, that would be freaking amazing and a badass finale.
For #postmortem: do you think the town Marshall committed the murder? It makes sense when you think about, because he could have hid the evidence by letting the townspeople view the crime scene.
18:56 i heard f**k you
#postmortem I just watched last weeks Q&A and I was promised some evidence? Where's it at, Bergoogs? I liked the bed part though, it almost spooked me! #roastmortem #Shaniac Also, if someone came in my house at 8:30 a.m. because I haven't started my morning chores, they're the ones gettting axe murdered.
I think the final person killed was the girl with the slashed hand and had a struggle as he either got lazy or woke up cuz of the other kills
You guys must have faulty flash lights. They flicker like a strobe light at a disco.
It’s so sad knowing that this is the last season
For #postmortem: Does Shane ever get bad vibes from any of these places? If so, which one gives the worst vibes of all?
What a great video, this last season is gonna be a banger.
“It’s everyone’s favorite tool…” -correction Ryan: Shane is everyone’s favorite tool!
You guys need a medium for these, like in the LA episode at the buzzfeed producer’s house
Hi guys! So #postmortem how many demons do you think reside in shane by this point or atleast may be following you guys? Also are there any ghosts you do wish would follow you?
🇵🇭🇺🇸🇵🇭🇺🇸
Ryan: “almost-“ *immediately gets an ad for alcohol* hm yes.
#postmortem How’s y’all’s bridge doing? Any plans to go back and revisit your ever-so-famously stolen bridge?🤣 love you Ghoul Boys #boogara 👻
#postmortem: Hey Ghoul Boys, great episode. As an Iowan, I have to ask did you stop anywhere cool on the way? Eat anywhere good? Also Shane, when are you going to admit you are a demon in disguise? Just kidding.
Question for post mortem: What if the killer was Michael Rooker's granddaddy?
I’m from iowa, I think me and Shane need to fight😂
this last season so far, trash lol. I feel like its lost its novelty since Ryan doesn't believe anymore and they are leaving this behind anyway.
What is the dad was the murderer I believe what you said as he was the only one that got hit with a sharp part so that could’ve been him bludgeoning his face with the acts that’s why there is no way to get in
For #postmortem: Ryan, what would you do if you met a non-Christian ghost? Would you still try holy water spray or would you ask Shane to discipline his minions?
#forpostmortem how come y’all don’t investigate while the lights are off and use a night vision camera to see your surroundings. Ghost activity is known to be more active with no lights on. Also try to investigate without cameras. A lot of ghosts don’t like to be filmed
All those stops its and help mes in the children's bedroom got me  And then when it said stop me like the murderer was taunting them I can't  I had a bad vibe during that entire scene
The killer sounds a lot like the Axeman of New Orleans. No signs of forced entry, kills residents with their own axe while they are asleep. Probably not the same guy, but the same time period and calling cards. #Postmortem
For #postmortem: Shane, what do you make of the ghost stories told by other people?  What do you think really happened in those cases?
Y'all should go to williows weep the most demonic house in america
#postmortem Just wanted to say hi to the crew real quick. Hi crew.
*This video is hardcore!*
the bacon resembles pigs in blankets lol
The "what is it" was so disgusting..not over it
#postmortem at 31:56 it sounded like the spirit/ghost said “eat me” in a sneering type of way
i’m surprised they haven’t used the estes method
I think counting down might be in the way of hearing any communication. You say "this is your chance to speak, im turning it off in 10' and then you count down so they cant be heard. just sayin'
Y'all should investigate the Amityville house
9:26 Ryan... you’re gonna shake out Shane’s inner demon
Post Mortem: Not really a question, but I like how Ryan sounded a bit different narrating this week's episode. It added a little more creepiness to the video and personally made me more uneasy.
For post mortem: I'm sure it gets cut down so it's less annoying for us watching but how long do you sit with the "spirt box" on?  #reeder
imma be honest, this is the most emotionally overwhelming episode ive watched. i usually watch without being affected by the story and more the activity of the place but the story is extremely grim and its strange how it happened...the qareens of those who died are breaking my heart...
the spirit box responses this episode were so cool
19:25 It didn’t really sound like “help me,” it sounded like Pudgy the dog. Owa owa
The sheet over the mirror is very interesting to me. In Judaism, covering mirrors is a common practice when sitting shiva, the seven day mourning period observed after someone dies. What if that means the murderer was Jewish?
WHY WAS THERE A BOOBAH IN THE CLOSET DHEHDHHS
#postmortem : Covering mirrors after a death is grieving practice in some cultures. Could this practice give a hint to who the killer was and their motive?
#postmortem is it advisable to give the ghosts ultimatum in responding to your voice box thing? Also Shane should stay in haunted england castles overnight!
Anyone who would leave bacon behind MUST be unhinged.
the bacon in wrapped in the towel, pigs in a blanket, everyone being in bed ‘wrapped with blankets’…. was it a metaphor?
Happy to see y’all back at it!
#postmortem what happened to the ovilus
#postmortem Please Please Please tell us more about the three suspects pursued on this case
#post-mortem do you think it may be the axeman because attacked with a axe in bed at night the axe was left behind and nothing was taken
when Ryan says the bed moves, in the black and white replay, you can see between the two pillows dip down
"Unicorns aren't real, ghosts are real." "AAAAAHHH"  So, this is the result of shooting holy water at a demon
I'm just questioning why the police chief would let the people even touch the ax and then take so long to remove the bodies.... 😪😪
*Shane goes in closet*  *ghost sits next to Ryan* “Thank goodness that guy’s gone, he gives me the creeps”  Ryan: “What was that??” 😳
(yeef)
This gives me axeman vibe with the hole attacking people in bed at night with a axe
Th house actually looks nice. Taking screenshots for my Sims build.
Ryan is me trying to be brave in Phasmophobia. lol
Shane how did it feel to be in the superior I state?
So excited-im already planning a vacation there for next summer!!
6:50 sounded like “I can’t say it”, “that’s kinda silly” or “I’m kinda sick”
I hope they ghost hunt on their channel
These guys should separate and make their own channel. Depending on how much buzz feeds paying them
im surprised they didnt sleep in the house tbh
The guy who murdered the family was probably a butcher judging by the fact he had a mean swing with that axe and the fact he literally left a hole chunk of meat on the ground. the father probably had some problems with the man hence why he was killed in a different way, way more painful. Shame how messed up it was letting random people in a darn crime scene.
For #postmortem: based on all of the audio recording you got from the house, what story did you put together about the house? Because the story I put together is kinda sad.    In case you want to know my story: an individual, possibly with some sort of mental illness like schizophrenia or DID, came into the home and killed these people. Once he came to, he realized what he did and felt shame and guilt. This explains the cloth on the victims faces and the mirrors (in some cultures, when there is a death, the person will put fabric on mirrors to keep their souls in the afterlife).  Ps, I am not excusing the actions of this person that killed this family and blaming it on mental illness, but it does make me sad
forget maths.. this is more important
For #postmortem,  Do you think the Town Marshall could have been the killer or could have been involved in some way? #Boogara
Hey ghoul boy pool boys! What exactly did Ryan feel? Did the bed move away from the wall while Shane was in the closet or was it like just the bed moved like someone sat on it? I watched that part so many times and couldn't see anything. #postmortem
Why are they looking for the murderer in the house if the murderer never died in that house 😆😂🤣
The killer made himself a meal from the fridge of the victims. My question is for both of you, what perfect meal would you make from someone elses fridge after dancing with the devil? #postmortem post mortem
Ok for #postmortem. Why doesn’t Shane pick a place to investigate? Just curious. Good ep. very spooky.
there are better voice reading tech i think called earth drum box
Its alot like the amittyville murders
Ghoul boys Ghoul boys Ghoul boys! 👻👻👻👻
Would you rather be a unicorn or a ghost
#postmortem: you guys have to, HAVE TO, talk about that “what is this?” whisper. That’s just 100% a voice saying those words. What’s the deal??
Wait hold on what do they mean that the caretaker of the house was a skeptic?
For #PostMortem: After all these seasons what do we think are the “rules” for ghosts?  Because it seems that whenever a reason is given a haunting it’s incredibly arbitrary. Like in this house for instance it’s one thing to say that the family might be there because that’s where they died but why would the killer be haunting that house? If they’d died there it wouldn’t be a mystery as to who killed the family.
#postmortem What is the ghoul boys going to do after the final season? #ghoul boys 4 life
For #postmortem: What if Shane's positive vibes (or demon vibes, whatever you want to call it) scared off the Ax murderer and now he joined the therapy group with Goatman and Annabelle?
Can you imagine living in that town after the murder, knowing literally anyone you run into could be the murderer? Gives me the creeps.
So I'm hearing a lot of "him" and "he" when referring to the murderer when we don't know their identity for sure. I mean the footprints probably match a man's foot size better than a woman's, but ladies I just wanted to let you know that you are equally capable of brutally murdering and brutalized a family of eight in the middle of the night as well. Slay queens 👸!!!!
#postmortem Imagine you're the perfect family who just moved into a new house in a horror movie Would you rather be haunted by a spooky attick where you can see faces in the window from outside? Or the weird cold basement with whispers and smell of rotting flesh?
Also, I should had commented this years ago cause you guys can't attempt it now but if spirits need energy then why not try to give them energy through catharsis?  Like when you're in a room start screaming at the top of your lungs and see if it brings them out of the shadows #postmortem
I remember the ghoul boys did a “man from the train” episode and that he’s a suspect for these murders.
q: how do you think the killer ended up in the house?? wouldn't it make more sense if they left after they commit the crime and how do you think they would have ended up there again once they passed on???
I would love to see a forensic psychologist analyze the original murder. The bacon, the mirrors, and the covered faces are all such weird details. None of it fits with the vague predatory slasher-movie bs the "medium" came up with. #postmortem
I’m glad to see police work hasn’t evolved much since then…
#Postmortem how do you choose what cases and places to ghostbust and why? I figured there must be so many places that are requested or suggested it must be hard to pick. Anyways, love you and the stuff you do I'm gonna miss unsolved!
For the #postmortem: Ryan, what piece of evidence that you've collected are you most proud of or find most compelling?
Is it just me or is that crime very similar to the Hinterkeifek farm (hope I spelled that correctly but almost certain I didn't)
For the #postmorterm: would you choose to haunt somewhere and if so, where would you choose to haunt?
ryan: *having a genuinely concerned monologue outside about his fear of going into the house after shane pisses it off* shane: HEY FUCKO
for #postmortem... shane if you don't nod your head after the 'are ghosts real' in the final episode...safe to say we'll all be very disappointed
#postmortem do you think the town may have been in on the murders since they were so nonchalant about the crime scene?
“The mag light is hooey!”  Becomes immediately enraged
Ghoul boy time!!!!
#postmortem did they ever look into the father doing it himself or some kind of murder suicide by someone in the house? It just seems sooo wild Noone woke during the attacks
@9:29 shane broke
This should have been like a cross over with Unsolved True Crime!!
Been wondering how long it would take you guys to do this one.  Gotta say it was bizarre to hear you both say what sounded like my name for an entire episode! - Valesca
Shane makes a great point. Why would the killer’s ghost haunt that house when the killer probably died somewhere else.
Based off the covering the faces this killer had regrets for the killing so he didn’t want to see their faces. He also clearly didn’t want to see his own.
I’m currently eating a sandwich sitting in my dorm room in Iowa. How haunted is this state.
#postmortem assuming ghosts are real (and i'm not convinced), why do you think they answer a few questions or make a few noises and then disappear for a bit? do you think it's a lack of energy thing or that there's only a small window of opportunity to cross into our realm? any theories?
#postmortem: for shane, what’s your favorite place where ryan’s freaked out? i’m from charleston so mine’s gotta be the old city jail  love you guys and so excited for the rest of the season!! #shaniac #butloveyoutooryan
“ I don’t believe in ghosts, but I do think Iowa is haunted.”
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
Are ghosts real? No. You have been doing this for years and come up with plenty of "evidence" and no proof.#postmortem
What amount of proof would be necessary in order to convince Shane ghosts exist?
I can't believe they're finally covering the Villisca axe murders! I've been hoping for this one for ages!
Morbid podcast just covered this!
Bro why would the axe murderer even be there 😐 it's not like HE died there #postmortem
Yesssss!!!!!! I knew I saw it in the promo! I’ve been there several times! Love it and miss it!! What a treat!!
I always get so happy when I hear the “are ghosts real”
You two would've gotten better results had you brought 2lbs of raw bacon wrapped in a kitchen towel 🥓
Awwww Shane checks all the rooms to make sure that Sara feels safe 🥺
17:16 the boobah really screams "axe murder house"
Thank you for blessing my feed again this week Ghoul Boys
Best day ever
shane is literally just a demon there to talk to his ghost buddies
The "what is it?" playback was the clearest playback I think we've heard out of all of the unsolved episodes
why
#postmortem how would the axe make a mark that high up on the wall? seems like that could have already been there
#postmortem it was the town marshall... letting the whole town contaminate the scene and also watching people react to his handy work and reenacting the scene probably excited him
Looks like an open and shut case. The Marshal did it, letting everyone contaminate the scene to cover any possible tracks. Let me know if you need any other "mysteries" solved. 🙄🤭
Investigators should use the technology we have now to find the murder suspect and use ansastory to link the killer
Went there a couple weeks ago and locked myself in the closet in the attic. Can confirm it felt weird.
The Midwest discourse is real with this one
#postmortem I don’t think the killer was “giddy” about killing the family. The killer covering the victims faces as well as the window(can’t see his reflection) might be because he didn’t want to see the monster he became because he couldn’t stop himself from killing. It looks like he had no control
For #postmortem I think this episode has the most evidence than any of the other episodes/ places explored. How does Shane feel about the evidence and this episode as a whole?
why do i watch this at night
i swear in order for paranormal investigators to get really good evidence, they need to stay more than 1 night in a haunted place
what if the murderer came to the house tours and that one time and kinda just wandered around being like " oh yeah, i remember that! man the sandwich i had after that was GOOD " HAHA - love you ghoul boys! (for post-mortem :D)
#postmortem ryan… hush. #shaniac
For postmortem : Who do you think would win in an axe-off? The Villisca Axe Murderer or the Axeman from New Orleans?
17:59 ha ha shaniac win!
When we finna get true crime merch
The best thing that made this last season so great     Ryan trolling Shane. It's beautiful to see that, because I am not a shaniac. And if I don't see anymore trolling, then who cares. It's the last season :D also sidenote: when Shane was in the closet, it would probably be very funny if a chair blocked the door and Ryan didn't say a word. (probably wouldn't work because Shane, has no soul)
Ryan: Unicorns aren't real, ghosts are real.  Shane: *And I took that personally*
for #postmortem , what's the dumbest piece of "evidence" ryan has presented to you
I’m just hoping that they’re able to find evidence on the last episode just to prove Shane wrong lol
For #postmortem: will you invite viewers outside US for the final one?
thank god i needed this today
#POSTMORTEM: Ghoul boys Are invited to our WEDDING, bring the ghost with you. Do you think the mayor was the murderer? Since he didn’t care to let the residents contaminate the axe.
that " what is it" was pretty loud
Ryan: "I am one of the most feared ghost hunters alive" You know ghosts aren't real becuase no self respecting ghost would be able to hold their laughter after hearing Ryan say that while his voice shakes
It was a serial killer.
im so happy that they are uploading more of this kind of vids, i was so excited when i saw this
#postmortem is is possible the murderer knew the family? Bcuz usually when a killer puts something over their victims faces it means they're ashamed and dont wanna see the faces of people they know wo they killed
You guys should've done an episode where the EVP is on the entire time
hell yeah, an Are You Scared? episode and an Unsolved episode in the same day
@6:25 ryan: “i dare them to try and split us up.” both: “can’t be done…” shane: “we’re ghoul brothers-” ryan: “-that’s a bond that lasts forever”
That’s a terrible attic
This one is for Shane, what watch is that you have on? #Shaniacs
There's something disturbing about the spirit box constantly saying "Stop me"
maybe the killer was superstitious. Usually you cover the mirrors in a house after someone died there to prevent the ghost of being stuck or something. There are many different reasons. I just know that we did this after my babushka died. #postmortem
i think the interesting thing about the "what is it?" recording, other than the fact that it was clear and could be heard even without subtitles (i was listening to just the audio at the time), was the fact that it sounded like a whisper instead of a tone that one would use in news or announcements on the radio. this for announcements sort of voice was the "anthony" recording from the viper room, which was the only other clear voice i heard that made sense even without subtitles. but that one sounded like it could be from a sports announcement or smth, as if someone announcing a player's name and the spirit box wasn't working correctly hence the three syllables. also asking "what is it?" in a hushed voice doesn't rlly make sense to me on a radio news channel or something, unless it was like an interview and they're doing something that prompted the said question. this isn't enough to make me believe especially since the spirit box is something that could be baloney and/or wasn't working correctly, but i think it's interesting to compare what is probs two of the clearest spirit box voices from the show.
PLEASE go to the queen Mary ship !
I’m 30 years old and I wait for this show impatiently every week 😄👍🏼😅
#postmortem for Shane..in all the many episodes of supernatural..have you ever experienced anything that has spooked you that you have kept to yourself for not wanting to give Ryan credence..and if not if if you experienced a spook would you keep it to yourself?? Love the show.. g to the utted this is the last season
Boy, NBC must acquire and continue this series in their very tv channel IMO. Nobody wants this thing to end for sure
For #postmortem - how long do you guys usually stay at a spot in a location? (when the spirit box is on and you're hoping for a reply)
how are they so chill when the torches are being turned off and on?! i’ve never had a torch randomly turn off and on while using it
#postmortem Theory that it was one of the cops and that's why they let the scene be contaminated
For postmortem- Shane, why do you constantly say that the evidence is fake? After the Saint Augustine Lighthouse, I thought you would after watching over the recording. #postmortem #boogara
the voice on the radio was pretty consistent in tone and pitch wasn't it? I feel like that should convince Shane at least a *little*. anyway, love the show y'all.
In fact Iowa gets its name from a 2001 extreme metal album
the ghoul boys are back
does ryan have any theories on why the murderer still would be there?
#postmortem A relative of mine was murdered in Portsmouth, Iowa in 1886 - was there a murder trend in 1800s Iowa? The state tagline is Fields of Opportunity (for murder)
“I do bring good vibes” that’s because the demons and ghouls leave bc they’re scared of Shane
#postmortem What's your favourite Holloween candy/treat? #candycornrules #alsocandyapples
For the #postmortem: maybe it was the little girls' bacon #Shaniac
Some of the nicest ghosts come from Iowa Like Shawn Chrahan Sid Wilson Mr. 133 Mick Thomson Chris Fehn The ghost glow James Root
#postmortem: Love the ghoul boys!! There is a book called The man from the Train that connects the Villisca murders to the Hinterkaifeck murders from season one.
For #postmortem: The reason why the killer covered the mirrors might have been because he felt conflicted about what he was about to do or already did, and maybe didn't want to see his reflection as to not change his mind or judge himself. In criminology the covering of mirrors or victims' faces is a lot of the times interpreted as a killer being unsure.
for postmortem: bro i literally pass by this town to visit my grandparents also have seen this house from a distance. creepiest place alive!
Just listened to the Morbid podcast episodes on the true crime of the place, excited for the ghosts 👻
I think the funniest thing shane ever did was lay on that pentagram lol
Do amityville
This episode was like a Supernatural meets True Crime. What if the reason the killer was never caught was because he was a ghost the entire time? That's how he snuck in and was quiet enough to not wake anyone up, because he was a spooooky ghost. He wasn't just a psychopathic axe murderer, he was a psycopathic axe murdering ghost! Case closed. (Look, I'm trying to give pity points to the Boogaras, it's just not as much fun for us Shaniacs to have this unfair of a lead)
For the Post Mortem, the killer left with a key to the house!? How did no one ever find that?
#postmortem I don't have anything constructive to say... I just wanted to make it onto the post mortem before the series ends.
#postmortem What happened to the points system? Wasn't used in this episode because clearly the boogaras won? Looks a little suspicious #justicefortheboogaras
"It would be trending on Twitter for a day or two!" 😂
I think my favourite part of this show is Ryan’s bad arguments for why ghost are real
Love this
It’s a creepy old murder old HOUSE! The AXE KILLER!!!
#PostMortem question: I find this episode fascinating. Is there a chance the murderer was a neighbor? #Shaniac #Boogara
#postmortem what did shane have to say about the whisper saying “what is it?” i think that was the most compelling audio recording captured so far.
Yea
"That's a bond that lasts forever" They say on their final season. I say. the ghost girls were successful.  I know they have The Watcher. But will miss this.
I’m pretty sure this is the only one where I’m actually spooked
I live in Desmoines and I kinda wanna go😭
Ryan and Shane doing real life Phasmophobia
For #postmortem, what was the voice you heard Ryan that wasn't caught on recorder? Also love all the stuff you boys make, keep up the great work! #Boogera
#postmortem: Can you explains the whole trend of "The killer's ghost is here too!!" when the killer was never caught. Is there some "logic" to that because it just feels like making the place more spooky for the sake of it. Like I'd buy there being too much negative energy due to the events that occurred versus "Axeman is here too and he gonna GET YOU"
me when my parents make bacon and eggs instead of sausage and eggs:
something about this one has me feeling serious chills
IT 👏WAS👏THE👏BROTHER👏
From morbid podcast to the boys going into the house🥳🥳
For post-mortem: Shane what is the creepiest place you've visited thus far and what do u think is the best piece of evidence do u think u guys have captured? ..Shaniac for life
For the #postmorterm Could they have like sedated the victims somehow and that’s how it didn’t wake them? What if it was the brother? How did he get in the house if the woman couldn’t? Maybe he had a key and could lock the door behind him on his way out after the murders. Maybe he ate dinner with them and sedated their food somehow. It would make sense how he’d be able to not surprise them and how their seems to be no signs of entry or theft. Still don’t know about the bacon tho.
Exciting to watch this after listening Morbid: A True Crime Poscast covered in in depth!
Covering the mirrors was traditionally done when in mourning.
#postmortem when will Shane wear his turtlenecks again?
“Shane was that you?!”  “No, I’m in the closet!” 🤣🤣
#postmortem What would the hardcore evidence for Shane to believe in ghosts?
This one is for Ryan, hii P.s I hope Shane gets possessed this season. Would be the best season finale ever
I literally screamed when I saw the title. FELLOW IOWANS RISE UP!!!
#PostMortem I've done my share of debunking. Ryan "The Boogmeister" has never caught any evidence that Shane couldn't argue against. All these seasons and not one legitimate ghost? Either way I just like watching u guys and dint care what u catch
For #postmortem - was there any place/s you guys went to that legitimately made Shane shut up? #Shaniac #MixingItUpABit
#postmortem : shane to “ghosts” every time he enters a “haunted” environment : look at me, i am the captain now. shane is just built different. ghosts don’t exist, hmm they may do … not too sure #bergariac
Ayo, ppl who live in a 100+ y/o house that has a confirmed murder and is haunted people unite
"Now I just think he's a crazy person" 😂😂
#postmortem feels like New Orleans Axeman 2: Roadtrip
#postmortem Ryan what is your ritual after you leave these locations? Do you pray do you cleanse yourself? I’m genuinely concerned about your energy lol really bummed this is the final season :(
When I saw the doll over Ryan’s shoulder at 32:23 my heart dropped before realising it wasn’t a ghost, anyone else? LMAO
Every episode my mom says that Shane needs to shave or get a haircut… Shane please shave my mom said to
#postmortem are we suuuuure it wasn’t Shane rocking the bed from in the closet? It was real up close to the wall and that wall didn’t look too thick. Just a thought. Loving the series so far!
Representing Iowa!!!!
I LIVE FOR SHANE NODDING HIS HEAD "NO"
Maybe you guys should switch up the colors of the flashlights. They may appear as white and gold to ghosts so they don't understand you. #JustSomeTipsForMoreSuccessfulGhostHunting
#postmortem do you think the killer chose to stay in the house after death just so they could relive the killings? If they were a serial killer or had those tendencies then it could be possible they just wanted to keep reliving the killings
#postmortem if the murderer did haunt the house, why do you think he would haunt the place? What does he get out of it? Do you think in the "afterlife", he continues to haunt them?
Funny thing is that I just finished this episode on Amy Bruni’s podcast today! What a coincidence!
Ryan, what do you think is the most undeniable evidence of ghosts you've encountered?
Fellow Iowan here! There’s a theory that’s been going around a whole that it could’ve been the Axeman from New Orleans. He had murders around the surrounding states and the MO matches the other murders from him.
For postmortem: Going to the issue of Shane believing if the flashlight work, why don’t you two try them on set and ask questions and see if it works? Also, a lot of responses here from the spirit box.  More than when Ryan had a full on conversation in St. Augustine Lighthouse.
For the post mortem: maybe when the spirit box said "switch" it was just calling Ryan a switch
#postmortem I genuinely don't understand why the murderer's ghost would be in the house unless they were one of the eight original victims?? There's no basis for their ghost to be there. Not even a hint that they died there or near there. I think the medium was hamming it up for clout and 2014 man was either stabbed by a human, or also stabbed himself for clout
"you do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe" If my future partner isn't like Shane I'm not dating them 💯
Something that just crossed my mind... maybe the killer is someone that served the family in some way... maybe a butler or the butcher. Perhaps it was normal foi him to come to the house and deliver food. Maybe he brought the bacon that day like he usually did, dropped it in the girls room in the heat of the moment, and forgot about it. It's an explanation for the bacon 🤷‍♀️
Ah, one of the biggest attractions in Southwest Iowa, which says quite a lot about our lovely corn-fed state. It is purportedly about as haunted as a preacher's outhouse.
For #postmortem : Shane you said you don’t believe in ghosts but you said Iowa is haunted. So, one must ask, by what? #boogarasforlife
ghost's sit around campfires telling scary stories of Shane
Thank you for covering this!
I almost like this show as much as jungle school!
yall people cover mirrors after death so their spirits wont get trapped its a common superstition
Okay, but the one that said “switch” through the spirit box? What if the ghost was trying to be like “I don’t have a preference for topping or bottoming” or maybe it’s just a huge Nintendo fan.
Post mortem q: have you put any thought into further ghost investigating or brainstormed other future shows that will utilize your vast experience as Ghost Hunters? #reeder #ghoulboysforlife
bruh he shut the ghosts up real quick with the spirit box lmfao
#postmortem I'm curious to know if after these investigations do you feel any negative energy or have you had a strange correlated dream?
For post-mortem: 22:08, knocking.
#postmortem I was very excited to see the Ghoul Boys in Iowa! Shane, stay out of the war, you’re from near Chicago, that doesn’t count. Did you guys find any evidence from the victims? It seems like the only possible ~spirit~ to be found is the killer’s. Who says they didn’t move on and he’s just there wandering around and going ‘mmm bacon’ all alone?
hmm I have questions abt the 2014 incident: 1) why did he have a hunting knife? If it was a little pocket knife okay, but A hunting knife? that would not help against a ghost. 2) what abt the old couple he came with? Did they hear him taunt the ghost? or did they just ignore him? #boogara  👻
Are you at the Amityville House?  I was expecting to see Jodi the Pig's eyes staring at you two when you were in the attic!
Babe wake up, new buzzfeed unsolved juss dropped!!
Maybe the bacon was left to attract files to make it seem like the bodies had been there longer than they had. Files tend to be on bodies after days not hours.
how do they expect the ghosts to differentiate the flashlights if they were from the 1910’s? everything was in black and white back then, they don’t know what blue is, silly!  /j
Ryan left feeling invigorated... i wonder if the murderer also left feeling invigorated too?
For #postmortem : what if the Town Marshall was the murderer, he basically contaminated the weapon.
#postmortem Ryan do you think it’s possible ghosts don’t exist
Ryan: Unicorns arent real…ghosts are real Shane: scream NOT internally
“the man from the train” by Bill James is a highly interesting read. I personally believe he is probably responsible for the murders of  Villisca.
#postmortem so is Shane's skull count the reason Iowa as a whole is haunted?
At about 19:50 when they’re doing the voice box and they said it said “Stop Me” I thought it sounded like Bette Midler 😂
For Post Morten: crap, it’s the last season so… too late for this suggestion really. But y’all should’ve tried to re-enact the murders? Maybe just to see how it’s possible to sneak around in there in a creaky house, murder folks, and it not be heard.
For #postmortem if the owner after almost 100 years only contacted the 2 girls why did they claim all 8 spiritd still inhibit the house
I've been covering the subtitles with my hand when the ghost speaks so I can see if I hear anything for myself and I have no idea who writes them, but I usually hear gibberish.
My boys were in my state! Edit: lmao spoke too soon. Shane we got beef
He f***ed the bacon
just. vibes.
“Hahaha….I didn’t mean to laugh at that, I’m incredibly nervous right now” me everyday
You guys need to go to skinwalker ranch
For #Postmordem I genuinely felt creeped out/really disturbed learning the history about the houses gruesome  history. How did it change the way you conduct your investigations? If it did
For #postmortem what made you want to investigate the Villisca Murder House? I grew up 2 hours away from Villisca and remember hearing about it constantly while I was growing up. Also I detest Shane’s comments about Iowa #boogara
I’m gonna miss y’all so much. Sending love to the ghoul bois
As a psychologist you have no idea how interesting it is to watch these two seemingly opposite people react to the same thing. I am going to miss them though.
Omg both of y’all lifted my spirits after a busy day of work 🥲🥲🥲
Yooooo that "what is it" was really really clear 😳😳😳 Ayooooo you can literally see the bed go down thats wild
I grew up about 35 miles away from there and always wanted to stay in it but no one would go with me lol
Shane: #ConfirmedGirlfriendProtector 💪
nice
For postmortem: do you think the Marshall was responsible for the murders in anyway, and deliberately contaminated the crime scene before it was properly handled? mans shady af for that
I'm from Iowa, and I have not heard of this "Turf War", and also, Iowa has quite a few haunted places
for #postmortem is there a place that ryan could deem as not haunted, and shane deem as potentially haunted? would love to see the grid flipped.
#postmortem- will there be a return of the hot-daga before this season ends?  Side note - it’s a Villisca axe murder house week in the spooky/true crime world
I will cry if this season ends 😭😭😭 I will continue to support Watcher.
For the #postmortem: Ryan we see you trying to make this into a true crime episode and I am absolutely here for it. My question is, how do you decide whether a case is going to be a supernatural or a true crime episode when it could go either way?
19:39 sounded like “Frederick”
oh ive been here, one of my good friends spent a weekend here :)
Sometimes I wonder if this is all a set up.
hey they got a lot this episode!
The reason Shane doesn’t believe in ghost is because he’s secretly a demon and only wants us to believe in demons.
Damn.. Wish i woulda known that the ghoul boys were coming to my home town. Y’all looked for ghosts in my grandma’s backyard. #shaniac P.S my grandpa found a buried rusty axe blade in the his lot behind the house. But he only decided to duct tape it to a stick and use it as any normal axe.
I used to be a hands-down boogara but over the years I'm ashamed to say that I think Shane has taken me to the dark side and stripped me of my goulie beliefs rip. Ryan, have you got anything to say that will help me convert back? #postmortem #kindaashaniacoops
Tragic case but genuine question, how many of such cases could even be solved in 1912? I feel like as long as the killer had no motive and got out of the house or town unseen, he was already in the clear. There was no DNA evidence or even fingerprints yet. It seems nearly impossible.
#postmortem: Shane, you admitted to checking all rooms before you go to sleep for the sake of your girlfriend - could it be that your girlfriend is a believer?
For post mortem, do you guys know about "the man from the train" book? it kind of theorizes that the killer was a serial killer who traveled via train and killed families in the middle of the night with their axe, and maybe even was the killer in Hinterkaifeck. Its a really solid cool read c:
#postmortem are we going to see one last hotdaga segment? the hotdaga fans await this sweet return! #boogara #notthateveryareaishaunted #unfortunatelyidolovethehotdaga
Honestly how messed up would it be for the person who murdered everyone in that house to haunt it after they died? Instead of the murderer haunting the place where they died, they're just like, nah I'm going back to that house, as a ghost, to terrorize ghosts
at 19:56 that definitely sounded like "Moore", maybe an answer to 'what are your parents' names?"
Maybe it was the Axeman of New Orleans on vacation? They should've jazzed it up that night
9:29
#postmortem an old legend says that spirits can get stuck in mirrors, which is why sometimes people cover them after a death. Perhaps the killer was trying to prevent their spirits from getting stuck?
For #postmortem: Do you think all the cries for help were from the family members being terrified of being stuck alongside their killer for probably eternity???
i dont like the spirit box, i like the oculus better.
For #postmortem: what if the family had a member that was locked away from the rest, hidden. I say that because what if the small room was a disappointments room? Whoever it was could have gotten out and murdered them
My fiance and I met because of our connection to you guys. I'm a skeptic and she's a ghost believer. To Ryan and Shane how have you managed to cultivated and grow your friendship through the years as polar opposites?#shaniacs #Dodgersin7
For the #postmortem was the sheriff ever a suspect? The motives are still unclear but this guy could’ve left the crime scene open and let all the townspeople sully the one piece of possible evidence purposefully so the crime couldn’t be traced back to him.
#postmortem What if the killer was the marshal and he let everyone into the house to contaminate the evidence?
There’s a theory the bacon was for uh..personal use
#postmortem I want more details on the “what is it?” part, because it seems the clearest evidence so far #pointoboogara #sucktobeshaniac
Hey just a huge shoutout me and my wife really love your videos so sad it’s the last season #boogara
Will you ever do another house call? I happen to have a demon that Shane may be amenable to taking off my hands.
the doll behind ryan at 31:53 literally made my heart drop.......i thought a man was standing behind him
Shane’s frustrated scream was the best
i think this will finally be the season where shane loses his mind trying to convince ryan ghosts aren’t real
For #postmortem : I honestly think it's the Marshall. Why would the Marshall allow people to tour the house and tamper with evidence other than to cover up his tracks? No signs of struggle?? It's probably because they knew the person. Definitely the Marshall.
The reason "Dad Moore"  was hit with the sharp side was the killer knew he had to take him out bc he was the only threat to him.
I'm sorry, but when Shane jumped, I expected the floor to cave in😭😭😭
#postmortem Shane and Ryan, has there ever been a place where you both would love to investigate but can't? Either because it's just too scary or for any other less exciting reasons? I have really loved both of your buzzfeed unsolved series and I will definitely miss watching these but I'm grateful for this last season. #loveyouboth #ghoulboys
For #postmortem: Ryan do you think maybe the ghosts especially the children would be more open to communicating with yall if you had the cat ears on? don't lie I know you still have them! Also, I wonder what happened to the bacon since it was evidence? #boogara
It’s obvious that the local butcher did it, he even left the clue 🤔 #postmortem
#postmortem: Ryan, when is the least scared you have ever been at a location
#postmortem Will the two of you continue ghost hunting on Watcher or is this truly sad end of a legendary era?
#postmortem: Was Hauser not a suspect? Sounds like he was around for all of them? Enjoyed this episode!
for #postmortem - I'm curious if leaving places like this standing keeps the spirits trapped and unable to move on? Could demolishing the house help those ghosts that were the victims finally rest? #boogara #butloveyouboth
god i know this is not the last time i’m seeing them, bc we still have the other channel, yet i just love everything they did on unsolved, i started being a fan in this channel and i’m sad that it’s ending. As they say, good things are not forever, which is sad but understandable
Where's the Roast Mortem on the #postmortem you cowards?
Yes, Enjoying this, humor is right on point.  U are the best Ghouls to be had. So sorry for these people, poor souls.  Yeah funny how no one heard something, but also are nine killers energy wouldn't be there. Only the Bacon stain and mirrors coverd.
#postmortem did Shane look at the footage of the bed moving and creaking and what does he think of it? I could see it moving because of Shane, but Ryan wasn't moving and wouldn't be spooked by his own movement. My only logical explanation was rats. Kind of some of the most compelling evidence I've ever seen on this show.
For #postmortem : Shane, what would it take for you to be convinced that ghosts are real? Also, it’s a bucket list item for me to visit your bridge. #Shaniac #lastseason #letsgoboiiiss #itsmeyaboi #goodvibes
I love having Shane as Illinois rep
It’s back B*TCH!!!
I think the bacon wrapped in the towel was to do sexual things too by the killer. It was in the visitors room down stairs. They were also killed last.
#postmortem what haunted places are you guys not allowed to go to
i'm scared, can someone hold me :(
#postmortem: What has been your favorite or scariest place that you guys have encountered so far in the supernatural series? Love you guys bittersweet to know such an amazing thing is coming to end
For the #postmortem, Shane, what evidence have you collected on the show that has you the closest to believing in ghost? What would you need to see or hear to believe? thx for the laughs boys, boogara for life 👻
“the party is almost over” -ryan..... awe im gonna miss this show #postmortem #boogara #shaniac
Why is this the final season ?
Bro shane …idc frick the ghosts
Yay!!! Another banger from Ryan and Shane!!! Thanks guys and everyone that helps with the videos
#postmortem Shane, what is the scariest place you’ve been to in the supernatural episodes and why?
watching this episode at 1am over here in europe is, well, an experience but I'm glad to be here for the premier at least once!!
For post mortem: maybe the police chief was the murderer and that's why he allowed the townsfolk to contaminate the crime scene and weapon.
The Town Marshall was the killer and he let the town tour the house and handle the evidence on purpose in order to contaminate the evidence.
#postmortem Shane is so fed up with the spirit box I fully expect his insanity to rise to a destructive level every time it turns on.
As a fellow Iowan, we thank you for visiting our state:)
#postmortem: for the both of you. if you were in horror movie, what would you want the plot to be? what evil being would you have to defeat?
They mentioned that 7 people were killed with an axe without making any sound which sounds very similar to Ronald defeo. Maybe they'll visit 112 ocean avenue to wrap up
Plot twist at the end of the season Shane ends up believing in ghosts while Ryan looses his faith in ghosts! Also Shane predicted the COVID pandemic when you guys visited the London catacombs #postmortem #halfshaniachalfboogara
So if ghosts appear when bad things happen to innocents, wouldn't the whole surface of the Earth be covered in ghosts? I mean I'm a Shaniac of course but....I'm just trying to understand the criteria for ghost production.
for #postmortem: was there a moment where shane felt a bit scared at any places you’ve visited?
can't stop thinking about that two poud slab of bacon
3:24 the light reflecting on the door window makes it look like the painting's eyes are glowing, pretty cool visual
Nice.
Iowa is haunted Shane, I should know, I live there!
Shane and ryan is always going to be the best ghost hunters.
For #postmortem  Hi Ryan and Shane  #boogara
Postmortem: Why are demons always depicted with horns when there are no large predators, or carnivores at all, with horns? Have we been wrong all along and demons are actually just misunderstood vegetarians, constantly pissed people keep bothering them and killing goats in their name?
#postmortem I’m surprised Shane didn’t kick the closet door and yell like the caretaker to scare Ryan
*30 seconds into the episode * Shane: "you've got to be brave, do you remember how to do that?" Ryan: 😄😑😑😑
Post mortem: is it possible that the murders did wake others up? I just have this horrifying image of children too frightened to move or run.
For the postmortem: Maybe the guy covered the mirrors because back in those days, mirrors were thought to be portals; perhaps they felt guilty and didn't want to see the faces of those he had killed
for the post-mortem. what is the piece of proof that is the hardest to disprove
Is it strange to anyone else that the Villisca house and the Amityville house have the same creepy windows, and both suffered multiple murders. Weird.
hey shane really great minecraft villager impression at 19:30
For #postmortem. What is the most terrifying thing you guys have ever witness
I JUST finished listening to a couple episodes of a podcast called Morbid: A True Crime Podcast. If you haven't heard it yet, I highly recommend! Their names are Ashleigh and Alaina. They do a fantastic job, and I think it is really cool that two of my favorite true crime media sources did a story on the same crime/location this week! Love you guys!
4 #postmortem: The brave boys! I love you two sm; thank you for these past years! I'm a strong #boogara head w/ a scoop o' #shaniac. I wanted to ask: In any of your investigations, have either of you taken a moment to just sit in darkness w/ the cameras off and let the noises, big or small, engulf you? And has there ever been a time while sitting in silence that has topped the others on the spook-o-meter for you?
Wow. I'm a Shaniac, but that episode was super creepy. The idea of a killer lurking in the attic like that is terrifying.
for #postmortem Do you think that the spirits/demons/ghosts don't talk to Shane because he's actually the devil and they fear him. Also love you guys so much!
Shane is such a gift. He says all the things I am thinking and also does it with such perfect delivery and punchline. I adore you, Madej.
#PostMortem Hey Ryan, do you think some ghosts just don’t understand our modern lingo when you try talking to them? #Boogara Thank you both for everything. You’re both brilliant 😎
For #postmortem I’d like to say you guys look quite dapper this episode!   Question whise, does Shane have a bucket list? I assume not but I’d love to know!
#postmortem The story itself is horrifying, especially since most of the victims were children. I know that every haunted place has tragedies in it, but there is something really chilling and upsetting when it was a normal family home and there were child victims. And there is speculation that Lena was awake and fighting back...and that she was sexually assaulted. I cannot imagine how scared she must've been in her last moments. I'm not a total skeptic but if any place was haunted I wish it wasn't this place. Because it would mean that those poor souls were denied peace even after death.
#postmortem imagine the family’s reaction to seeing the ghost of their killer chilling with them in the afterlife like: 👁👄👁
Bedtime Stories did a double episode called " The Man From the Train" that was based on a former detective's cold case work, they link the Villisca murders with the Hinterkaifeck murders and several other and even name a suspect. Apparently this guy came from Germany, and when in the US was clever enough to commit his murders always near the trains he used to get around and always in areas where there were minorities who would typically be blamed for his crimes.
#postmortem What was the room that gave you the most creeps in the house
#postmortem Ryan please say February.
the perfect video to go with my applesauce, thank you boys
This feels like true crime.
@Post mortem There’s an episode of Nukes Top 5 that features footage that Shane took in the lighthouse episode. There appears to be a shadow figure in the corner of the room when he was in the lighthouse alone. I was wondering what you both thought of this.
Morbid just did a two parter on this.
For #PostMortem. I'd like to see Shane's explanations for some of the things seen on the show, such as the bed moving in this episode #Boogara
when they're in there alone are there any static cameras in other rooms? in many other ghosts hunts some of the "activity" caught, be it fake or real, happens in another room from where the guys are filming, like a random shadow figure walking, or a face in a window or a door closing kinda thing.  just wondering since there didnt seem to be any static cam footage when ryan and shane were doing their solo part
For #postmortem : Professional Psychologist and unprofessional Shaniac here. Shane is 100% correct here about the spirit box being BS. It's what we call pareidolia, the infliction of order upon disorder by our consciousness.Don't you think that the fact that you're at one of the literally most famous crime scenes in history (I literally teach this case in my psychology and law class) might not shape your perceptions of the random noises and sounds picked up by that box? Or at the very least put you in a headspace where you're more likely to pick the scary interpretation over the more neutral one?
Unironically, I think there is alot of evidence in this one
#postmortem  If something similar happened around where you live would u go to the town murder house tour? maybe even buy some souvenirs?
#postmortem I don't know details about the crime, but what seems more plausible is that the family was poisoned. Why otherwise how would the killer manage to kill everyone without waking anyone in the house?
Somebody said the bacon was used as lubricant for this psycho's fap session (hence the towel and was found in the girls room). I'm so sorry, but if I have to this in my head, then so do y'all.
#postmortem have you ever sneezed so hard you had a flash back?
#postmortem would you guys consider doing a collab with morbid podcast as they just did an episode about this 🥺???? #boogaraforever #butImarriedashaniac
For #PostMortem : if you had to renovate any of the locations you’ve investigated and live there for the rest of your life, which one would it be? #boogara #ghoulgeng
For post-mortem: someone please tell Shane to keep a hairstyle for more than a week, a need some consistency in my life 🧍🏻‍♀️
The man in 2014: [trips and lands on his own knife] Uh, yeah, can’t remember a thing. Probably ghosts did it.
How strong do you think a ghost has to be to hurt a living being #PostMortem
Am I the only one who gets constantly scared of the mannequin man behind Shane????
For #Postmortem: Ryan, what was your favorite piece of evidence, or the one you found most compelling, in this episode or the entire series? And Shane, how do you put up with Ryan's exhausting energy all the time? #shaniac #butRyaniscooltooig  Ps. Was the ghost dildo analogy rlly necessary?
#postmortem what was your guy's reaction to the voice that was heard in the rooms and picked up by the recorder?
I'm so EXCITED the ghoul boys are back 👻👻👻you guys make my week! And I'm also a combination between a Shania and a Boogarian so just call me a BOOGARIAC OR A SHAGARIAN!  ☺️
"maybe you bring good vibes"  😭😭❤
As a Nebraskan, Shane I’ll assist in burning Iowa
For #Postmortem: I'm new here but I'm sensing the Amityville house for the season finale! Mark my words!
Hi guys! I’ve always wondered if talking to ghosts more personally, as if you’d talk to just anyone, would be more effective in getting a response. Instead “ WHATS YOUR NAME, DO THIS TASK! “ haha, love you guys  #booniac
For #postmotem: If I’m being honest, I haven’t watched this yet cause I have to wait until my boyfriend gets home but I’m sure you get tons of evidence and prove ghosts are real #boogara
It's crazy to me that seemingly no evidence was found pointing to a killer. Either this guy was really careful (which I doubt considering he took the time to make a post-murder snack) or the law enforcement involved just didn't care. Sad that this family will never get the justice they deserve.
As soon as they said "the murderer was most likely hiding in the Moores' attic", me watching this in the middle of the night, decided it was more than enough to call it a night. 😂
One of the finest pleasures of life:   Going on YouTube and finding out Ryan and Shane posted another epic video.
#postmortem Shane what was the closest you've ever been to believing in ghosts?
ryan: “i’m afraid i might see something in there”  meanwhile shane: “i’m looking for the killer, fucko!”   i just love these cuts that they do, i can’t keep it straight w shane lmao
Only 34 minutes??? We were spoilt with the conjuring house episode
omg the Morbid podcast just did an episode on this case
#postmortem What’s your favorite cases from all of Supernatural?
Can't even watch these videos since I get scared shitless 😅
For the #postmortem: Shane, what is the single most compelling piece of evidence that Ryan has come across? Ryan, when have you been most disappointed by an investigation's evidence yield?
So I live in Omaha and one year my sister dad and I decided to go to the Axe Murder House and while it definitely gives off some creepy vibes I don’t believe the murderer is in the house. If anything is there it’s the family and the 2 girls
#postmortem Shane, after all these years of investigations, have you encountered anything you personally don’t feel you can explain?
Shane can win this “I” state it’s boring over here in Iowa man! 😭
okay listen,,, I fully believe in spirits and all and if I were to be in a haunted house I'd be scared shitless. HoWEVER I feel like the ghosts are so repulsed by Shane (no offence) that I wouldn't be scared if I was with him.
9:28 LOL Shane omg
God I would love these 2 in a ghostbusters movie or something
I Ghost
#PostMortem I know this is gonna sound strange, but Shane brought up an excellent point during his solo investigation. Why does the killer haunt the house? Do ghosts get to choose where they haunt? Or do they haunt the place that brought the most joy to them? Doesn't make sense to me. #Boogara
For Postmortem: Any suspicion that the family was drugged? Might explain why none of them woke up. Also Ryan you captured some pretty good audio clips this episode, still don't believe in ghosts though.
What is it with all of the other Midwestern states having beef with Iowa? Speaking as a Nebraskan with South Dakota family, everyone rips on Iowa.
Its interesting how you guys are mixing the true crime style video with this season of supernatural. Like an homage cos we're never gonna see true crime again.
Ryan’s greatest enemies are ghosts. Shane’s greatest enemy is that damn spirit box.
9:18 - 9:23 -9:27
For the #PostMortem:  Hey Ryan & Shane!! Excited to watch this season finale & looking forward to your content on Watcher! My question is, what is the most compelling piece of evidence ya'll have experienced in these episodes? If you can't talk about it because it may be in an upcoming episode, that's alright!! Take care to the both of you & enjoy the rest of 2021! Stay safe!! #KindaBoogaraKindaShaniac
Ryan, would you feel bad or vindicated if Shane were to be attacked by a ghost or demon?
"you sick little weirdo" hahaha
Covering the mirror is a respect thing so the spirit doesn’t get trapped
wish u would go over suspects like true crime since u arent gonna do that again
omg is this character growth??
only 34 minutes sadge :(
How is Ryan not more freaked out about that bed moving? Unless he's just covering for an epic fart? Seemed like a big boogara win to me.
For #postmortem: what do you think about the "what is it" voice? Was that part of the house empty? Could it have been a crew member? Is Ryan's theory that it was a ghost inspecting the voice recorder? It was way to clear to have come from outside. I think the boogaras deserve a point here.
Honestly Idk which is worse, meeting death at the sharp or the blunt end 🪓
“now i just think he is an insane person” just say it, we all know it, he is a demon, just say it ryan
It's funny you could have covered this house in the unsolved mystery too
that what is it sounded more like let us in lmao
im fangirling rn
idk what i’m gonna do when this show comes to an end
It's already been one week, I'm not looking forward to the last episode ☹️
For post mortem: were the cigarette butts at least kept as DNA evidence?
Where is this evidence that Ryan promised us in the last post-mortem? You said it would be packed with evidence… but I see none… :D #postmortem #shaniac
#postmortem : what has been the most horrifying place you have been throughout the show?
"I'm in the closet... just chilling." Me in a nutshell
"You do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe" awww Shane! That was adorable AND thoughtful. <3
#postmortem do we know what happened to the bacon? like did the investigators eat it or would that be considered disrespectful
"We're ghoul brothers."  "That's a bond that lasts forever."  I'm not crying, you're crying.  #postmortem😢
The Killer 100% missed breakfast hence the bacon. Or maybe he was a vegan and knew that the family was in possession of bacon and was out for revenge.  👀👀
for #postmortem: what do sara and mari think of your episodes, or the series as a whole? I wanna know about the ghoul girls
Honestly the idea that the murderers spirit is in the house seems absurd to me. Usually it's the victims who stay in their place of death, but killers don't reside in their victim's houses unless they died there or spent a majority of their time there. Obviously the killer wasnt someome in the family, and there isnt enough info given to know if someone else was often present in the home.   It just doesn't make sense that in this one instance, the killer who got away would return here after his death. If the murders were something he couldnt control, he likely did it again somewhere else. Why didnt he return there?   If anything is there at all, it's most likely the family.
Oh my God YEASSSS!!! I'm so sorry I've just been in love with this entire series from the beginning! ❤️👻❤️👻❤️👻  I truly TRULY hope that you guys will do the Myrtles Plantation overnight!
Shane screaming when Ryan *almost* gets his point about the flashlights turning on and off is priceless
#postmortem hi! really love the show :) so glad you guys are back! i wanted to ask what has been your favorite place to visit throughout all of the seasons? can’t wait to watch more!!
I'm supposed to be studying but MrBallen, Logan, and Ryan and Shane all uploaded on the same morning and I'm only human.
👍
For #postmortem: Was the bacon smoked?
"You do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe." I imagine her making Shane check everything because if ghosts are real, he has certainly pissed a lot of them off.
My best friend (Kat) and I (Kit) went on a ghost tour in Georgetown (Washington DC). We got to see the house from The Exorcist. She’s a Shane-like “I’m going to provoke the spirits” kind of person and I’m a Ryan-like “How about we don’t do that!” And it was hilarious
#postmortem this felt like one of the more unsettling Unsolved episodes you’ve done, what an insanely brutal crime. Ryan when the bed moved & hearing Shane’s little voice still in the closet - how the heck were you not out of that room instantly
The sheets over the mirrors: isn't that a Jewish tradition after a death? But I think the windows would have been left open if that was the reason for it.
#postmortem my four year old walked in on the part where Ryan was alone using the  spirit box when he said Ryan she was like Ryan.
For post-mortem: how long has the turf war been going? And how many years has Shane lived. Also maybe Shane knows that Idaho is haunted because he killed many people and they haunt the state to this day? Also what if the the killer(s) was from Chicago from one of the mass producing slaughter houses that existed during that time? Also thank you for the Godfather reference. Also love the hair.
Why is it always the perfect families that this stuff happens to. Maybe people just need to start being bad parents smh
I'm going to miss Ryan and the Wish version of the actor Edward Norton when this season ends!  I love these guys!
The Ghoul Boys finally come to Iowa!!
Shane is our righteous Lord and saviour and is never incorrect #shanic
Shane just intimidates the ghosts, they get performance anxiety and shut down, and I mean, can you blame them? Shane has no chill.
#postmortem these is the theory that all the people killed were drugged by the food they ate before going to bed and why didn't you show photos of the children so everyone could see how young they were?
Hi guys! I just wanted to say that I really love the two of you and appreciate the joy you brought me throughout the years with this show. I’ve been watching since the beginning and I’m glad I stuck through until the end. #Postmortem #BoogaraButAlsoPartShaniac
#postmortem for ryan, whats a location you thought was haunted untill you explored it?
24:41 Shane cheerfully exclaiming "So let's see if I end up in a puddle of my own blo-oood!" like some sort of game show host has me dying. Easily a new iconic Unsolved moment.
Pretty good evidence in this one! 👻
#postmortem if the family didn’t wake up, were they drugged? And was the bacon sort of like an ritualistic offering to something more sinister who masterminded the killings? To be honest, the mirrors being covered and hearing release me and help me multiple times seems like there’s someone trapped in the mirrors/the house, whether that be the one who urged the murderer, the murderer, or the family, and that’s why they’re covered.  Or the bacon could have been the friends gift of breakfast as they slept over? I know I bring something to a party/get together
Idaho is superior.
#Q&A Why dont you guys get the motion sensors try them out if ghost "Are Real" then that would help. #QA #postmortem
Ryan: Hey! Ghost: Release me”
For #Postmortem, how come you chose this case for supernatural rather than true crime? Seemed really interesting but I didn't see any ghosts #Shaniac PS Love you guys
#postmortem thoughts on these people being victims of an unidentified serial killer that traveled along the railways? There were a number of similar mass murders around this time period that lead some to believe there was an active serial killer that was never quite discovered. They all follow a similar MO (blunt end of the ax used, covering windows and mirrors, leaving behind a bowl of bloody water used for cleaning up, a young girl either appearing to have fought back or been posed, etc.) happy final season!
Couldn’t the bacon have been left by some random person viewing the home? Or was it definitely left by the murderer? Maybe it was in someone’s pocket and it fell out lol
So a man got stabbed in the house and apologizes for messing around in the house/being skeptical and then Shane goes in there and goes "hey fucko". Shane, I really underestimated your level of insanity.
Nobody in Iowa has beef w Illinois. It's all against Nebraska I'm sure you understand Shane
I heard "Probably" instead of "Help me" at 19:28... This talking to ghosts machine thingy is very much up to a listener's interpretation....
Kinda disappointed that your trip to the Midwest was to Iowa (shoulda been Minnesota 👉🏻👉🏻)  but still glad you stopped by
has anything ever followed you guys home in any of your investigations (ones we have seen and those we are yet to see)?
They cover mirrors so spirits won't get confused and trapped there.
For the postmortem: do you guys ever feel down or drained after staying at a haunted location? Also aren't these houses 100 years old I'd be more concerned for bed bugs and insects than spirits wanting to have fun
#postmortem that moment when shane got a hold of the screaming box of tunes it suddenly went real quiet, shane is indeed the devil
#postmortem I've heard elsewhere that some people believe he used the bacon to masterbate....so....really normal.
#postmortem Shane, has there ever been any evidence that slightly convinced you, even for a moment, before deciding to deny it #boogara
Been waiting on this so long thank god boys
#postmortem i just think its kind of haunting that the killer not only put literal covers over things like he was ashamed, but a lot of the spirit box replies seemed to have a running theme of "stop me" "hard to stop"  "ill kill him" and "im miserable" makes u think if it is really the killers spirit, maybe ryan was right that he couldn`t help himself and felt ashamed? idk i watched this high
#postmortem BRING BACK THE HOT DAGA!!! BRING BACK THE HOT DAGA!!!
for postmortem: do you guys think the EVPs you got from the spirit box were from the killer, or from the victims? especially with the "help me", i could see it as either - perhaps the killer was remorseful over what he had done (evidenced by him covering the mirrors and their faces), but i could also see it having come from the victims (for obvious reasons). also, i've been in iowa my whole life and i've always wanted to visit the villisca murder house! iowa doesnt have a whole lot goin on, so there being this giant mystery so close has always piqued my interest - but, even if there's nothing going on here, iowa is still leagues above illinois #boogara
For #postmortem : for the last season are you guys doing the amityville horror house?
#PostMortem Ryan when it felt like something sat next to you on the bed and you tried to show Shane did it not occur to you that you were sitting on a ghost?
why would the a murderers ghost be in the house, if anything you shouldve tried reaching out to everyone that died in the house
For #postmortem : Do you think this is the most evidence captured by the Ghoul Boys yet? The bed incident was pretty solid evidence to me, definitely not the wind. #boogara
with all the people that went in and out of the house before they could secure the scene, I would bet that it was not the murder that covered faces and mirrors
Woo hoo! Ive been waitin for this one.
“it’s actually quite calming” says Shane lying next to a crime scene
You guys are so cute that i wonna place you in a jar and tickle you. #postmortem#cuteryan
doesnt it seem weird to kill 8 people and never again?
I'm somewhere between a Shaniac and a Boogara but even I was impressed with what the boys found in this one
what is it? let us in? medicine? 14:46
Why do people think killers haunt the places they committed murder in? Unless they died there what reason would they have to haunt the place?? Guy could have moved to the other side of the world before he died for all we know.
For the #postmortem based on the bacon, mirrors being covered, and John being the only one attacked with the sharp end of the ax it seems like this was a very personal murder, maybe centered around John.  Also it is possible that the family was drugged, contributing to none of them waking up?
"Ax Murder House"   Talk about exactly what it says on the tin.
Ghouligans at it again #Shaniac
22:16 can we just talk about how much Shane loved his girlfriend it’s so pure
#postmortem I’ve always believed it was the brother, he was the one who got there with a key for them to get in…. And the killer locked the door behind them….
Is there any logical explanation behind why the flashlights flicker out like that?
#postmortem to ryan why didn't you took the holy water gun to this house  With you & what's your thought on axman covering the mirrors and curtains over the window?
Shane brings good vibes #trufax
Wait I'm confused. Why would the killer's spirit be in the house? wouldn't it just be the 8 victims? #postmortem
#postmortem how’s demon shane and ricky going? missed you guys welcome back
For the #postmortem ghosts are always reported as someone from a long time like the 1800-1900s why do think this is. #shaniac
lit video! 🔥 top 5 best youtube channels of all time
Ah… our favorite ghoul-friends…😼❤️
18:13 Shane came out of the closet
that woman’s voice in the beginning was so distinct that it’s hard to believe that it wasn’t a crew member. was there anyone else present that could’ve said something?
Is it just me or does Shane look like Walt Disney with that mustache? 😂
I know people in 1912 didn't have TV or the internet to keep them entertained but I still can't believe a bunch of people wanted and were permitted to just walk around a gruesome crime scene!
Tell Shane to look up the Toledo War, then come back and see if he’ll make remarks about Iowa being a bad state
The spirit box is the best bit of the show.
When I was in college some friends and I rented this place out overnight. We went and turned off all the oil lamps before leaving. As we walked out the one in the attic window came back on. F that noise. I bounced.
If you really wanna show Shane that ghosts are real, get a medium and go to Queen Mary, it might not be up for much longer so if you really wanted, take Shane there
For #postmortem  Shane : *make some noise Ghost : Leave me please 🥺 Ryan : Why do you want me to leave?  Get it boys, ghost are scared to Shane!!! He is with Annabelle and the Goatman!!!  #Shaniac #Shaneisdefinitelyademon #FinalSeasonYEAH
i believe the “hard to stop” reading was the clearest phrase i’ve heard on the show. though i believe in ghosts, a lot of the readings sound like a jumbled up mess.... i’m curious how shane feels about this phrase #postmortem #boogara #shaniac #loveyouguys
#postmortem are Asian ghosts scarier?
i’m a shaniac but this episode has some of the clearest voices i’ve heard
This episode probably had the strongest/clearest spirit box and EVP in the series so far, wonder what Shane thought of it... #PM
If there was a hundred people inside in the short 3 hours before actual humans arrived, who is to say that the bacon even came from the killer. It could've been from one of the hundred people and faulty memory made the brother think it was there the whole time.
For #postmortem : There have been many different approaches you guys take to try to communicate with spirits, from cat ears? to straight up menaces, which one do you think gets the most reactions? #boogara #donthurttheirfeelings
I was just bingeing these episodes and this comes out. Amazing.
If you where a ghost where would you haunt
That's why I have four pitbulls. Nobody can get in without getting hurt.😏
#postmortem what are you going to be for halloween #boogara
For #postmortem What if the Axeman of New Orleans was the murderer? #Boogara
Ghost: “when I said switch I meant switch the damn spirit box off! My spectral ears are bleeding” 😱
Heyyyy them ghoul boys are back in town.
#postmortem What do you do after you’ve been in ghost houses? Holy water bath or blood sacrifice?
4ibigf #von.ong
LETS GO TVEY ARW BACK
loved this so much can't wait til the next one
For #postmortem since you guys are hanging up your ghoul boy hats are you passing the torch or continuing them on your own channel?
For post mortem: Is Ricky goldsworth a demon that has possessed Ryan? Is that why Ryan is so insistent that Shane is the demon? To throw us off his own possession?
Shane: how loud is Iowa? Ryan: I can hear everything
Do you think that it's the same being as the New Orleans axe murderer? I think if it is a ghoul it could be the same ghoul.
For #postmortem This channel called Observe has been doing body language analysis videos about you two. I thought they were really good and I would recommend them to you!
#postmortem What was the scariest place you’ve gone to. ps great video keep it up, love you guys
Shane, are you at all unnerved by the FACT that several people died in that house?
14:42 Oh wow.......
For #postmortem Ryan says that he still believes in ghosts, but hasn’t 7 seasons of not really finding any evidence convinced you to the slightest they might not be real??
Iowa doesn't exist so of course it's haunted.
for #postmortem if you had to revisit any spot from buzzfeed unsolved and make confirmed contact with a spirit who would you want to talk to?
#postmortem during your years of this, where did you feel most genuinely in danger? Ghosts or animals. Anything
Have you read about the theory that this was a serial killer? There were multiple axe murders of entire families relatively close by and around the same time period.
#postmortem after ryan asked why they murdered at 7:05 did anyone else hear "pleased me"??? Anyways, I am hyped the ghoul boys are back to investigating!
Hey I'm new to the channel, what's a ghost?
AHHH IVE WANTED YOU TO DO THIS FOR YEARS AND I GAVE UP WHEN THIS WAS UR LAST SEASON!!
For Post Mortem: How do you guys sleep knowing the snail is always following you? 🤔🤔 #shaniac
For postmortem: why are you treating the spirits like you are in a demonic residence? Most are innocent children who lost their lives tragically!  #boogara
For the Post Mortem! A theory about the bacon; didn’t people used to hold raw meat to bruises to stop the swelling? Could it be that in the struggle with Lena Stillinger she hit the attacker and they used the bacon on the injury? Not sure why they would leave it there though, but it could explain why it was wrapped in a towel
14:48 - sounds like a feminine voice though, unless the murderer was a woman.
The town marshall did it
Omg I just listened to the Morbid about this
i just listened to the morbid podcast about this case! really great podcast to check out if you want to find out more about what went down at the villisca house as well as other true crime / spooky stories
Omg this is one I've been begging for the longest!!!!!!!!
God this was one of the best Shane’s “investigations” lmao
19:59 the spirit box picked up when I heard it yeah one, which means there could have been more than one killer or person involved
My day just got a whole lot better thanks to the demon boys :)
yall really came to iowa and just didnt tell me? fake as hell boys...
For the Postmortem, Ryan, where did your "I am not my fear. I am stronger than my fear" mantra come from? Also, you said the idea of seeing something is horrifying which makes me wonder, if you saw something undeniably paranormal, do you you think you'd be more scared or excited?
Just a tip: listen to all the "ghost voices" on the recorder and spirit box with your eyes closed and without reading the subtitles and they sound like a load of meaningless nonsense. #Shaniac
Bruh I live right by here can’t believe they were here
#postmortem when the day comes and shane gets split in two by a murderous ghoul where would his demonic soul reside? inside ryan?
It’s a shame you guys can’t settle into these sites for about a month or so to really get the feel of the places!
Lol Shane is right. The person who killed everyone got what they wanted, killed and got away with it. Probably died peacefully somewhere else...why spend eternity haunting it??
For post mortem: do you think they could have all been drugged at church? Maybe that’s why they didn’t react/fight back? PLEASE MAKE MY DREAMS COME TRUE AND RESPOND TO ME
"You do what you do to make your girlfriend feel safe." Awwww Shane
For post mortem: Whats the spookiest thing not caught on camera you have seen/heard while ghoul hunting?
For postmortem, I’ve never asked a question before but, do you think that the bacon wrapped thing was like a joke? Like pigs in a blanket? So maybe he was mocking them.
"I'm not my fear" is Ryan's motto this season
I like these
#postpostmortem at the club cause from England but #boogara at heart and we love it
#postmortem I’ve never gotten on a postmortem before, please give
Ryan: this is the season of evidence!!  Also Ryan: dang, we’re alone here aren’t we? guess there aren’t actually any ghosts here :/
For Post Mortem: About the medium that supposedly talked with the ghost of the killer. Could they not have just done a few minutes of research about the house and just made something up?  There doesn’t really seem to be a way to confirm what the medium said and a person making something up seems a lot more plausible than talking with a murderer from a century ago #Shaniac
Look this may be a farfetched theory but I think the ax murderer was the town marshall himself because he just let the people handle the ax destroying any fingerprint the killer left behind
For #postmortem will we see the end of the hot dog saga?
You know how men acted when Joker came out? This is my Joker, except I will be SO much worse
4:24  ther- lmao bye 💀
I wonder if maybe the bacon was for in case they had dogs?
For the #Postmortem: Do you guys think that the medium's statement about the killer liking those who are "Putty in his hands" might refer to something he liked to boast about back then? Like that was his catchphrase or something? I just felt like that might be a possibility when I heard it mentioned. #MostlyBoogara
#postmortem As a sceptic+#shaniac I'd love to actually be convinced of ghosts existance. What is a piece of compelling evidence/case that can prove my sceptical mind wrong?
Will you guys have another channel or show you guys will be on together? If so what is it, and if not why?
It’s now 4 am for me, why am I not contemplating sleep. ( ahhh ik I’m a shaniac ) 🥰✨
#postmortem the Marshall seems sus, I mean no sane person would've done that. Also, what's Shane's problem with the spirit box? :p
with all the evidence gathered over the past few years i’m curious how shane still doesn’t believe in ghost. were there any moments where shane was actually scared? #postmortem #boogaras
for the #postmortem : shane, i don’t believe in ghosts either, however i try not to mess with what might be haunted (on the off chance i might be proven wrong (very unlikely)). are there any precautions you might take to protect yourself if it ever came to light that ghosts ARE real (once again, very unlikely) since you’re someone who would’ve pissed off a LOT of supernatural beings ?
For post mortem: is this the season Shane will turn into a BOOgara????
I feel bad for Ryan, whenever he says something funny Shane chimes in and says something funnier  Anyways #shaniacs
#postmortem have you tested the flashlights on their own to see if they just turn and off by itself with no “ghost” activity? Idk like in ur bathroom
#postmortem will this season finally be the season where Shane finally believes in ghosts? Shane, was there a place you guys went to that almost made you believe in the supernatural? Also, are you guys pleased with the season finale? have a great day. sister, mom, and I will miss the supernatural series. -Valerie p.s the series got to end with the sallie house
Post Mortem Question: How come Shane never gets to narrate the background stories of the episode. I think he deserves a chance to “spice it up”
LETS GOOO
#postmortem for both of you, if you had to pick a house you’ve gone to to buy and live in for the rest of your life, which one would it be? Loving the final season
Watcher and unsolved. Friday's are great again
YES MORE AXE MURDERS
#postmortem I seen every episode serval times I love watcher but what happens to the ghoul boys after the season  very concerned ryan is gonna get killed off like the professor !? # reeder
I love Shane's sassy crossed knees.
#postmortem what are your favourite spooky snacks to bring with you on ghostly adventures?  Big fan of the show, always bringing me some serotonin at the end of the week :)
What do you think about the theory that this could be connected to the Axeman of New Orleans?  It happened only 6 years before New Orleans and has the same motive and there were more the years before and between that. Someone broke in through the back door, unheard, murdered the whole family with an axe and in many cases had a meal in the house or covered the mirrors, windows and faces, andhe always left the axe there. Often times he'd sneak in the night before and wait the whole day so no one would hear anything, which i is why he would then eat after the murder. Its all cities with train stations very close by, so he could have traveled by train. It just feels very unlikely someone would murder so many people so suddenly and then just stop.   The M.O. is the same and the time frame works. What do you think? #postmortem
#postmortem Josiah Moore actually wasn’t the one hit with the sharp side, in court transcripts it’s stated that it was SARAH who was the only one hit with the sharp side of the axe This makes a lot of people look at it a little differently and think it might have been someone angry/jealous towards sarah (because of Josiah’s affair)
Ther
Ghoul boys is why I’m on this channel
24:32 what a qtie clown
At least they have fun doing these, even though Ryan gets scared.
I've noticed that way too many crimes happen in June.  Which is my birthday month.  When crimes like this actually happen on my birthday, I weirdly feel guilty.
For #PostMortem: love what you guys do, always having a laugh and a spook with these episodes. Anyways, have you ghoul boys ever thought about ghost hunting with the Try Guys? It probably would have been ssoooooooo hilarious. Thanks a bunch! <3
I think the man on the spirit box is more likely to be the husband that was murdered rather than the murderer as he died there and he said "release me" as if he wanted their spirits to finally move on and be freed from what happened to them all. Also when he said the thing about the brain he could have been trying to describe what happened to them all.
How come nobody ever talks about the spirit box? How exactly does it work. Has anyone from the company that makes these things testified that they just make the spirit voice box say random things or something? Also at 10:51 are these flash lights designed to easily be turned off or are they the ones that are pushed to turn off?
please, the scream that shane let out when ryan said “unicorns are not real, but ghosts are real” he is feed up lmaooo
I was pissed because I can’t find a ps5 but not anymore
As an Iowan I had no idea we had beef but I will confirm our state is haunted
FINALLY THEY ARE BACK! SO EXCITED!
" It's me, Austin! It's me, Austin!. It was me all along Austin!" - Vincent Kennedy McMahon
Ryan: But unicorns aren’t real. Ghosts are real Shane: So you have chosen death
#postmortem: there are a lot of amazing haunted spots in India, and some thrilling stories behind them. If you’re continuing this series on watcher, you should definitely visit India.
What a coincidence that Morbid just covered this story!
It’s a no bones day. I see a new video, I click. That’s self care
Shane having a stroke after the unicorn thing is hilarious 🤣🤣
It is a cute house. Has curb appeal.
they died on 6/9 lol
For the #postmortem in the Stillinger room, the spirit box was mostly picking up what sounded like one voice. Does this make the spirit box more/less valid in your eyes?
Damn, Morbid podcast literally just covered this the last two episodes  Hmm, that slab of bacon. Must've been pretty greasy . Listen to the Morbid podcast episodes about this. Highly recommend.
tbh I thought the ghost was saying ryan tops and bottoms when it said "switch"
why is no one talking ab the boobah in the closet at 18:28 😭
That voice saying “what is it” WAS SO CLEAR
New subs. Here🙋
#postmordem I believe that over time, Ryan has slowly become more emboldened and not as scared as he used to be. I think Ryan is secretly a Shaniac
I really thought shane would jump out of the closet scaring ryan.
I mean the marshall letting the townspeople handle the ax isn't a bit suspicious? maybe he was trying to get the weapon contaminated because it would incriminate him?
yayyy you guys always make my day <3
For the #postmortem Why are the only places Ryan collects "evidence" old derelict places where the shadows are long, the building is run down and the rooms are all dirty and creepy. The only "evidence" collected in new/clean places has been when a paranormal "investigator" was along for the ride. I'm guessing the quotation marks made this obvious already but #shaniac all the way. Also I haven't watched this episode all the way through yet but I wanted to make the 1 hour time limit you gave out in the last post mortem and I'm pretty confident (since ghosts aren't real) that you didn't blow the lid off it and discover proof of an afterlife in this episode either. Kidding aside I love watching Ryan fail to find ghosts more than any other ghost Hunter in history though because at least Ryan is honest and seems like he genuinely wants proof not views. Sad to see this one go.
Ok but… ARE WE gonna get amityville Ryan??? #postmortem
for the postmortem: ryan, do you plan to continue ghost hunting after the end of buzzfeed unsolved (not necessarily on camera)?
Let’s goo
Wow, I live in Iowa, guess I’m a boogara now. #formershaniac
Ryan’s cackle at 10:24 will still be the scariest thing on this episode
Experts on the case theorize that the bacon was placed there after the killer used it to “get himself off.” They believe that Lena was posed differently because she was “special” in some way.
For the most porterm: Why are we called Bergarans and not Bergarians? #bergarians all the way
For post mortem: id just like to say, there other haunted places in iowa like the black angel of oakland cementary and the banshee of brady street. I think its cool that the ghoul boys came to my home state.
For post Mortem: maybe the “what is it” was one of the kids waking up wondering what the noise was?
For #postmortem : If you could have FOR SURE proven ghosts are real with any of the past cases, which would you have liked it to be?
What kind of flashlights do you guys use that turn on and off by themselves? It has  never happened to me.
#postmortem: Shane, when the voice in this specific episode said, "what is it?" What would you write it off as??? It sounds a little TOO clear to just be something like the wind🙃😬
Is it a problem that I always howl with the wolf at the beginning of each intro? #postmortem #shaniac
came here after watching “are you scared” and rett and links scary tiktok story soooo today is a good day edit: shane screaming in frustration is kinda hilarious  shane you good you doing ok buddy
this kind of reminds me of the Lawson Family murders where the crime scene became a tourist attraction
GHOUL BOYS 🤩
#Postmortem What does Shane think of the EVP that was caught in the bedroom? He always said he wanted to hear consonants in an EVP. I'm a non-believer, but that was pretty clear. I wonder what his explanation would be. #Shaniac #Loveyouboth #AllHailTheWatcher
Okay, so I was getting a glass of water with my back to the screen when the subtitles said “release me”; and I heard “Ryan and Shane”. Anyone else?
Does anyone just think it was the Marshall? I mean he did knowingly ruin the crime scene.
Iowan here: Can confirm, we are all ghosts of the corn. Also, have SO been hoping the Ghoul Boys would visit this place after I did a few years back so needless to say, I was ECSTATIC to see this! Absolutely made my entire year!
I look forward to Friday’s every week just to watch this show. Where will I go once it ends
So, Shane is on board when it comes to kelpies and unicorns, but not ghosts  And Ryan believes in ghosts but not unicorns...  That is like being friends with someone from  different political parties
#postmortem why didn’t you use the spirit box in the conjuring episode? I love the spirit box. I like hearing them talk. Hehe #booganiac
#postmortem Me (a bergarian) and my fiancée (a shaniac) both want to know if you and Shane intend on continuing to investigate the paranormal outside of BUN? Btws we have watched since shane joined in season 2 of true crime.
#postmortem genuine question, why would a demon or ghost or whateva spend its time haunting a few folks when it could probably conquer the world? sorry beef boy #shaniac 🤷‍♀️
#postmortem Were there any other people who moved into the home after the murders? Wouldn’t the murderer have had to have died on the property to possess the home? Love the show!!
I don’t want this to be over 😫
also one of the alleged reasons for the bacon is that he was doing his ✨business✨ with the bacon
We ever going to see the moist little man crater ghost hunting technique again? I think it had the most promise. #Shaniac
#postmortem How does Shane feel about the "what is it?" whisper? It's definitely the clearest recording you've gotten so far. #Shaniac #ButStillAfraidOfGhosts #PleaseDontKickMeOutOfTheShaniacs
Buzzfeed!! You better pay these boys good to keep them on!!
#postmortem What was y’all’s favorite episode to film?
Just want to be on post mortem
Postmortem: maybe the town Marshall let everyone in to contaminate the site because HE did it?
Okay so they just let people tour the house with the bodies still there? I couldn’t imagine being the parents of the girls staying over their. Their kids went for a sleepover, were murdered and then turned into a tourist attraction.
YES GOOD!! This is my home state, glad they’re checking out Villisca~
#PostMortem A Sheet over the mirror is a typical funeral tradition -- it's meant so that people's souls don't get trapped in the mirror/home.
A slab of bacon? Why hasn't that been added to the hotdagga
Hey Ryan - have you ever heard of the Estes Method for using the spirit box? I know this is your last season, but would you ever be interested in trying it? It’d at least keep Shane from complaining about the noise. Haha
Omfggggg they were so close to me and I didn’t even know😦😦😦 I’m annoyed now wtf😂 also Illinois hates Iowa but only the east side of the Iowa would have beef with Illinois if anything… Iowa and Nebraska on the other hand👀😳😤😤
I hate that this series is coming to an end.
“Unicorns aren’t real…” slight pause and then Shane reaction😂
For the #postmortem  Hey ghoul boys, loving this new season. I’m very curious to what your guys favorite ghoul movie is.
Holy crap that “What is it” whisper was so clear!
Post Mortem if it’s not ghosts what would explain the flashlights turning on and off. Any other explanations? Genuinely curious.
for #postmortem : i'm gonna be very surprised if ryan *doesn't* become like one of those war-hardened veterans after all of these consecutive spooky investigations. character development is bound to happen one of these days. anyway, on a scale of 1 to 10, how scared were both of you on this episode?
I live in Iowa, used to want to do the overnight stay here... after all my favorite paranormal investigation shows stopped by I think i'm good now. Absolutely flipped out before i even started the video because i get excited whenever anyone even mentions Iowa, let alone visits
14:46 holy cow that’s super clear. To me it sounds much more like a woman’s than a man’s. Maybe the voice of the wife? #postmortem
i was supposed to go there with an old friend since its only a few hours away from us. we stopped being friends before we got to go sadly so i still have yet to go
#postmortem are you sad that this is the last season of buzzfeed unsolved supernatural?
#postmortem My husband is a shaniac who is also from Schaumburg! And I am a shitfish from Indiana. We love you guys-our whole family watches! Thank you for this already amazing last season!
I thought the "Help me" sounded more like a "probably". Also, that "what is it" made me think of the ghosts being confused at the machine that was left in their room. I don't believe in ghosts but I'm not sure what that could have been. #postmortem
For #postmortem the house may have squeaky floors today but back in the day it probably wouldn't have been as loud, it would've been relatively easy to sneak around without being heard
this is what mafia did in the past? they left bacon after every killing? lmao
I’m getting deja vu, I felt like I seen this ep already
Me and my boyfriend are going there for our 4 year anniversary next week!
i miss this kind of adventure ryan and shane ❤️🙏😔
*ad interrupts*79% of all murders committed in the united states are committed by acquaintances”
I JUST LISTENED TO AN EPISODE FROM A TRUE CRIME PODCAST ABOUT THIS CASE AND THEN I GET THE GHOUL BOYS VISITING I LOVE THIS
I miss these uploads so much. It makes my friday 1,000 times better
It's much less fun to watch now because Ryan seems really desensitized and doesn't get scared anymore...
5:24 dude just wanted some protein.
#postmortem not a question but great ep boys! it was a good mix of supernatural and true crime
#Postmortem Out of all the places you visited, What Place have you got the most evidence? (still crying about this being the last season)
The “what is it?” had me levitating, sounded way too clear
Shane brings in good vibes but the ghosts won't show up probably because he's a demon and they're scared of him
for #postmortem: what do you guys think about the theory that shane is a demon? quite frankly, i believe the opposite. ryan is an all-powerful demon masquerading as a frightened little man and protecting his spaghetti-limbed friend with a facade of fear
Question is .... Shane do you not want to do the ghost hunting thing anymore? Love you guys.
They drugged the bacon with sleepy sauce. The one lady didn't eat as much so she wasn't fully asleep. Unicorns are real! I've lost all faith in Ryan.
Ryan you need to redeem yourself and go back to the Sallie house
Some think that these murders, along with the New Orlean Ax murders and the Hinterkeifeck murders were part of a serial murderer's spree. Dozens of murders all over the US in the same period of time with the same MO. Be extremely creepy if it was
#For Postmortem. How is the bacon like the horse head from the godfather? None of the victims were able to see and rue it because they had been ax-murdered! #ithoughttruecrimewasover
#postmortem I’m 12min and 39sec in and I bet the town Marshall did it.
ghoul boy time
#postmortem what if the bacon was a symbol sort of mocking the killers victims? P.S. it’s just gone past midnight here in South Africa what a time to watch the ep 😱😱😱 #boogara
I find it really interesting how the spirit box had the same distinctive voice coming out of it at 7:00 !!
It used to be believed that if you died in front of a mirror then your soul could be trapped in the mirror. When my grandmother died the nursing home staff covered the mirror in her room and opened the windows so that her soul could fly free.
Did no one see the white shape sorta next to Ryan as he was sitting on the BED? and then he felt the BED move....creepy
This was a kind of compelling episode. Even if we disregard the spirit box, that bed moving, that really got me.   Play  by play of my thoughts: "What is it" and "Hard to stop" were pretty clear That bed moving was spooky. Also the spirit box in that room was way too talkative I think it's so sweet that Shane checks his house so Sara feels safe. That's really nice of him.  Also the attic spirt box was FREAKY and I didn't like it at all
I have but one question…is it ax, or axe? #postmortem
my puppy woke me up and here i am
Is it just me or making a fun attraction out of a place where actual people died and that some people profit off of a tragedy, and make up ghost stories about it is weird and disrespectful? I've been thinking about this a lot recently. But I'm conflicted cause I love Shane and Ryan..
This is like a true crime and supernatural in one thanks
Something similar happened in Romania . A family was murdered and found in the barn with the exception of the maid and youngest child they were found murdered in the house in their beds. The town had the house torn down and a memorial setup for the family. That's what they should of done with this home. Out of respect for the family,instead of it being a tourist attraction.  They never found the murderer .
Jesus Shane shoutout from Iowa wtf
Post-Mortem: why is it that ghosts give small glimpses of their presence? With the amount of people dying every year, shouldn’t the ghost realm be a bit crowded?
1:04 unsolved murders? Then why is it on supernatural?
#PostMortem: Imma little disappointed that we only got two cryptid episodes in supernatural. It sucks that we didn’t get episodes on EL Chupacabra or The Jersey Devil. And I already know that nobody on Buzzfeed unsolved is gonna read this so I guess this comment is kinda pointless
7:36 after it says "switch" you can hear a faint scream😱😱😱
Remeber lads, we dont want to party with the murderer.
Post mortem: which mystery monster do you think you would be able to fight?
Small Town Ignorance & Morbid curiosity for the #Win 😒🤦🏽‍♂️.
IOWA
Cool! I was wondering if you guys were going to take a look at this case. Though I thought it would’ve been for True Crime since it’s a cold case. But it does make a lot more since for Supernatural
As an Iowan that lives like 45 MINUTS AWAY FROM THAT place. F*ck you to Shane, come possess me if you want demon boy, fight me.
I know it’s not going to happen but the series finale should be them going to Shane’s house and it being the most obvious haunted house ever
If you guys are ever in Ontario I would LOVE to see you guys team up with Celina Spookyboo (as long as you respect her craft), it would be amazing
for #postmortem is it possible that the marshal murdered the family and that’s why he had a bunch of people hold the axe so that it would be contaminated
Maybe this will scare my COVID away 😍😩😩
Why do you have to live
"I do bring good vibes!"   -Shane "I've got a demon living inside my ribcage" Madej, 2021
#postmortem I imagine shane if he lived in that town being one of the folks touring the crime scene. He probably had nothing better to do
#postmortem Shane, what other ghouls are in you at the moment? Is there a rent arrangement between you and them?
I've always remembered this place from the ol' days of Scariest Places on Earth... glad to see it again!
I'm convinced that Shane is a time traveler.
Will there be a last season of Unsolved True crime?
Shane looks exactly like a girl I use to know from years back Seriously! He could be her son!
Gotta love that I just finished watching the Ax Man of New Orleans only for another Ax story to pop up on my notifications. Gotta love update Fridays 🍾
Ryan thinks unicorns, literally just horses with Narwhal Syndrome, definitely aren't real, but that ghosts ARE real?? buddy c'mon 😭
(yeef)
Ryan: "Ghosts are real." Shane: *unleashes his inner demon

The Ghoul Boys were in Iowa and didn’t even tell me.
There was so many people at the crime scene that I’d not be surprised to know if the bacon was left by one of townies
!!!!! Legit in the middle of listening to Morbid podcast's latest episodes on this case...it goes super in-depth
For #postmortem: Last chances to get onto post mortem, boy i hope this makes the cut. Love the show. Love the merch. Shane is a demon.
I wish I would have known you were doing the Villisca house.  I would have popped down and said hi.
For postmortem: did you ever get the scent of bacon while you were in there?
The windows next to the chimney look like the Amityville Horror windows.
For #postmortem - Have either of you ever felt like you brought back home a “negative” energy or just had a weird feeling after any of your visits? If yes, what was it like and if not, how would you react and what would be the course of action you would take? #boogara ;)
For #postmortem, which haunted place has given either of you two the best vibes? #Boogara
Oh, the ax murder House. I wonder what happened there
The same week the Morbid podcast covered this house… amazing.
Have you ever thought to bring in a medium and see if they get possessed or not?  Have either of you ever seriously thought about encouraging ghosts to possess you?
I HAVE WAITED FOR THIS PLACE
Ngl i thought the new ep will be uploaded next week
Skip to 9.29 to hear everyone’s reaction to unsolved ending
"just a little" *Jumps* *The loudest noice ever*
The horse audio scared me
Y’all should play phasmophobia in vr
Last episode of this show will be Ryan revealing he has never had a college named Shane. But their office is haunted by this guy who went insane after claiming the world was round in 1000 BC.
Omfg I’ve been waiting for this one for so many seasons
When Ryan and Shane are no longer here we leave too ! 👿
10:07 shane these are children don’t be weird
A new video released!          *It got closer to the end of this series... ;(*
I AM SCREAMING OMG
Stop posting these videos when its at night for me! Please!
I learned a few days ago that the man who stabbed himself a few years back in this house said that just minutes prior to the stabbing, he was deliberately provoking the ghosts by trying to make them angry. It made me worried for the ghoul boys, but then again, they ARE the best ghost hunters to ever exist so the ghosts would probably be too scared to mess with them.
Postpartum: For the spirit box, does the voice always concludes the gender of the ghost? The spirit box is changing from channel to channel so fast the ghost can't be picky when it comes to the tone/structure of the radio voice. They just want to get their message out. #ghostaredefreal
for #postmortem: there’s been a lot of good Bits and post-mortem bits over the years, do you guys have a favourite?
Omg you guys were in Iowa😭
Not sure if you're legally allowed to awnser this on the Buzzfeed channel but will you guys do some version of ghost/true crime series on Watcher? Love the show. Parting is such sweet sorrow. Best of luck!
I’m so confused on why you would think that the murderer haunts there. Unless it was a ghost axe murderer that killed them?? Like I’m a boogara but that makes zero sense. You’re welcome.
"Unicorns aren't real. Ghosts are real." Ryan, I think you broke Shane.
for the postmortem: just wanna say thanks for this wonderful series y’all created! anything fun planned after the show? #boogara #ghostsarerealShane
For #postmortem: If you could investigate any fictional location, where would it be and why?
Damn Ryan you really hurt Shane bad when you said unicorns aren’t real
For the Post-mortem: brief return of the hot daga Shane?, just to get a last glance at the critically acclaimed character.. Gene.. in heaven...or...hell
Was really hoping this season wouldn’t have cases I’ve seen before.
Whatup Ghoul boys! It's the last season...weird. anyways, tell me why you both look like very middle middle aged fathers, my Shaniac and Boogara friends are awaiting your answer #postmortem #Shaniac #pleasemakemysmalldreamcometrueandreadthis
Theory: bc of the turf war Shane has he was the one who actually murder everyone in the house
What kind of knowledge have you guys gathered after all these years of doing Unsolved? #postmortem #boogarabynightandshaniacbyday
Buzzfeed Unsolved > Shane Dawson Spooky Vids.
These episodes drop in such a perfect time
#postmortem: Can I get "(yeef)" on a sweatshirt now?
Watching these two sleuths walking up to that residence with such confidence only to know they'll solve nothing.....at least you guys are consistent. #postmortem
For the #postmortem I can confirm that Iowa is in fact haunted by the dreams of all the people who said they were going to leave their small town but instead of doing that they married the guy they dated in high school and got sucked into an MLM
Only 12 minutes ago and alreafy 11k views?! 😧 wowza.
its gonna be a good day!
6:16 "I dare them to try and split us up" "can't be done, we're ghoul brothers"  "that's a bond that lasts forever" who's cutting the onions around here 🤧🤧🤧
It’s so spooky that those episodes come out at exactly midnight in Central Europe 🥲
#postmortem would shane  sleep in a haunted house for 1000 bucks a week for as whole month
les go!!  Post mortem : are ghost real?
I am laughing so hard right now, Ryan, "unicorns aren't real but ghosts are real" Shane, "GAAAAHHHHH!!!" 🤣🤣 The shear look of aggravation on Shane's face 🤣 For #postmortem Ryan if you believe in ghosts then why not unicorns?
For the Post-mortem: Why did you guys think the murderer's ghost would be in the house....? #postmortem
Yeeeessss the og's time👌🏼🔥
Frustrated Shane is me every monday morning
Normal Ghosthunters: my mission is to catch evidence! Shane: I bring good vibes :)
For the #postmortem : will you be attending the funeral of my functional sleeping schedule?  You always post when I should be catching some sleep, yay being a uk fan. Loving the new series, btw.
For #postmortem will the hot daga ever make a return? Love you both❤
Everyone in the Midwest hates Ohio lol
9:29 I think Shane finally snapped:( I probably would even earlier
Shane is getting closer and closer to unveiling his demon form—
For #postmortem: Is there a place in your hometown or home state that you would have liked to investigate?
Ryan: Well unicorns aren’t real, and ghosts are real. Shane: *starts screaming*
i’ve been blessed with an upload
Concentrated dread 😂 Oh Ryan!!
I know this is the last season but I would love to 1 special per year on Halloween
#postmortem Shane, why did you decide to go blonde? Ryan, do you approve?
T.G.I.F it’s ya boi!!
This was posted 9 minutes ago and is already the highest viewed Buzz Feed has had in 8 years. Its depressing this is the last season.
9:30 ya I understand
FINALLY IVE BEEN WAITING YEARS FOR THIS EP
For post mortem: How do you best describe how this show has changed/evolved over time, if it has at all in your eyes?
For Post Mortem: Y’all ever think that ghosts are sexy?
i need this season to have a big reveal: this whole time, it was ryan who was the demon, not shane. HE HAD US ALL FOOLED!!!
lets gooo
NINE MINUTWS
I still can’t get over that they are leaving.
I'm from Iowa lol but i feel you Shane!!! I wonder if we're all ghosts out here just reliving the daily 9-5 struggle sending our kids to ghost school watching Buzzfeed Unsolved on our ghost screens to the living 49 states out there lol  Would you recommend a visit i live a couple hours away from villosca? #postmortum #ghostsarereal #boogera #turfwar
The channel Bedtime Stories did a great video about this case.
2xtwpn #von.ong
#postmortem Are you guys ever planning on using the Ovilus this final season?
For #postmortem do you think the ax murderer was a vegan? All those people lost their lives because they like a delicious breakfast? What an odd detail
#postmortem Is there any house y'all absolutely won't return to?
for the postmortem - i have nothing of substance to add to the conversation, i just can’t let this show end without at least commenting once. that’s all. much love.
As an Iowan, I’ve never been to the house, but I know people who’ve been to it and they say when the doors open by themselves, it’s because of the wind as well as the fact it’s an old house that hasn’t changed much since the murders happened. Even with that, just being inside the house there is an obvious creepy feeling due to murders being committed there and that doesn’t surprise me. But there’s no supernatural stuff going on, just a combination of it being an old house and the fact murders took place in the houses which makes people think something supernatural is happening, when in fact that isn’t what is going on.
Me wishing I was there with them
For #PostMotrem: do you think the axeman of New Orleans took a little trip up to Iowa?
I was hoping you guys would go to the Villisca Ax Murder House before the series ended. It’s both an unsolved case and a supernatural case! Truly the best of both worlds.
For #postmortem: What is the strangest thing you have happen to you while traveling, but not at the actual location?
Was the conjuring house scarier than this house?
#postmortem. Do you guys nerd out about the historical pieces in the places you go off camera? I would be squealing.
8 minutes ago D:
Are yall rocking the Midnight Mass stache? I like it!
Imagine viciously murdering an entire family but carefully wrapping bacon with a towel..
y'all I saw the ghost talk at 9:30
For the #postmortem : would guys ever consider going back to any of these haunted locations in your free time, causally, maybe just to be a little quirky?
my day is now x10 better
The scariest thing is the idea of someone being up at 5am to hang out their washing.
For #postmortem the "feeling oppressive feelings" are we sure that's the house or is that just Iowa
#postmortem Shane doesn't believe in ghosts BUT... does he believe in the Ax Man Fever and the adventures of Razer Boy?
#postmortem, Shane and Ryan - my long distance boyfriend and I would always set aside time to watch new episodes every Friday. 3 years later we’re living together and are so happy to be able to watch these new episodes in person.  We actually started a BUN bucket list and try to visit the places you’ve done investigations at. Our favorite so far is Ohio State Reformatory.  What are your guys’ suggestions for the next place we cross off??
Unrelated to the actual video but the other night I had a dream (I dunno if it counts as a nightmare) that I was a camera person for unsolved and we were investigating a haunted corn maze and we ended up getting lost and  practically going in circles. As we turned another corner we saw a giant (like 7ft) bloody inflatable duck with a knife I got so scared I woke up.  I still remember the feeling as if it wasn't a dream and it's the most terrified I've ever been 🙃
what’s ryans workout split? he looks good
Regardless of whether you believe in ghosts or not, please tell me I'm not the only one creeped out solely by the idea of spending the night in a house where an entire family, (plus two guests,) were murdered with an ax.  Especially since that murder has been unsolved for over 100 years.
It's 3:30 am here and I'm up forthe new episode
For #postmortem: Shane, what is the most plausible/hardest to disprove piece of evidence that you guys have collected? What couldn’t you just dismiss as the wind?
I was literally just reading about this house lol
For post mortem, what’s your favorite condiment?? #postmortem
For #postmortem Ryan, what does Ricky think about Unsolved ending? Also, when/what do you guys eat on your trips? A little McDonald's and Murder? Arby's and Annabelle? Popeyes and Phantoms?
#postmortem Q: If you ever were to murder someone what trophy would you take? #boogara #kindashaniac #shitfish
#postmortem you can't keep running from the hotdaga like that shane, we want a finale!!
What’s your favorite flavor of toast?
the sheer glee at seeing a newly uploaded Unsolved episode ... soon I'll never feel it again </3
#postmortem do you think that these experiences have made you a. More skeptical b. More open to the supernatural or c. Just stayed Shane
"we're the ghoul brothers...it's a bond that lasts forever" anyone else emotional
I need to sleep guess i stay up another night.😅
Let’s go I missed these videos man they are always so interesting
I thought you said only one demon house!?
i think it was Ax Man and Razor Boy
Let’s go baby right in time for the ghoul boys while the sun is still up…🙏🏼
#Postmortem Is there a place you visited during the series that you want to go back and explore more?
Y’all I understand they’re great but it’s been 5 minutes-
#Postmortem: ghoul bois I'll miss you as nothing helps me procrastinate more than your antics. Also Ryan, can plants be ghosts? They get murdered all the time and yet I've never heard of Doug fir getting it's revenge. #shaniac #axmanwasatree
Man from the train 🚂
bro these dudes grew so much over a few years, good times back when they were investigating that doll island, good times.
i’ve been waiting for this one!!! i’ve been to that house and it was so erie !!
#PostMortem Just as a general rule, if a 'haunted' location is advertised as haunted, or is in any way used to make money or publicity, it just really makes me doubt the validity of said haunting.
This is my favourite haunted location
#postmortem I remember reading about how Ryan has had to be blessed, after visiting certain locations, due to hallucinations. Is that true? How come it’s not really talked about if so?
#postmortem  has the show changed your view on the supernatural/the shows that play up supernatural occurrences?
#postmortem What are your thoughts on past lives?
#Postmortem What will you do after the series ends? Will you both go to haunted areas as a hobby or do you have something else planned?
For postmortem- Compared to previous seasons, do y’all think the evidence this season surpasses evidence the Burgmeister has presented/found? (albeit I’m already a boogara so you know I believe it when I see it)
Also, as a chicagoan, I had no idea we had a feud with Iowa lmao
Right off the bat, shoutout to the Axe Man, possibly my favorite ghoul of the entire series
#postmortem if you look at the window to the right at 3:24 you can see 2 red dots I know it’s nothing and probably just your flash lights but it still looks creepy
No one: Americans: let's make the site of this great tragedy a tourist attraction🤗
It's 1 am where i live, perfect time for Buzzfeed Unsolved
Ryan: Ross walked into his brother's house and saw the unthinkable. *cut to house* Me: Another house!? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
YES!!! This is the episode I've been waiting for! 😁
I just finished the new “Are You Scared?” and was sad the episode was over but then this was posted. 10/10 timing
woooooooooo
I will miss this when this season ends
Ay answer me this idiots, have you ever been scared for your life on a hunt? Shane, like scared of enviromental danger or possible squatters, Ryan over creaks and shoe whispers? #PostMortem #Shaniac
Finding ghoul Fridays!
Its a shame this series is ending, would've loved to see Shane and Ryan hunt a Wendigo or Skinwalker
#postmortem is there any location that you’ve been to for an episode that you would want to revisit in the future?
another one down… I hope they do Goat Man 2 electric boogaloo
#Postmortem It’s 1:30 am rn should I watch this or have a peaceful night of sleep?
Who does their laundry at 5 am? That's the real mystery here
I’ve been looking forward to this all day!
I’m calling it, Shane is going to mimic murdering someone or getting murdered with an ax
Yay another vid
#Postmortem. No question I just love you. I got two cats tonight and they are  now called Madej and Bergara 😺.  #Allhailthewatcher
My face when this poped up 😁 great start to my birthday but every episode we watch is a step closer to no more of the ghoul boys 🥺
NO WAY! I just watched the Conjuring House then 3 minutes later this got uploaded. LET'S EFFIN GO!
My uncle literally wrote the book on this murder called the morning ran red. It was a fiction book based around the events, he sadly passed this year but it’s cool to see the boys finally visit here.
I was legit sitting next to my phone just waiting for this to pop up and when i saw where the boys were going i just knew Ryan's gonna lose his shiteee
This case is absolutely insane.  What are your proudest moments in regards to Buzzfeed?   P.S. currently wearing my Too Many Spirits sweater 👻
YAY! So glad ya'll are back!!!!!!! Here's to a great season! Ghoul Boys rock!
i remember watching this episode on ghost adventures, i couldn't sleep that night.
Are you guys ever going to go to the Russian Sleep experiment and maybe take a little nap there
I cant take anything horror seriously anymore…and it’s becuse of u guys 😂
For postmortem: Now that Shane will be at the post mortem.. can we talk about the insanity that took place of 3 different doors opening in different moments in the last episode? FACE THE MUSIC SHANE! #Boogara4L
The simultaneous excitement from a new episode dropping and the twinge of bittersweetness from knowing we're one episode closer to the series finale is  a really weird feeling to have.
#postmortem: has there ever been a place that’s genuinely given shane the creeps?
SPOILERS... The murder left ax cuts in the ceiling because he used the back of the ax head as a club to kill his victims.
Ryan, how much time do you put into researching the place you go to? #postmortem
Man, I can't believe this series is ending. I love this show so much
I’ve seen documentaries about this house  No wonder it’s haunted #Boggara
Question for Postmortem: Does Ryan believe in Jesus?
You spelt axe wrong
YOU WERE IN IOWA AND U DIDNT TELL ME
For the #PostMortem: If you guys were to meet one person from history as a ghost who would it be and why. Also I hope Shane is here this time because Ryan was getting a bit to comfortable with his claims. #Shaniac.
AHHHH!!! I’ve been here!!!!!! There were some real friendly little kitty cars
Yessirrr
Good show guys! Has either of you ever pooped yourselves?
Shane is against ghosts but as soon as he enters this state ghosts are real and they must be exterminated
Just came from the new Are You Scared? episode lol
MORE, MOREEEE
Ryan: ....as part of our investigation into the ongoing question are ghosts real?  Shane: No Unsolved in a nutshell
YESSSS I'M SO EXCITED!!! New BUN eps are the highlight of my week :D
Oh my god thank you thank you thank you for covering this case! As an Iowan I have been waiting for you to cover it! Thank you!
#postmortem I wanted to say thank you because a few years ago this series helped me through a tough time and has actually inspired me to go to a Film School in a couple of years. So I have a question; What advice would you give regarding film production, editing, and such? #boogara
for #postmortem, if you each had to pick one animal on Earth that was most likely to be an alien, what animal would you pick and why? (personally I'd say jellyfish, those things are wild, but I don't want to color your opinions)
FINALLY,  MY HOME STATE
HELLLL YEAHHH!!!! I've been waiting on this one. I'm so happy. I'm about to block everyone out and watch this episode.
For the #PostMortem: How does Shane rank the Midwest states, from worst to best??
Yeeees
hi
Ryan it was so amazing to meet you in San Jose recently after your investigation of the Winchester House! Did you honestly get the feeling that this house is haunted? If so, by who? #Boogara for life!
Yoooo!
I always forget theyre weekly now
#postmortem why is Shane a poo poo head???
Have you ever considered that the reason the ghosts/spirits/demons don't do anything to you guys is because they can sense the presence of Rick Goldsworth, so are too afraid to mess with you? #PostMortem
for the #postmortem, what are you guys going to miss most about this show? Love you guys and everything you stand for, and thank you for amazing content throughout these last few years!
LETS GOOO
The score was even the episode. 1-1, the next round would be out of this world.
love that our collective comfort media is two dudes talking about horrific crimes and hunting for ghosts
LET’S GOOOO
#Postmortem Ryan how to you live with yourself after what you did to the professor?! But real question, would you two ever investigate or just visit Zack Bagans' Haunted Museum in Las Vegas?
suxs this show is gettin axed.
Thank god it’s BUN Friday
Its always the midwest with worst haunted houses
from the title I'm expecting the return of Axeman and Razor Boy edit: I've been sorely disappointed
Been waiting for this all day!!
#PostMortem The Ghoul Boys are back in town! Since we’re in the spookiest month of the year, I have to know; what are your favourite scary movies or what do you consider to be must watch on Halloween? Personally, I love me some Hocus Pocus and John Carpenter's The Thing. #LetsGetWet #Shaniac #ThatSaidILoveAndSupportYouRyanAndHopeYouCanProveUsShaniacsWrongSomeDay
I'mma comment before I even watch!
I was literally just about to head to bed. Guess not.
I'm so sad you leaving but I understand and here is my question did you see anything before recording
Hello boys
As a scientist, I always feel like in my mind I'm a shaniac and in my heart I'm a boogara... who's side should I take? Love you both though... #shaniac #mostlyboogarathough
For postmortem: I’m still waiting for my shoutout
Watching with my son Oliver who’s 10 it’s 23.01 here love your shows hate the way it’s all ending so much love emma and Oliver x
for #postmortem: has shane ever genuinely felt scared at any of the places you’ve visited?
Welp, a good morning to me:))
READY FOR ANOTHER BANGER OF A VIDEO LETS GOOO
ITS BACKK!!!!!!!! THE NOD AND THE NO
Do you know how long I've been waiting for you guys to cover this story!!! Too bloody long!!!
pp
For the Post-mortem: Does Shane prefer Apple bottom jeans or boots with the fur?
I was JUSTTTT hoping for this upload 😭 Boogaras unite
I'm do happy to see someone cover this
Not even surprised it's in Iowa, this is why Illinois is better
This house is so iconic. Been waiting for y'all to travel there
would love to watch this now, however I am a young girl on my way home late at night, and im already spooked, so it will have to wait 😔✌🏻
YEEEEES
ive been waiting for this one. TURN IT UP
The boys are back! LET'S GOOOO!!!
Still can’t believe this is the last season 😭 I’m going to miss the ghoul boys 🥺
Razor boy
Just in time. 💪🏽
I swear if this series doesn't end with Shane revealing he's a demon and Ryan being possessed I'm not going to forgive them
Let's go
For the post mortem: question for Brad Pistachio and Brian Cramblish, (sorry for making you get out of character guys) is Brian the one possessed by the one you call Ricky Goldsworth and you had to add that bit for Ryan's character because Ricky would interrupt the scene or is that strictly a part of the fictional character of Ryan Bergara? Sometimes the acting is so real it looks like he's genuienly haunted
Hi
I love you guys!!!!
New video for spooky season! Wahoo!
less go
Yes 👍😇
Wooo another video!!!!
Hi🤩
#postmortem Ryan, which one of shane's hats is your favourite?
Axe murder house??? 😂 like the deodarant 😂😂😂 wtf???? Please someone tell me I’m wrong 😩😩😂😭😭😭

Solve the mystery of why I don’t have a girlfriend yet Ghoul boys 😤😭
I have my glass of wine and some cheese and crackers. Let's goooo
Yes ghoul bois!!!!
#postmortem I have another ghost joke for today:   “Today I found out my girlfriend is a ghost. To be honest, I’ve had my suspicions from the moment she walked through the door.”
I FARTED 🙏
ok
For #postmortem do you ever get the feeling of horror right when you roll up and if so is it accurate or not actually that bad once you get in
My Friday is now complete !
Yes yes yes! This is the one I've been predicting!!! 🎉 🎉 🎉
Friday is always gonna be a good day. Not because it’s the end of the week, but because the Ghoul Boys bless us with an upload.
