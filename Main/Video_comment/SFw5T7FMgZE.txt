Who y'all think kill jay man rip
I bet you any amount of money he had nothing to do with Foolio getting  killed. There is another even bigger rapper than Yungeen- Ace Foolio was beefing with that's even more dangerous than ATK. I don't do no name dropping. I don't work for the Feds but if you remember, you know exactly who I'm talking about.
This shit was hella hard 🔥 LLJ23 🕊️

This one is so sad.  I feel ace pain. Rip jay.
[Verse 1] I been in that war, but I ain't say it My dawg just finished trial and lost the case Couple days before I was a pallbearer and buried Jay I ain't walk up on his casket when it's open, I ain't want that to be the last time I seen his face When I seen my tear fall, I ain't cry in a while, but I seen blood And it's feelin' deep, we ain't lose connect, so we ain't talk, but that's my thug I felt his soul when I was huggin' her tight, when I gave his mama a hug I'm still mad, tryna rekindle our flame, but you know it's still love  [Chorus] I'm tryin', but it's only so much that a nigga can take Inside, I'm dyin', every day feel like my last, in the morning, I won't be awake  [Verse 2] With all my love, been tryna make this mountain move Uh, I still be trying even though I know it's impossible How could I be so foolish for believing in love? Know it's limited moments I got with you and this time ain't enough YB just lost federal trial, it got my head spinnin' Grandma asked me, was I at peace? I told her, "It's been a minute" They say I beat the streets, but I promise it don't seem like I'm winning God keep a close eye on me, you know how I get when I'm healin' Know how I get when I'm dealin' Suicidal thoughts, I be trippin' I been out of touch with my feelings Emotionally scarred, but I'm willin' They say I'm weird 'cause I'm different I still won't change with these millions I cry of pain 'cause I feel it They ain't say bad news, but I hear it  [Chorus] I'm tryin', but it's only so much that a nigga can take Inside, I'm dyin', every day feel like my last, in the morning, I won't be awake  [Verse 3] Ayy, I be tryna move my feet, but my heart just got me stuck When I started to see that they cared, that's when they showed me they don't give a fuck When I love, my heart start beating, I can't let you in easy Why should I be the one to stay when I know you gon' leave me? Mortician wanted me to talk at Jay funeral But I was tryna stay strong even though I was vulnerable I had 23 once before, but I lost him two times We wasn't on good terms before he died, I wished I called his line The shit that we was fighting over, we could've got over it Had our differences since 2019, but nobody noticed it I still loved you like my brother, I hope you know it Embracin' all my feelings like a poet I just seen the devil flash right 'cross my eyes In my dreams, I seen a shovel bury me alive All your friends and, yeah, all my brothers died Baby, I need you here, just right here by my side Feel like bad luck is me, feel like I'm cursed I know everybody go through shit, but I go through the worst Hurt people hurt people, I lied when I said I believe him I wouldn't be surprised if out of the blue, that my heart'll stop beating I showed 'em my weakness  [Chorus] I'm tryin', but it's only so much that a nigga can take Inside, I'm dyin', every day feel like my last, in the morning, I won't be awake  [Outro] You know, like, real niggas go through shit, you feel me? I won't try to hide it 'cause I know this shit be real, you feel what I'm sayin'? I can't hide this shit, this shit just be me, that's who I am, like I feel this shit, you know what I'm sayin'? Like, every step of the way, it's always somethin' else Every time I open my eyes, it's somethin', I close 'em, it's somethin' else, I wake up, open again, it's somethin' else That's just my life

Wish I could rekindle with the One's that I understood Me & My CURSED CURSED Life show Me what Love is even if they didn't Carry Me for 9 months & held me first time coming in this miserable depression sucky Life. But they watch Me over years grown up being around grown adults would Talked about Me and Tell My mom in Face her & Dad was stupid bring Me in this. Being a Lil kid hearing All these grown adults talking shit made Me feel like I was straight 💯💯 CURSED CURSED CURSED too My parents even Now. Being adult people's still talks shit don't feel Love by noOne's. They say they Love Me. But they don't show Me Real Love. My mom be regretting she Birth Me. Wish I would die nd My Older sister be the one be alive making Both parents happy nd My handicap sister & Lil brother. Praying for My kids don't go Tru same shit I want Tru. Praying My baby's mamas give My kids better Love then what My parents show me & My Dad not in our lives. Even still My mom show two of My siblings More more Love then Me. Hate My parents everyday. But still love My parents even they don't Love Me.☠️⚰️😊🔫😊

This song makes it sound like this shit just happens to you. It wouldn't happen if you weren't constantly killing each other and making music about it.
RIP jay I miss you so much man thanks for making this wonderful song  love you man
Many of your people didnt make it out, you did, for some reason God has blessed you, it's hard but honor them by moving on with your career and out of Jacksonville, kill your beef with Foolio like a man. Yall made it, live it for your bros who didnt get that opportunity and settle the beef as you move your own ways.

† We are all born with a sinful nature. To live eternally in paradise and escape eternal torment in hell, we must accept the sacrifice that Jesus made on the cross.  Even though Jesus is God, He came to earth to be a sacrifice for us so that we could live with Him, God the Father and God the Holy Spirit forever. We can't save ourselves by doing good works. Only faith in what Jesus did will save us. Just by believing in our hearts that Jesus died for us, we are saved eternally. It can't be lost no matter what. After that, we trust God to do good works in us. It's all about what Jesus did, not what we have done or will do.  ...if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.                                         †  Romans 10:9

Jesus is coming soon; please repent of your sin and turn to him.  Jesus was crucified, died on the cross, was buried, and God raised him from the dead on the third day, in fulfillment of the scriptures.  He loves you and wishes that none should perish.  He died so that we may have life, eternal life in heaven.  Read Romans 10:9-13 for starters.  Believe in your heart who Jesus is and what he did for you.  Are you paying attention to what is happening in the world??  We are at the end, Jesus is coming.

💥💥💥💥💥💥
Me as an underground artist with a small audience, Yungeen Ace is the type of success story that inspires me. It's been inspiring to see how he's grown in his abilities and steadily exploded after embracing every chance he's been given! With good reason, Mans has swiftly become a hallmark in the music business. I know that if I work hard enough, I can eventually reach a wider audience, but for now, I'm satisfied as a supporter. It'll be my time next. Much respect Ace🔥
#LL23
Once again its yo time!! Lets go!
Love yours while their here

Hello everyone,wish you a blessed day,if someone wanna heel there soul ,I have a video for you with a beauty of my Asian village https://youtu.be/y9yUZjpQrIc
I know some dont want to hear this but it needs to be said..For the rapper, drug dealer, prostitute, homosexual, partier, fornicator, drinker, drug user..Jesus is willing to accept you just the way you are.. Jesus died for all those and every sin and all a person has to do is believe he died or all your sins (past present and future) and you are justified in the eyes of God and will have a relationship with him forever

I loved jay bro. He got me through everything in high school. Whenever I was down or pissed off. I just threw a headphone in and listen to you roll off the head. I can’t believe you gone man. I woke up one morning and my shit was turned upside down reading that you was gone 😥😥 rest up a soldier man! May god watch over your family and friends!
Hiding the pain in his eyes, this sum real shit right here 💯
Inside i’m dying 😖😭💔
🦍🦍🦍🔥
Rip 😭😇🤧
Life is too short to wake up in the morning with regrets. So love the people who treat you right, forget about the ones who don’t. And believe that everything happens for a reason. If you get a chance, take it. If it changes your life, let it. Nobody said it would be easy, just that it would be worth it
Everyday feel like my last ...💔

pain!
Mannn that Shit messed up. Rip Jaydayoungin
Damn this shit hard asf💯
Out of all the songs I’ve heard from him. This one hands down is the best
Ace is underrated as fuck and he deserves way more respect and attention for his lyricism and vulnerability in his music. He’s one of few rappers nowadays who doesn’t shy away from expressing his deepest feelings. I have endless respect for him for that! As a rapper and producer myself with a very small following, i hope one day I can grow to your level right now, and by then, I hope Ace is well over a million fans cause he deserves it far more than me! Another great track bro! 🔥
🔥💔
😂 rip
LL23 we miss u 2️⃣3️⃣😔💔🕊
"I had a 23 bro before, But I lost him 2x" Damn 😕
I knew it was sun going on between them they wasn’t talking how they use too wish they would’ve seen eye to eye

Ace had real pain his whole career
greetings from Mexico! here supporting 💖🥀🇲🇽🌮🌯🇲🇽 Lyrics of the song:  He estado en esa agua, pero no estoy a salvo Mi amigo acaba de terminar el juicio y perdió el caso. Un par de días antes de que fuera un portador del féretro, terminó de enterrar a su arrendajo No caminaré sobre su ataúd cuando esté arriba No quiero que sea la última vez que vea su rostro. Mientras veo mis lágrimas caer, no lloré en mucho tiempo pero vi sangre Y este sentimiento profundo, no perdemos la conexión, no hablamos mal, sigue siendo mi matón Sentí su alma cuando la estaba abrazando fuerte cuando le di un abrazo a su mamá Todavía estoy enojado porque no reavivamos nuestra llama, pero sabes que todavía es amor  Lo estoy intentando, pero es mucho lo que un negro puede tomar Por dentro me estoy muriendo, todos los días me siento como el último, un día estaré lejos  Con todo mi amor he estado tratando de hacer que esta montaña se mueva Todavía lo estoy intentando aunque sé que es imposible ¿Cómo pude ser tan tonto por creer en el amor? Sabiendo que son momentos limitados que tengo contigo y esta vez no es suficiente Ybeezy perdió el juicio federal y me dio vueltas la cabeza La abuela me había preguntado si estaba en paz. Le dije que había pasado un minuto. Dicen que gano las calles, pero prometo que no parece que esté ganando Dios, mírame de cerca, sabe cómo me pongo cuando estoy sanando Sepa cómo me pongo cuando estoy lidiando con pensamientos suicidas, me estoy tropezando He estado fuera de contacto con mis sentimientos Emocionalmente marcado pero estoy dispuesto Dicen que soy raro porque soy diferente Todavía no cambiaré con estos millones Estoy llorando de dolor porque lo siento No dicen malas reglas, pero lo escucho.  Lo estoy intentando, pero es mucho lo que un negro puede tomar Por dentro me estoy muriendo, todos los días me siento como el último, un día estaré lejos  He estado tratando de mover mis pies pero mi corazón me atascó Cuando empiezo a ver que les importa, ahí es cuando me muestran que les importa un carajo Cuando amo, mi corazón comienza a latir, no puedo dejarte entrar fácilmente ¿Cuándo debería ser yo el que se quede, cuando sé que me vas a dejar? Mis lágrimas intentan mantenerlas escondidas en el funeral de Jay Pero estaba tratando de mantenerme fuerte, aunque era vulnerable Tuve un hermano 23 antes, pero lo perdí 2x No estábamos en buenos términos antes de que muriera, desearía haber llamado a su línea La mierda por la que estábamos peleando, podríamos haberla superado Tuvimos nuestras diferencias en 2019, pero nadie lo notó Aún te amaba como a mi hermano, espero que lo sepas Abrazando todos mis sentimientos, como un poeta Acabo de ver al diablo parpadear justo cruzando mis ojos En mis sueños vi la pala, entiérrame vivo Todos tus amigos aquí, todos mis hermanos murieron Tal vez te necesito aquí, justo aquí a mi lado Siento que la mala suerte soy yo, siento que estoy maldito Sé que todos pasaron por una mierda, pero yo pasé por lo peor Lastimar a las personas, lastimar a las personas, mentí cuando dije que les creo No me sorprendería si de repente, mis letras de corazón dejaran de latir  Lo estoy intentando, pero es mucho lo que un negro puede tomar Por dentro me estoy muriendo, todos los días me siento como el último, un día estaré lejos

So much pain I feel in this song😔
This is a masterpiece, he really keeps losing close ones and we all know both sides won’t stop. It’s only just sad. #RIPJayDaYoungan
heart
I think this was a good song and right on only thing I dont like is normally when they make these songs, videos its like something happens, I pray it dont. I dont think anyone knows but the one who really feels like a they are the curse for others guess what just think how many also think that and not want to be around or hang with you so its hard enough you feel that way its worse when many treat you as such. I will look at it in another way maybe your still alive to do something different and change the way you live and move, let beef go and be patient, lay low and wait to see your real purpose. I hope you move to another State

LL23
I related to a lot of things that Jaydayoungan had gone through as a kid, when I heard he got shot I prayed to lord that he would live sadly he gave up and passed away when I received the news I didn’t believe that it was real until I seen everyone posting it 10 minutes later, that’s when I turned on Jaydayoungan and I remember I listened to bad news today, the song made me cry because he had just passed away and the lryics were too relatable in the situation, I couldn’t believe if it were even real life at that point, I couldn’t believe it had happened to such a talented rapper, Jaydayoungan got me through hard times, his voice doesn’t sound the same to me anymore since he passed, his music doesn’t hit the same as it used too and when I put on a sad song by him, my head goes into deep thought about it he is in heaven or not. I felt like jay knew his time was coming, the lryics in head heart were too deep. Jaydayoungan got me through last year and I thank him for that. Rip 23🕊🕊🕊🕊 rest up Jaydayoungan, you need your rest after a very talented rap career, you were only 24 and that is very sad🕊 long live 23, a true legend that will and should never be forgotten😖😖😖😖😖😔😔😔😔🕊🕊🕊🕊🕊🕊🕊🕊🕊 fly high 23

It's funny how these police officers keep shooting people and not get accountable for what they doing it's funny how you go out there and rob somebody they'll give you 20 30 years if you shoot the officer there give you life but when the officer shoot someone that's unharmed nothing happened to them sad how American against us that's why sometimes I love to see these young n***** start rapping and start balling start spending money like crazy showing their ass

Dude spit real Shit! I feel bad for dudes son too

REAL RIGHT💯
LL23 ! ♥️🕊
Bro made this an hour ago and got all these likes and views I’m proud of my fav rapper
I’m tryin, but it’s only so much a nigga can take. 💯  Main reason I never blame nobody for what they do. I hold you accountable though. Life will turn you into a animal if you trying and nothing changes. Especially coming from me I used to starve at night and didn’t have parent’s at the time. I was 15 at the time. I remember I used to get kicked out of class for talking to much. After that I didn’t speak at ALL and was quick to handle anything I needed to. I’m Still fucked up in the head too because of that and other things.
