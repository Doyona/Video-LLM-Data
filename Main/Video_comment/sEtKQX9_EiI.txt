He's completed golf
Best hole in one in the history of the sport.
And all done with a pair of DUNKS on! :)
This is one of the greatest things in any sport - unbelievable story 👏
Sometimes Golf God says YES!
I did one of these on tiger woods I have never been able to repeat it
What a shot that was the best bit was when he didn't believe it went straight what a moment for him
"In without touching the sides" That's what she said . Yes I need to grow up but this was an opportunity I could not resist .
😴 you can use the term 'slamdunk' all you want. Golf is still the most boring thing on earth
👍👍👍
1:12 “in without touching the sides” - story of my life!
I've always wondered if this could happen 😮
thats unbelievable
Unreal pinpoint 📍
1:12 that’s me and my wife
Here's me thinking the flag pole is blocking our view of the roll in. But no slam dunk brilliant 🏌️🎯
Daaaammnn!
Even better than Brooks winning the tournament in my opinion.
Swish! Nothing but ne... Cup?
Incredible, ive been playing golf for 50 years sometimes to a good standard but never had one, come close a lot of times. This was very special, slam dunk and the first guy to congratulate him was Rory .... Very special for all around the hole but for Block .... Wow
Guess he got the club selection right.
Fantastic story and people who don't even follow golf and got right in to it 😂 Michael block what a story take a bow
*OUT.STANDING!*

Inject this into my veins
Ok. It's done. Game Over. The whole point of golf is now completely obsolete. Although this should be a mandatory watch every morning for the entire planet.
Best shot in a Major ever?
Bring on the news fans favourite!!!
Loved the commentary “that could be very expensive” 😂 not sure the usual £150 hole in 1 insurance will cover that bar bill… worth it though, what a shot..
The commentators could have been a bit more excited 🤦
fanTAStic moment!  and what an excellent presentation of it in this vid, cheers production people:)👍 i discovered this marvelous and momentous event through online media and randomly selected this video to watch  - that roar of the crowd - delicious!  such a blessing for all who participate/d in this  massive 🕉nom nom YUM! dude!  that was a helluva shot!  gracias muchos muchos for sharing! 👍🕉😃🌱🙏✅️🕯
I'm not a golf fan.  Never watch the sport and have never played it and if you asked me to name 5 golf players then Woods, McllRoy, Ballesteros and for some reason the name Travino (I could be wrong) comes to mind, and beyond that I'm stuck.  But as a sports fan in general, you know when you're watching an extremely rare and special achievment.  This is definitely one of them.
This is one of the maddest things ive ever watched, not even a golf fan
Took all the glory from Rory.
What a moment, and he seems such a humble guy, refusing the believe this has happened to him. Well done Mr Block. 👏🏼
Add that to his up and down on the 18th to qualify for next years Championship.
Never seen a hole in one straight in, no bounce...incredible
That made my hairs stand on end 🤩 couldn’t have happened to a nicer bloke. He’s just living the dream right there 🙏🏻
Great moment and jaw dropped watching it live. Genuinely couldn’t have picked a better guy to be with for his last round than Rory. He’d have made him feel so at ease despite being in the hunt for the title himself.
Well played Mr Block 🎉
What a moment.....made up for the bloke.
Seen Matty Fryer do it first 🫣
Mongs and  their arrows pointing to the thing taking up 40 percent of a thumbnail
I am so pleased for this guy..  He did so well.
This really was like a Rocky movie. What a moment and what a story.
Truly amazing good luck to the guy in the near future 👏👏
Keopka may have won the Major. But Block this week won the world over
The absolute best shot of the tournament and he seems such a nice guy. Fantastic!
ace
Not only did Koepka a LIV golfer win a major (Rory hates LIV) but a club pro upstaged him and jarred a hole-in-one right down Rory’s throat on the same day 😂 definitely not Rory’s best week, but he has a decent chance to get his own back soon at Royal Liverpool and win The British Open…
WHAT A LAUGH!??. 😂😂👍🏌️⛳
A hole in one is rare for any golfer , but getting a slam dunk hole in one at a tournament like this playing with McElroy is just nuts.
Wow just wow
HOW MANY MINUTES FOR FINAL ROUND HIGHLIGHTS EH SKY? 3 MINS 40 TO BEAT THIS? PATHETIC!
I love how Rory always seems to enjoy the moment. Even when its not his
Stud
WOW! Magically fantastic. With that, this Pro's inner self surfaced. Here's my piece via my country's (Philippines) lingo..."Walang Kayabang Yabang".
It is a miracle that the ball didn’t bounce at all
BAM! No bounce straight in! Fantastic shot and what a few days he's had.
fantastic what a nice bloke made the tournament for me
Hey what a journey for this guy . Talk about a moment in time set apart for him. Great story . Great golf . Love it ❤.
Listen to the crowd!
Brilliant.well done.great moment..
I hope Rory picks up the tab at the 19th hole after that one.
And the tv commentators go crazy lol
what a story gotta love it good stuff brother!
Longer video than highlights for a whole day
Good thing someone yelled, "GET IN THE HOLE!"
Cinderella story…..
Boom
Hell yeah!
Slam Dunk the Funk Baby! Wow!😮
What a story!
