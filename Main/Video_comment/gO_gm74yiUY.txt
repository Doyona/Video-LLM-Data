15:22 lowk made me sad my room is smaller than that closet I don’t even have a window or a door
11:09 why the fly yryna get camera time 😂
I love Hawaii
YouTube video TokTok
"one small step for mankind, one giant leap for badb****"
That’s my dream house ❤
5:40 Just get rid of the ugly countertop.  Everything else looks great
I like his mail cart!
I actually never cared for him until this video. I liked how he really loves hawaii and that aloha at the end, I felt it.
So the mountain is reall? Gorgeous❤❤
💙
Wow! What beautiful house.  You are so blessed. ❤
Bret: Even tho she said this is me *oints at cleos drawing of him 😂* Bret: rude
Yaaaaaasssss britney. Queen of everything. ♥️♥️ You go Bretman🎉
Has he ever climbed that mountain ⛰️
One small step for humans, one giant step for bad bitchezzz!!!✨✨😂
I want this lifeee
That red chair definitely resembles something different than flower...
Is this guy owning or renting ?
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Natural Icon.
Where are the chickens???
Who could hate him😢❤
Wow, the views of NATURE, GORGEOUS!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
When i saw the red chair, I was like "That looked like the place where the sun don't shine"... Then Bret said... "You know what it resembles to me 😂😂😂😂" Made my day.
Why does he sound like that?
Okay first off, this guy is always such a vibe! I LOVE the way he speaks. And his house is so stunning and colourful and I loved the terrarium he had in his living room
Alam mo Ikaw Yung na panood ko na na pinapakita mo Ang Meron ka sa Bahay mo na Wala akong nakikita saying kayabangan Basta pinapakita mo pinapanood kona Hindi Ako nayayabangan sayo, nakukuha mo atensyon ko sa mga bagay na Meron ka dahil Ang gusto ko sa LAHAT ng pinakita mo ay Ang mga bundok sa labas ng Bahay mo at may madaming huni ng ibon sa kapaligiran.
Brets house is Gorgeous!!!
I actually live really close to Bretman! He’s up in Makaha valley and I’m straight down and live on the beach in a condo building ❤️ I love his personality, he’s hilarious 🌺 I’m a artist as well and would love to donate a piece for his wall 😍🤓
Bretmans hous is so beautiful. he is a very lucky .
AD you should be ashamed of yourself. This is so sad and tacky. Just HIDEOUS design
Wow, the view!!

Anyone else who thinks he looks like kaycee😭
Batman rock is a vibe, not surprised that his house is too

I lurve! Bretman!!! I don't know what's with him but he is literally one of the few big names that are not problematic!
The little chair for the niece is so heart-warming. Love Brett, he isn’t superficial and very authentic.
Results of thinking too much.
Who is this colorful person?
Is English his second language?
“Bcs without mf turtles we wouldn’t have turtles”
If I could chose a lifestyle this would be it
wtf is this? They make everyone famous now 😢
How did you find this channel? I stumbled upon it by accident and I’m hooked!
KAYA PALA PUMANGIT NA SA HAWAII, TINAYUAN NA NG MGA BAHAY YUNG DAPAT AY PROTECTED AREAS

He's an emblem.
SERIOUSLY, HOW MANY ROOMS ARE IN THIS HOUSE???  Kidding, love you Bretman!

This might be the most bleeps AD had to do lmao. I love this so much. Idk why but im in the AD rabit hole. Just watched Rupaul's, Orville Pecks' and kevin hart's.
There’s so much potential for the house but he doesn’t put any effort on it :( it looks like any other house
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I love this! 🤩 I also love a “rags to riches” story - I’m so happy to see people accomplish their dreams! It’s beautiful and inspiring! 🫶🏼💗💯
homosexual
A house like this is all I want in life.
Bretman, we love you, but calling the closet located in your master bedroom "tiny" is CRAZY!
If u wanna b a woman u have to born as a woman 😢
I love everything bcuz ❤❤❤ I too love nature
literally a Sephora.. every shade
hes a sweetie!
I love his house, close to nature and so cozy❤ my family would love to live in this kind of environment🥰
Love love bretman! He deserve it all!!
One of the best houses AD has ever showed.
this has some comedic value
I loved every second of this ❤
He such a ♌️♌️♌️🦁
Love his style AND his vibe!
Bretman is so SARAP and loveable as a person.  Always repping 🇵🇭to tha fullest.  Just finished his book.  ALL THE FEELS!  I feel so seen.
MEN  OR  WOOMEN  !!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The outdoor is amazing. He seems humble compare to others in this show.
Not sure about these neon signs. A bit much, no? Not sure about this one AD….

Yasss Brett I love bretmans taste
I'm just so proud as a Filipino and also just so happy to see a fellow Filipino thriving and building her own empire, low key inspires me to have a life like that 😌✨💅🏻
Lmao I love the camera panned on him when the whole point is to see his his house and the stuff he’s talking about. He’s talking about the chair we don’t even get to see Lol 😂 you missed the assignment. It was funny when it was all in his face and he’s uhhh and runs behind a chair lmao
♡it...
Its been 2 years since I watched this video. I was high the first time I watched it. Its been 2 years since I stopped smoking. Somehow this video popped in my mind as a distant memory. Searched for this video again. here I am . Hawaiieey is nice.
🤍
Bretman, the house is definitely you. I do not consider you "weird" but I do consider you "unique".  This house is you and it is beautiful.
No chickens yet.
I adore your house
Who is this person?
Air breathe got it
bill nye the science guy, what a tv show cause you legit got a science corner in your house and im watching that jow 😂😂
The blue sign is my fav
I mean sorry can we speak about the kitchen as well, the light bulbs art piece thos videos
Was it MCYIA? The brillant the team i do hope i heard it correctly. Highly appreciate this video
Why does he talk and dress like a stereotype?
can i sleep in your closet mr bretman rock
guy has really nice vibes
I love him! This is my first time seeing him because I like AD. He's great!
😒
He is beautiful....
Super duper love the robe. Reminds me of precolonial Visayan robes  worn by datus. I wonder where he bought it.
I hope his house is not burnt
He speaks birds
“Tora kinda looks like a jelly bean”
I love his croc 🐊 collection 👟😍😍😍😍😍
What island is this?
hiii
And not even showing his whole farm he has is a flex in it self
His house is beyond chic 😱
❤ He came so far! I'm so grateful for his amazing authenticity and he's still Da Badesst Evuh!!! PERIODt 💯
Any, repeat ANYYYYYYYone who worships “INFLUENCERS” needs Haldol, stat.  Architectural Digest used to be THE source for legit and impeccable, REAL interior design by genuine professionals.  It has become an abject waste of paper and time since Margaret Russell was fired by Anna Wintour.
Omgeee I love the book and the movie where the wild things are too 🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷
@1:19  Oh no.... 🤣🤣🤣🤣
It's Beautiful Bret huhu! <3
Terrible house...!
Офигенное видео
geeee, what a clown
OK! Like! Y’all know what this chair reminds me of.
the asswhole chair
This place is absolutely spectacular!!!!! I would be in heaven getting to live in this kind of luxury in paradise. This is a dream come to life! 🎉
Is that Honolulu?
Great video tour!
Did I see a few Christian Scott pieces on the walls? Love them :)
collar of ur dogs too tight
Crazy how he got alll this money yet he keeps his house simple and humble ❤
I see, this is pre- chicken huh
Brendan has the best personality.
Babaylan siguro itong si Bretman sa past life. Love it 🔥
The way I have laughed so much with this video I forgot I was watching AD!!! I love Bretman been following him since he started doing makeup on ig
Why some part has been blurred?
Love the flower chair and yes it looks like the bloom
Agh his energy is everything
Bretman is kind of amazing. Other videos people kick out the crew, but Bretman's like stay and watch the view it's cool.
Hoping for a update❤
i love how this is literally modern mtv cribs
I’m so happy for him.
you’re such a warm person i felt warm and safe just watching your space
Personality, personality, personality.
Congratulations as always kabayan, keep it up and godbless you more more blessings to you and to your family ❤❤were so proud of you ❤
I want his robe!!
fabulous..just fabulous ❤
I love him .. there is no one like him 👏🏽 what makes me love him even more is his story & his love for his family /Hawaii and Phillipines ❤️
compared to other AD tours, he literally knows nothing about the majority of details in his place, ‘i love my lightbulbs’
Wow 😍😍😍😍
I don’t know if you guys heard it but you could hear the energy he was sending through the speakers. 🫶🥰
Best house EVER
It blows my mind that an YT influencer can achieve this. He's pretty ignorant and that also is crazy to see someone who can be so clueless can achieve this much. Good for him though.
i love the chair for cleo
hе's an absolue darling. i don't even know him. first time seeing him. great vibe, nice decor. but the home itself is dated--especially the kitchen and bathroom and fireplaces. the surroundings more than make up for it tho.
Best home I’ve seen in archi digest! So soulful!
my uni has like 20 of those butt chairs but in white... they crack me up everytime i see them
A dream house
Its loving on nature, relax, cool and style love your comfort zone, expect more renovations nxt blog
Beautiful ❤️😍The mountain back drop is the icing to the property for me ❤️🥰I love nature’s beauty .
I love to see how he loves and appreciates his home. Some people seem weird in big homes like it's odd for some, they don't seem to fit with it.  But he fits his well. He has personal connections with everything including all his animals and his plants! ❤ I feel peaceful when I watch him in his home.
Loooove 🐢s!!! ❤🎉❤🎉 Anyone who loves turtles, science, and makeup is my Ultimate HERO!
Now i love bretman kept uttering Philippines ❤❤❤
lmao the flower chair
Where’s this at Kailua Hawaii?
Beautiful home ❤️
absolutely LOVE bretman’s ear cuff!! it reminds me of the Philippine flag bc of the sun & three stars ☺️💖🇵🇭
He didn't get a bird he got 40 chickens 😂😂😂❤❤❤
nobody is gonna mention the bloomin chair?
That’s funny uses golf cart to check his mail😅
12:10 you caint be IN an embryo
4:33 So Sweet ❤❤❤❤
1:27 it’s a Vagina chair. A flower 🌺
We’re in the wrong world
17:44  Thanks to these dogs, they made me follow Bretman and I get the daily dose of energy and happiness from DaBaddest ever since ❤
9:24 ❤
I love him so much...
Little did he know, he would get 40 chickens.
I've never seen so many blurrs and heard so many beeps in a AD video 😂
What does he do to become rich?
the wig part 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Omg! I wish i can go in there even for day, so relaxing to see. Im proud if you and how you love your mom
I've seen some other videos and this is the most eye catching as the things in his house are so loved and have special meanings to the owner instead of just architect this or that.
I believe he is the only one that said:" You are welcome to stay". The others usually say "Get out now!" by the end of the video. So, that's nice. :)
Bretman says his house is extra, but in my opinion it's just perfect! I love when a home truly reflects a person and this does. Every little piece meaning something, or being there to inspire, or being a reflection. It's so homey. So so much nicer than any LA home.   I'm an aunt so I love the parts of the house that are for his niece and his nephews, if I could, I'd do the same things. Sweetest ever.   I love him x
Omggg watching this while high is the best thing ☺️
🥹
I had no idea who they were but I laughed a couple of times - really likeable and funny, and the house is beautiful.
Beautiful house ❤❤❤
0:09 cardinal tetraaa ❤😮
Love to see my dad's artwork on his walls. 6:14
Beautiful home 😊
You are inspiration! I'm blind artist and after my loss of eyesight I paint by touch. My husband describes to me youre vids ) Vest wishes from Los Angeles! #kateroyax
omg!!!!! i cant
I am older person so don’t really know of him at all but what a delightful and yes a very beautiful person. Beautiful house as well. Definitely a new fan.
no more irvine is too expensive
Literally so funny how he loves nature, but then also his energy is just too much for nature if you know what i mean LOOOOL
“Im mainly here to microwave things”   😂 I love his honesty.
I want to be him SOOOOOO bad so serious want to cry rn
He's lucky.  He really is a sweetie. Very grateful u can tell
All those foundations bretman.... you don't need them all lol
I love your house and I love the place 😍😍😍😍
The little chair for Cleo is EVERYTHING 😭💗💗💗
Gorgeous home
Hawaii mountains hit different. Yes because they’re volcanoes 😂
Not a “scientist on the mother effing side”. 😂😂😂😂
That view is die for 😩❤️
TELL ME WHY HIS KITCHE LOOKS LIKE THE AULANI KITCHEN (locals u know what i mean)
Wow, amazing house so cool.
Britney = Bretman
Very nice home. A lot of personality. But what really matters to me is the stories and character.
BR is amazing! I love how he continues to embrace his person esp when he says "I'm a boy"
I am Half way through this video and honestly, the vibes are immaculate ✨ This House Radiates Fun, Not-taking-oneself-too-seriously, and Playful vibezz.  Love How This place is blessed with both oceanic view AND mountainside! What a blessing 🌻 Definitely a source of inspiration For My Future House too.♥️

5:51 I love that he said this and they kept it in on such a huge popular channel like YES literally help Brittany out
I believe the crystal is Citrine  😊
Why is Bretman such a vibe like legit i love him so much
Listen I’m for the gays but he was just trying way too hard 😂
The ear accessory!!! Ph
It's the bong peeping behind the crystal for me 😂
He is the pure definition how beauty gurus should be. Such an amazing identity!
Love you Bret!!!!
He has a science section like what?😂
It is really to rare to be this confident and authentic. He is something special :)
Why does it always feel like these people don't live in these houses.
that mountain view and the ocean beside / behind it is insane. How lucky to wake up to that view everyday. Heaven.
AD,  you are losing touch indeed
Who the F is this freaq
So sweet the relationship between him and his family
Wow the view outside is heavenly
Now that's a view you can't beat!  A literal mountain and the ocean behind your house.
This may be one of my favorite ones yet!!! This place was amazing! You could really feel his energy all throughout the house. A++
what a wonderful, quirky tour! the energy is contagious!
I'm crying!! Not only is the interior beautiful but that terrace and the outside. The view omg im dead hawaii is stunning
Damn, that view is stunning. Wouldn't mind waking up to that everyday.
This is makaha valley. It’s beautiful, but also the armpit of Oahu.
What an AWESOME child Bretman is to his parents....
"we don't have fireplaces in Hawaii" LMAO I WONDER WHY.... I really wonder
He sounded like a man here 10:05 omg luv it

🤮
this rich people or newstars are so strange. i don’t know him.
He is just stunningly beautiful ✨
iconic af
2:03 I honestly believe AND THE RECORD SHOWS that gay men have less respect for women than straight men do. PLEASE LOOK AT HOW MEN USE being gay to use derogatory and degrading terms designed for women. Why the "B: word. Why is is ok because if a straight man calls a woman a B then it's a BIG problem.
Sooooo cool😍 haha and it made me relax the way you talk and introducing the different personality of every area of that house♥️. Thank you!!! I'm a new subscriber from Philippines ♥️
I screamed when he just had moldavite just chilling in his room lol
I love brettman specially in her tiktom video with her chicken
Ugliest color clashing home I have ever seen.
LMAOO “reminds me of a jelly bean”
" i have this chair right here" dude has alot of chairs
I just love this man hands down❤
" For what shall it profit a man if he gains the whole world and he loses his soul?

I don't know who he is, but I really loved his energy. Kind, grounded and confident vibe.
The painting above the fireplace is by @blackbeancms on YT ❤
my office is a mess. but a hot mess. very much like me.  just bretman effortlessly being relatable every single time
Bretman kinda reminds me of Jenna Marbles in the sense that he's achieved so many things and became successful yet he stays humble and real and i love that
America needs help
큐영이 보인다😯
You can see how much he loves cleo
I have never liked any influencer but you are the only one
So imma just link this video to my vision board. Cause yeah 🤩❗️
5:51 why is no one talking about the bong lmao killed me when i saw it and he didnt say anything
House is good but I wanna know who’s this sister btw?
I love how honest bretman rocks. Just like telling the truth that he really dont cook, while some other models or celebrities that have been featured here are so scripted. lol
Dios bendiga siempre tu casa tu vida y todos los que as logrado y obtenido soy pobre y tú tantas bellezas tú lo as logrado por tu esfuerzo bendiciones para ti ❤️❤️🥰👏👏
I wanna move to Hawaii as well!!

7:34 this is so funny lol but I like it how he loves his niece
He will be the first to die during the next depression.
Can't stand the first 30 seconds hes too gay its annoying
Love how Bretman says Ha-Vai-i which is the Correct Polynesian pronunciation.
Beautiful view Beautiful home 🏠
Wow, love the house and surroundings, looks like a fun place.
Great taste! Lovely energy! I am soooo happy for your succes sweety ❤🥰🙏⭐
Gay in the level of quality 😂
No idea who he is. Bye.
perfect
it's heat treated amethyst lol
I love this human so much
awful
His pride for his heritage is so sweet. I love it
Is Putting Neón lights on wall a gay thing ?
How can someone with such a manly name be so feminine
This video is much better muted
Beautiful home❤❤
Now that's a dream home! It has character and a beautiful atmosphere, just fantastic Bretman, so deserving!
🙏
What kind of bird is that, where does Hollywood dig them all up?!
Lol. This guy is hilarious
🌺🌺🌺
Why does he kinda remind me of Edna Mode
very filipino rich houses so much things and chairs 🏡
I love Bretman, he’s so real and hilarious. Beautiful home
The butt chair 😍
Without turtles there would be no turtles...
Thank you for supporting and defending nature. Thank you for rescuing animals. I know you will continue to use your influence and resources to make the world a better place. Your house is beautiful.
Fun fact usa is actually illegal occopoation of Hawaii
Hello Kababayan!🇵🇭 what a nice house 😊
"Bret Man-cave" had me dying LMFAO
You won’t leave with an empty stomach in a Filipino home!
Joseph and today 😀
Interesting.....I loved the architecture, surroundings, most of his furnishings,  and the fact he supported local art. His personality?...not so much.
So much of his home had Cleo in it, and that's ridiculously sweet
For the wages of sin is death...  for God so love the world that he gaved his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life . Amen
YASSS BRET IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU IN ALL YOUR SUCCESS AND DREAMS COME TRUE LOVE YOU SO MUCH! ♥️
Yuk
Oh my god, him gushing over his butthole chair absolutely KILLED me! Love this guy
Bretman, thank you so much for preserving the Filipino culture. A lot of our own fellow countrymen forget where they came from. But YOU didn't. #raiseourflag 🇵🇭🇵🇭
He's so EXTRA! 😂 I love it!
Self-absorbed much? haha Guess that goes with WHO he is and he was himself so ya gotta give him credit for that I suppose? haha Fast forwarding came in handy though I will say that.
His room where the rest of his crystals are with the science lab has so much positive energy. That's why he naturally gravitates to the room and sleeps there more. Who doesn't want tht comfort? Our pets are our greatest blessings. They bring so much love and joy into our life. I'm proud of him rescuing and adopting pets. At least he can afford to take care of them and gives them love. Inspiring that he immigrated to the States not knowing much English at first. Look at him now. He cares about his family and loved ones, and takes care of people he loves.
I’m sorry it doesn’t feel colorful
who is that?
i seriously did bret's kimono wrap.it looks something like embroidered material from malaysia..called sulaman or songket..  like seriously...it is beautifullll
I love the bong just chilling right next to the Britney photo in the living room lol
Flashy humble house😅
so gay
This video is a joy.  Everything is so colourful and the cat is adorable.
Peaceful living! Bretman You're sweetness is my weakness 😘
AN AVOCADO TREE???? I WANT IT
I used to name my facebook account Britney as well. I love Britney b*tch and I love Bretman.
pays to be gay who knew
Wahhh I'm crying at the where the wild things are wallpaper and his story, I love bretman so much! <3
nobody noticed the bong by the crystal in the living room 🤣🤣🤣
This Buttchair is 🔥
A dream home location and outdoor view
Shouts out to the cameraperson!!
“My office is like a mess, but a hot mess” Me: where
where is the sectional sofa from? love it!
I guess no pool because he has access to the beach.
@1:16 what else can that resemble beside a flower?
Bretman truly Rocks!
I’m in Hawaii vacationing
Such big admirer of the Bad Bxtch there ever was 2nd to Ri tho 🤣. Bretman is an amazing Person. His down to earth, Fun, intelligent and kind.  His Home was the BEST EVER FEATURED. This is because it was REAL and not those Designer this and artsy that where you wouldn't want to touch a thang cause it cost a forutne. Bretmans home looks like its had memories for the lifetime. And mind you, looks expansive while doing it.  Please support Bretman on his show on MTV. I hardly watch these things and Bretmans shown is so much fun and authentic.
So proud of Bret! I remember watching his old videos in a tiny room with a tapestry on his wall. And now look at where he’s at! He’s definitely my favorite influencer. He’s so humble and inspiring 💖
Things I have in common with Bret: 1. Where the Wilds Things Are as my first book 2. Restoration Hardware being my go to shop spot 3. Hawaii 4. Being gay af  YASSSSS Representation!
the little chair for cleo is adorable
"one step for humans, and a giant step for bad bit*hs" ICONIC
this video was everything, and when i mean everything i mean everything!
Did anyone else notice the Bong at 5:36 which disappeared in the next shot
please somebody tell me where that robe is from
Finally, a celebrity home with COLOR and individuality
omgggg crystals!!!!!yassss
funniest AD ever!
As a Leo I understand him & gets me.😍😍😍
I ate all of my meals outside when I lived in Hawaii too, no flies 💖
Leo energy 💗💵🏠

"I'm known for being the most beautiful person in this world, nobody has ever said that but I just think that." Lol this is why I love him so much!  I want to live in his house!  And Hawaii?  My dream!
I love how he says Hawaï 😂😂
fffffffuuunnnnnnnnn, lovely, an actually magical reality star <3 <3 <3
I like this guy - he doesn’t act he is himself - the view he has is extremely gorgeous and peaceful 🕊❤️
OMG I LOVE EVERYTHING YOU PUN INSIDE YOUR HOUSE AND THE VIEW OBVIOUSLY STUNNING
dua lipa?
WOW. Just wow. I remember when he was still in high school on IG. Damn 😳 He didnt let anybody get in his way
Mood .
Beautiful home, wht made me giggle was whn he went 2 show his beauty room & his furbaby was bout stretch out &  walk then saw the person videoing the cat paused 4a second tht was so funny
i only made it to 26secoinds... he clearly has no personality other than being homosexual. which isnt a personality
You are adorable. I am a new fan and yes, you are very blessed. Love your home.
He should join "RIch Asians" TV show
His skin omg 🥰🥰
Omg I love him
Omg the view is DIVINE
Not the blooming chair resemble something else 😂😂😂😂😂
lol the bong in his living room xp
No...just No...
This is a wonderful house tour, I started off not knowing who you are king, but now I'm going to look you up after this video is fully over! This was such a genuine and pleasant house tour, and I love how much you clearly love your home. Love the outdoor space too, the natural background is amazing and I miss living in country/nature more so much

The earpiece!🇵🇭
When he said “let’s be real y’all know what it looks like to me” I hollered 😩😩🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bret is Extraaa!!!
By far the best house tour 😍 love love love Bretman
This house is a home. This is what HOME looks like. Everything is touched by him. Notice how he describes each piece with “I got this from here and there” “I got this cos it reminds me of the Ph” unlike other houses where celebs would say “My architect chose this” “My designer did his magic here” like… I wanna live in Hawaii now lol
So beautiful love it
This video is hilarious 😂😂
I love Bretman, you are awesome , he’s so humble and so down to earth, the best youtuber honestly
Where you get the ear piece! I wants it!!
I think his house is my favorite so far for AD. I love uniqueness. And hate house that are just plain and cream colored all the way through. Or just industrial looking. I love his whole house.
this has to be one of my top 5 favourite homes, it looks sooo elegant but comfy
Sick
Beautiful 🌳 🌊 home 🏡
Crazy this kid started making vines of him cussing and doing make up ✨
Bretman is so humble and real at the same time 😁 he is a gorgeous man
i love how  he has blackbean cms's art   on his walls
“Where The Wild Things Are” is my fave children’s book. And that wallpaper is everything!
He makes me want to move to hawaii more than i already do 😫 i’ve been to 2 islands in hawaii so far i can’t wait to go to the big island
lmao bussy chair
Call it the Rosebud Chair
I lost my mind when I saw that his home is literally on the perimeter of a freaking volcano.  WOW!!!! what a view!  Almost like Jurassic Park!
Pretty sure that was a bong in his living room next to his purple crystal haha
I LITERALLY LOVE BRET HES SUCH A MOOD😂💕💕💕🥰
I speak bird and they said yes that's right birch hahahahahahahahaha.
This was so entertaining 🤣 I love how he says Hawaiiii
Omg I love him 😍 when he said “let’s be real y’all know what it represents to me” I losssst it 😂 🤣
I love this! This is like my DREAM!
Your house is amazing and you have a great personality too😍😍😍
loveeeed this !
The wall of wigs part 😂😂😂🤣💀
Who does not love bret omg what a beautiful home
Where the wild things are??? Can he be any cuter?!?
Citrine bby
I love how playful all of the decorations and colors are in his house!! He is such as multi talented artists and creative! Great interior design taste, makeup is on fleek, wonderful style, the earring he is wearing gives off a certain je ne sais quoi.
the croc shelf made me giggle 😂
cringe
Bretman rock is the epitome of a gay man stereotype!! The long drawn out words, high pitched nasal tone, & hand movements 🤮 don’t forget the   annoying sense of self thats better than anyone else.  I was interesting to see his home but his voice is driving me absolutely nuts!!
The view from the front yard is just amazing
“Tora reminds me of a jelly bean” is the cutest thing I’ve ever heard him say
I love seeing BlackBean CMS art too
Meanwhile native Hawaiians can't afford housing because of people like him
Disgusting Style
This guy is cool he's got a real genuine vibe
Stay out of the sun, Hun and maybe we can have some fun... hotdog buns and weiners 😘
I just absolutely don't feel his house as a living place and I don't like his style :/ doesn't look to me, like it's actually cozy to live in
I love how he ended the tour..
Coconut con·nois·seur 🥥
Love your house!! Of course, we especially love the curtains inspired by us. Been amazing seeing your journey and growth.
It's hard to find a boring gay man yet somehow you've managed. BORING
NOBODY GONNA TALK ABOUT HIS BLOOMING CHAIR? AHAHAAHAHAHA
Lol the bong just casually displayed in the living room 🤣🤣
I manifest a beautiful house in Hawaii just like this. Thank you
"without turtles, we wouldn't have turtles..." wow
KABABAYAN. nakakabilib ka naman. 😘😘😘
i c o n i c
i love him so much
there way too many rooms for me to keep up with this video
How can you not love him?!
Wow !! Gorgeous !! Him his house his view all of it just gorgeous ! How blessed !
I love your kitchen cabinets!
I'm a big fan of AD so I have decided to rank/review all of the Open Door homes. You can check out my official rating of Bretman Rock's villa here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnrYU20ghm8 ...P.S. This is all just for fun, nothing personal and design is subjective so hope you enjoy and would love to hear your score!
Omg how far he’s come. He taught me how to regrow my eyebrows as his rooster was chirping in the background… is that what it’s called, chirping? Idk
Funny when he was describing that Crystal when he said b I don't know what is call its orange and I like it . Something I would have said lol
I don’t get the red chair… help.
@blackbean there are so many of your pieces here, I love it
Did anyone notice the Catriona Gray earing?!❤🇵🇭
The reason Brittney Spears can’t have her gmail account
I love that he never misses a chance to mention his niece
Bretman and kendalls houses are both so welcoming they don’t feel empty like a lot of influencers/celebrities houses
Do you fear Lava?
I wish Obama came to live there...
Now I’m curious as to how far his mailbox is…
I love this
I loveeeeee this video! This house speaks levels to me I love him 😍
How can you not love Bretman
I love his house. Awesome, restful vibes 😎
the bloom chair.. is so iconic 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣
Swag🥰
OG 🌈❤️🥰
I see you have no other people to visit. I mean… wtf…
0:56
OMG my dreaammm house. Mountains and ocean Perfect Combooo.
Where’s the chicken ? Or rooster I haven’t seen it lately
"...I'm mainly here to microwave things..." Love that! LOL
How are the cameras  men not loling
like having meals outside would be the most south-east asia thing bretman could do
Is this a woman?
The prettiest princess in a Hawaii castle
he is literally a mood
bretman having a painting of freddie mercury, einstein, and ruth bader-ginsburg in one room speaks a LOT
Amazing! 😊
I mean... If you have all the money you want, why saturate yourself with toxicity? Enjoy it and live life! Bretman definitely knows it. Thus he chose to live a life that feels like vacay everydayyy. Cause why not? 😌💗
🥰🤩
Bro that I lowkey like that buttchair, its awsome🤗
Noboby: So Bret how many crystals do you want around the house? Bretman: Yes
your father will think thats a shame for him to have you
Succelent
to be very honest with you i loved dakota jacksons house cuz it was around nature but this mutherfukin master peice is diffrent and i am in love with every corner of this house and living in it is living in heaven or like a trip of thousands of dollars for free , every chair seemed the most comfertable once in the whole universe and i loved how even inside of it  there are plants plus the most lovely thing is he has everything that has a meaning some sense of belongignness ,something that worth remembering and it is just a dream come true moment  for him which apparently i am feeling as if i live their and i have it  so  much to you bret  love love
👍
I super love it!
I inspire to be (and as rich) as Bretman tbh
Kenneth Cobonpue chairs <3 <3
Home prices in Hawaii 📈
That mountain...wauw!
Ilomyhosekindo

❤❤❤❤❤❤
"Without turtles, we wouldn't have mf turtles!" Omg love him!!!
if only he was straight i would have been simping for him and might have even started crushing
only real one i would say! im starting to love this man
OMG. Frabuuulous.
How much does he love his nieces and nephews 🥰?
Local paintings my ghad can't ask no  more about this house!
Very beautiful home Bretman...sending love from here..🇵🇭
The view is insane!! 😍
dope!!!! just DOPE!!
"This is where i prented i know how to cook"  This line should be add in every AD video when celebs showing their big empty n unfunction kitchen.
uuugh
bret's home compares to none other celebrities mansions in LA or NYC. Prd
τι ειν τουτο?
Bret looks like baby Moana or that small girl from enchanto
I can't with his stereotypical blackcent.
That's a big chunk of moldavite
you know this is the real home, h o m e
He has such a bad vibe….I don’t know why anyone would be influenced by him…..weird 🤪
It's like I see jennie on bretman rock because jennie love Hawaii and jennie love sunglasses and you know that because she's the ambassador of gentle monster so obviously she really has collection to of sunglasses and there vibe are the same so I see bretman rock as jennie
boy you have a lot of cross
The way he says Hawaii!
I cant help but to smile everytime i see BlackBean CMS' arts on your walls <3
I don't know I love bretman alot am a (girl) I really love all his tiktok and YouTube videos is home is so peaceful
I like his energy so positive.
Bro Bretman alr rich himself at young age 😭
I just love how Bretman is just Bretman through and through. He is the same no matter the situation and I am here for it!
Wow love your house!
i love his "suck-your-length" collection
Is this Architectural Digest or MTV Cribs?
Brennan is the Rihanna of YouTube
I love him
What does this guy do again?
I love Bretman house, it's so amazing and very beautiful
🤍🤍🤍🤍
This is acc my dream
the science room has me dead asf
He is so funny haha
Your house is so beautiful love it.
The first thing i notice is the clothes he wears its called inaul and its handmade weaven by Filipinos especially by muslim people everything in his house has filipino vibe and im loving it he's real and very humble. Im a fan of him since he became famous because he inspires me a lot.
I just love me some Bretmannnn. I would so love to meet him one day 😩😍😍😍
This person is loveable.
I don’t get it what does the bloom chair represent hahaha love this home
He’s so fun to watch hahahaha
What I love about Bretman is he never forget his roots as a Filipino. So proud of you of what you become. 😍
He knows himself very well. 💖 Which I love!
All his comments are hilarious 😂❤️
Best home tour on this channel ! He’s so real And honest ❤️
Can't listen to that voice - skip
without the turtles we wouldn't have turtles 😂
I thought she was a woman on thumbnail! Lol
Awesome
I freaking love bretman
I feel poor and sad now but optimistic
He's literally a male version of Nikita Dragun!!
bretman is such  a humble person despite of his success, watching him is like watching a successful version of myself.
When I first saw Bretman I knew he was going places he appeared on Itsjudyslife vlog before I was thinking boy hmm later he’s going to be doing amazing things and has more opportunities and getting new fans
Where did all his plants go? That was my fav part.
See I speak birds and they just said 'that's right b****' I DIEEEEEEEEEEED
His home location seems so relaxing!
Uhhh is it just me or does it seem like he doesn’t even live there, the way he described the furniture seems he just made all that up, the make up brushes weren’t even used, and the way he looked at those dogs at the end when they ran up on him like they’re strangers.... 🧐  fame is a deception
Beautiful home. Thank a lot for your sharing !
Love him to pieces
I appreciate how extra he is but remains grounded.
I miss Hawaii
Am I the only one who noticed Bretman's earpiece? It's the same earpiece what Ms. Universe 2018 Catriona Gray wore on the day she won! So much for Filipino Pride 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
I love how bretman is using Ms Catriona Gray’s three sun and a star ear piece that she wore when she became the miss universe in 2018 representing the philippines
Goal.... to have to drive the golf cart to get the mail
Please someone tell me is he/she boy or girl?
“Without mf turtles, we wouldn’t  have turtles.” - Bretman Rock, 2021
wasn't really interested in investing in crypto and stocks, but after receiving $92000 profit from an investment of just $1500, my perspective changed immediately. I couldn't have imagined that. That's for the joy you bring yo my life and that of my family. I highly recommend her sandra Bullock
I'm so proud of him, he never forget where he came from. He's always proud to be Filipino..🥰😍
10:14
This is way too Gen Z Tik Tok style for my taste but I love that it shows his personality with the personal touches. He’s 100% himself and I love it.
No self-respected Hawaiian wears shoes inside the house.
this is my favorite open door so far its so cute and charming and I love Brets very chill way of describing everything
We love Brittney too, no wonder you have excellent taste and style. xx
I love that you brag about being a Filipino❤
Omg the view is amazing, i can feel the fresh air😩
he is so funny
why did you guys blur cleo out of the painting of bretman and cleo??
10:20 😂😂😂😂
Disgusting...
His soul is soothing to me 😂😂😂
Uhh, I love him so much 😭❤️ I’m going to manifest that life
LIVING THE LIFE WE ALL WANTED, AND BRET DESERVES ALL OF THESE!! 💚💚💚
I already watched this video and I'm watching it again because his house is sooo beautiful and there are peaces of art in there and that's sooo inspiring.... ❤️
Habla como mujer, actúa como mujer , camina como mujer pero es hombre, que tiempos son estos, qué hay que defender lo que es obvio🙏🏽
Funny, humble, true nature lover. He even let the crew stay longer. I really like his zen. I love the house and kudos for making it sooo homey. Respect.
Such a beautiful house 😍
in my opinion the funniestpart of this walk through is....ur "STATEMENT PIECE"
Yo ur back patio and yard.....BOMB
And I honestly think u R one of the MOST BEAUTIFUL people n the world n the FUNNIEST!!!
I love how Bret has a Kenneth Cobonpue chair 💫💫
The bong😂
What I like about him is that he didn’t let money get to him like other influencers. I also think he’s to the point of being a celebrity.
I have been seeing this man everywhere... now he's on my recommended page on yt?! it's like he came out of no where( at least for me)
Love the earpiece and yes, #FreeBritney!
So love your house bretman😍, Very calm and relaxing. View is the best!
I like how he just doesn't kick AD out at the end of the tour.
When I saw his curtains I was like, “those look familiar🤨” and I look up and notice that I have the same exact curtains💀
He essentially has the ultimate house, the view is astronomical. What island is this specifically? Gotta be Oahu.
Lets be clear nothing in that house was “formal”
that chair looks like a butt hole
Awww I like him now 🤧. These make me really like the stars lol
Manifesting to get this kind of life like Bret in the futuree!!
Who the hell is this person?
this is literally the best episode
I’m not the sure but I think he might be gay
People are just starting life financially at 23. How the heck did this guy get so rich at that age?
jajjaja te amo
love you! Congrats!
The fact that he wore the Catriona Gray earrings are amazing
Soo beautiful beautiful 😻💞💛💞
The chair is like a plump booty hole 🙄😌
I admire people from Philippines around the globe who are successful. To think being an immigrant is not easy. I myself is an immigrant. Much love here❤️
I'm confused cause i read an article where bretman said he wasn't hawaiian when he was labeled one in a magazine and now he is hawaiian in this video, still love him though🥰🥰🥰
The bong behind the amethyst i died
I love how he's always proud of being a Filipino
he is so pure
I speak birds 😂🤣😅😅😂
Where is the pool??
This is very stereotypical, but he really talks in the way how gays talk.  Like duh~ uh-huh~
I don't know why we moved from Hawaii,  it's soo beautiful I love ur golf truck/car!
He is very smart! He is an example of someone using fame the right way. Very grounded and funny.
wow the view out side just like jurassic park
I’m Up Next 🙏🏾🧘🏾‍♀️
I am a new fan!
why'd yall cover cleo's face like everybody knows what she look like already
who is this person?¿
Good for him, finally someone pronounced Hawai’i properly.
I have no idea who this guy is, but he’s a crack-up.
my idol 😭
And she said she said she said she said she from Hawaii.. How to say cute in japanese ...Kawaii💜💜
"Not only I hear myself, I hear my own thoughts in this room"  I'm not that rich but my room does that too
nicee
His judgemental wig wall 🤣🤣
I love his home, one of my favourite with Vanessa Hudgens's home 😍😍😍
6:56 🤣
The earrings 🇵🇭😍
🇵🇭😍
*Oahu's Mahoooooo!!!*
How many crocks do you want? Bretman: yesssss
12:30 is breath-taking 😻
My boyfriend fixed his air conditioning one time. He said he was very kind and welcoming.
I love that you adore your niece, she's growing with so much love
annoying when he or it talks...
I love that he has a lot of local artists designs in his house
Stunning
Tropical houses 😻😻>>>
The red chair tho! Ahahahahahahhhahah!!!
14:26 PREACH.
T H E  C U T E S T....... ♾
Love love love
I loved living in Makaha Valley right down the hill and across from Bretman it truly is an amazing place to wake up to everyday 🥰🥰🥰
1:54 it's called a geode  Very beautiful piece
"Welcome to my kitchen, this is where I pretend to know how to cook" 😂😂😂
God, how can someone be so entertaining. I would literally watch him do nothing and he would some how find a way to make it seem like so much fun.
so funny
This is the AD episode that I watched more than twice.
So boring.... like its owner.
"Because without turtles we wouldn't have turtles"  wise words
Lol i luk. U i luk u 2. Adios tis the season.
that chair looks like a vagina hole
lol this dude is funny
Sobrang nakaka inspired ka Brent!🥺🥺 Sana ma meet kita in personal.. 🥰😘  #foreverfans xx
7:25 cause I want Cleo to know that i like appreciate these like little drawings that she makes of me even though she says that this is me * points at the wall * * silence * rude.
WTF!?
TO BE GAY, WHY MUST THEY SOUND AND ACT LIKE THAT?
Is his zodiac Cancer ♋?
Sooo much personality 😂, love himmm !
#freebritney
The cat be like... 👀
Amazing !!! Beautiful view! I didn’t know about Bretman before but he seems fun!
I've seen a lot of AD celebrity houses but Bretman's house view is the greatest I've ever seen. Just breathtaking
2:33 the rack of crocs is my dream
I've watched this already, but it was recommended again. But jeez, Bretman Rock is gorgeous. The hair and that flower around his ear is amazing.
Who the heck is this😒
Wow how u came up big time from utube
That earpiece!  Loving Bretman so much
I love how he keeps on mentioning Filipino/Philippines on this house tour. Keeping your Filipino taste even after moving to America makes me prouder than ever!
The most beautiful dream fans, dating cyber friends in Hawaii, oh yezzzzzz, l would spend something like six months of suuuuper Woodstock oceanic hugzzzzz dating all web groups of supporters, what a wonderful world this could be fans, think about it
The earrings 💛
I so liked your house. This is exactly the kind of house that I want so much greenery and plants
The house interiors are not that impressive, but damn! The views outside are just stunning!
Loveliest person in the mf world
oh my god cant live w/o nature around me. and things bret said maan thats right and cant wait to realise my own goals
"Without turtles, we wouldn't have turtles "  lol!   Words to live by!
Perhaps a good soul, just get a mixed message about his authenticity.
can I send you some crystals boo??
hes so flawless
Nagpintas ti balay mo manang..love it so much..Sana all
Its like an overwhelming paradise,  I could stay there everyday. Thats exactly my dream home,  cozy and alot of touch of nature, tropical vibe and wide green green grass of home just like from the song. So stunning and cozy home of Brent.
Beautiful home
I’m super late! How did I not know about this
I love your home and your Avocado Tree
Love that he mentioned “#freebritney”
Fireplace is such a flex..and i have two of them.. he's so funny!!!
by far my favorite AD video. Bretman's energy shines through! Can i come visit 😂
I was laughing for 18 minutes straight
this is free therapy
"See I speak birds and they said that's right b*" 🤣
💕💕💕
Can we appreciate how good of an uncle Bretman is? I mean, if he’ll be my uncle I’d be the luckiest 🥺❤️
AWESOME!!!!!!👍😎 PHILIPPINES in Hawaiii Beautifully done LOVE🤣👍 the style Everything in the house..very good &.classy 👍 esp the design of Chairs by Kenneth beautiful ambiance we love you!!!!!
Love this guy!!! Malo Bretman💪❤️🙏🏼
tagalog  challenge pleazzze
I think the only reason why I like this episode so much is because I’ve watched Bergman Rock so much on social I know 100% that he LIVES in this house, I’m always questioning with other celebrities and their homes if they just bought the house and decorated it for show but never sleep there probably ever. 🤷🏽‍♀️
love how he's the perfect mix of hilarious, kind, and crazy. XD
The sass I never knew I needed
I love him ❤️
NATURE!!! ugh!!!!  I love his house very homie!
The crocs
Sudden death while having sex - DANGEROUS Illness - DO NOT KNOW 100% DEATH https://youtu.be/NctT8rvsyUc

Man i want to be rich so muchhhh
Richest gay boy in the world #bongga
This is literally my dream house..i just need to make an office room according to my preference
best house tour I've ever seen tbfh. loved how he ended it too by saying "you are more than welcome to stay & enjoy the view"
💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Your house is nice, but hard to watch  “ liiiike… all of it”
R u kidding me???? Let's meet on mtv app for a marathon now. 😘🥰💯

Is that tony jaa
ICONIC 🤎
This beats all the other celebrity’s Episodes 😍😍😍 that hawaii view is priceless
the bong at 5:35 lolol I love him
I love him he is the best
This guy is living my dream☹️
i love where the wild things are
Does anyone know where his couch from his living room living room is from. The light grey one Not the one from his formal living room.
Such a wonderful place to live in.
I'm literally crying rn. I need this view everyday and live the best life every second. So much peace! So close to nature! One day, I'll live my best life in Hawaii.
He radiates. I just love this kid. It must’ve been …. Like…. Shoot idk, 7 years or so since I first saw him online. He’s come so far and he’s just as much himself as he was then. Love that
Take a sip of a drink every time bretman rock cuss
Love you bretman for showing us your treasure ✨
The view around you is breathtaking 😍
WOWWWWWW SO BEAUTIFUL
The little chair!!🥰
The best house ever 💖🥰
the bong in the shot @5.35 haha
That truly is Bretman’s well deserved paradise.
WoW just WoW
I love bretttttttt😂. So dramatic 😂🤩💕
Beautiful <3
It's called citrine. That gorgeous crystal is so amazing and he doesn't even know what it is, just shows you how drawn to crystals certain people can be without even knowing what they're used for.
Probably a stupid qns but ive been wanting to ask this to rich ppl,becus they have chair and sofas in the outdoors,if it rains,do they have shelters that can be opened or what???
Yaaaaaassss‼️ #vibes periodt!!
Calcite geode is most likely the crystal he couldn't remember...  😘
I love it nature lover here 😍
I'm impressed how Bretman adores his Filipino Heritage despite being successful in another country.
I love him, his house, and everything thing that he stands for, i hope he keeps thriving 🤗
“I love Torah because she reminds me of a jelly bean” 😂❤️
The bong as decor on the bookshelf, I’m in loveee 👏🏼
It’s NEVER boring when watching Bretman Rock!
The striped bottle superficially amuse because trip overwhelmingly cause per a stupid mother-in-law. curved, measly millisecond
Bretman is in AD? Awesome!!!! To be honest he isn’t my style. Too extra. But I support him because he is Filipino and did well for himself and his family in the States.
I loved the pieces that stood out! But I hated the kitchen. But thats fair because you can tell which places are important to him 😆
Oooooo you have such a beautiful home! What island are you on? I was on Big Island with my boyfriend during covid but now we’re back on Oahu. I miss the country lifestyle on Big Island
"Welcome to my kitchern. This is where  I pretend that I know how to cook."😂😂😂
It’s the blue bong behind the crystal for me 😂
The classic proverb, "without turtles there would be no turtles."
7:18 is that a CupcakKe sculpture?
Thank you so much for sharing your house anak. God bless you .
I love how bretman is such a super humble guy
HE’S SO FUNNY THE WIG PART LMFAO HE’S THE AMOUNT OF BOUJEE I ASPIRE TO BE
let's appreciate the earring😍😍
Filipino Foreigner. Go home. You deserve it.
kudos to his success..wow he is proud being Filipino..wow!!you go

Wow 💘 😻 💜
You are absolutely passionate of everything you have in your beautiful home.

Proud of you Bretman and proud to be a Filipino. 👍❤️
He lives on a painting
😍😍😍😍

Who is this person?
The view of his villa issss everything! 😭🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
I love how bretman mentioned Kenneth Cobonpue! His pieces are UH-MAZING!
I looove the view, the crystals, the art. It really is an awsome home.
This is such a bigger flex than James cookie cutter basic LA home with no personality.
Oh snap I didn’t know Bret leveled up like this. Good for him!
gross
Heat treated amethyst....it is citrine
Yaaaaaaaas!! Love bretman🤙Cheeeeeeehoooo
the earcuff 🇵🇭 miss universe 2018 catriona gray , loveeeeyou bretman 🇵🇭
"Without MF'n turtles, we wouldn't have turtles" I died🤣🤣🤣
“I’m a big advocate for turtles because without motherf$ckin turtles we wouldn’t have turtles!” Please never change
"See I speak bird, and they say that's right b*+ch" 😂
I don't know who he is but... mad respect for making his dreams come true.
the view is wow! love the nature feels! love waking up in the morning to that kind of view everyday ❤ #dreamhouse
The fact that he opt to wear Filipino print and showcase Filipino pieces, just wow.
hes just like this cool gender fluid down to earth friend you got he is amazing
All his dreams became reality . I'm so happy for him
This is a home ❤️
Damn I thought that was Mario Lopez😂😂😂😂
acoustic panels. not audio pads. So much for loving science.
Can people stop saying "moment" now please? God it's driving me nuts. Not every single thing has to be a "moment".
Beautiful home, Bret! ❤
At this time, I just wanna be Bretman's fish
He’s a good soul.. humble, family-oriented and brings so much life to everything. His house is simple but what truly stands out is his amazing character! ☺️

"Without mf turtles we wouldn't have turtles"                    - bretman rock
Love Bretman so much 😭💓
I'm here for the comments.. 🍿🍿🍿
He's so down to earth. I love that so much about him
If his Mom was there and know that some guest will arrive, she'll probably cook a set of dishes for the AD Crew. Like how the Filipinos do. Inviting guest to eat.
He said “I speak bird” yesss
I've seen that blooming chair on 2 kdramas now, "she was pretty" and "tempted". I watch both of these after I've watch this video in which i notice the chair and i have to come back and comment on it lol.
Oh my… I thought it’s a green background… it’s real!!! 😱 so NIIIICE!!!
I love how Bretman is really extra but you know deep down he genuinely cares ! <3
Where's the pole? HAHAHAHAH
I love him and love how much he loves his family! Been a huge fan for years and not surprised at his beautiful home with so much of his personality in it
Such a beautiful home and the outside view is amazing. Always wanted to go to Hawaii.
Loveeeeeeeeeeeeee
Beautiful Home❤️ Beautiful Hawaii ❤️
I think the large orange crystal is Citrine.
Bretman cracks me up! 😂❤️
🇵🇭❤️❤️❤️
C/O 2012 JCHS CHEEEEEEE🧡🖤🧡🖤
I love how much he adores his niece, it is so wholesome
LOVE!
I was about to post a comment and ask why his villa doesn't even have a pool since Hawaii is hot then later on Bretman at 16:52 talks about installing a pool on his insanely spacious frontyard/backyard😄😄😄
Iloveyou Bretman From you're home the 🇵🇭
Those views are absolutely ridiculous and he fits so well in with them. When he was standing in front of the mountains talking about living in Hawaii… *CHEF’S KISSES* 😻 He really deserves all this and more
His love of crystals chairs and imbuing all of his loves and passions into his living space is next level. 💖U Bretman!
Ahahahaha being judge by the mannequin😅
I love how Bretman loves Cleo always doing stuff for her. Cleo is blessed to have an uncle that loves her that much
Can someone explain how a room can be gay ?
I love his baaad B! attitude
Looks like he’s standing in front of a green screen with that beautiful scenery behind him while standing on the deck.
Bretman’s home is literally giving me them dream home vibes.
Alright y’all rich folk…what’s the difference between a living room, living room, and a formal living room? lol
👍🏻👍🏻
Inter design
🥰
That’s a BADDASS CRIB…
.....this man...this man is so fine.  😂😂 omg.
would like to live as him for a day yes
LIVING THE BEST LIFE OUT THERE 😍 ALSOOO I'M SO PROUD OF HIM!!! BEEN SEEING HIM RISING UP SINCE 2016
Torra is like a jelly bean 🤣😩
Being married to him would be like being married to a valley girl on steroids. The inflections would drive me off the cliff.
Please don't guy to Hawaii. Tourists and foreigners are taking up space and kicking out locals making them homeless ‼️‼️‼️
Love Bretman, hes a whole mood
When he shows us at outside view i'm shocking like... Oh my god the view 😍
can i please sleep on that frontyard 🥺
He is living the life i want
He isss so amazing so gladdd iveee been following him since foreveaaaaaaa

I've heard Karibu sana.
Very interestingly explained. fireplace adds contrast. Crazy. Random.....and yet not so Love it.
Are we gonna talk about the suck-u-lent ahahahahaha
He made a grand ending for sure
not him fighting with the wigs 💀
Ok. Can somebody explains to me how do you keep the furniture of the patio safe from the rain?! You run home like crazy every time to get it in or leave it like that and than replace it next month?!
Such a lovely person you are  ❤
and who the hell is this guy?
Kabayan bretman pinoy riprisint
you know u actually made it when u actually materialized ur childhood's dream, is such a flex - every min of this video deserved to be flex.. and u can tell how Bretman's success didnt just changed him, but his whole family for the better and it shows.. congrats kiddo!   P/S - and also i didnt know i needed a Golf cart until today for my mail, bucketed list it! 😂
This vid made me genuinely like him
I know y’all saw that b*ng
A.D  doesnt realize they are lowering their standards
I like his honesty lol  Here's a golden quote I fell for "Cause without mf turtles, we wouldn't have turtles" and "Please don't use plastic straws, cause, do you want this b+tch to die?"
Idk who he is but I love his vibe. His home is so beautiful and very colorful, I have a smiliar style. Nowadays most people use boring neutrals but I love a pop of color in every room. Love it! Keep doing what you're doing!
#FreeBritney i love it!!!
“Welcome to my kitchen, this is where I pretend that I know how to cook” -BRETMAN 😂
that view really is the important aspects here
Welcome to another show of " LET'S SHOW YOU HOW BROKE YOU'RE"
Congratulations Bret!  You deserve this beautiful home and so much more. May God continue to bless you.  By the way..........I love your new hair style!
So far the most watched video so far. U can feel his house as HOME. Like there's a human living inside. And the outside, no words. U can just seat and enjoy the breeze.
His house is just real. Very colorful. I appreciate him for supporting locals. But damn, his outdoor amazing.
Dang how did u get this rich? How to be u? 😬😁
Lmaooo about the blooming flower 😆
Everything is already top notch. Then the cat(s) take it to the moon 😼😍

Kinda random but the fact that I own the same red sweatshirt at 10:45 makes me feel like I have good style lol
why is this channel interviewing only gays?
Nice house, but that VIEW 🤩
“It’s such a flex. Like oh yea I have a fireplace... two of them” 😏💅✨
4:42 bookmark
Actor/Actress, hm interesting, doesn't really make sense. Also as as scientist what research are you currently doing?
really love how I've heard bret probably be the only person who says "you're more than welcome to stay" at the end whereas most other celebs say "now get out bye-bye" aha - no offense to them but like just a quick observation. he's an amazing person
Wow, I remember how this kid started or not too long ago - good for him!
Lupit Ng swag mo boy daming tao na gumagaya nang style ba, Peru sayu lang bumabagay Po.
Lol
That golf cart!! You can take the boy out of Ewa Beach, but you can’t take the Ewa Beach out the boyyyy!!!
So..what does that red chair resemble?..
His makeup room was a cosmetic departmental store for me... And if rains all the cushion chairs out there would be spoiled light ??
Everything is so beautiful and peaceful..manifesting  a house like this for myself
I love the giant amethyst next to the picture of Britney Spears and a bong. 😂😂😂
The golfcarttruck is the best vibe 🤣😂
Love that Bretman never fail to be a prod filo <3
He is so funny , cute , hot , has awesome personality , good taste , unique  dAymn I wanna wife him up
Sooo nobody else noticed the blue bong next to Britney ? Cuz first of all .. lol second ..that bong is super cute

GO GAY!!! 💯💯❤️❤️
💜💙💚💛🧡❤
Imagine lighting up with himmmm
He is literally living his life...
Why did they blur out Cloe’s face?
The way he just hopped up into that stripper pole--
Citrine
Who?
Love the stripper pole in Brett bedroom. The entire home is beautiful and welcoming.  Have fun and success.    Hawaii is gorgeous. I wish I'd went there. My sister went to her penpal in Hawaii years ago.
Aye uce u need a rock wall?🤣🤣🤣🤣

10:17 New aesthetic unlocked: Bretman Rock fighting with 30 mannequin girls for judging him.
😂🤣❣️
because without mf turtles we wouldn’t have turtles - bretman rock
And at last i felt.. How dey can be so fond of nonliving things..all this love... Is for tht.. Which is a part of impermanence like our body too. Nice big house.. No body lives der without you and ur dogs ???? I honestly feel like living dying alone... We live in small home but 6 people together including a naughty kid look, love, quarrel  with each other ,do work together. ..tht looks like life to me.
Does anyone know where he got his black and gold robe from? so gorgeous
I just love him ❤️❤️❤️😭😭
#freebritney touching me
BEST HOUSE AD HAS EVER TOURED!!!!!!!!
His house is all things locallllll i love it, i love u bestie!
KING ENERGY!!
I thought for a second he's wearing some balinese traditional clothing 🤔,.,.he really look like one
The fact that I enjoy watch this more than I'd expect... I just look touring a beautiful house, it was spectacular love it
I speak bird and they said "that's right b****"   ✌🏻
pls I find his house on google maps and i can’t freaking find it like my finger hurts LOL
Im so proud of  Bretman not because I am a filipino but because he is living his life to the fullest but still a bad b*tch(good person). Unlike other influencer, even just by the videos that they uploaded the viewer can already feel the toxic life and toxic people on that videos... You kinda just know that one of these days one or two of them will be viral bcoz of some some sh*tty stuff they've done... To Bretman you can already tell that he likes peaceful life.. He loves his family.. That wall for her niece to doodle, it tells you what kind of a person he is..
Hes really a god, and very beautiful and conscious  person, i love it and him and hes filipinoo, representt
BRET is so authentic  I cnt lie. This whole video i never got the show off/rich guy vibes. He was so genuine and real with everything. Good for him
I love hawaii too😍, would love to go back to hawaii
“tora just like reminds me of a jelly bean” 😭😭😭😂
I love your house! The design, the architecture, the interior, all are quite impressive! I also love your advocacies! <3
Didn't have to swear to show how "baddest" you are.
When every sentence is a question
11:10 did anyone saw smth flew by XD i think it was a fly,,,,ik very random,,
WATH!!!!!
I love how humble and confident Bret is, he doesn’t have to go out of his way to show that he’s rich or big. I love that unlike other influencers, his house isn’t way too much yk, it looks homey but still expensive. It’s the kind of rich people houses that would be a dream goal to have, unlike those big, boring styled mansions like Jeffree’s or the ace family’s, or the basic ones like James’.   Bret’s house is just my dream, and it’s a perfect representative of a young, successful and rich social media personality like Bretman. Sometimes I look at other influencers’ houses and be like “but can they really afford living here?” Or think it doesn’t suit them, but with Bret’s house it’s like “this is what im talking about 🔥 ” Idk, im just in love with it. It makes me wanna move to Hawaii and I’m a city person , such a heaven on earth place, I can see why Bret doesn’t want to live anywhere else! 🌊 ☀️ 🏝 ⛰ greetings to the locals in there from North Africa 💚 Keep protecting and taking care of your beautiful island ✨🐢🌱
So wholesome
He makes me love Leo's again
Love u forever brek!!!!! I'm ya bestie for life!
How is he so naturally funny and likable
I loveeeeeee you
His confidence is so flourishing and wonderful to his fans. His home is so nice and unique. I also LOVE his outdoor living areas.
At the end “torá  reminds me of a jelly bean lmfaooo
Is this guy gay
BECUASE WIHTOUT TURTLES WE WOULDNT HAVE TURTLES
it's a home, not just a house ❤
How can you not speak on the many pairs of crocs?
im confuse if tora is a dog?
Probablemente este sea el mejor video de AD
I just enjoyed this human being ❤️😻oh boy real soul
when he says he loves his home and the contents like that is so genuine like "look at my blooming chair...these are local paintings...the light bulbs...the crystals I collect, I love it" like that is so pure omg.
Probably the most homey celebrity house I've seen. Some celebs have extravagant houses but doesn't look homey to me, but Bretman's.....makes me want to go there and ask him to adopt me. Hahahaha. His house is a home. It's awesome.
😍😍😍
He intro'd this video like he works at a Hawaiian tourist shop i canNOT lmaoooo
I dont like the kitchennnnnn ://///
Wait, I saw a painting an artist from tiktok made for him, that's super cool! @14:06
I’m so broke
I’m straight as hell but man this dude is like beautiful on the inside 😂 I’d love to be his friend tbh he’s real positive and happy
Does anyone know where all of his plants went?
When he pronounces ‘Hawaii’ correctly. 💖👏🏽👏🏽
that is the saddest gaming/working setup I've seen(pc area). Looking at it already hurts my legs, my wrist, my whole arm gets tired and I feel claustrophobic lol
After watching that video, I am hard now.  He has a beautiful personality, and he is a lot more sensitive and complex than he shows.
Pewdiepie brought me here
He is so leo
This is where I pretend how to cook - Bretman at his kitchen  hahahahaha that's relatable!
Dog's look so happy and free.
He banged into the wall
He is the real influencer
The picture of him from his niece 😂 I get this so often from my son nephews and nieces and need to think so this is how I look 😂 love it
My dream house omg!!! Hawaiiiiiii
MAn Or WoMan, am kind of confuSeD
Tora reminds me of a jelly bean 😶😂💁🏽‍♀️
Love Bretman but the house is meh
Boring
Does anyone know where he got his kimono from? It’s soo pretty
omgggg, i loved where the wild things are when i was younger
I love the small nature there
Bretman makes me wanna move to Hawaii 😩❤️‍🔥
Dear bretman , u r an inspiration to ur family n fans. Love every nook n corner of ur house. I can c how far u have come till now. N it all cuz of ur hardwork n ur love. Keep thriving n that RED CHAIR🔥
My dream house!!
Those Kenneth Cobonpue chairs are awesome!!! Nice crib Bretman! 👏🏼
This was entertaining.
The gayest terrarium, accent furniture  i've seen... never fails to infuse humor... we wanna see forest like terrarium.  His house has the most precious views that AD featured.   Hope changed his kitchen cause it doesn't match exotic beauty of entire interior.
Blessings!  🙏Jesus Christ Saves🙏 1st Corinthians Ch15 Verses1-4 KJV
Hawaian mountain so beautiful 😍
I love ur earcraft brett
You can see how grateful he is for all his blessings, and he earned it all himself! It's such a beautiful, soulful home 😍
i love bretman rock🥺
He has three living room😳
His looks is a combination of skills and passion so relaxing and I don't know i just loved staring at him. Love it!
love him
Hey Bret man I live in Oahu
If Bretman said “wait me in living room i’ll be back”   Me:which one? And got lost
Britneyspears@ gmail.com 🙃
1:16 I don't get what he mean? Can anyone enlighten me up?
The nature 😭  BEST AD house tour!!!
I love his home so much, its so pretty and you can tell he really loves it. I love it for him.
where did all your plants go???
He's just so real to me... I mean what you see is what you get. He takes care of his family, his dogs. He's humble too coz he never forgets where he came from. Always proud to be Filipino. Good, good kid. Deserves what he all accomplished! Props!
Beautiful Personality! I hope it never leaves her.
I mean come on those mountains views and backyard got me as hurt as I am inspired. One life!
Proud of his growth
It’s so nice to see a creative house. Everyone’s house looks the same— modern farmhouse. All white. Matte black hardware.
Who is the hell is this dude ?
Okay wow I had no idea he was actually interesting or this rich. Good for him!!
Aloha!
Makaha mauka/makai all of Waianae west coast side of Oahu is beautiful.  Simular to its beauty sister of S.Africa..
I never wanted to be someone’s cat so bad adopt me lol! 😂
Bretman Rock is totally has a Filipino heart. You are amazing gurllllll
bretman is so funny and genuine. i love how he talks about local businesses and saving whales 🥺
Lmfaoooo, love Bretman
Peep that bong thooo. 😏😘💨😍
❤️ Bertman rock! Period
Jesus is coming.     "Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand"- Matthew 3:2   Many will say that the Lord has needed to come for 2 000 years and it  is for those who He seeks to find, that one lost sheep  among the ninety-nine that the coming of the Lord has not yet occured... For God “desires for all men to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth” -1 Timothy 2:4    And say "Rejoice with me: I have found my lost sheep. I tell you there will be rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent."- Luke 15:6-7    “if you acknowledge and confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord(Is recognising his power, authority and majesty as God) and believe in you heart the God raised him from the dead you will be saved”-Romans 10:9    “For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that you may have life and have it to the full “-John 3:16       "Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, because through Christ the law of the Spirit who gives life and has set you free from the law of sin and death"- Romans 8:1-2   With all that has been said  “Watch therefore for no man knows the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming”-Matthew 25:13
The swears🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dear Bret, you are the most beautiful person in the world.
#freebritney... well, didnt work out...
Why would they blur cleos face on the painting? Bret has showed it many times😂😂🤔
he's just so expensive!
His interior designer did not do a good job!!! He needs to get fired!!! 😂
What does he actually mean by saying to the blooming chair that you all know what it resembles to me??🤔
The level cord clasically drum because cat natively shiver given a six touch. absorbing, abrupt lyocell
His view of mountain is more than enough.
12:08 is a very fabulous red chair...
Proud of Bretman Rock 🇵🇭 ❤️❤️❤️
It's Citrine lmao beeetch
AD is trying to find the Gayest Person's house
The outgoing married consequentially murder because church scilly force per a sassy temper. pink, pretty view
PepeLaugh
Absolutely beautiful!
I mean, Bretman Rock is cool and all, but was the house itself AD worth?
“Tiny @ss f***in’ closet” *pans a space bigger than my entire apartment* #goals
I don't know him but I love him and this video was inspiring.
So happy to see BlackBean’s art!!
Don’t really know much about him, but this was so interesting to watch!
Beautiful house especially the view outside! 🤍😍
his house seems very personal, definitely a definition of home✨
I love how he said hawaii😍❤
I love that yellow sofa the most!!!!! ✨
Very pinoy vibes esp in your office! 😅🌸 I love it! 🥰
Why does this house remind me so much of the one from Zenon? It is perfect 🌴💗.
Love that he doesn't ask the cameraman/crew to leave at the end but instead ask them to stay and digest the glory of his house. 🇵🇭 hospitality at its finest!
The idiotic bedroom unfortunatly hammer because weapon constitutively harass anenst a daffy skill. knowledgeable, untidy architecture
I feel old because I have no idea who this person is. Although I am 28.
He is really the kind of person I wanna be. I love his home and his perspective as a person. His home reflects so much about his personality. I can feel all the positive vibes through my screen.
That fly was brave enough to steal bretman's spot light at 11:11 😂
I need more Bretman content like this.
Why’d they blur Cleo?
*He's literally a man who was written by women.*
Such a warm hearted soul, his house is playful, I feel alot of joy experienced in that house. Like everyone I love how he thinks about his family- his nieces, his mum, play room with his friends. He loves animals, advocating for turtles and saved 2 dogs. I wonder if he realises what a lovely person he is :D
The location! Majestic 😍
I'm loving this home of Breeeeet ❤️❤️❤️❤️
anyone else notice the bong hahaha
Any aesthetic association with Frida Kahlo?
Bretman's so homely, down to earth and vibey. Such a unique individual. I love this video.
why was cleos face blurred
i love your hasven and i see the Catriona Gray homage in this feature... more power and stay brilliant and fearless
the way i laughed out loud when he said the dog is a jelly bean
This just made me love him so much more
I love how he doesn't conform to what a modern youtuber house is expected to look like. The house is so reflective of his personality I love it. ❤
9:18 actually feels the energy
😭😭 Is it weird i feel proud of Bretman? Like from his small room with all his shoes in the background to this!!! 😍 love to see it
He's living my dream life
One small step for man, one giant leap for bad bih 😂😂
#freebritney
The wretched satin immunochemically burn because antarctica logistically love throughout a adamant van. jazzy, lame sharon
12:35 the view. to wake up and see that everyday. wow
Hit me britney one more time.. 💃
A nice chilled crib.
OMG amo su personalidad
so nice to see so many Black Bean CMS paintings!!
1:19 Naughty 😉
Make an episode with Jeffree Star.
Cheering up my day 🌞
he should have at least named some of the local artists
ngl the house and this video was boring although i love bretman
The best scenery I have ever seen . . Love your home dear
The fact that Bretman loves Britney <3 #freebritney
Where the wild things are 🥺🥺🥺
I Love him! What you see is what you get.. Quite candid. Congratulations on all his success.
Best house so far.... Not boring at all
Does anyone know where that “Papaya Bath” art print is from?!?!?!?!
I didn't know who this was but I really loved his personality and his house. I feel a lot of kindness and also wanting to be normal definitely not the idea I had of a makeup guru. Also he's gorge, would love to date
I felt the energy bret thank you ☺️
okay now someone told me what that bloomy red chair resembles for bretman lmao
what a beautiful mansion
why they have blur cleo’s face tho when she gets appearances on his vlogs?! 🤔
Ok I was not a fan of Bret untill watching this. What a funny guy when he said he spoke bird I Lol'd so hard.
“I speak bird and they said that’s right b*tch”          Iconic
Amazing! Not only the view and the house but Bretman's story of success! Such a motivation!
Its citrine bruh
Don’t really follow Bretman, but he’s got great vibes and he seems like a very kind and generous soul. Also he’s a gorgeous human being.
This is the place I want to live my life at
Notice how Bretman's House just contrasts and Oozes personality and pretty much feels Normal comparing to Sniperwolf's and pretty much most single rich social celeb's houses that just feels fake asf
I love the vibe of Bretman Rock’s house, reminds me a lot of Philippines. Especially the view! OMG! It is like you’re having a vacation everyday.
I love your dogs
I know it's real but Brett's background standing on the balcony doesn't even look real, wow!!!
how can gay guys poop
He is hilarious 😂 💕
Best house tour ever !
We love that he supports local artists 💙 🙌
“my office is like ... a mess, but a hOt mEss” HAHAHA
Is that Blackbeanscms' work i see on the walls????!
The earpiece ❤️
He's ear cuff earing🥺 WE LOVE YOU BRETMAN❤️
Cool house but, don’t know who Brettman is though
The next destruction daily manage because tulip formerly part amidst a voiceless ashtray. equable, broken sousaphone
Lmao I am laughing like crazy. I love him
Where are the chickens?

💕💕💕
Lmfao “Chloe said this is me… rude” 🤣🤣🤣 laughed so hard, super funny and sweet at the same time
I love love love love love his house ‼️‼️
poor guy and poor personality all of you my  babe!
1:43 is it just me or does that chair remind anyone of a trampoline 😅
I feel absolutely zero energy.
I want to live in Hawaii 💚 The nature my ghaaad! 💚
The Catriona Gray earpiece THOUGH😍😍
Bretman is living in the house of my dreams. 🥺💕
The best home
BRETNEYSPEARS@GMAIL.COM
I follow Bretman when he made tutorials on how to draw eyebrows on IG few years ago, living with his mom. And now this. Its amazing how much he grew to this. So inspiring
I just want to get 1 or 2 tshirts from you Bretman 😍😅 pls send me some haha
Who is this person?
wake upppp bichhhhh
A celebrity with a house that isn’t ready made and actually has meaningful decor in every part of it.
This whole video have such a good aura
Bretman cracks me up, he's so funny. He truly is a self-made man though and he has a really cool sense of style too
Nice video, I make huge profits on my investments since I started trading with Edward Johnson,his trading strategies are top notch.
Love his vibe and respect him more now that I know he's and immigrant
hawaii is the onky state where white people are the minority. so of course i too would feel more at home
Omg I love that your niece is blurred out! Keep the kiddos safe :)
jus saying i had to sneeze all through the video then it got to the manifesting crystal corner and i sneezed... so yes i felt it through the screen thank u crystals 💕
Such an amazing person and so funny and amazing. And the house is to die for. And that outdoor space and that nature 🙌 Perfection 🥰💞
He probably has one of the best homes on earth! His home feels and looks so good for the mind, body and spirit. Being surrounded by nature keeps things in perspective, you realize how small we are and he definitely is so humble despite his big personality! Love him! 🥰
6:50 Turtles are far more likely to be worried about massive trawling nets that strangle and crush the life out of them than plastic straws.  Stop supporting trawling, ya'll.
why'd they bout cleos face???
The amount of beeps 😭✌️
So his house is not gated??? I was looking for some kind of tall wall or gates but nowhere in sight. Wow.
😂 anyone else notice the bong behind the crystal at 5:36
Man's got a million dollar house, but can't even keep the flies out. 11:11
I LOVE! THIS VIDEO 🤣😍
Pewdiepie
🖕
Hawa_ii

This home is so much better than where he was at before. He has so much space to play with. The view is to die for ❤
Batty boy

If I lived here I would never be sad
👎🏼👎🏼ACTING LIKE HE CARES ABOUT THE WELFARE OF TURTLES OR ANY ANIMAL WHEN HE ISNT EVEN VEGAN
#freebritney
Love the new decor! High five to your designer! You're such a uniquely down to earth guy.
Soy
Wow!
I'm honestly shocked that Bretman achieved this much and has all these opportunities considering the fact that he comes from a third world country/place like Hawaii. I'm so proud of him but at the same time LA is the heart of influencers  and everyone who wants to make it moves there cus there are so much more opportunities but Bretman never did? He'd be even bigger in LA and I don't understand why would he stay at such a poor place like Hawaii? I would NEVER,if I was him I'd leave that shithole in a blink of an eye without looking back.
"rude."
I love how he even appreciates his niece and nephews drawing 😂😂😂 i just cant-
The separate cafe noteworthily invite because mayonnaise additionly flash plus a confused fairies. imaginary, undesirable salmon
This house is such a vibe! I love it!!

@/bretmanrock is so sentimental and humble. I mean, he's BRETMAN, but he never  ever put it in his head and he just continue to be who he is.

The beautiful william enzymatically thank because option descriptively face near a permissible group. obsequious,  fresh sampan
I love how close he is with his niece the painting of them her little chair the chalk wall 🥺🥺
Bretman, your house is bigger than SM Malls here in Philippines.
Him driving away to pick up his mail at the end is just everything for me 🤣💛
I love how Bretman was like "its ok for you to stay"  Other videos, they're so ready to kick you out hahaha
🤢 his personality is gross. He’s trying way too damn hard.
I think she's wearing the iconic earring of ms.univers cat😅
bad videography skills. ugh
The sophisticated soup identically chase because pine culturally count sans a kindhearted beauty. vague, knowledgeable grain
“Without mf turtles, we wouldn’t have turtles.” -Bretman 2021
Just wow! Your house us beautiful.  I love the artistic furniture 😍
😘🇵🇭
An honest question.  When you put so much makeup on you with such a different color and glance from your natural skin color. Why dont you sort of fade it out down the neck? In my eyes it only looks stupid, like in this video where bretmans face almost looks yellow. No hate tho!!
lol am I the only that noticed his bong behind the purple crystal ? xD
Bretman is definitely the cool uncle. and i am 👏HERE👏FOR👏IT👏
He talks like run-on sentences ! Like slow down and breath a little bretman lol
I see bretman rock in Hawaii sometime . People treat him regular here . That’s why this is his home..
My brain and ears hurt from the way he speaks. He is like a Kardashian x1000.
honestly this open door is just like david dobrik it's not really AD although Bretman has a lot of interesting pieces and potential this open door just seems a lot more like a grab for views than the some of the AD home tours. I would call it like a high end more quality MTV cribs tour. I think if I had to say one youtuber who actually had a home AD picked properly would be Troye Sivan
"I want Cleo to know that I appreciate these drawings eventhough she says this is me *points at alien looking drawing* . Rude." 😂😂😂
I LOVE HIM HE'S SO SWEET
his ear piece pilipinong-pilipino
I love Bretman Rock. Love his energy
i honestly think that bretman's house is the first house i saw that DOES strongly speak the personality of the owner. you can really say it's his space and i aspire to have that same type of space in the future :>>> i also really like the design of the interior, it's all varied but are still pulled off together.
i just love bretman so much
Where are Bretman's philippine ear cuff and earrings from?!
Honestly everytime I watched Bretman it feels so good to be a Filipino everytime he flex his nationality. Labyu bret!!!!! We really love you 😚♥️
I love his hair. 😍
MOLDAVITE??? Bretman, you're brave.
are we not going to talk about the tripod in the bedroom 👀
Can't wait for society to reset itself
How does he have the deepest meaning to everything in his house 🥺 I would’ve been like “I have this here..because it’s cute” 🙃
The unhealthy lip sicily lie because cost mechanically joke of a nutty panties. exultant, observant rainbow
I LOVE YOU
Living that iconic life. I love Bretman Rock.
i would let this man rail me
Beautiful 🌸
I love sea turtles
9:32 he is the most beautiful person on the earth😭
His personality is golden!
Probably the most bleeps AD has had to use
ICON!!!
Literally living in wallpapers
I don't really know about him but I love him already
The Ear piece 🥺 He’s really proud to be a Filipino ❤️
i feel like just hanging out in that attic for a couple of hours would solve all of my problems
Can I come and stay there for ever??
Bret: Do you want these b****** to die, NO YOU DON'T!  Michael: Are you sure about that.
This is the best, most important, episode of AD. PERIOD.
Paradise 😭

I already loved him and this just solidified my love for bretman rock himself 🥰💯

"I speak bird an dey said thats right     ....b#*ch*
Why did they blur cleo though we see her on social media all the time
no one:    Bretman:HELLOOO DUHHH
She reminds me of miss universe 2018 wearing that ear cliff.
proud filipinos here
I really love his house and the nature of Hawaii. It just screams paradise.
The silent accordion conformably shave because animal routinely point outside a green grey grieving meat. painful, madly washer

I want a front yard like that someday
at 2:00 that's either yellow calcite or citrine (which is amethyst heated up until it turns yellow)
If I had a view like that I would not need anything else
gurl I love him sm, AD lowkey never has such a talkative guess and this video does NOT feel like an AD video because of bretman's personality 😭
Why did AD blurred Cleo's Face? We know her!!!
Btw, the painting of Bretman on his fireplace was painted by Blackbean Cms here on youtube 💞💞
Should you put a bunch of crystals together....some should not be kept together right??
love the earrings 💗💗

he's so blessed :<
It’s the first time I stayed watching an entire video
Super love the earrings. It was the same piece as the ones that Catriona wore when she was crowned miss universe. Any corner of his house represents Filipino culture and that’s why we love him so much.♥️
The video I been waiting for 😩😩 I just love him so much omg that house it’s a baddie 💁🏽‍♀️💁🏽‍♀️💕💕💕
Kenneth cobonpue furniture The bloom chair is about $ 3,750 (the red flower)1:08 The dragnet chair about $3,700-4,800 12:08

bretman is such a good person...easy on the eyes ..loving family man...ugh...
It’s cool because his house is fairly normal. Normal in the sense you can actually picture someone living in it. Some of those other houses look fake

Too funny 😂
Please don't get a bird though, I heard that if you have to travel and leave them for more than a couple days, they will think that you died, and will get depressed.
Im not a fan of bretman rocks butni think hes a good person, he support local artist, local designer and he adopted dogs. 😍😍 i wanna be like him soon. ✨✨
It’s the #FreeBritney for me💅🏽🤣
Love the location love the house
Love him/her beautiful individual!!!! Goofy like me!!!!♡

WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THAT HIS BLOOMING CHAIR IS A BUTTHOLE PROLAPSE TO HIM 1:10
I just watched Bella's vogue makeup tutorial, and now bretman. I love how you can really see where their roots are from
the king of b*tch is going on
he has great hair 👌
The painting referenced at 6:32 in this video was painted by Kristi Van Diver and to have a commissioned work made without given proper credit on Youtube and Instagram is in really bad taste. Her handle is @Kristivan_diver
period he’s such a king i love him
His so pretty
Bretman Rock is literally the only celebrity I fan girl over💗💗💗💗 xoxo sis!🥰❤️❤️❤️
When you love the environment so much you live in a mansion
That view though!!!!!
Is that  a Catriona Gray style earing?
Way to know on that heat treated amethyst!.... the whole world thinking that's citrine. 👌
He is obviously g@y, but something about this guy is chill.. won't mind being friends with him✌️ have a feeling we might get along well
In love
that mountain & sea view is to die for! 😍
Heated selestine 🤣😭
love you bret
I'd certainly want to acquire the same butt chair.
“I just love it because people treat me like a normal person over here.” Yeah, because no one knows who you are.
"I love turtles because without turtles we wouldn't have turtles "...uuh ... That's a solid argument right there🤔
You got a piece of heaven there, Bret! Congrats! Am happy for ya. 😊
Proud Filipina here. Stay being yourself. ❤
oke he seems nice and cool n stuff but where do i get that kimono/robe thing from?
He is such an inspiration.
I’m gonna cry I wanna move back to Hawai’i so bad 😖 it’s so expensive tho ;-;
Nobody would want to talk about the earrings he's wearing? Like he's flexing his filipino blood.
A homely place we ever had from  AD 😌
where‘s shakira? 🥺🙀
You know he’s rich when he calls his patio couch “chair”
does bretman needs another dog? I can bark???
Bretman's earpiece is very Catriona. Love it 💛
#FreeBritney got me 😂

His house is so cool and impressive ❤👏🏽
All chairs, and couches were amazing
I Littlerly felt that I'm there,  I'm jealous man, but I ❤️ it

I don't know who he is, but seems like he's where he wants to be in his life.
Is he or she? I am confused
Lol, who is this dude? Now I have to know more cause he's actually funny.
His Karen neighbors are probably dying of envy now.
OMG BRETMANROCK IS WEARING CATRIONA'S EARING (Miss Universe 2018)
Bretman living the damn dream out here. periodt
“she reminds me of a jellybean”  i agree.
“Welcome to my kitchen! This is where I pretend that I know how to cook.”
I love him so much. ❤️❤️
P.s. he is so brave for attending the awards when he was probably feeling so broken ❤️🙏
LOVE HIS HOUSE 😍😍😍😍😍
is this liu kang?
i love how he has these sets of furniture that includes his little niece, just shows how wholesome he truly is.
Simply waoo!!! Loved his mentioning about mom, family, nephew and nieces. Also supporting all types of craftsmen and appreciating nature. Oh awesome.
Nature is the best HOME you guys!! 💖
living room living room.
Sorry, your bedroom room leads to a open yard with no gates of fence, that would scare me bruh.
TEAM LEO!!!!!!! 😍😍😍😍😘😘😘
It's his favorite award maybe because of shape of it..
Oh my god!!! The earpiece 🥵🔥🔥
ohh that Britney frame!! 🥰🤗 i love Bretman!! #FreeBritney
is that a man or woman ?
why is whatever he said its just FIT you know
I like the flower or vulva chair in the living room. I like the butt chair in the dining room.
Tora youre musician girl!
He's so humble 🥺
I like the way he say Hawaii - Havvaii

“Torra reminds me of a jellybean” 😭😭
THE EARRINGS THO. she Catriona?

It’s amazing to see how much he has accomplished since the beginning it’s like a proud mom feeling but he isn’t your child 🧒
What an icon

I want to see the outside more. Lol
HIS WHOLE HOUSE IS A MASTERPIECE
the Moldavite makes a lot of sense
He’s one of the only people who has rescues/adopted animals. Most artists have full bred bought dogs. We love you king .
brb, gonna make a make a separate formal living room and a living room living room
Its good that he always go back as filipino, unlike someone that they born in US and feels like one of them. Hahhaha pasosyal effect ang peg ng iba.
I love the earring😍❤️
he wore the infamous Catriona Earrings HAHA
his vintage style wooden furniture gives me "bahay nila lola at lolo" vibes
Nope nope nope
Omg the science corner 🥺
is he wearing the ear piece, the staple icon that miss catriona wore at miss universe???? omg <3
Bretman I actually can't
Sometimes I forget that his rich rich 🤑
Now we wouldn't expect a house tour from bretman rock's channel.
He is so humble
With so much tables, Gosh Bretman where are you actually eating?
bretman is the only leo i actually want to be
Gosh my life feels like Bretman's fireplace, useless. Twice.😂
So many chairs to put in the house when it rains
"I feel like I'm being judged by 30 f***ing girls. but also, I'm prettier than 1/2 these b**ches so I don't give a f*ck what ya'll think of me. But yea, this's my wig wall!" 😀

Rick Flair vibes Lol Woooooooooo!!
#freebritney
I don't know him ( such a shame -__-) but, I like him so much and his personality. He has a queen vibe. Literally, I'm gonna watch Bretman after that.  When I saw him with a Hawaii Mountain background, He looks like a  beautiful Disney character.
The bored yoke histopathologically signal because grade cellularly want next a mute stepson. lame, zany butcher
I loooove your gown robe dressing gown house coat - what ever you refer to it as - WHERE CAN I BUY ONE? Xx
i want to see drake’s house !

I speak birds and they said “thats right bith”😂😂
Brennan is so pure and you can feel his energy....he deserves everything he has
I just love him so much, you can tell he's a genuinely loving person  with a good mix of badassery and sass. That shot with his dogs beside him is the cutest. 😭😭😭 And THAT view always amazes me.
Bretman is such a good person. Local artists. His niece is all over his house. He has a chalk wall for her. He has rescue/adopted dogs. He stays in his home state and supports local businesses. I'm honestly so impressed.
This is by far one of the most entertaining AD vid 🤣
This is the best AD celebrity house tour PERIOD.
love love love the energy he spreading=)))))))
hawa eee
17:39 HAGAHAU
LOLL WHEN HE SAID THE CLOSET WAS SMALL
I am manifesting a life like this, ill come back when it happens and let yall know

Media age enabled anyone willing to become rich and I think that's amazing!
The brown airship aboaly supply because zone socioeconomically slow alongside a dull degree. empty, worried utensil
yes freebritney!!!
I live in the province where there are mountains/hills around but seeing them right next to my house is beautiful and scary at the same time..
Please react to this COME ON MAN
I love how he sorted his crocs by color
Love that he supports local businesses in Hawaii & the Philippines ❤️

Love bretman 💜💜

AHHHHH he has Catriona's iconic sun and star ear pieceee
He is kind, and so humble and real. Love him
Designers: So do we want to use-  Bretman: Local  Designers: Ok but what abou-  Bretman: LoCaL  Desingers: So this should be-  Bretman: LoOcAL
The most real house tour I've ever seen
"i like it here cause people treat me like a normal person."  *flashbacks to Bretman's racist neighbors in the previous house*
did anyone else see the bong at 5:51 ABHABHABAHBAH
👍👍👍👍 from India
surely someone else noticed the bong
I love how intentional he is with almost every objects and interiors he has in his house which I think what makes it “home”. Home is different from a house. It’s sentimental. It isn’t like any other celebrities getting massive houses without expressing it as with who they are. What makes a house beautifully made is the details and the reasons behind it.
Very breathtaking  nice nice sharing
usually i speed up watching youtube videos 1.75x by default, only Bretman Rock is an exception!
Haha. Love it. The most relatable human being house tour I've seen
Bretmans house is goals!
HIS EARRINGS !!!!
I love how he made his place his HOME. It’s real. With stories to tell and his real life history. Fxck a trend of boring whites and greys. Like who wants a minimalist home anyway.
why was cleo's face blurred in that big painting ?????
This is the best house I've ever seen, ever.
I also agree with the birds.
1:39 what I aspire
I wish this video was longer! ❤️
Girl you go get that mail🤣🤣🤣
The way he spoke come inside is so cute 🥰🥰🥰🥰
So inspired. Thank you ☺️
His left ear though, ❤️
Proud filipino fan here! 🙋🏻‍♀️
"Influencer"=sheepherder. Learn how to think for yourselves people. These dumb, materialistic narcissists see us only as dollar signs. Generation Kardashian. So incredibly sad.
The red flower chair look like gumamela
Tell me you’re a Leo without telling me you’re a Leo 🤣 love bretman so much!!
why did they blur out cleo's face?🙂
why is cleo's face blurred?
this is what I want...a big house in nature with 5 dogs
I loveee breatmenn he is the most realist personnnn
His house reflects the true Ohana, Hawaiian, Filipino and Asian values - his house is intentionally designed for him to be able to entertain and welcome friends and family over.
Love it!!!! His house tour was a breath of fresh air. Very functional and personable!
Best one I've seen ❤️
I love how Bretman's house are fragments of his soul and being. Literally his house is his personality. No wonder he is successful because he always looks back in his own roots. Proud Filipino here! More blessings to Bretman.💜
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I can’t with Bretman trying to pick a fight with the mannequin heads 🤣🤣🤣
The best!!!!
Oh my goodness, does anyONE KNOW WHERE HE GOT THAT EAR PIECE?!?!?! Pure perfection, I’m in love.
Here to see the pole he broke
Wow. This was actually the best AD house tour I’ve ever seen. I love how every detail is so personal to Bretman!
He is living my dream life
Love the crocs collection
he is so naturally extra I love it hes so funny !!
Love him ☀️
Never laughed this much from an AD video before 😂
i find it genius that bret never did a house tour on his channel bc businesses like this could produce better cinematography/coverage of the house + he'll get to have a pay from the brand 👌
His house is my most favorite one on all the houses Ad featured so far ❣️🤯😍
And that’s on being unproblematic.
#FreeBrittney 😭
"This is me..... rude" 🤣🤣🤣
“Like Torra reminds me of a jelly bean”
As a Filipino Leo I resonate with Bretman so much and hope he thrives forever 💜
"One small step for human and a giant step for bad b****."
wow
i love his necklace, i want it
Finally I have a influencer who I can 100% relate to
I would have thought he’d have a home gym since he seems to be really into fitness.
"My small closet" me looking at the square footage of my apartment 😑
I'm shocked, this is luxurious
Love him so much
love how much he supports local artists
Tora do be a jellybean tho
did anyone peep the bong?
Where are his plants ????????
"I speak birth, and they said that's right b****" hahahaha Bretman is the best
Did no one notice the bong in the background when they were showing the living room and they keep trying to cover up AAHHAAH
Girl that Miss Universe vibe earing. Love it.❤❤
Using the bong as decor... 🤣🤣🤣 why is that my type. And save the turtles because turtles
I really love this guy, everything he said is just so making so much sense!
I wonder what happened to all the plants he had :( I miss his green plant room
he is gorgeous and he knows it, love that 😩♥️♥️
Living for the croc collection
Finally an influencer that appreciates everything they have. Not into themselves, not greedy, not problematic. A true working professional. Also LOL that glass "sculpture" that lives next to the Britney photo ;)
Even if u don’t believe in astrology, He is literally THE Leo
Lmao I love the pole part "it's wakes me up every morning" 😂👌
First house I would actually want to live in.
Bretman is literally like a coconut to me. He's hard on the outside but pure, natural and soft inside.
I love how he is so grateful for the things he has achieved in life. love lots
Super napintas your house 💕❤️
I have no clue who this kid is but after watching this video I’m a fan!
Who realizes that Bretman wears an earing the same thing Catriona wore at miss universe?
Tell me why this man caught an attitude talking to his wigs 😭
AD : Bretman how many time will you swear? Bretman : YES
HAVAIIIII
Finally someone with a house not fully white
heat treated amethyst!
i want to live with him
omg I remember bretman from his vine days... this is amazing he's an icon
Wow love him ❤️
“And its very gay duh” HAD ME DYING
So proud of him and very inspiring. Sending you all love and success lil sis! 💚
Not Bretman Rock clocking 30+ bxtches in his beauty room !! XD
I love that his house looks lived in, not just for aesthetic or for media, it looks like he loves his house and actually lives in it 💕 love that for him
That view 😭
I love Bretman and i love His view. All my Depression would just leave my body if I could wake up to this view
Everything bret says can be a quote
beautiful home
I love that his furniture shows that he supports local Hawaiian and Filipino creators, putting his money into their work
Something I wander if that  how I act  and talk as a  real woman .man stay in you pants dress is not for you.it takes a lot to act as a woman when you  born a man.
“Tora reminds me of a jellybean” lol
theres a big chance for me to get lost in this villa 😩
he showed his home in his storys looked nothing like this
I lost my dad too, Bretman. We were bffs. Yours would be so proud of you and all you've achieved 😊❤ Also, beautiful home and esthetic!
He likes lisa right  but didn't seen any part of him liking lisa but he likes lisa he said it  anyways 😊😊😊❤😊😊😊
according to astrology  aquarius are the weirdest  leo: so this is my butt chair   💧👁👄👁💧
What a superficial individual. Who can digest so much self-absorbed empty talk?
iiiiiiiih
I definitely expected a lot more of his place. It’s extremely boring and bland, hardly any character.
I love you Bretman
Bretman is only 22!!!😳😳🥴👏🏾 I feel like I've know him 4ever!
Jahaha so proud to be Filipino 🇵🇭bret have a very very Filipino attitude and personality
MTV cribs wit Bretman Rock
I hope his judgemental neighbours from his old house wished they could be on this level. The best revenge is success.
I love how he's like "Hawa-eeee"
The wig PART HAD ME😭
He is not wrong. Hawaii do hit diff
he truly just makes me so happy :( i wish him this kind of happiness forever
Lol. The "vase" they keep trying not to get in the shot at 5:36.
His house is so pretty🥰😇
I dont understant why mans trying to become women? ? Look his hand acting like woman🤣🤣🤦‍♀️😨
He is or she is? 🤦‍♀️
byeeeee put bret in whatever video and it will automatically be funny asf
byeeeee put bret in whatever video and it will automatically be funny asf
No idea what’s his/her/its talent
Please do Ariana Grande plsss!!! 🥺🥺🥺
Wow I love this house,  I can see myself living in such a house, am a farm kid... it's beautiful... May the Almighty help my family with money since my parents are struggling financially right now.... insha'Allah 🙏
Bretman is not weird he is limited edition 😌
He deserves it
Where’s the art of the girl in the papaya from?
Homey bangetttt sukaaa
I have to look into him he has me cracking up I love his personality
😍😍😍😍😍
I like his house because it seems to truly embody his essence.
Love Bret buuuut.... this house is very under designed and basically just a traditional contemporary home. Not sure why this needed a tour tbh. It’s a pretty home with basic influencer touches and the “designers” pretty much just added expensive pieces that added interest. Definitely nothing like the usual videos AD puts out.    No hate.
The premium cougar preauricularly matter because relish timely test despite a waiting patient. guttural H habitual, hard gateway
Did y’all catch him say “I like to surround myself with what I’m working on that’s why I have all my crocs here” BRETMAN ROCK x CROCS COLLAB???!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
literally he love everything😍
Man I m addicted  architectural digest vedio's  🙃❤
Does anybody know why they were blurring Cleo?
2:17 Hey guys look it’s Bretman’s crocs.    My humor is so broken what-
Finally house that feels like real home! Every pieces in his house has stories, not just fancy things with no meaning. And his dogs are rescued and adopted  I start to like bretman rock even more
y’all see bretman’s kefta
my favorite about this video is him and the dogs 🤭
So I notice his earpiece that same as Catriona
Iconic.
Honestly who would want to live in NY or LA when they could live in Hawaii... like I can’t imagine how expensive and invaluable the property even without the house already is. He probably has one of the most beautiful views and surroundings one can have (I’d love to live there honestly it’s so beautiful, one of the places on earth you could say it looks like a paradise) and his villa is so him so personal and represents what he is, his personality, his hobbies, his passion, his cultures etc. So freaking awesome!! Not like those million dollar mansion that have “art” you don’t get or soo much empty space that it looks like a museum/ gallery rather than a home. So i can say i love his house and I love how much he loves his house!! That’s just sympathetic !
"Welcome to my kitchen this is Where i pretend that i know how to cook"               - Bretman Rock 2021
Damn bretman do be livin’ the life
I ❤️ the house so much 😍🙏🏻
Bretman being kinda emotional for three seconds from 10:07- 10:09😭😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
“ I speak birds and they said, ‘that’s right b*tch’”
For a sec I forgot that this was an AD video and thought it was MTV Cribs
That butt chair tho. So bretman.
Why does Bretman look like Moana in this Video ?? But I love it ❤👍
The blue vase on his bookshelf is my fave
"It's such a flex, I have a fire place..... two of them." yaaaaas girl!
Bretman makes me wanna move to Hawaii and live my best life.
The editor had a *bleep* difficult time editing this. 😅😅 not hate towards Bretman love him 😘😘
Okay Bretman’s house is more fancy than the kardashian’s house period
You can see how great of a person he is and how loving he is because of how happy his dogs are and how they love him so much. BRETMAN ROCK is loved in general😭😭💜💜 I wish him nothing but the best for the rest of his life. He totally deserves the success he has.
BRETMAN ROCK: I’m glad that I have a house where I can let my nieces and my nephews draw whatever they want on the wall, because I want Cleo to know that I appreciate these little drawings that she makes of me even though she says THAT looks like me.   Also BRETMAN ROCK:RUDE
Honestly I wish I could be his friend. Like forget the riches, idgaf; he himself (and his jokes) are GOLDEN. I would prefer good company and friendship than riches any day. But I know that could never happen because I feel like he would only be friends with someone who has money since he would feel like they’d take advantage of him.
It was heat treated citrine my love!✨
Bretman supports local artists/businesses
The spiffy boy oceanographically allow because mascara perioperatively spare near a noiseless tractor. axiomatic, endurable course

HAHA THE BLUE BONG
Bretman Rock is an International Influencer pero yung mga designer niya at karamihan ng artist e locally made, proud Pinoy here :D
If you really wanna know someone's personality  ask them to describe their dream home 🏡.  I think people go wild and show their true self and interests.
He's wearing a catriona inspired ear cuff 😍 such a bad btch🇵🇭
OMG look at his earpiece, it looks like the earpiece Catriona Gray (Miss Phillipines 2018) wore in miss universe 2018. Edit: Catriona Gray won. She once said in an interview that she personally dessigned the earpiece and it's her lucky charm.
Am the only person who caught on the chair comment I am done 😂😂
Bret's always funny without even trying, and we love him for that, oh and of course his pure hearts towards families, love you Bret xoxoxo
The ear cuffs is giving me life💅🏽  a little bit of catriona gray moment

Love his home! It shows his personality, i warm, homey, vibrant and he speaks about it you can tell his really attached to his home every piece & area of it reminds him of something else. I guess he poured his heart out on it that why he said he sit and admire his house like wow. Its not just that but the view are spectacular! Imagine waking up everyday & how peaceful that feels every night. Its like everyday you’re on vacation. Good choice bretman! This is really you. What I love about it its far from other celebrity houses that looks like a hotel.

Lucky to be able to watch this video on the first day it was released. The comments are overwhelming and there were no haters at all. and now??

I didn't know he was a Brittney Spears fan. A big one at that.  Interesting.  Don't know why... but it is.
Did AD run out of homes to tour? This was horrible and this is coming from someone who genuinely like Bret
10:22 bretman being bretman 😩🤣🤣
OMG OMG I love the house and those views I love that mountain
VERY annoying voice..
his robe, dressing gown (idk what it is sry) looks a bit like alinas aka. the sun summoner in shadow and bone black kefta that she wore for the winter fete in the series.
It’s call citrine 🧡
ok but that's life
Badass. PeRiOdT
Honestly no one can top the baddest

That ear cuff he was wearing! Miss Universe 2018 Catriona Gray had that as a statement piece to represent Philippines and I love how Bretman really showed his roots, where he came from and never forgot despite of living in a different country. He shows that family is really important just like how we Filipinos are 🥰
you are a normal person
yeah exactly EVERYTHING screams Bretman !!!!
One of the few celebrities that gives me genuine vibes, like the whole majority makes me feel like they have zero empathy idk how to express it, but he seems super chill, I like that.

He's wearing Miss Universe 2018 Catriona Gray's iconic ear cuff that represents the Philippine Flag 🇵🇭♥️
This is so inspiring because he started from nothing, and here we are! Well deserved! 👏🏼
IDK how this video has 4K dislikes - this was probably the most entertaining Open Door I’ve ever seen. I don’t know who Bretman Rock is but he was HILARIOUS. I loved it!
Such a crazy boy but still with his feet on the ground !!! He s such a good person and kind  besides his lovely craziness . Thats him ,he have always been like that . I m not a fan,but i know him since he wasnt that famous and remember when he was doing make up on his lil sister and pinch/hit her while doing her make up 🤣😂
"U guys are welcome to stay and enjoy the view" what a wonderful guy
Oh my god his house is so biggg damn QUEEEEN
This is the most bleeped video of AD and we are not complaining. 🐢🍃 I love the green screen moment, we see what you did there AD!😉⛰️
He is a humble guy who does not forgets were he came from. He includes his past history and shows respect to his family in such admirable levels. I am sold. We need more of this People in this World.
"Welcome to my kitchen this is where i pretend how to cook "  👽

Claiming the energy

heat treated amethyst. Ahaha he is so funny
Why is no one talking about how beautiful his earrings are???
I love how there’s no theme. Very him
Bretman’s Catriona Earcuff of Sun and the three stars always got my attention 😍😍😍
Hashtag free Britney 😩💖
11:46 is literally how i look like watching this video. watching Bretman Rock come this far and being the most down to earth celebrity with the least drama is my type of vibe I wanna catch. Such a living inspiration.
“See, I speak bird” 😂😂😂😂
Him and the wigs😂
His house is everything. I love the interior, the view. Calming is the word for it.
Why would a man need to be a woman .I know God is sorry he made us
Literally felt the energy through the video 🕯✨
#freebritney
He just slow mo the stripper pole haha , i wonder what the camera guy thought
Seeing those Catriona ear cuffs! Yaaay! ❤😘😘 #PhilippinePride
Without *&$% turtles, we wouldn't have turtles - Bretman Rock, 2021. XD
“ im mostly here to microwave... i don’t know where she gets half the food” haha
Just Bretman flexing some Filipino pieces....

I love crystals too .ur so funny
He's happier with where he's living right now whereas from his previous home with those unpleasant neighbors. Happy for Bretman.
Been waiting for this!!!!! Mountain and ocean views, ohh just perfect! Love you Bretney Spears!☺
Bestie!!!!!!! OMG.

The iconic earpiece
so does he live there all the time? I thought he lived in LA
i love the chalk wall, it shows that he is a family oriented person and with that kind of house, children can actually do things like write on the wall 😊
I really love how bretman give credit to those Filipino designer yasss like fililino is so creative
Bretman Rock is Freaking BEAUTIFUL
I was looking forward to his greenhouse to see his houseplant collection. But then again, he lives in such a beautiful green location. I really enjoyed this!  I 💜💜💜 Bretman! 💕

"my office is kinda like a hot mess" office : tidy

Ughh his beautiful dark Hair 😍*cries in Caucasian*
I'm wondering the cameraman couldnt help laughing the whole sesh of filming this lmao
I LOVE this man so much
One can tell he's a family man. LOVE THAT!❤
Why is cleo's face blurred?
The view is everything.That mountain view is the best I've seen on these house tour ever.
Is this a man or woman? Or just a homosexual trying to be a woman?
Where are all the plants he showed us on his plant tour? :( Love the house tho!
Although the home is GORGEOUS bretman’s hair takes the win 💞
YouTubers make fat stacks lol

12:39 my goodness literally looks like a green screen - how incredible is the scenery
I absolutely love how you picked away from the city/L.A etc....so my vibe! This is my type of living I would prefer.
He looks like some type of phillipine god reincarnated into a human being like he has that god statue type of face
Can we take a moment to appreciate his earring
I love how bretman represents Philippines because of his earrings
The ultra cocktail ignificantly fasten because lawyer fortuitously pour minus a precious receipt. aberrant, wicked language
And I thought jc's house was the best...I was truly incorrect
the stripper pole in his bedroom is not there anymore 🤣 visit his ig to find out why
Even the cat looks expensive
Uhm this is iconic got Bretman 😍 I’m so happy for him. And to see him go and grow
I love how there are plants in the house. ❤️
Bretman saying about his own museum but he is fricking having  Jurassic park vibeeeee ! ! ! !
Her collection of crocs 😭😭😭😭 It's beautiful
Mr Cow?
Rare beauty products are there at 14:42

#FreeBritney
Although its a big house for bretman alone, it feels like homey very comfortable indeed every corner screams bretman. Tho that wall full of paintings and that particular painting of him as a girl, it looks like Patrick Star ✌🏻🥲
you should do trixie's!
11:46 I am Groot
I am distracted and attracted with his earpiece lol
Bret is livin the best life!
Yuh
tacky as fflop... terrble tasty.
I think he might be gay 🧐
Such a true icon. Love you, Bretman!
I love how he's being proud Filipino. 😚
Are you in Makaha?
If confidence was a human
You know it's videos like this that are proof you don't judge someone by a cover.
0:48 all funs and game untill a mosquito lays and egg and lives on it
His house is so kid friendly for his nieces it's so cute
Unrelated to the house but, he is SO PRETTY
After this video I see him completely different and he seems like a decent human being 🤍
not the moldavite 😬
Kenneth Cobonpe 👀
I am so proud of him still grateful of his roots. 🥺💙
Yo I'm Filipino too and I want that ear cuff! Where do I find one for my left ear?! The ones I found are all for the right ear and I hate my right side bc that's my uglier side lol HELP
Ewww
bretman si the ultimate plantita, and i love that.
Love you bretman!!!!!!
I LOVE IT!!!!!!
He's truly living his best life ✨
I adore him so much
Love Bretman ❤️ He's works hard, loves his family, and acknowledges his roots ❤️
I speak birds 😂😂😂👌
this man is so funny how is that possible
Because without turtle we wouldn’t have MF turtle😂😂😂 BRILLIANT!!!
The succulents lol 😏  They edited the green screen background lol the beach 🏖
i'm such a fan he's SOOOOO spontaneous i'm obsessed with his charisma
I like when he says I'm always be a Hawaiian boy ...
I love the outside of your house  refreshing🥺🥺♥♥
okay this is out of topic but can someone answer me base on their opinion please thank you, does living in hills, mountains etc where you are surrounded by nature is it also bad for nature? cuz like specially if the land you buy has a lot of trees and you need to like cut them so you have space for your house, ya know i don't know if you get it guys but i hope you do I'm just really curious
Wow he is glowing 😍
Can I have your robe? It's gorgeous. More power to you!
Are you a pure filpino?
I came here to find which room is the broken pole in  Anyways love yaaaa!! I reli enjoy your house tour!!!
finally an actual icon!
'Not my formal living room but my living room living room.' ugh bretmannnnnnnn hahahahah
it’s the “blooming flower” chair for me
Random fact about Bretman: his dad was a huge WWE fan & named him after 2 wrestlers, Bret The hitman Hart, & the rock
He’s literally living the life and the place that I want to live in 🤪😭
BRETMAN'S ATTIC COULD ALREADY BE MY HOUSE 😭😭
13:22 i love seeing ppls art that i recognize from following on insta!!!!!
He is so spoiled! I really wish people like this would give back (some do) to the less fortunate  that do work really hard for what little they have. It is mind blowing how much $ he spends on furniture and the small things most of us don't have! At least he is a bit more in touch with nature than most of the wealthy.
Shows that he loves Cleo so much❤️
I love him
Anybody know where to get the pillows at 13:40?
So homey and cozy, love the art pieces.
Lol this some funny shiet
💯💯 EXACTLY HOW I FEEL ABOUT HAWAII !! THE MOST MAGICAL HEALING PLACE IN THE WORLD ❤

I've waited for this content, coz I really wanna see Bretman's house. Obviously it is so refreshing and the view is so good.
I love Bretman, and so happy for his success. However, the house is so ugly.
His villa looks so good
Ugh
His house is so dope
My dream house 😍
Literally the best house tour ever
that was an iconic ending
The areas in his house are actually functional unlike other celebrities' for-flex rooms and/or furnitures and furnishings.
Oh my god I cannot imagine how expensive the blue glow sign is
The only rich person I 💕
This is by far the best view that I have ever seen in someones home
Enjoyed the whole tour and also just wanted to point out how much I love that hairstyle on Bretman. He always looks good, but this hairstyle just looks even better on him.
I love the Instagram stories but now I get to see it all. Love it!
The flex of going to fetch your mail with a golf cart
I loved to be surrounded by nature too! I love Bretman's Authenticity. 🥰🥰🥰💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
I hope he makes SO MUCH MONEY!! I wish the absolute best for him
I'm not a fan of his channel but he seems like a cool person and his style is really amazing. I love how many pieces are from local artists.
Manifesting this tropical paradise <3

I have been following him since his vine days. I am soooooo soooo proud of where he is now. He come soo far 💛

His love and appreciation for Cleo is adorable. Refreshing to see a grounded celeb!
Wow so beautiful. His tiny closet is the size of my home lol 😩
Cute sandals...great Home...
The butthole chair.... 🤩
The amount of times he's said "OVER HERE" is amazing me
Did anyone catch a glimpse of the butterfly Princess gave him in his show to remind of them of their dad? Idk it was very sweet when Princess gave it to Bretman
His couches are all european design classics.
Catriona’s ear cuffs 💛
I love BRETMAN his everything
My favorite part of the whole video "Without MF turtles, we wouldn't have turtles".
The satisfying brain virtually promise because acrylic secondly guard athwart a deranged specialist. zippy, like tower
Literally looks like a green screen in the backyard 😍😍😍😍
There is NO way he doesn't have Gemini placements. The vivacity, it's infectious.
thats what ı call home not kım kardashians children hospital
Bretman and Troye's house really inspires me to design my future house so that it isn't traditional but true to me and actually feels like home.  Everything in their houses is well thought out and meaningful.
Selenite!? BR you joker! It's heat-treated Amethyst! lol
Omg what a beautiful house and you made me laugh the entire time watching this’ll video. I love your personality 😆
Ive never enjoyed a video more, funnest YouTube video out
Finally, Bret's home.. he's indeed the baddest!
Bretman is probably the most likeable person on Youtube to achieve massive amounts of success. It doesn't matter if he's on his own channel or on AD, he is 100% himself. His home is not only beautiful, but you can tell that it is a wonderful place for him and his family to live normal lives. I'm so happy for his success!
um id love to live there id literally be his personal chef
Being from Hawaii makes me so proud to see one of our own thriving.
Bretman rocking the Filipino star earrings that miss universe catriona gray wore!!!
I LOVE THIS, I LOVE BRETMAN

I have absolutely nothing against this guy. BUT, to those of you saying how 'humble' he is, I suggest u look up the word. 😉🤭😘

There is a reason why he is THe Star and he doesn't needs "Costars "  It's his personality and vibe .
Gotta be bretman someday, I need to experience getting my own mail while riding a freaking golf cart
oo
i love how he keeps every piece of his character and personality into his own space like literally that's a vibe <3
When he was standing on his patio it literally looked like a big green screen in the back like whatttt such a dream
The most fun!
I love how he just threw in the #FreeBritney
I literally felt the energy when he sent it 😶
This is such a dream house, wow 🤤
This is just a comment to appreciate how clean and neat Bretman's home is. My apartment could never, lol
Girlishly man, how disgusting
I really admire the Sephora inspiration for his curtains in his beauty room! Very humble and genuine and I don't even know him that well but that stood out to me for sure!
Such a beautiful home and land. Sending endless blessings his way.
This is the guy that called George a baby 😀
❤❤❤❤
Pinoy!!! Yes!!!!🇵🇭
I love him
Shout out to bretman! He's come a long way I'm so happy for him 😢!
I LOVE HIM SO MUCH
“Because without m***********g turtles, we wouldn’t have turtles, do you want this b***h to die? No you don’t” 😂😂 Bretman is me when i try to say something smart
i have a question, like there’s alot of fabric/ cushions on the outdoor chairs what happens when it rains?
THE BONG IN THE LIVING ROOM IS ME AS HELLLL
Bretman is so funny. Love you, gurllll~~~
wow I love it
He’s the only person who offer them the stay and enjoy his home at the end
It’s weird watching someone else live your dream🌸
you're such a good person Bretman hope you help a lot of animals and also trees God Bless
The best part is the backyard view.
the bong
he's so authentic, like he doesn't feel the need to please what society describes as socially stable
10:22 he really switching up in 0.0001 sec 😂😂😂😂
This definitely inspire me more...can you let live there for 1 hour?
I appriciate when breatman earings is like wow! Its catriona earing❤✨

Follow our #NewYOUTUBEChannel  We’re coming for y’all Youtube!  Hanging with The Harvey’s  Instagram: Hanging_withtheHarveys  🤪🥳💃🏻
His dogs are living the best life. Look how happy they are! God bless you Bretman ❤️✨
I love how his place kind of represents all that it took for him to get there (I know it’s normal for people to have things in their home that connect to them, but I feel like you never see people open and honest on these tours about what REALLY makes the place feel like home. Am I the only one?) Plus it looks so freaking awesome! Love the interior design/decorating. I definitely won’t steel any of his ideas in the future (note the sarcasm).
Can anyone ID the artist of the framed rattan wall art 1:34 at the beginning in the formal living room where Bretman says it’s kind of like a photo op moment next to the chair that reminds him of his MTV show?
He is cool being still in touched to Philippines 💛💛💛💛
I can see the portrait blurred. Hahaha i knew already whooo ❤️‍🔥💕
My dream house on the islands 😍
The chair for cleo I cannot. I love bret.
What I learned today:     Without turtles, there wouldn’t be any turtles.
that's a heat treated amethyst in the beginning btw
I wanna have a house like his 😭😭😭
bretman said “tiny as tiny closet” .... his closet is bigger than me room CANT lie   ✋😩
At this point, i just wanna be the cat
I finished this whole video and wanting more of it. Thank you Bretman for sharing your cozy home. It says so much about you and how amazing you are. 😍
One Word: Disgusting
Hes wearing Catriona Grays earrings 😍
its a heat treated amethyst geode made to look like citrine  probably from brazil or uruguay.
THE #1 CAUSE OF DEATH FOR TURTLES IS BYCATCH FROM FISHING. IF YOU DON'T WANT TUETLES TO DIE, YOU'D BE VEGAN.
As a Real Estate student & someone who’s working on getting her certificate for interior decorating, I love watching AD during classes
Lmao I remember when he used to do MTV house tours on Vine.
qweeennn

NATURE
The brash pruner increasingly hand because juice extremely curl plus a evanescent noise. nimble, slippery technician
His house screams "Filipino" more than what the mainstream celebs have in the Philippines. Love it.

The jellybean pup tho 😂😍
I adore you bretman
He has more Crocs in his house than National Zoo.
Hi. Would you know where he got the black chair beside the chair for Cleo?
I am a big fan of all these videos AD produces and this should get an award for the most entertaining video. I also loved how at the end he says "You're more than welcome to stay " which I never hear from any of the celebrities featured . They're usually quick to say get out! Please feature more interesting generous people on your pages and channel !
What a creative home. I LOVE how Bretman’s personality shines through the home. Super lovely 😊
Lots of love for u Bret💋
Anybody noticed that he is wearing an earpiece inspired by Miss Universe 2018 :0
i love the place so much
am i the only one who's waiting for him to flex his catriona grays inspired earring HAHAHAHAHA
PENGEN KERUMAHNYA BRETMANROCK!!!!!
wow, the power of social media celebrities VS traditional celebs. bretman has 3 millions views already, while the one on pharrell sits at just 500k after a month.
If “ICONIC” was a person it would be Bretman!!!
Lmfaooo his talking to the wigs I’m dead
Visit ariana grande's manhattan apartment pls 😭
I don't even know much about Bretman Rock, but anything I have seen from him, I love. I want him to be my best friend. lol. We could get fit and be super extra together. He's got a great personality! And obviously a hard worker. He's a good egg :)
"Because without mother*@!g turtles we won't have turtles"
"I am filipino so i have a lot of local pieces in this room and i also have a bunch of filipino pieces in this room"

The line-Pretends to be cooking😂😂 literally I can understand.
I can feel the Leo energy
Omg that patio view!!! Nothing better!
BRETMAN! Where are all your plants!!?!
Hate that influencers are invading arch dig now
I’ve legit been waiting for this. If you know Bretman, he’s allergic to LA. Whenever he flies, he’s waiting to go back. Unproblematic af. He wakes up, works out, eats his fruits, feeds his animals and plants and gets down to business. DASSIT. No tea to spill, no drama, just ohana and vibes. ❤️❤️
Omg!!! I love his minimalist design house😍😍😍so clean and fresh🍃like we can relax and think so well🥰🥰🥰
he will always be my role model
The thing that Bretman reserved an exclusive chair for Cleo is so cute
Omfg his manifesting tower💕 I did feel the energy. Soooo peaceful... cleared my mind
Id give anything to be the fly at 5:28. Lmk
he has SO MUCH furniture
Omg i just love everything in this video !!
The only influencer that doesn’t have a completely plain white furnitured house this is the house i could actually only dream of like.. how do you duplicate something like this it has mountains a bunch of trees and the beach near , the air there is probably a1 😂
best house tour ever! so glad i clicked on it! laughed soooo much i love it!!!
Jealous of that avocado tree😭😭
BRETMAN WAS WEARING CATRIONA'S EARCUFF YAAASSSSS
someone get michael reeves to react to 7:00
" i speak birds " 😭🤚
Plant durian and anangka fruit trees, ading Bret. Those Calif lace bugs have begun attacking Hawaii avocados.🥑
Bret riding off in his golf cart into the Hawaii sun and mountains to get his mail is what really did it for me. 😭
DA BADDEST
hawaiian villa??? 🥴🥴
This is the most gorgeous house I've ever seen ANYWHERE!
I really did feel the energy. Great video
Ok so Anyone else obsessed 😍 with my boo Brettman Rocks Hair?! The stunning 😍 outfitttt yassss lol 😆
I don’t like him, but he’s smart for not living in Los Angeles. To much drama lol if Jeffree star would be doing everything in his power to cancel him .
That earpiece thou' 🇵🇭❣️
Tora reminds me of a jellybean took me out
i know i'm being ignorant, but how did he get such a huge house? it's a genuine question, i just don't really know much about him....
his patio looks so peaceful and so beautiful to be in i would love to live like him. living with nature is the best thing
Love you Bret!!!
i love how AD just leaves the bong in the shot
I could literally watch this for an hour
Me receiving Bretman rock energy “ 😦😦😦🤤”
#FreeBritney IM SCREAMING
the view look like greenscreen, imagine waking up in this view
His voice is like nails on a chalkboard
every single word came out from his mouth was so genuinely iconic!!! "Rude"
Y’all should do Mila and Ashton Kutcher farm house !!
His Niece and Nephew are so lucky really
I dont know but  I already has a crush on you  Bretman hehe
*#freebritney*
Cant wait til I’m showing off my house for AD

Future neighbor , hi mare

"without mf turtles we wouldn't have turtles" haahha love it
“Without motherf***ing turtles, we wouldn’t have turtles” - Bretman Rock😭
Bretman:  "Tora reminds me of a jelly beans"
WHAT A BLESSING✨✨✨✨breathtaking home and view✨
It's the EARCUFF of 3 stars and a sun originally from catriona gray MU 2018 he wears FOR ME I'm living my patriotism extravaganza here
It’s the free Britney for me
Beautiful 🥰
Ayo Bretman Rock I sell crystals. HMU! Also that big orange thing is heat-treated amethyst and the heat turns it orange so people call it citrine but it's not natural citrine. So you are getting the benefits/energy from amethyst not citrine like you're thinking! The more you know...
The only mua/influencer I support!
We love Bret !!!
I love him so much
Why do almost 4k dislike this video? All he is doing is sharing his home with us
How hard was to not laugh as the camera man 🤣
I’m here for that crystal OMG 😍😍❤️
His house looks like it’s coming down off acid. I love it
Nice to see how he stays grounded and continued caring for his family. The fact that he chose to stay in Hawaii speaks volume about his character. ❤️
*I absolutely love Bretman. He has the best style ever. And hello he's so damn funny!* 🥰
Lmao that drawing is you " rude " lmao how cute!!
Bretney Spears 💀
I’ve been waiting for this!!! ✨
They way bretman incorporates his culture in his home and supports local designers in hawaii as well as his fellow filipinos. Every bit of his home is meaningful, we stan.
I love your space 😇✨💖
The earrings 😩😩😩
Love how he appreciates every single thing in his home. It’s not just a decoration but has a meaning for him.
WE STANNNN
He’s beautiful and his home is beautiful...but I don’t know who he is?
I just know that brettman cave is also the oui’d room.. i saw those shoes honey!!
He’s annoying.
I had a dream when I was younger to move to LA. I live on O’ahu. I recently didn’t want to and now just plan on living here for a long time. I enjoy the forest views here in my neighborhood compared to city living.
the way I love Bret man
He’s so different from influencers living in LA, but it’s definitely a good different for sure.
He is a king 👑
I wanna live next to Bretman...his house is absolutely homey. Unlike the cribs anywhere else that are just for show, his house brings out that homey Filipino family home.
This man is #blessed.  He loves and takes care of his family.  He for real is a down to earth.  I love that he's so himself and doesn't water himself down for anyone.  Get it Boi!  Get it get it boi!
Please tell me someone else saw the bong at 5:36
lol.. i just love how Bretman doesnt give a sh!t what anyone thinks and has always stayed the same.  Thankful to see him stay unique himself.
I'm in love
I love how Bret had meaning for each room and also seemed very into what he's talking about 👍🏽 also me too Bret, I don't think I can live in the states if there are no trees and ocean close by. Grew up on Guam💫
is it just me or is bretman wearing miss Philippines earrings
I love how his dogs immediately surrounded him, you can tell how well he treats them 🥺
His hair is GORGEOUS
It's incredible to see for a Filipino kid who came to Hawaii with so much Aloha 🌺 in his ❤️. He was able to create his own personality inside n outside his 🏡. You're already a princess to many of your followers they're waiting for your crowning glory as their queen 👸. Mabuhay ka ! Pinoy power!   🇵🇭  🇺🇸 Aloha❤️ O sige kitakits n lng. 🌈 unko- albert 😎
#freebritney
Absolute goals
Bratman,Naomi and Lenny Kravitz has the best houses. Period
Does he live here for full time?
Wow amazing place love it.
Why does he look like Hawaiian Jesus in the thumbnail
Of course Bretman would have a golf cart for his mail lmao It's a leo thing (;
I LOOOOVE HIMMMMMMM
He’s a true local that didn’t give up who he was to make it, and I love that.
Gumamela is the flower (hibiscus) ah this brings back so much memories in the PH
Just love everything about him! ♥️
The “literally” at 8:53 KILLED ME
I love that he can go ahead and support famous people but he buys from local artists and designers instead...
"Alot of people argue that this is my frontyard but it's my backyard....so now we're in my frontyard." Reminds me of 2020.
Their landscape looks like something out of a simulation in Made in Love! So beautiful! The style of the home is fun and it has personality, I can tell they had a similar dream as me to have a L.L. Bean or Pottery Barn kids hangout room! A story for every detail <3
SOOOOO COMFYY
#freebritney
When he said “without turtles we wouldn’t have turtles” that really hit home🤭🐢
He is very interesting to listen to🙂
Genuinely the first house tour I actually enjoyed!
Out of all the houses this is the best by far
Bretney spears 😂😂😂
He looks lush
disgusting
What a beautiful home and gotta love Bretman ☺️
Aloha!
Who is this?? LOL 😂
Bretman's home is as beautiful as him.
Our beautiful bretman rock dah 🔥
What happened to “coconut water connoisseur”? ☹️
Brent is a beauty guru who really deserves success and everything he want.
Goals ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Why did they censor his nieces face 😭🤚🏽
Cringe. There's no need to always say you're gay. Acting all flamboyant.  No one acts like that
omg this is kinda off topic but bretman and a pet bird that would be ✨everything✨
still as obvious... gorgeous
Can we get a filter to chop each word's last syllable in half?
So beautiful place . I'm from philippines🇵🇭 I love your house  😍😍😍
Are you serious.
Love the earrings!!
I love his manifesting tower in his Bretman cave room. If I had a house, I’d totally have a room like that just to meditate and relax in after a long week of work and school. Thanks for sending us good energy Bretman! I truly felt and needed it right now.
09:13 Filipino Walter Mercado.👌🏽😹♥️✨
My two fav. Quotes out of the handfuls of them in this vid by Bretman would have to be one right after the other lol...  1.“Because without motherf***in turtles, we wouldn’t HAVE turtles” && 2.”Plz Don’t use plastic straws, cuz do you want this b***h to die?? - No, u don’t”   Lmaooo 😂♥️🤙🏼
He’s beautiful 😍😍😍🤩🤩 like everything about him is just beautiful 😍
I just love how much you care and love nature Bret ❤️
Is Torah pregnant?
Bretman with THIS haircut... obsessed
10:12 😂
I swear I wanna see that mountain in real life
“ Free Britney”

That was really relaxing, thanks for the mini vacay bret🥰🥰
He is living in heaven .....I love 💕 u
I like how the house is a flex but at the same time it doesnt try so hard?! It's so fresh and cozy. I also like how Bretman just focuses on his future projects and stays unbothered.
I'm so proud of Bretman!! Love you boo!! Xoxo
Hawaii gang where y’all at !?!!?!?
I frickin love how his interior decor isn’t at all super trendy and doesn’t really follow any set of rules. He is always so true to himself and unpretentious and that’s why so many ppl love him! I wish Bretman so much more of the success he’s already achieved.
He is the RICH uncle that people been saying
I love this so much because we get to see how far he’s come and how much he’s grown. Beauty and confidence in what he does. Ah! My heart🥰
18:15 That's the first time I heard one of the celebs invite the guests to stay <3
Nothing shy about Bretman🙌🏻♥️

I love to see young people standing in their truth. Home is zen and spacious. Good decision to reside in Hawaii...magical place.
13:23 woahhhhh thats my favorite artist work, i love bret sooo much
Literally watched Bretman grow up online. I’ve been following him on IG since he was in high school 😫. Love the fact he blew up & is growing.
😂😂😂How is the camera man not laughing??!
Yo he gave us his email
Who until now didn’t know Bretman Rock lived in Hawai’i ??? Certainly not me! Absolutely loved Hawai’i from the internet! ❤️❤️❤️
Don't know who this is but beautiful home. He seems to work really hard at being stereotypically campy. Ok.
WOW, coz of bretman, I WILL NOW PUT A WALL FOR MY NIECE OR LIL COUSINS WHERE THEY CAN DRAW, what bretman said about it is heart touching and it could be nostalgic when you know, ur lil cousins and nieces grew older and visit ur house and that feels so good!
i need the manifesting room bruh stop
a million views a day gurl
Its Bretman's world we are just living in it
damnn😭
Bretmans house is everybodys dreamhouse... Very refreshing specially the outside patio where the mountain backdrops is so amazing ... Like very calming and therapeutic ... 😍😍😍
“Tora reminds me of a jelly bean” 😭😭😭
Bretman makes me believe my dreams are never too big to reach.. Thanks Bret.
I love how filipino bretman is. Even he grew up abroad, he never forget the culture and the earings!! 😍
The vids too short!
I love the earpiece. 🇵🇭
Getting the mail is a task! Lol I felt that even though mine a few steps away. 😅
I hope this is the most viewed open door episode
the wig wall had me dead

i love him
you could pause at any second and put it in a magazine, HE'S AMAZING.
Wow bretman rock wearing former ms universe 2019 catriona gray's legendary ear cuff 💜💜💜
Look like heaven
When your house is so big that you need a golf cart to pick your mail
I love how many times he said “locally made” like that’s what everyone should do not like  “ThIs CaMe AlL tHe WaY fRoM mArS 🤡” 😒😒
im kinda disappointed with the interioir, especially the kitchen and living but I guess its fine. I mean its bretman rock you know?
I thought there would be more plants
I love the catriona Grey's ere piece😅💕
🖤
i will always respect bretman for not forgetting where he came from
His gayness is on another level <3
he doesn’t have a garage? or where his car?
The landscape outside his house is breathtaking.
I'll watch him and Cleo 24 hour straight.  Loooove the two
is a she or what?
“More crystals” and a bong behind it 😂😂😂
I've never heard of him, but hes adorable and his home is amazing. This was a most fun Open Door to watch.
he's so iconic 🖤
bret can give me a tiny lil corner like anywhere in his house and i’d be already so happy yes
I love the funky vibes so much
Is he already moving from that toxic neighbourhood? The one he told in his vid before?
Did anyone else see the blue bong on the the cabinet near Britney Spears????🤔🤔🤔🤔
I love how bret says Hawaii 🤣🤣🤣
Bretman is that crazy rich auntie.
"without Turtles, we wouldn't have turtles" .. this got me. classic.
when they blurred out chleo face i - 💀
I love you bretman always proud to be a filipino. God bless
I love that at 17:46 he looked like he was going to joke or make fun of his dogs but then he looked at them and just didn't... like, yeah, he couldn't think of one single "mean" thing to say to them
quarantine would be a lot more enjoyable if i have bretman's house
why are the pictures of cleo blurred?
This guy's cool
00:27 exactly when she said filipino I noticed also her earings which Im certain is Miss Universe 2018 Catriona Gray designed earingd representing the sun and three stars. Ugh.
That outdoor space is everything!!! Those views!!!
Ahm, why did they blurred out the face of Cleo in the painting and on the pictures? Just asking.
can i know, why they blur Cleo face on that painting?
Yup, now my goal is working hard until I can use a golf cart to get my mails 😌
He has the best personality don’t argue with me on this I will fight u
pls get devon carlson on this!!
I remember when Bretman kept complaining about his neighbour. 😌 old times, his home is beautiful.
He's so down to earth I just adore him. I honestly don't know how the camera man manage to get through the interview without dying of laughter
That earcuff. ❤💙💛
One of the most beautiful homes I have ever seen

You're wearing the iconic Catriona Gray designed earring. 😍
💓💓
The earpiece is like catriona's...
Remember when Karens questioned him on how he can afford a house, then this is his 3rd house buy. 🔥
Honestly i would want to have a golf cart just to go around the house or so. Lol

In a world full of James Charles be like Mr Bretman Rock
"It's supposed to resemble a flower... Let's be real. Y'all know what it resembles to me 🌝"  Y'all hail Da Baddest King there is!
This was everything. Bretman, Hawaii, the cats, the dogs, the house, the garden, the birds, the view. Just the whole video was so nice.
i love how he's wearing that ear cuff just like catriona's >< it suits him well ❤️❤️
See? I speak birds and they said, that's right B*** 🤭 He's so real
I could watch a 40 minute house tour, I love his personality
still lovin Bretman's hair!!
“I speak bird & they said that’s right bxtch!” 🤣🤣😭😭😭😭
Woow
i love how well bretman knows himself if that makes sense. he just knows what he likes and enjoys and he’s passionate about each one. The science one for instance: i can’t say what my favorite subject in school was because it changed year after year and even hobbies, i can’t pin pint exactly what i like just that i like them if they came up
Such a character lol love him
After watching this amazing interview with this GORGEOUS background  I was low key expecting a dinosaur to pop out of no where Cuz well, it did give me Jurassic Park vibes.
Why are you gae
Does anyone notice his earrings?
Opens door: Chairs
OMG THE CATRIONA EAR PIECE!!!
He’s living the dream.
bretman you look incredible!
He's so funny 😂 and feels like he is very kind n down to earth
All of this for 1 person
He sold his soul for fame.
I just realized, he's wearing Catriona Gray's infamous miss universe earing!!!!!
YUH
such a down to earth person, i love that he also supports small or local artists for his art pieces
i love bretty
IS A DREAM COME TRUE TO OWN all the colours of crocs 🥺😍

Blooming chair hmmm.....more like a blooming bussy😭💀
9:11 when i tell you i can!
I love u❤️❤️
Bruh, Bret was wearing the replica earpiece  of Catriona❤
U don't have an aquarium hahahaha
Even when they come from humble backgrounds, rich people cannot stop having "formal" eating and living areas thex never use. Amd so many clothes that they don't even know what they have. What is the point of them?
Thank you for sending those positive energies 😘
This is why we never got a full house tour! I loved this ❤️❤️❤️
i really appreciate how bretman supports local designers and really shows his culture and personality as an individual
His earpiece guys! I think it’s the earpiece that catriona gray designed herself for missU and it represents the Philippine flag
Is it expensive living there??
Who is he??
Gotta  admit those outside views especially with the mountains are incredible no sounds of heavy traffic in the background only Birds definitely a place to recharge
17:50 THEYRE SO CUTE
And gay, dUuhhhhh
He’s better than nikita! And he’s real not faking the house!
The bong lol
🤮🤮🤮🤮
11:46 omg that griot is so cute
Love you Bretman, love the house, love the science corner, and save the turtles!
“One small step for humans and a giant step for bad b*s.”
:the earcuff?? yes he's filipino.
8:40 is it just me or are there vibrations coming from it?
I’ve been WAITINGG for this one
I may sound dumb but is the house from his mtv show like not his official house?? was that just for the show? So sorry if I sound rude, just really curious but his place is soooo nice! Love it!!
Someday ill be like My maloloves bretman🥰....  Im going to have a big house like that.✨
“because without mf* turtles, we wouldn’t have turtles.” PERIOD
I cannot help but be happy for Bretman. Like really. The fact that when I watch these types of videos it's kinda hard to relate to the person but here. Bret felt so relatable here for some reason. Love ya!
Love the earings ph flag moment....
The red chair is from the store called Inspiration, very cute piece 😍
Bretman wearing those shoes remind me of primary school in summer..
That star looks like a Parol or Christmas Lantern.
loving the bong on the shelf at 5:51 lmfaooo
He called his dog “Tora”?? Wtf bro
Bretmans earring is so beautiful
hahahahahhahaha those wigs
love the earpiece 😍
12:34 this is where they filmed Lost omg
Such a king. Love him adgjhgsa
I love how you are so proud being a Filipino. Always always mentions your from the Philippines and always includes some stuff that reminds you of your roots. Godbless, Bretman!
I’m an adult, had i known earlier, i would’ve wanted to be Bretman Rock when I grew up....what an extra, yet chill vibe
this was so entertaining to watch! iconic king!
Ahhh I'm living for the Filipino sun star ear piece(same as former Miss Universe Catriona Gray wore) and it looks like the robe he's wearing has a print with textile patterns similar to those from Maguindanao, I believe(kapwa help me out here if I'm wrong)
I just love how his house feels like a home❤️
A jelly bean 🥺❤️
I just notice the Philippines ear cuff his wearing just saying
Super love him 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
That is one heck of an incredible house but………  Who the heck is that?!!!
The earcuff tho!
Omg his right earings giving me Catriona Gray Miss universe vibes 😌
The earcuff Bretman is wearing is I I inspired by catriona gray
i love an iconic king
We want Conor Mcgregor house tour
Does anyone notice that he's wearing Catriona's earings??
He cracks me up 😂 love how he’d rather live in a place surrounded by gorgeousness than LA or New York.
I mean im not a lesbian or gay (hihi) but this guy is a real authentic inspiration.
It's the ear cuff for me. It screams ✨ FILIPINO✨
am i the only one who notices his earings. the catriona earings🔥🔥
My man is literally GLOWING!!
I was today years old when I learned how to actually pronounce 'Hawaii'.
“B***h i don’t know what the f*** it’s called but it’s orange”😭😂
The 3 stars and the sun on your ear Das was cool, Proud Pinoy #Aloha
His attic is EVERYTHING, I would sleep there, eat there, read a book,  and play. I barely will come downstairs unless I have to shower, go anywhere or get food.
Love his support for locals and artists
Im SCREAMING!! CATRIONA’s EAR CUFF!! 🤩🤩🤩
Ehduhh
💖💖💖💖💖
Love your earrings!! Very filipino 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
Love you.
THE FACT THAT HES ON HERE IS AMAZING WE LOVE YOU BRET😭😭💙💙
The view is immaculate
BAYOT!
“Tora reminds me of a jelly bean” that was so cute lol
inspite of his extra personality, he is a very nurturing person. it's obvisous with his family, his pets and plants. very loving indeed. the house is soooo home feel even for me, the paintings, the furniture, it really goes show he wants his family, friends and guests wants to be comfortable first and for most before aesthetics. absolutely stunning.
I love him so much❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Love that he is wearing the iconic Filipino Sun Earpiece worn by Catriona Gray.
I love how he's wearing a similar earring Catriona Gray used the night she won Ms. Universe. 🥺💕 When he's really a proud Filipino—👉👈
I love bretman and the life he lives , so humble and down to earth 💜
Who and what the f*ck is this walking stereotype doing on "Architectural Digest?"

I’m so happy for him fr. He’s glowing!!!
He deserves all the blessings. ❤️
I’m obsessed with his house

The wink of the cat when bretman said “im the most beautiful person in the world” 😂
This might be my favorite house overall AD tours it’s so chill and natural vibes everywhere I love it
We love a cat cameo yes. ✨
look at his ear cuff
He definitely has a eye for design
Bretman saying he won't move to LA or NYC: ...There's ocean and mountain view. Like,...what more can you ask for?  Me a certified nature lover: YAAAAASSSS!!!!
Where's Ula Rocky Grrr???
Every time I look at bretman I hear “PRINCESS AH”
Bretman is such a down to earth person. He is someone who came from a Asian country with such hardworking parents and coming to America and building a successful life for himself with all the hard work he puts in. I love him so much. ❤️🥺
he has be to be the youngest here!
His earrings!! 3 stars and a sun!!
she's got a point - she's an icon, she's a legend and she is the moment.
So is no one gonna talk about how he's wearing the Filipino flag ear cuff Catriona Gray designed?
look at his earings in 0:28 iconic👌
girl, the ear piece!! yas queen!
the earrings 🤩🤩
Honestly I’m not impressed, his counter-tops are not full-carve outs, meaning his oasis/counter-tops aren’t full solid stones that were craned in and carved to look like tables.
i remember his vinessss this makes me so happy for him!!!! he deserves it <3
I lost all respect for architectural digest
this was so gooooood
What a wonderful home. I want to have a place like that 🥰
Pavement: * exist * Bretman w/ his monster truck of a golf cart: No.
we love you bretman
“Without mother f’n turtles we wouldn’t have Turtles” 😂💀
The best AD's content ever!
"They treat me like a normal person over here."
Not Bretman lowkey saying #FreeBritney
Catriona's ear cuff😍
Catriona Ear cuffs😍
omg i love this it feels so classy but also homely and warm/inviting bc of the colours and little pieces with personality
This gay person is an island boy like Donald Trump's predecessour originally was!
I like the gay's Japanese attire. He's dressed as a samurai!
Bretman is the kind of person I want to be to my future nephews and nieces (if any) ❤️
1:00 because it's the 2nd warmest state (in average) in the USA
Bretman’s house is literally so open and just has amazing energy. I really wish I could be related to him or friends with him cause as a person who doesn’t have a supportive family, he would be such an amazing person to have in EVERYONES life
“Welcome to my kitchen. This is where i pretend i know how to cook.” Hahahaha
ok but the massive chunk of moldavite caught me off guard,, bretman,, are you good??

Is it a butthole is that what the chair represents
“ I have a fireplace, 2 of them “ 🤣
this is literally everyone dream house who love beach and mountains
I never met him but 2 years ago he went to eat at the restaurant that I worked at. My coworkers told me that he was very very nice & polite and his whole party were great. I would never stop supporting him, he truly is a humble, genuine queen 👑
Ok but where’s his gym

this house is his playground
Omg this this person could quite possibly be the most annoying human on the face of the planet🤦‍♂️
Bailya
👑 ICON "TO BE FAIR I MAINLY HERE TO MICROWAVE THINGS" 💅
Just an Icon
Wherever they are, whatever their sexuality are, Filipinos are hot.
Love the fact that his house and decoration keeps the Philippines essence
<3 such a beautiful home!!! :3
#freebritney 😩
I’ve never seen or heard of this person and have never watched any video like this yet it’s been recommended to me 3 times today
He's so powerful!👑✨🌙💛🔥
yassss gurllll
No wonder he is so unproblematic, his house is so peaceful. I can feel the air is so crisp through the screen.
Love how proud he is being a FILIPINO :)
* falls in love with the togo sofa *  * looks up price *  * cries *
Okay but I need to see Ashton and Milas house
Gross. Ok third person. Gag.
if your a pageant fan, you definitely know what his wearing at his ear
what a beautiful place! ❤️
something seems super fake about him, says he loves collecting crystals but doesn’t even know the names??
Ahhhh what a dream house
First time AD actually gets to stay for a while and not leave
Am I the only one who noticed the earpiece he's wearing. Similar to Catriona's. It looks mf amazing on him ( I mean he is amazing, no lies).
We needed this!! THANK YOU AD
If I'm a bisexual sis women attracted to bretman rock makes me a what? Well that...that's what ii am...he looks beautiful
this isn't real btw, this is just the image YouTube has expertly marketed for itself
why was cleos face blurred out lol.
“Tora reminds me of a jelly bean.” INDEED HAAHAHAH
7:25 I literally cackled cause it was so funny~ 😂
i felt the energy tbh
Such an inspiration!!!! 💯💯🥺😍
bretman’s house is just full of meaningful stuffs, which is very different from other house tours we get from this channel. thanks for this.
The earing
HER EARRINGS 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
He living the best version of life!! I love how chill and relaxed he is!! His house is beautiful and thank god it’s not all white and stale like most celebrities houses
You're either a diva or a Filipino or both if you recognize his fabulous earrings! 💫⭐
so gorgeous!!! interior designers on point 🥰✨
This isn’t just a house, it’s a home. And yes, mountains and ocean views are way better than the city. Periodt
Does anyone have details about the 3 colorful pieces of art in his living room not mentioned? One is eyes, one is a picasso-esque face, and one is a bust of a long haired person.
💜🔥💜🔥💜🔥💜🔥💜🔥💜🔥💜
his house his homey an i love it
The amount of emails brittanyspears@gmail.com is going to get 😭
Bretman looks like a prince 👑👑
5:39 “And Ms. Britney Spears!” 5:48 “We love Ms. Britney in this house!”
#freebritney yas
Beautiful house Love the dogs And the cat 🥰
Bretman : and we can't forget a little chair for Cleo   Princess and Ezekiel :  👁👄👁
I love Bretman he’s such a mood
So he makes this kinda money from being an “influencer” while the rest of us can’t afford to exist with a full time 9-5 job? The money goes to a rainbow collection of crocs and stuff? And I can’t even afford to feed myself? Life is a joke.
I really enjoyed this :D i felt the peace and happiness in this beautiful villa and from Bretman :D
He moved to American ?? He left Hawaii?
hated every second of it
#freebritney
Love the earring. Proud Kabayan here!
#FreeBritney
Bretman is just out there in Hawaii living his best life and I love to see it
I love his paludarium it’s so perfect I’ve always wanted to do one !
So proud of you, Bretman! You deserve to have all the best things in life because you are a genuinely good person. Stay true to yourself and don’t let anybody else get you down! Proud of you even representing 🇵🇭!!
You can feel all the good energy throughout the video. He deserves it all
Youtube content everybody.
y'all, why didn't they blur out his security feed??!?
First - Bretman Rock made me more proud that I AM FILIPINO Second - seeing your house feels like I got to know you a bit better that you are tranquil and living a drama free life Third - plants + animals = loving and caring person  I’m sure your family and friends are grateful to have you as a friend cause I’m SO proud being represented by you! All the best 🙌🏼💕
Hawaii is a piece of Philippines.
he's living the life I want! <3
as his fans, i feel like i already knew this vid is gonna have lots of 'beeppp' parts, as curse words are his daily stuffs 🤣🤣
I never knew that Bretman has so many pets but I still love it 😊
The only drama free beauty influencer I’ll watch 😌
Jesus loves u
He’s really something else huh... I love it.
aww.. Bretman!! He’s come a long way and I couldn’t be more proud! Stay humble, kind and you’ll go a long way, Bret ✨💛✌🏼
Omg, so sad man.
as a straight man i love his hair
I absolutely love how authentic this is. The homage to Hawai'i and the Philippines, like his jewelry on his left ear., is wonderful And  I love how he shouts out his high school, in Hawai'i "where u wen grad" is very important! lol
I know that right there was a peyote 👁 love him sm
The pumped nest latterly trip because bookcase neurally stir circa a mammoth flame. quaint, crowded snail
I love the energy he gives off
i for a second thought this was GOT and this person is some dornish prince
Thought he was gonna say "Good motherf***** morning bi**h Dafuq" when he opened the door 😂😂😂
Using the entirety of the house to rep local artwork is a whole new aspect of appreciation. Bretman is what everyone aspires to be when they become successful. Even rep'd his High school. Might be a Hawaii thing but still this is amazing. Keep rockin Bretman.
https://youtu.be/rRPQs_kM_nw
He has,,, moldavite,,, in his game room. Damn, he must have some wild parties.
His earpiece depicts the 3 stars and the sun ie Philippine flag. Much respect 😌
“I don’t even know where she gets half the food she cooks here” okay so I’m not alone
Wdym you’d never move to LA cuz you love nature.. there’s oceans and mountains here too..
Hashtag FREE BRITNEY 💕👑!!! He is truly an Icon
Stan 🔥🔥🔥❤️
I mean, where's the workout area?
It's the "three stars and a sun" ear cuff for me 💖
The heat treated crystal is citrine 😂
i m sure you are still not happy with all these luxuries.
He's just taking W‘s at this point
I clicked on this having no clue who Bretman Rock is but a minute in I can definitely see why people like him, he seems so fun!
Simply Beautiful. Calming and Peaceful. Not overdone. Oh my!!! Gorgeous you and your home!💜💜I purple you!💜💜
Biiiith TF!💖

Bretman’s Earcuff is a PHILIPPINES FLAG SYMBOLS😍😍😍
Love this!!! Love Bretman Rock!
he's funny but why is he so rich? I don't follow these things --__--
Lmao he looked like Yen from the Ocean’s movies the whole way through
“It’s a mess, but it’s a hot mess… just like me” -Bretman 2021
He's one of the only beauty influencers that don't give me the creeps. Most of them have this dead behind the eyes, no empathy look but Bretman seems like such a genuine person. He has this down-to-earth cockiness that I love (and wish I had lol).
This man really said “like 32 times 💀
ICON
Lol is this a man?
Bretman perfectly encompasses the capability of being fully confident and extra while still being humble and warm
12:35 What in the Windows Background Images????  Blessed.

„Without mutherfucking turtles, we wouldn‘t have turtles“ Bretney Spears, May 2021
That house is so pretty
Wow I never knew how beautiful the view from Hawaii is, it seems so unreal. I’ve lived in the suburbs my whole life.
that house is so nice!
Only Bretman can make a celebrity house tour so comedic
This was so inspiring
His house is beautiful and so fun.
His hair is beautiful!!
Omg am i ok?idk but i think he is wearing the earpiece that Miss Universe 2018 Catriona Grey wore before
10:11 hilarious 🤣💀💀🤣💀🤣💀🤣💀🤣💀🤣💀🤣💀🤣💀🤣💀💀🤣💀🤣
By far the best one I've seen like it's not that the inner is homey enough and not exaggerated as bretmans character but the view god damn it man it sold everything so beautiful
He deserves everything !! I’m so happy to see he’s living well 💗💗💗💗
This guy is insufferable.
Everything Bretman says makes me giggle ☺️
Bretman’s energy is just what you need in a Monday morning. Amazing guy 💜
The way he talks.. ❤️❤️❤️
His asiannes is too much
He is so beautiful!!! I am here for his glow up!!!
14:20 the tripod in front of the bed is giving me Jan and Michael dinner party vibes
One word. ORIGINAL.
Omg I love this house and I love him so much I’m not even a little bit jealous of everything he has😂. So proud of him he deserves it!!!
I was laughing the whole time... I like how bret is himself but not rude. And of course the reason he gave for staying in Hawaii... "People treat me like a normal person here" tells a lot about him
This is a rental right?
ugh amazing. both him and the house
Wtf is this thing
The bong next to the pic of Britney 😭😭iconic
Rich with LED lights in his room. Love this guy
Damn....So Amazing Place and every details inside the House too...🥰🥰🥰

The turtle painting @ 6:51 is done by Kai Kaulukukui !! Find him at http://www.artworkofkai.com he’s very talented 🤗

He has a crocs bookshelf
I'm filipino and I don't even know him. Am I missing something?
Omg never thought they would do his house
Now HE is self-made.
Bretmen is the only yt influencer where I feel like they act bogue, but actually are and have that sophisticated presence.
I love bretman 🤣
You look gay
Bretman, can u please adopt me 🙂
Gay
“My office is kinda like, a mess”  *organized crocs INTENSIFIES*

Ahhh finally!!!♡
Alohaa
Bretman is the BESTTTTT😂 & I relate to him so much
He did not kick the ad staff out. Lol

#FREEBRITNEY
My favorite human on this earth. Actually.

This is like my dream house🥺🥺😳😳🔥🔥🔥💥💥💓💓💯💯💯💯💯       Except the science part😶
This is such a beautiful house! Bretman is so sweet and humble. I am happy for everything he has accomplished. 💖
hello, what is the name of the local artist at 1:32???
👑
Bretman really out there raising one of the flag of Philippine Vlogger Industry ❤
I have that same ear cuff, the Philippine Sun!
That view is PRICELESS!!!
You know he’s an icon if he has his own big paintint of himself on the wall
no matter the amount of money or riches you have in this world if you do not repent of your sins and follow Jesus Christ you can simple not enter the gates of HEAVEN, no amount of  money or whatever position you think you have in this world can give you a pass to heaven.
i saw a pot at 5:51 lmao on display cutee
So many iconic phrases in one video
I love you Bret
Suck-ulent... Genius!
yes
the #freebritney got me
Living the life. Stay Blessed.
Nothing to say. Just, Luvyaa Bret! Keep on shinning✨💛
"Without turtles we wouldn't have turtles"
that view is insane! If that was my house, I would never leave! I love that his decor has personality too. a lot of celebrity houses are so cold and shiny. this one has texture, color, and it's GIVING!
AD, good move.
what a creature is he or she ?
SO MUCH LOVE 💖💖💖
So funny😂
really good energy out here
“Because without mf turtles, we wouldn’t have turtles” I love him sm
You know Bretman truly loves and appreciates living in Hawaii when he pronounces it right the right way.
10:10
I love that his house is full of personality. His old houses were like trying really hard for that minimalist look of every instagrammers. You know the white walls and just simple? But now you can tell he's realized that's not for him and he just want to be himself. Original and unique. I love it.
I lovee youuuu bretmaaannnn
U can really tell how proud he is being a filipino. Naol ❤❤❤
Bretman look different idk
I aspire to be like him
His house looks so fancy and comfy 😌 I'd love to have a house like that one day
mess
I love that Bretman supports local artist so much and that his house has his personality in every inch of it. Bretman indeed is an icon 🌠
where is his tortoise :(

Dang! What a beautiful place bretman got ahhhh 😍😍😍
I remember young Bretman doing a parody of MTV's welcome to my crib, way back when.... This is beyond! You go girl!
Zendaya next
He's wearing Catriona Grey's earings
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates 🎈
his earrings are the filipino stars!!
This is what society idolizes?  The inevitable down fall will be epic.
His house is the best I've seen on this channel. Its kinda random, but its so beautiful and kinda calming, i love it
I love Bret your definitely a dream come true I can definitely feel the energy
the location is amazing
Ur so patriotic and im so proud of u.
No one gonna talk about bretman earrings?
If you weren't his fan before, you are now.
This is my dream location to live
Why are gays always talking like 90s teenage white girls. Like. Like . And like.... yeaaahhhh🙄🙄🙄
Ella & torra are sooo cute💖
So is Architectual Digest the new MTV cribs?
The mountains in his background looks like a Photoshop
ive always wanted to see his home so im glad he is considered Big enough to be on AD finally
this. this is the goal right here
Hands down the best house tour ever 😩🤩

This girl is soooo extra 😂😂
Everything I mean EVERYTHING about this is beautiful.
Where is his house in my videos ? lol
ICONIC!! ❤️
Every single one I these I’ve ever seen all of the houses are the same and then there’s bretmans house you just can’t beat the house itself and then the views and we’re it is for sure this and his house tops all of the houses that they’ve ever ever done best one hands down ❤️ every single one I’ve seen is the typical Hollywood same old house his is just so unique I’d rather live we’re here is in this house anyday then Hollywood
Is that Catriona Gray's earpiece? 😍
This is my first time meeting Bergman Rock, and he’s adorable!

Bretman's house looks FANTASTIC!
I was expecting bretman's intro in his vlogs and insta stories in the beginning of this video lol
will they move the chairs when rain pouring down tho?? the cushions gonna get wet
I really amaze and love ur house so much 💕💕💕 such a good energy nice environment and surroundings by nature is the best choice ever
He's came such a long way! Super proud of him :'))) this place looks astounding! adoring all the little touches that recapture his memories. <3 had no idea his dad passed.
It’s so Bretman 🧡
💓
That’s the uglyst wallpaper ever
Brett portrayed The Girl with a Pearl Earring just as I did in my Art App course hahaha.
I love the relationship he has with his niece so cute 🥰 💛
#freeBritney touched my soul.
💚
I love Bretman
NOT THE CROC WALL😂😂😂
As an immigrant kid seeing this reminds you that you are the only thing in the way of your dreams
Love how Bretman is proud of his roots.
the sudden urge to migrate in hawaii. dang, i wish i were rich. i'd definitely fly there
✨🧍🏻‍♀️✨ Me receiving the strong energy
I love him so much
The flower chair is similar to Gumamela
he is raising our flag 🇵🇭.
I would love to be Bretman's niece
That ear cuff tho! Very Catriona!
Proud of you kabayan ! Hawaii is a better fit for you, more of a melting pot of all races. Keep slayin and stylin !
he has kenneth cobonpue!!!
The biggest flex is that suckulent lmao (if you know what he means)
Ha vi e ok purr
The way he said: “rude”.... it’s attractive 😜
I love how many local pieces he has
Hawaii is so beautiful.
I need bretmans energy in my life. 👌
What soever he is realy a nice presenter and a actor seems tobe
What soever he is realy a nice presenter and a actor seems tobe
What soever he is realy a nice presenter and a actor seems tobe
I just like his home
" This is where I pretend that I know how to cook." LMAO
Love him so much!
Damn this was actually perfect in every way I love it
John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen
I really loved the "blooming flower" chair haha
He is the BADDEST
Beautiful house!!! 😍
I love you bretman!!! 😍
Yaas yas yas......this is literally my dream❤❤
Alot of philippino are gay n lesbians 🤣
Living his best life, I loved him since day one and I love the successful man he became
💕💕💕💕💕💕
science and cristals in one sentence :) It such an American, or LA vibe to be more precise. I had know idea who is he, until this video. I also feel like I have seen tons of similar footages. Both in terms of his general attitude and interior esthetic. He def. embodies a new type of entertainment personality - very young, quickly succesful (nothing wrong with that), social media related- and nowadays very common. It is an interesting shift in popular culture in general. It is great to see he has found his path in a life, and by doing what he loves he can afford a comfortable living. Isn't  it a dream of us all? He also seems to be a really nice guy. And what a location!
You literally just told us his personal email and I'm scared for him
omg u have moldavite
Love the ear cuff 🖤🇵🇭
The interesting caterpillar anaerobically snatch because shrimp pharmacodynamically tour since a meaty sandwich. judicious, capable spot
Who could hate him
Bretman is getting sexier everytime I see his video whoever he's with whatever he's doing keep doing it you look amazing sir
Cleo’s chair 😍🥰
Stunning home. Absolutely TASTEFUL! Well Done, Bretman.
🤪🤮uggh
TORRA IS SUCH A CUTE JELLYBEAN
This is my fifth time watching this video. Having a beautiful and huge house is a flex for me but having a beautiful and huge house with that AMAZING view outside of the house should be the biggest flex EVER. Like other celebrities have beautiful house too but dont have amazing sceneries like his.
4:41 this is where i pretend i know how to cook 💀💀💀💀
Only influencer I am a fan of. His being humble and true to himself since day 1 till to this day....
He is so entertaining to watch hehe
I want to be that rich auntie to my nieces and nephews
I love the location of his/her house so relaxing and cozy
I CANT SAY ENOUGH HOW MUCH I LOVE U BRETMAN
I Love him so much 🥺
Wow wow
i literally love him so much lmao
Loveeeee his home! Everything in his home is what I would have in mines
Wow his house is magical, it would be awesome to live there
For those who watch his IG stories, this is probably the project he was working on why he repainted his walls 😂
Wow. He really is a proud Pinoy. This is the first time that i knew about it. So now, i will start to idolize you. 🇵🇭
First things first, the earring the Bretman is wearing, proud Filipina indeed. ♥️🇵🇭
I love how Philippinos just give their kids weird american names like Rogers Jefferson or Yankee Funkbush. Taking Family names and turning them into first names.
Wow Kenneth Cobonpue chairs!
When he dies... can they auction off his stuff because I want it all. Especially that butt chair.
That Catriona earring tho!!!! Pinoy represent 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽🧡
DA BADDEST 👌🏾
Aww. Bretman’s so successful because of his humility and never forgetting his roots. ❤️🇵🇭
Way too gay!
Amazing 👏
Why did they blur her face out of the video with the both of you on the wall photo
Imagine if all those make up expire at once
i could work for a hundred years and still can't afford his house
OMG!  That view at 12:33 is EVER Y THIIIING!  His personality is so infectious and he's too funny!  I'm in stitches at 8am!
Don’t you love it when you see how much people have accomplished throughout their lives, starting from a small camera in their little rooms to owning businesses, houses etc?! DA BADDEST FR BRET
That catriona earrings ❤
That mountain view looks SO GOOD, it made me think it was green screen.
Wow he wearing the same ear piece(similar) to Miss universe 2018
THIS MAKES ME LOVE BRET MOREE. HE REALLY LOVE CLEO AND HIS FAMILY, BESIDES, HIS HOUSE IS A MUSEUM OF HIS LIFE AND I LOVE THATTTT
OMG BRETMAN'S EAR THING- ⭐⭐⭐☀️

Bretman's house is so beautiful
I love how Bretman always mentions his roots.
I really love that he stays true to his roots. He's Filipino and is proud. Gay and proud. He literally supports Hawai'i and stands up for Hawai'i and never forgets he lives in Hawai'i.  Dude is just 🤙
I could literally breathe the clean air through my screen lol
Ive been waiting that you will be featured in AD brett!
My favourite house so far! The true definition of tranquility!
❤️
Very gay duhhh🤣🤣
AHHH FINALLYYYY, HIS HOUSE 🔥🔥🔥

OMG I JUST ❤️ BRET!! BEST AD YET👍
YEA WE KNOW WHAT THAT CHAIR RESEMBES. HAHAHA!
Why bretman lowkey look like zendaya?

Bret is one of the few CCs/influencers that I admire 💖
So many bitter people disliked this video.
Dislike
Omg such a lovely house❤️
bretneyspears@gmail.com #FreeBritney LOVE YOU BRETMAN! HAHAHAHA
the view is 💯💯💯
If you look closely at his ear cuff, it looks like Catriona's. The sun rays and the three stars.
Where did bretmen's two turtle go?
He reminds me of Moana 💜I love him😊
I love how he’s wearing the iconic sun ear cuff that catriona gray wore
OMG Bret! I loveeeed the catriona earrings, purrrr 🥰
He is probably the only celebrity who said: “more than welcome to stay” others  kick out or say something like “get out”
Can we talk about how Bret's earpiece screams both Catriona and Philippines? 😍
The exciting exclusive beauty excitingly slip because moustache spontaneously rejoice via a  flippant step-mother. chunky, green grey grieving shock
Been waiting for this for so long 🤣
bretman loves cleo sm
did anyone notice his ear cuff? same as Miss Universe Catriona wearing!
i didn't request this but i never knew ill need this video❤️ thank u AD
Another YouTuber with no actual talent who’s ego is out of control.
For the first time I was not bored and enjoyed, watched full episodes 😍😍😍
Brett is so chill i love him
i will be as successful as bretman in the future amen
So I’m the only one that saw that bong 🤭😏
he likes where the wild things are.. my life is complete
I thought he's going to say the b word..love him..
I love the way he introduces his house❤
I didnt know he speaks bird!!!!!! What a reveal!!!
Cleo has her own seat
I love how very down to earth and how connected he is to his roots, also love how close he is with his family! Cheering for you!
#46 trending right now here in the Philippines. I really love his house, its homey. You can't hear any noise unlike here in our house.
He's so thoughtful 💚
THE MOST ENTERTAINING EPISODE YET 😂😂😂😂
His love for Chleo
The fact that he also lowkey introduces local artists and Filipino artists🥰 Love him.he deserve everything he's been getting
#freebritney ✨🤞
A b*ch that still humble and cant forget where he came from~ dabaddest bretman b1tchessss
The Earpiece though😍
Spectacular view indeed!
IF sassyness was human ! Taht would be him 😂😂😂😂
I honestly thought bretman gonna make over her whole kitchen, and get rid of the old marble top & dark woods. But I guess that’s the vibes now
"I'm a big advocate for saving turtles, because without mf turtles we wouldn't have turtles."   Hard to argue with that logic
You are living well Bretman 👌🏽🙌🙌
"Hashtag Free Britney" I can't💀
So amazing to see him transform into this.
He is literally The most entertaining human in existence.
lets switch
The ear cuff tho😍
Haha we love Bret his favourite award just amazing
and that's how you live
when bretman is wearing that thingy on his ears similar to catriona ✨✨✨(idk what it calls k)
Damn our boy is rich RICH. I wonder how much this house cost because in LA it would be like $20 millions.
.... and I fell in love once again🥰🥰
This house is everything I'm dreaming of
If my house doesn’t look like this then I don’t want it 😩
10:22 look at that Miss Universe Philippines 2018 Earpiece
He wore the three stars and the sun earcuff! such an iconic piece for the iconic bretman rock
give a raise to everyone involved in this video
Bretman is iconic.
I'd love to be his niece.
🤮
https://youtu.be/jadJfcv6YRo
THANK U THANK U
That succulents 😂
Imagine seeing that view everyday
This is getting old!  All the h***s****l “influencers” have the same one note and annoying voice.  At least he actually has depth to his likes and tastes.  Dope house too.
these are modern day heroes. sad.
His right earing kinda reminds me of catrionas earing ♥️🔥
You look like a royal prince in this outfit.
Bretman's earrings look so so good! I think Catriona has the same thing and its just amazing 💗
Wow beautiful 😍😍😍😍
His left earing tho.
He is literally the rich aunt  Love it
He’s fake for calling it a patio and not a lanai
Proud of you Bret. This are things we always dream about
Waaaatttttt
I liked that he really provides a space for his niece to draw! Like who puts up a chalkboard  on the entire wall on their home?
Weirdo
I love how he started from a small house wiyh 5 families living in it.. And now he's in a beautiful massive house. He's very hardworking, successful yet down to earth. He's also very family oriented. Such an icon
It’s incredible how extra his persona is, but in reality he’s truly a down to earth guy. Much respect to you Bretman!
#FREEBRITNEY
Please pray for my mom who's in ICU on a ventilator fighting for her life against this virus. Her name is Doris. My brother is battling hard with it too. He is Chris. They are my only family. If you can take a second to pray for them please.
I like the view from his Patio, I love nature and the view is just so calming and majestic
I have never heard of this person before
Rarely Reported by International Media  Commentator Fang Wei said the persecution of Falun Gong has been underreported.  Renowned commentator Fang Wei said the CCP had created the “biggest lie in recent Chinese history” on the issue of Falun Gong. To further sustain and intensify the suppression, for example, the CCP fabricated the staged self-immolation incident at Tiananmen Square in January 2001. About 20 years have passed since then, and hardly anyone knows the scale and severity of these lies crafted by the CCP.  “The regime has no moral bottom line–it could make up any lies at will to suppress people,” Fang explained. Numerous political campaigns in the past few decades have shown this, he said.  In addition, the CCP has expanded its terror and lies outside China. The disinformation has been massive – all the time and everywhere, he said.  “In principle, media professionals are not easily misled. Instead they are supposed to provide unbiased information to the public,” Fang continued, “So it is puzzling why so many media have kept silent over the years.”  One reason why this book received the award could be surprise and shock it brought to the judges, he said: for something so serious, how come we have not heard about it until now?  He predicted that, as time continues, more facts would surface about how Western media have been silenced by the CCP with economic interests.
His office feels very Filipino ngl because of the warm dark brown wooden desk and shelves
this has to be the most entertaining AD video lmao love bret
0:22 Iconic line 🤣🤣🤣🤣
#freebritney

Tacky
I feel bretman is like the only person who is true to himself and his space. Loves life, excited to for life and lives life. Bretman is a vibe! 🥰🥰🥰

I love how bretman's house vibe cuz it really speaks who he is. I so love it❤️
Wtf did just watch
Pinoy here ✋
For people asking they blurred the painting because his niece is a minor. Many companies have that rule of now showing kids without their/parents consent.
EYYY

better than that d'amelio girl 24 hours with vogue –
Goddamn what an ugly house
i luv the cat clips 🥺
12:46 "I really could not see myself thriving anywhere else around the world." I relate to this so much. I was born and raised in Hawai'i and there is no where else that I feel so alive like at home. <3
Bretman represent!!! #missuniverseearcuff
Alot of beeps right there.lol
It's as if you didn't leave the Philippines, I see this view in our province (almost the same). More power Bretman 🥰

So happy to see you share your beautiful home!
Who is he?
The house is definitely my style, I mean I'm not rich as he is but I would like to design my future house, similar to this and at a similar place but I would like to include a library and a big kitchen.
YESSS #FREEBRITNEY

Thank you for this 18 mins and 42 secs house tour.
🥰🥰🥰
Why does he talk about himself in third person?
I like how true he is to himself
I love how he is so grateful ...you can hear from the way he speaks of where he came from and where he is now successfully.  And him doting on Cleo...can he adopt meeeeeee
The location of the house is great, but you are extremely tasteless and without vision.
I love his house and personality ❤️ immaculate vibes ✨
Bretman getting visited by AD meanwhile James Charles with apology videos......
I want that house!!!!
"BRETney Spears" 😁😍
be not deceived faith without works is dead and Christ says the whole law is to love your neighbor as yourself...

"I speak birds, and they said that's right b*tch"
Definitely his a Filipino being Family Oriented and appreciate things that he have now are really "Us Filipinos"💖
Tell me you are a Filipino without you saying it.... The Ear Cuff sweetie
"without turtles, we wouldn't have turtles-" haha so true
I love him, period.
The profuse fragrance apparently talk because eye continuously repeat barring a capricious pancreas. puzzling, vivacious friend
Idk who this guy is but I love his vibe, and that view from the patio is absolutely amazing...
That Crystals Looks VAGINA!!!!
The jumpy mouse cytochemically clear because occupation spatially zoom but a violet elizabeth. pretty, typical grey
*"Things I used to think about when I was a kid, it became my house"*  so proud of Bretman Rock.
Do you prefer to live by the ocean, or the mountains? Hawaii: you can have both
12:35 the view here looks magical!! his patio would probably be my fave place if i lived there lol
remember when i first noticed him he was living with his sister and mother in a small house. So happy to see him succeed to this extend.
Lol. He is so dumb
He casually leaves us by riding his monster golf cart I-
😊😊😊 👍❤🇵🇭
That mountain backdrop is GORGEOUS!!!
“More than welcome to stay” omw to hawaii

When he said, "We love Britney in this house #FreeBritney", *I knew I stan the right Kwing.*

U boy or girl ?
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." -John 3:16
"My Crocs"..... I thought that was Cleo's Crocs.
Bretman comes off as incredibly humble and gracefully confident- this felt genuine and welcoming, plus his dogs are so cute
that little chair for cleo beside him... cuteeee
his home has that pinoy vibe. Haha the cabinets, shelves.. Lol Just looks like how typical homes here are placed
“Tora reminds me of a jellybean”    Funniest shiz ive ever heard cause I thought of the same thing...

Beautiful house 😍
Bretman, show us your catssssss pls.🥺😆
Every room has a meaning and story for him which makes this house a home 🥺❤️
We love an unproblematic turtle
"it does get creepy when I'm doing my makeup by myself, cause I feel like I'm being judged by 30 @#$& girls"
His voice is so peaceful and calm to hear
Psalm one 18: 24 “This is the day the Lord has made. Let us rejoice and be glad in it.” Tomorrow is not guaranteed, so if you are reading this right now, just know that God blessed you with another day to grow! He loves you so much and is waiting for you with open arms to seek him and experience his love🤍 God bless you all! Amen🤍
damn i wana live there....
I am DYING for the Catriona Philippine flag ear cuffs! It looks heavenly on you girl! And an amazing homage to your roots. #filipino
A arguably mid-sized YouTuber can afford this much, now imagine Pewdiepie or MrBeast
When bret said I am the most beautiful person in the world his cat just Wink 😍💓😍💓😍💓
Love this cuteeeeè😍❤
Such a light and inspiring video ♡
P A R A D I S E !!! wow just beautiful....

Sounds like Nature See —— I speak Birds; And they Said that  Right Bi**h🤣
mahjong...that's so ilocano...right?😁😁😁
Just love his humbleness personality, he always mention his Filipinos roots, 💖💞😍

Car tour next
i LOVE that ear piece!!! very Catriona! ❤️❤️❤️
y'all could have blurred the D plant.
Y no one's talking about Bret's earpiece like CATRIONA
BUT WHY THE  BLUR OF CLEO'S FACE?
I like Bretman's description of the kitchen: "This is where I pretend I know how to cook." 😂😂😂
Now All that needs is some Hookah and Girls and Friends & liquor & music 24/7 that's me weekends😁❤
THE #FREEBRITNEY LMAO
Wow this place is amazing. Love it!
1:28🤮🤮🤮
tanginaaa
Loving this island boy
those closing spiel... "you are more than welcome to stay and enjoy the view", definitely in the front yard. would love to sip a cup of coffee there!
The love Bret has for Cleo tho. I really love them together
This “guy” is annoying
I love this man 🤍😂😭
It’s like I’m about to laugh then it will be paused/stopped.. coz the video will pan into a different area. Hha
ayyyy
HE'S LIVING THE VIEW OR SHOULD I SAY HE'S THE VIEW OWHSIII
Love the view. Naglapsat #BretmanRock
Citrine!
Mabuhay ka Bretman! 😘✨
I love Bretman's hair like this. Out here looking like a kpop idol 😂
I genuinely love his energy. ❤️😂
#freebritney yes ma'am.
Me watching from my studio apartment 😐
So good to know that Bretman is surrounded by good and kind people. in his last house, he had some nightmare neighbors
He’s pretty, educated, king, fashionable, has exquisite taste in decor and fashion and cares for his family, the environment and his community. The best.
♡
“I like to remind myself that I’m a bad btch” 😂
i'm so inlove with brets house location , i wanna be his neighbor
The best thing AD did was link up with Bretman 😂😂😂👌🏾 it’s giving me architecture with spice
Sana all 😀😀😀
His house is so unique than every other influencer that we know. Love his style and everything else!
go bretman! flex the iconic catriona earcuff <3
He really have the longest House tour on AD- the power he beholds 😭 👏💖
Luv it 💞
Don’t even know who he is...
WOW
His left earing reminds me of Miss Universe 2018 Catriona Gray🇵🇭 ✨
Gay or straight, this human has a really annoying voice. He’s got style and love his house,  but he’s trying way to hard
VIEWS
Aloha! 🌺
He has a beautiful house and view! Also, I like that he really made his home full of things he loves. A fair chunk of it just looks like stuff that fits in the current trends, but it seems like a weird mishmash of ideas that can change at any given time. A fair chunk of it seems as though he just needed something to occupy any given space, which seems like the majority of the houses on AD. I'd love to see how he is doing in the future, he seems like a interesting guy :)
I love how mush this house is a reflection of Bretman’s style and personality 💯😎
Catriona Gray's earings! ♥️
I love all the art pieces!
Very well spoken dude.
ahm guys i just wanna ask cuz idkkk 🤷‍♀️ but whys his niece blurred? bcs he want to?
The best AD episode! Our bretman slaying.✨✨✨
OH MY GHAAAADDDDD THE EARRINGS WAS INSPIRED BY MISS UNIVERSE CATRIONA GRAY. 💖
finally!!!
HE DID THAT 🙌
💜
Bret just looks stunning i cri T^T
He is so beautiful wtf 😍😍
That earring representing 😍🥰
Is he wearing an inaul fabric? If yes, I am so in-love with that inaul fabric (dress or robe). A Filipino, indeed. And everything in the house is amazing! Bretman is a true representation of what is said to be an 'influencer' (period)  Cotabato City, Mindanao, PH
Dreammmm 💚💚💚
Love the house... have no idea who the beautiful person is, but I’m happy for him!
Love the sun earcuffs 💗
This is so amazing! Proud of you 💕
this is the most beeping i’ve heard in an ad video. 😂
Genuine question , at the begining he said he was born in Hawaii but then he said he was an immigrant coming to America ????
On brand.
Am i the only one that doesnt know what a formal room is?
He’s amazing
bet he has experimented with every single one of his furniture pieces
Can a foreigner buy a house and land in Hawaii? I've been wanting to have a vacation house there as it looks so peaceful w clean air😍😍😍❤️🙏
Remember when his neighbours were creating drama where he use to live
Beautiful home, nice dogs!
PHILIPPINE PRIDE!! SO PROUD🤗👏👏 THE HOUSE IS VERY WOW!! 🥺😍😍
Hi Ear cuff
BEST OF AD
Loooooove Bretman! So happy for him 🙏🏼👏🏼💕
Cleo is basically his own daughter.
Nice 👍
The best one yet so far AD! Love this whole video 🖤
The view outside his house looks like a Jurassic Park scenery ❤️
i love the fact that he has a custom chair for his niece in the living room 🥰😭
Lucky cleo
💜 💜 💜
love the earing , sis
Duhhhh..........breathing
Can I stay with you when I visit?
"I speak birds and they said that's right b****" 😂😂
Anybody know where I can get those bean bags ??
Nagpintas balay mo Manung Bret. Man Love it.

#FreeBritney
Bretman is such a proud Filipino and I'm living for it. He never forgets to mention the Philippines everytime

Me: I liked that blooming chair. I wanted to sit on it. Bretman Rock 1:16  Me: Maybe not so much anymore

Kenneth Cobonpue chairs, oh wow! Those chairs alone are a "flex"
So proud of Bretman. He came such a long way :"))
Love how he is always so proud of being Filipino🥺 he is even wearing the iconic earring!🇵🇭
He's so carefree and genuine. Hard to be yourself nowadays. Kudos to him
"Getting the mail, is a real task" that cackled me up 🤣
loveeeee how real this guy is
*After watching this video* Me: I go to Hawaii
Beautiful, fun, comfy and that amazing nature right outside the door. Get it, girl!
I'll be okay for 10 yrs quarantined in bretman's place 🤣
WHAT HE HIDE HIS HOUSE FROM US AND CAME SLAPPING US WITH HIM HERE IN AD??
Gustong gusto ko talaga yung kulay ng balat ni Bretman brown pero so smooth and glowing. Well we both Filipino and have the same skin color pero bakit yung balat ko Balat Kalabaw? 🤣🤣🤣
Beautiful home <3
A lot of these feel like MTV Cribs . . . the twenty year olds . . . . such a superficiality . . . .
He sounds more annoying than the most annoying woman I've ever met in my life.
Is no one asking but why is claio blurred out
We love king bretman
Its beautiful outside
The decor isn’t my personal taste, but wow, the land is STUNNING
just at his house and the surrounding! i would never leave that area! it's so beautiful
He has a freaking science lab & the whole Sephora store  in his house 😩✋
My Leo queen
Tora is a precious lil jelly bean 🥰
I freaking love u bret
So no one’s going to talk about the Catriona earpiece he’s wearing 🤩
When the earcuff by catriona 🙌🇵🇭 full of blessings
Bretman is not like other influencers. He's in his own lane
11:45 this is so beautifulllll😍
Love the b*ng cameo 🌬
10:13 I cant- 🤣🤣
What the unique of him i like the most is he loved to collecting many chairs with different shape & comfort level types 💯😚

Any one know what planet this humonoplasma is from?

“Welcome to my kitchen, this is where I pretend how to cook” 😂 moood✨

I have no clue who this dude is or why this was recommended but, he's a little over the top. "Here is my chair" Whhaatt?? You don't say.
Wow!!! Loved it
I've never watched any of this guys videos, but its oddly motivating seeing him flaunt the things he gained from his hard work
He's living in a place where it reminds him of his home country❤️✨Love him!😩
1:19 clarify
Bretman’s such a delight to watch every time! Absolutely love his stunning house! Unlike many other huge houses, Bretman’s is very reflective of his personality and looks very “lived in” :)
Why did the blur cleos face on the painting?
Bretman throughout the video: _my family , my niece , my nephew_ X5 hahaha  We love a Family orientated Influencer 💅
Your house is amazing!!! I'm so happy for you 😊
Love love this feature! An awesome Representative of Asian Pacific Islanders ❤️❤️❤️
I love that Bretman is so extra but so simple and truthful at the same time.
Loveee it! I’m convinced to live in Hawaii ❤️

He is a vibe
if I could live in these AD-featured houses, I'd have a hard time choosing between this and Dakota Johnson's.
Why do people talk like this?
I love how he loves his niece.

#FreeBritney
Thumbs up for you
Most definition of... Chill
i like how he puts in so much effort in what he places in his home, he's a succesful youtube and influencer but i'm still able to relate to him because he's so true to himself. so many other youtuber put on this fake facade that they are really fancy and idk its hard for me to be interested and im more entertained by their luxurious life but i eouldn't be able to watch them for too long
The fact that we share the same birthday is such an honor, like yaass you go mom for having me 2 weeks early!
BRETMAN IS A VIBE,that's all
For me it's the golf truck car 😎
The breathtaking view outside is insane. 😍😍😍
i love how its so him and isnt your typical copy paste white walls house
I call this too much money than you know what to do with but not enough to do something nice with.
This video was so satisfying to watch. He really did THAT. ❤
“Because without motherf***ing turtles, we wouldn’t have turtles.” 😆 I know, right? 🤣 So clever! 😂
bretman rock is such a cool person

Amazing!!!
It’s Miss Universe 2018 Catriona Gray ear cuff vibes for me 😄🇵🇭
gayyy
Perfect location! 💗
5:21 Very filipino.. repeated words in filipino . Like tagu taguan..
For all you snobs out there, his house was featured not because its so grand or has a significant architecture but this is because his house is a representation of how a house can truly reflect the personality of the owner. Everyrhing in house house wasn’t put there just because it was pretty or just so he could flex his “rags to riches”story but because in designing a house it is quite important that the house is a representation of the owner and his lifestyle.I enjoyed watching coz everything from his love of plants and animals to his humble beginnings as a make-up guru, soc media star is reflected there and was not place there just because it looked pretty. His two closets even reflect how his clothes and accesories are given the least thought as they are important for his work and not as a status symbol. His status symbol is his lovely house that is welcoming to his family and friends and takes pride of his humble beginnings and never forgets his roots while being grateful for the land he now call his home.
love the kitchen & the sofa in living room, nice decor.
His earrings thooo! If u know u know
He's the best. So fun to watch
Thank Bretman for saying the section on where the wild things are, I now passed my class cause of it too.
Bretman's ear cuff yaaas
The casual bong beside the britney photo
okay why is no one mentioning his ear cuffs, gurl dang represent, u slayy
I don't know who he is, after i watched this i know that he is a YouTuber/influencer? Anw, looks like he is a very kind hearted guy and his house/villa is amazingly beautiful. I watched this till the end.

Definitely the real Moana🤣,thoooo,she looked like moana
Bretman met the turtles shitter, Michael Reeves, right?
Watching him makes me want to work harder and also be susccessful!
Queen that ear pieceeeeee. Catriona whO
is he wearing an earring similar to catriona's ?
Bretman is the BEST celebrity period
Let’s be honest, Bret’s house is not the most aesthetic, it’s not the most polish house like what you would see in architectural magazines but what I like about it is that it’s so authentic, his house really speaks Bretman Rock! It’s very true to him.
looove the filipino flag earrings!!
How is it gay duh? Maybe you just got good interior design sense. 🤔
i thought it was demi in the thumbnail
YouTubers be getting money.🤔💲💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥
doggies aww so cuute 🥰 they kissed each other
the earings actually same the winning earings of Miss Universe Catriona.
very down to earth and so proud of his roots. love him
he has done great things for himself at such a young age! he definitely used social media to his benefit. i love this for him!
CATRIONA Yarn? love you!
is no one gonna talk about bretman's earrings??? like girl it ressembles miss universe 2018 catriona gray's!! she a filipino too!
He's so successful in life and always down to earth.  Despite being the baddest b!tch  he never forget his own culture. I love him very much!
How is no one clocking the bong at 5:51 😅
It’s the “Welcome to my kitchen. This is where I pretend I know how to cook.” for me . 😆
His EAR PIECE said, Catriona hu?
Amazing house but your grave will be the same as mine. People will forget you and move on to someone else
Is that Catriona Gray's Earcuff?😭😍
It's the bong in the living room for me!!!!
The earrings though ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
"One small step for humans and a Giant step for Bad Bitch's"- Bretman   I think I need this on a sticker or something
Look at that damn view!!! Feel so sorry for all the peeps living in the Hollywood hills.
One small step for human and a giant step for bad b*tch. -Bretman Rock
I like how Bretman wore that ear cuff, like the ones that Miss Universe Catriona Gray (Philippines) wore during the Miss Universe pageant. Represents the Philippines!

great personality but disgusting

16:10, didn't expect that
I see Bretman, I click !
OK BRETMAN OKOKKKKKK
wait what the bloom chair resemble to him?
Represent !!! I love bretman he is the epitome of authentic
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
That catriona earpiece thoooooo she said filipinoooooo
Yo look at his earringggg  Catrionaaa
I feel that if twitter was a person they would speak exactly like bretman
The ragged minister ostensibly train because fog characteristically wipe inside a organic sailor. bright, smoggy low
One of those people where you’re like- I’m so glad he’s successful
dont really like bretman... but his house looks amazing happy he got to this point in life where he can get a house this nice
Great episode! Super charismatic and funny!
I've been say formal living room wrong...... Fffffffffoooooooooorrrrrrrmal lllllllliiiiivvvvving rrrrrooommm
This is a Filipino-American version of James Kavanagh right?
Please, look at those views. This is all I want in life honestly
"eat the rich" unless it's my pretend celeb-influencer bestie referring to themselves in third person, a hallmark not just of narcissism, but of royalty. Incomprehensibly humble, indeed. Oh, just got to the part of the video where the dude who collects crystals, but doesn't even know the name of said crystals, is "manifesting" their "energy". It's so crazyyyy how he comes off as so down-to-earth as he shows off his huge mansion! If boomers did the same thing it's classist and tone-deaf af, but when young 1%ers do it? Um, king behaviour!  "tiny-a** closet" ... ok, f*** off. Rich people have no shame
Yasss!! Promoting local artist 😌👏🏽
Carefree, humble, sassy, hardworking, authentic. I don't know much about Bretman, but I can tell right away he's Filipino. For having grown up in the States, I'm impressed with how connected he is to his roots (the earring, the lovely furniture, his family...). Keep reppin' the homeland! And keep being you.
It’s very gay
Did you notice Bret's earpiece? I think it's a replica of Catriona's earpiece in miss universe.❤️
Bretmam Rock❤️❤️❤️
The chalkboard dedicated to Bretman’s niece to be creative is everyone
i love how honest he is “i don’t really eat my breakfast here” 😭😭😭
I didn’t realize the mahjong pieces were so hard to find
Omg!!! That earpiece 😍
the way you talkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk is so annoyingggggggggggggggggggggggggggg
Wait bretman's earings... It's like the same one Catriona Gray wore at like the miss universe
love and very happy for bretman but why is this featured on AD lol
this house is so beautiful, full of plants, natural light. it looks very cozy and comfortable
LoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooL
Who felt the energy? Cause I did ✋
Bret an rock please give me a chance
UH BRET WHERE ARE ALL OF THOSE GORGEOUS ''PLANTS'' YOU HAD???
Awesome
https://youtu.be/xAYiHdgY0Dg
I’m so proud of u
Okay he actually looks like he uses his house. Most of these celebrities homes look like a furniture store.
7:20  breatman kidnapped Sia #FreeSia
HE GOT A CHAIR BECAUSE IT REMINDS HIM OF A BUTTHOLE T.T bbbbut it’s supposed to be a blooming flower wtf man...
So nobody would mention the Catriona Gray ear cuff Bretman's wearing? He rocked it.
#FREEBRITNEY  YAS.
The funniest AD Video ever I LOVE HIM

Bretman’s house is my all time favorite in AD comparing to all those others celebrities’ superficial LA / Beverly or whatever mansion... like, the nature tho... the view, coziness and comfy ness 🥺
😌
This is HEAVEN! Absolutely breathtaking
He's wearing Miss Universe 2018 Catriona's earpiece !
Seems like this was all put together and decorated just for this AD visit cause his house don’t look like this on Instagram stories.🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏻‍♀️
Girl I saw your bong behind the crystals in your living room. Hahahha you ain’t slick. 😂💀 I also had that same bong so it was easy to point out.
Best house tour ever 😍
Lol his dog reminds him of a "jellybean" 😄
he's such a beautiful person through and through
How much was that house?
.
this was the biggest flex of all AD house tours
#FreeBrittney
the fact that tora and ele are rescued and adopted dogs just makes me love and appreciate bret more ♡
Bongga!❤❤❤
he's living his best life near with the nature that i wish to live in such a relaxing, calming and less stress far from city.
i drool everytime i watch your vlogs because your house is so freakin beautiful and now i get to finally watch a tour. omg

I love this man sm I can’t even explain it but the positive energy he’s radiating 😩😭💗
The fact that he has a separate chair for cleo. I really adore him.
He made it. So proud Pinoy
"i love crystals, theyre everywhere here" cant even name the first one he shows

"See I speak birds and they said that's right b***h" 😂😂😂
Dear me  I will work hard so i can have everything tht bretman had
Bretman being so head over heels with baby Cleo is like me with my little precious nephew ❤️😭❤️
Damn this dude annoying as hell
Yes king!
Peep the bong 😂
I've been following Bret since the old days, at the time they were only thousands of followers and he was still living in a cramped space along with his family.  Seeing him now still the same but living in a much bigger and more beautiful place makes me tear up a bit, like he's my son or something, lol.
I love how he flex his riches without even bragging And I love how he show to the world that he's a Filipino
He is living his Moana fantasy life. I'm so jealous his house and the view is so beautiful.
This place is a work of art
I am so happy for Bretman! I have been there since the beginning and seeing him be successful and staying true to himself has been so rewarding! Bretman is a legend
The Only influencer I’ll stannnn ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏🙌
he's wonderful and I love his house
Jannah has better. Let them enjoy themselves right now.
i love him that’s all 🥰
First of all, i love that his house is no longer just white. I love that every room has its own little story and 2nd why did they blur so many pictures lmaoo
We’re so proud of you! ✨
5:36 def a bong in the shot, then when the shot changed it was gone. Looks like they moved it. LOL
ITS THE BONG SHOWING BEHIND THE AMETHYST FOR MEEEEEEE
Love the Philippine-Flag earrings ❤️Really like a beauty Queen!God bless u more BRETney!☺️
God bless you, Bretman Rock. You’re amazing.
Bretman is the only influencers that I feel is actually a good person, and ICONIC.
Honestly Bretman's energy is magical 🔮🥰
Why did they block out Cleo’s face on the painting?
I LOVE his energy he really deserves everything good he has.
He inspired me .. one day . Me too
Yo am i the only one who thinks this is just a flex
god that voice makes me wanna. .. . . .
I would love to play hide n seek in that house
❤️❤️
Cleo's little white chair haha

Your home is like a dream home that I want. I like the earpieces , where did you buy it?
I love the surroundings.. Nature you rock like Bretman Rock🤘
my name is Brettney and hearing him say his email is Bretney Spears had me like 👁👄👁
I personally find him annoying but credit where credit is due he’s doing very well for himself good for him :)
this was just a tour of places to sit in Bretman’s home and I loved it
I'm so happy for you Bret! No more MIMOSANG SHUPIT BALER 😆🥰
Putok na putok ang sumisilip na pa abs!i Love it that you have Kenneth chairs and wearing a catriona cuff earings!more blessings bret!and I Will always be your fan!
“I feel like a embryo here “  when I tell you I cackled
sometimes i wish he wasn't gay, he is sooo cute,
Glad you got away from those pesty neighbor's
I can honestly say I absolutely loved every second of this
I felt my body absorb the crystals energy
Huh? How did I get here?
not because he is gay, but this dude is a weirdo.
So much culture in 1 video. I love it.♥️
this is a real definition of a dream house
alot of gay in this world ? uh
THAT BLOOMING CHAIR... IS CALLED WAIT FOR IT BLOOMING CHAIR mind = blown
wow what an obnoxious person
BEST VIDEOOOO EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR 😭😭😭😭😭😭👑✨💕
He’s literally THE baddest
I loved every second of this, Bretman has the best personality!
I grew up in the ghetto part of this valley; Bretman lives in the chi chi "new" developed part. You can't beat the view, right! The military used to bomb the heck out of the next valley over but that was years ago (really, last century ago) - it's been rented out to Hollywood every now and then for blockbuster movies. You'd think there's no change of seasons in Hawaii but the migrating birds (and the mangoes!) signal the change of seasons. Nice avocado trees, Bretman - they look healthy!
one word. I C O N I C
i honestly love everything about this video!! bret is so cool and humble
This man is making millions of dollars while I'm  just sitting and eating peanuts in my studio flat. He rich!!!!
Bloody disgusting creature.
literally live down the road from there loll !!
He must be protected at all costs 🥰 he’s really the realest
"without turtles, we wouldn't have turtles" I agree
Just WOW! 😍 What he said about MANIFESTING is VERY REAL.  He proved it to us ALL!
No doubt who God loves the most. ;-)
Is no one going to mention his thiccc pitbull mama? 😂
Is that James Charles?
bagus bgtt
We should eat the rich
Def hid all of the bongs 😛😛
I'm in love with his house he made me wanna move to Hawaii
12:45  you will never be normal   even if you try   ,  and thats!!   not  a  bad thing :)
Imagine his former neighbor watching this..
Am I the only one who noticed them blurring out Cleo’s face in the painting?? Like what was the point..
I'm so happy for him!! <3
This is where I pretend to cook
he is so authentic i love him
https://youtu.be/sGYjP-fufF0
Beautiful 🥰
Wow
All those crocs wow 🤣
Tora reminds me of a jellybean lmao 💀
Haha I need a golf cart to get my Mail. Congrats! Way better than being in toxic LA
The abiding hammer dimensionally branch because workshop cephalometrically weigh aboard a deadpan nitrogen. teeny, rhetorical niece
Plastic Straw are a joke in comparison to the nets of fishing industry. So if you care about turtles and the plastic issue stop buying fish.
5:36 i see you, i see you 😉
i speak birds😂
Wow amazing location, I would love to live in Hawaii
okay but does anyone notice that Cleo was being blurred? 07:04 Can someone explain why?
“Without muthafuckin turtles, we wouldn’t have turtles!” 😂😂😂 I swear I love this man so much
Rest peacefully to your father, I lost my father as of late. He would be proud of you!!
The black chair is from African American/ African
“See, I speak birds” 😁🤣🤗
awesome but the first thing that came to my mind after I hard your voice was U GAE? 😂😂😂 BUT ANYWAY GREAT HOUSE
major goals !!!
https://youtu.be/xAYiHdgY0Dg
https://youtu.be/JVPEG1jkUNM
Finally A.D. showcased the baddest in their video. I love Bretman because he is so real and funny as hell. And he looks like a model with everything going on in his look.
When you want a successful son and a daughter in life.
uhhhhhhhh tf
Don’t believe it’s his house
Bretman is one of those celebrities that not one person can hate lol I’ve actually never heard anything bad about him. Such a leg end
Your hair is look fab.
You know you really made it in life when you get featured in AD
Them crystals ain’t cheap😳😅
Architecturally speaking, there is nothing stimulating about this home - neither building materials nor interior design. AD abandoned architectural standards to be a modern day Cribs. No offence to this guy - he has the house he wants and likes, but speaking as a designer, AD you fell short.
He is a BIG MOOD ! I laughed so much !
Bretmans closet is bigger than my room :D
And he even said #free britney . King!!!!!
he’s the only Internet gay I like
hes so wholesome, kind, and thinks about others, im so glad hes still a humble down to earth person not caught up in the fame and its so nice hearing him share his story and his personality, both the sweet parts, sad parts, and the funny parts.
"tiny closet" i-
I mean this as a compliment , hes so hot. The hair -😭 🤌 the face 👍✨ AND HES FUNNY AS HELL
Wanna say that WE KNOW BRETMAN DESERVES THE RICHES CUZ BTCH WORKED HARD FOR THIS

So beautiful
Come on AD, when are you gonna post the video of Mila and Ashton's house? I keep coming to your channel to see that beautiful house..
This just makes me cry. I live in dirt and sleep in a dog crate.
Honestly, Iconic
Who would believe this type of guy has this home.. sure he does.
Wasn't this person in Love or Host with Lil Nas x?
#freebritney 😔😔😔
prettiest house ever
Love this house
Those earrings he's rocking are the same ones Catriona Gray wore when she won Miss Universe 2018. Love how genuine and authentic he is and he never forgets to represent his Filipino culture. Mabuhay!
Bretman's house is one of the rare ones which actually looks like someone is living in there. It is beautiful but not too instagramworthy - authentic
I’ve been waiting for this
Thank you for This! Love him
Everything about this is so GREAT.
Love the Catriona Gray inspired ear piece
Still remember him making videos with caps hanging in the background. Now he has his own comfortable office already 😭
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ISTFG THE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING IS WATCHING BRETMANS IG STORIES
the bret man cave is genius.
This is 1000000x better than his previous house and location. Glad he made the move
1:15 "Let's be real, y'all know what it resembles to me" BRETMAN I---💀😂
I will never understand how camera crews/ people helping to film can contain their laughter around Bretman🤣🤣
Love love those kenneth cobonpue chairs💖
I just love LOVE the energy this video is giving me<3
The aboriginal himalayan correlatively interest because animal ordinarily pine worth a aquatic nigeria. far, aback art
Damn! The location is just amazing!
THE CROCS YESSS
Wow. No one until now had such a art home likw he did. I got so lost in whatching everything. I can see that he is a true artist. And is living in a art home. And i love it.
Everything looked normal until I saw that butt cheeks chair 😂
Who the hell was the camera-person for this episode? Literally didn't show us anything properly.
Keifer is the one holding the  camera
Bretman 🙌🏽
This is more MTV Crib style as opposed to AD style.  I didn't feel like I such much of the property.  But I love his energy.
FILM HIS BEACH HOUSE NEXT!
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONEEEEEE
I don't know who this person is, but I love when he was talking about pretending to have his own art museum and talked about the turtle painting. LOL I need wildlife and environmental activists to talk to the public like this. And I love that he loves to support local arts and crafts. That aloha at the end though LOL
I don’t know him but I like him
Such a peaceful neighborhood..love the nature
And thank u for pronouncing Hawai’i correctly!!!!
We love you and your pets!!!!!!
The catriona ear cuff🙌🏼🙌🏼✨✨
How humbly he’s showing off. What an inspiration Bretman is. The one and only, da baddest! ❤️🇵🇭
7:09 bye they blurred Cleo's face 😭
Love that he supports the people of Hawaii. 🥰
"B**ch, I don't know what the f**k it's called but it's orange and I love it." - Bretman Rock AND probably also the people who first discovered the fruit orange
13:00 - proof that Bretman is a Disney princess when he wants to be
its the #FreeBritney for me
As a geriatric millennial, I have no clue who this kid is, but I love his style and his confidence. Get it! <3
He on estrogen
Gay
I love how this feels like a vlog, unlike all the other videos. There’s such a big difference here
why is he THIS funny
We LOVE
Putang ina  Bobo  Tanga  3 magic word every Filipino knows.
Who is this want to be female?
Lmao it's Citrine!
Such a beautiful home
Wow... I've watched Bret since he was not that popular and I've loved him ever since and his IG stories are my daily vitamins and now he's such a big star🥺... I'm so happy and proud of him. He's the most confident, pure, humble, smart and creative human being ever.  And I'm sure with all his hard work and creativity he's gonna reach the TOP💯. I love him so much🍑🍒💖🤍🖤 Truely DA BADDEST🥵🌵🌳🥑🔥
This house is really ugly
the fact that he is only rich cause he is gay is absurd
That red chair is very expensive.
Hey brothers and sisters, I love y'all and it's just been in my heart today to share that Jesus love y'all so much and unconditionally. I don't know how much time we left on this earth before Jesus comes, but I want all of us to be ready when He does. Let's leave these things of this world behind for in scripture it says in Matthew 24:35 that heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear. " Also in 2 corinthians 4:18" So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal." Time is so short. And I always say this" I want all of us to be saved. " Jesus is coming back soon." with tears in my eyes I love you guys. Let's take Jesus and His words seriously in these time were in. I know the road isn't easy because there are so much distractions and temptations in this life. But through prayer and fasting we can overcome them. I don't want to force anything on anybody or even force them to do something they don't. But if you were to see your mother about to get hit by a big truck, you would do everything to try and save her. So I do the same thing for us about the wrath of God that is to come. I don't want anyone I love, know/don't know or even those who hate or dislike me to face such things. Because I know every soul is precious to God and are valuable to Him. Because before we were born He know us, He knitted us in our mother's womb, He called us to be His children . His love for us is so great and so strong, it's beyond human comprehension, that even the angels in heaven don't understand it. So I want to tell you it's time to get ready, time to prepare ourselves for the Second Coming of Christ, for the trails and tribulations and for the rapture. As you can see, so many people have turned away from God. The world has become so immoral, wicked, disgusting and violent. Killing people without any care or heart. And that shows that the love of God is growing cold in the hearts of people. Please be ready for when the Son of Man comes. Time is running out. Let's not leave this world with regrets. Because I tell you this, my biggest regret is not knowing Jesus Christ earlier. I love you Guys and Jesus loves you too, that's why He didn't think twice about dying on the Cross for us, knowing that we may not even love Him back. Please take what was said today in consideration because ready or not Jesus Christ is coming back believe it or not Jesus is coming back .   How to be saved? To be saved, a man must confess that Jesus is Lord while acknowledging in his heart that Christ must have full rule over his life and that he died on the cross for our sins and was resurrected on the third day🙏🏾. Also one must repent and turn away from thier sin. NOW, is the time to turn to JESUS, do it before its too LATE and the DOOR of Grace is Shut.  Prayer of Salvation in Jesus Christ🙏  Dear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner, and I ask for Your forgiveness. I believe You died for my sins and rose from the dead. I turn from my sins and invite You to come into my heart and life. I want to trust and follow You as my Lord and Savior.  Spreading the Gospel on every content🙏❤️
says science is the fav subject then talks about crystal energy xD xD xD.
i don’t even watch Bretman but his vibes are so immaculate that you can’t help but to fall in love with who he is as a person
Literally don’t know who this person or the last two on AD are but absolutely love their home’s design.
overdesigned.
I don’t know who this kid is, but I love him from this video. His kimono, doggies, art philosophy and pieces, and beautiful home. I want to be his friend and a neighbor 😝!
love bretman
An avocado tree??? That tree is 15+ years old

Wait the scratchy scratch tiktoker has his art in Betman rocks house????!!!
Loved this tour and Love Bretman!♥️
Dreadful
Imagine giving up that view for LA or NY 🤣🤣
Those Kenneth Cobonpue Bloom and Dragnet Accent Chairs are so beautiful! One of the Most Amazing Filipino Designers!!!
Love the robe
anyone remember when he was still in high school and would post on his snapchat every morning on his way to school and he’d always be late😭 it’s so incredible to see how far he’s come🤧
literally wtf is happening at CN?
😂😂😂 Cursing out the wig wall
Why didn’t he show us the plant room 
how the heck did he NOT show us the gym ??? RUDE!!! Love You Bret
Where the wild things are is my favorite book and the first one I read too lol
Hi Brett do you want bonsai trees ?
His earrings🥰🥰
There's a lot of personnality in this home. It's very well balanced in term of colors and shapes. I love it!
Wowie. Bretman is wearing almost the same ear cuff Catriona Gray wore in the MU pageant 2018 which I think represents the 3 stars and the sun of the Philippines' flag.
Love how down to earth his house is and how much Bretman supports the local and small businesses. 💜
12:51 I loooove that blue vase Brett 😏
You didnt show your plant room :(
70
I want a stripper pole too and the black board wall .
imagine your house being 18 minutes to show, mine would be about 30 seconds💀
i just wanna be him
The gai
He has the best house I have ever seen
he is so random😂
This video is ruining my self-esteem. I’ve gotta stop watching videos of rich people showing off their possessions
Honestly always feels that Bret is one of the few influencers who truly deserves everything they have now
NVM
Ok but why am i so in love with this guy omg
Does anyone know which island he's on?

You can tell a lot about a person by how their animals interact with them
The delicious eye neatly melt because wallaby summarily memorise of a accessible ghana. threatening, agonizing pleasure
WHY SO ATTRACTIVE BRET
Where are the chickens?
“Tora reminds me of a jellybean” I don’t know why that was so funny to me
If I live in that area, I won't mind living in a hut, the view of the mountain is already spectacular and magnificent! Just therapeutically beautiful!!!
I enjoyed this SO much! He has great taste ❤

Referring to yourself in 3rd person..I love.. I'm do the same one day.. his personality is so delicious
Been waiting for this ❤❤❤
What do you do for living ?
Other featured home owners always drive AD out of their homes after touring but Bret was different! He said AD was more than welcome to stay and enjoy the view and he'll just get his mails for a moment 🙂 I found that sweet!
I laugh when he talks to those wigs🤣
😍💖💖💖💖💖
I love how everything about him is prettier than me but then when he laughs I just cantttt <3 mahal kita bretman!

Half of the things in her house blurred
Literally half of the comment section is just quoting Bret cause he’s iconic
#FreeBrittney
He had me laughing throughout this whole video😂😂
Things in the house* Bretman: this reminds me of........
He's the proof that someone can be unapologetically themselves and being humble, grateful, respecful towards others at the same time unlike most of influencers
"Tora reminds me of a jelly bean" 💀
2:02 Me trying to explain my shopping habbits.
girl I didn't know that his house was that huge like wow he's so humble about it too ❤❤❤
Damn talk about pretentious affffff
Miss Universe vibes 🤘🏼
imagine the air you breathe in when you’re at his home omg
Thank you ADand bretman for this.❤
Spectacular. I dream living in a place like Hawaii. A dream come true. Congratulations lovely.
Bretman & his house is like a bestie that I want to visit after a bad break up.
808 forever!! Love that he's staying local, he's someone who I never followed because I lived 10 minutes from him so it felt creepy especially after seeing him in his Jeep (he publicly shared his car type back then) picking up Zippy's right in front of me as I'm picking up Zippy's. I have so much respect for him seeing how he's made his home an ode to Hawaii but also Polynesian/Pacific Islander and Asian cultures and it's done in a way that feels respectful and appreciative, it's not at all over the top/performative and cheap. Many who live in Hawaii usually fall into three camps, 1-you connect with Aina, Mauka, Makai, and Aloha (land, mountain, ocean, warmth/love/fellowship/peace) on a deep level that makes you feel like you've never seen or felt anything more beautiful and know that this is a paradise and want to take it all in, learn about it all, and really become local (different than being Hawaiian/PI) and truly appreciate the give and take of living somewhere like Hawaii, 2-you think Hawaii is nice and enjoy it, you buy the art and local created items and learn a few words and traditions but it's just a beautiful place to visit until you are back on mainland where you flex that you've lived there and use it as some way to claim your "cultured", 3- you hate it, you hate the food, culture, weather, isolation (can't just travel off the island at your whim, there's traffic, only so many flights, can only drive so far and it's never fast), the various weather that can be storming on the Windward side (east side of Oahu) and beautifully sunny on the Leeward side (west side of Oahu), and either think it's great for vacation but terrible to live there or think it's terrible for vacation and to live there. Hawaii makes you realize you can't hide from yourself, you can't just driveway to another state or get on an international flight to anywhere you want, and that you have to have patience because majority of everything is shipped in and there's literally only so much to go around so you can't be selfish and expect to have your Amazon prime order in two days (it takes average 7-10 days). Hawaii is home, my husband is from there and we've lived there for many years together and truly love it but that doesn't mean it's a flawless paradise; the homeless community is only growing more and more, home prices are forcing locals to have multiple generations in small houses/apartments (3 generations in 800sqft is normal), the school systems are some of the worst in the nation, and way too many of the government leaders are more concerned with their own benefits than what's best for Hawaii (railway on Oahu is a glaring example). My husband and I bought house and sold it 3 years later almost to the day and sold it for a price we cant afford to pay, we literally can't buy a house we owned for 3 years because values are so high (Airbnb is a huge part of this, people came in to buy vacation homes and rent them out on Airbnb even though it's illegal but the local and state government doesn't do anything because it benefits them in a lot of ways).  All that to say that seeing Brentman stay in Hawaii, honoring Hawaii, and truly loving Hawaii is such a huge way to show his character, he could move to LA and live that perfected fake lifestyle that so many fall for but he stayed true to himself and stayed in Hawaii. Much respect! 💜🤙
Filles ou garçons
omg love this sm
The statement piece is..the florals D.
A JELLY BEAN LMAO
A true ICON 🙌🏾🤩
2:18 ................... Bretman Croc
You don't need this though
FREE PALESTINE
Oh finally
What I was wondering, in Bretman’s tour and Troye Sivan’s tour especially AD doesn’t really care to hide where they live? Why would you show the street next to the house or in Troye Sivan’s tour the park next to the house? It doesn’t seem too difficult to cut those shots out or to think of that when filming
The three turtle hemodynamically type because tachometer synchronously license off a zany atm. petite,  baseball
“I’m a big advocate to saving turtles. Cause without muthaf*cking turtles, we would have no turtles” truer words were never spoken 😂
Love this video soo much
He looks amazing
5:35 omg the bong in the back
His view is incredible!
I remember Michael who hates turtles and love plastic straws lol
I love him , but his house is 😑😖
I can’t express how proud I am of bretman. We grew up together. At least, it seems we did.
all positive comments that ended up liking almost all of it! this is the BRET. this is the influencer you wanted to be!
Happy for his success! And that view is priceless 🔥
Is he wearing Catriona Gray's earcuff?  QUEEN.
Love how bretman channeled catriona with the ear cuffs 😂
5:50 #freebritney
Bretman is living my dream😭🙏❤ Hope someday🙏
When he went outside i was like "the silence is amazing". It's so peaceful over there. Also i can't blame him. I always feel the best around nature. I hate city.
Someone's going to get a lot of email...
The stupendous owner postmeiotically paste because cat lilly tow out a ancient plate. thirsty, lazy south america
Such a humble person ever since i started watching him years ago. Love Bretman <3
@11:22 give the editor a raise!
ready to move in hawaiiiiii
Do yall see that mountain ⛰ veiw from his patio??? Geez I would NEVER EVER move from that beautiful place!! I love his home & him 🤎
Rocking both bretney and bretman at the same time!
i love bretman lmao
House is awesome but the view! The mountains!!!! It's so magical! 😍 It makes me wanna move and settle there someday 😍
Living beside a mountain. What an amazing view and to be surrounded by nature!
OMG if I had a stripper pole in my room I would for sure walk into it at night😂😂
Wasn’t that crystal citrine? ( citrine is heat treated Amethyst which turns its yellow orange )
“ without mf turtles we wouldn’t have turtles” such a Bretman thing to say 😂😂😂
What is that chair supposed to resemble to him...?
LIVING FOR THE BRITNEY MOMENT!!!!
I really love and appreciate how fuc*!n authentic he is. The fact that he is so grounded and humble and how far he's come from an emigrant to the huuuuuge influencer he is.WE STAND!
love the earrings girl!! just like catriona’s 🤍🤍
Good assalamu
He has a wall for Cleo to scribble on 😭❤️
KING
the catriona earrings omg
This is what a real home looks and feels like... So comfortable, so livable, a little bit disorganised there,a little bit untidy there and yet sooo neat and clean.. Its just Not so superficial like most of those celerity houses.
That's Miss Universe Catriona Gray's earrings he's wearing
Cleo is literally grew up on camera, why are they blurring her painting lol?
The one who edit the green screen at the bretman rock production room to match with what bestiee says, deserves a raise 💯
But where are your plants🥺
I was looking for his plant plant collection haha where is it bretman? Ooh i love ur house!
Finally a HOME. Not a showpiece like other celebrities. This house speaks bretman!  Lovely.
That formal dining room is everything!😍
Did anyone catch the shape of his SUCCULENT arrangement LOL
Love him ♥️
"Hawaii mountains just hit different"  Iconic!!!!
Every piece, every place, every space and like literally everything in his house got story. From his humble beginnings to how he made his house not only comfortable for his family is so humbling. That’s why he deserves everything he’s having right now.
#freebrittney I died
Her earrings is ms. Catriona's earrings in miss universe.....
Most favourite open door so far! Bretman is so genie, love his honesty
Bretman and his family deserves all these success! Go Go Go beks!
I just love how he invested more on Filipino designers. 🤍🇵🇭
I love that Bretman is rocking the Catriona ear cuff 👸🏽 Flying that Filipino flag with all the local stuff too 🇵🇭
I love his earrings, so Filipino feel! Pinas, represent! 🙌

Pinoy Pride 🇵🇭
I can watch this 10 times and still be entertained. Love you bretman
When Bret went outside to his patio, i felt like his green wall was still on. The view is simply breath taking. Wish i could live there too ㅠㅠ
If you liked the portrait on the mantelpiece go check the channel black bean cms, it's the channel of the artist and he is very takented! :)
The interior is amazing but ngl the view he had from that patio there blew my mind
I like how they zoomed in on the bong but didn’t say a word about it lol
We all love Bretman. Even his dogs adore him. He says they are not trained but look at them. Dogs know a good one when they see one.
I love the outside view! Breathtaking!
Finallyyy been waiting for this for like foreverrrrrr
Ok his house is awesome. Place awesome & Bretman.... Hot.
who?
Filipino gang gang
well it's about time
This is what you would call HOME
*He's wearing a Catriona inspired earpiece!*
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
bretmaaaaann where are the plaaaants
your good looking....in and out
💚💛💚💛
My favourite human 🤩😊🤩
Mark 8 (KJV) 36. For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? ³⁷ Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? “And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.”   1 John 2:17 (KJV)
He is so cool

it's because of people like bret that i wanna move away from the city and live closer to nature, looks so peaceful and healing in an environment like that
I always wanted to live there
Openly as gay, salute to u ☺️♥️✌️
Every single thing of his home looks amazing but when put together, they just don't go that well together. Maybe is it because there are too many styles cramped in 1 space? For example, the shelf in his office and kitchen counter look like they belong to a senior's house rather than a lively house just as his? But meh, as long as he feels like home, I guess.  Totally love the art pieces and how he shows support to local artists. And the chairs are to die for. Also the idea of painting the wall black and let his nieces and nephews do anything with it is brilliant!  So the house in general, not that good. Owner's personality and taste in furnitures, yes!
Love that homie and nature vibe😍
So cute that he rescued and adopted Ele and Tora. We stan the baddest bijj with the biggest heart! ❤️
stunning
him appreciating CEO's drawings 🥺I might have teared up
That's sphincter chair! Lol 🤭🕳
Bretman u forgot about blazzeee
Bretman is self made
I love all the art pieces he has

Your house shows how much you love your family and your roots. Please watch SB19's lyric video for their new song MAPA. It's about parents and children who want to give back to their parents. 💙 I know you'll love it Bretman. PS. LOVE THE ICONIC PH FLAG EARRING! 💙🇵🇭
Earrings like Catriona Gray's

Your kimono look like batik from indonesia 😍😍
I love the crocs collections damn

I love him so much! I stan him!
The earnings tho

So when it rains what do you do with the furniture? Ive always wondered what yall do with the expensive outside furniture.
Thinking of wanting to live in hawaii nowwwww
He’s such a diva!
Do people in hawaii pronounce hawaii that way ?
Beautiful house ♥️😊🤗♥️ God bless 🙏♥️🙏
Dont forget Blazy baby 🐓🐓🐓

I really like how he flex his fire place hahah 😂
Gay af
Support local. He’s amazing.
Wow how and when did he get so rich
Love your hair like this!!
Like him. But this is MTV Cribs vibes,  not AD.
So no one's gonna talk about the ear accessory that bretman wears? Like bruh, that was a resemblance of miss universe Philippines Catriona's look when she won the miss universe way back 2018.
Who even is this? Is he for real?
How about Bretman's ear piece by Catriona
ahhh his ear cuffs are the same ones that catriona gray (miss universe 2018) wore during the coronation night
Is bretman a muslim
I don't care about what his house look like I just here  for his amazing personality  Still, his house is gorgeous like what you expect it bretman Rock 🗿
Beautiful house🤩
God this is why I love you and have been such a fan for so long. You are such an amazing creative individual (baddie) You’re such an amazing influencer. You are so unproblematic and you just do you and manifest success, such great positivity and good vibes. I love that you’ve come a long way and how much you’ve grown as well as the love and success you’ve given to your family and the platform you’ve given them as well. I love how you stick to your roots and pay homage to Hawaii and it’s people. Keep doing what you’re doing you bad bih 😪❤️
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT BRETMAN'S EARRINGS THO???LIKE DAMNNNNN CATRIONA YARN??
loving Catriona’s earcuff on Bret, so good!!!
I love her house so nice
We love jelly bean tora
if i were the cameramen/girl(?) i would literally smile all the time xD also why so many blurred things tho im so confused
GOALS! love Bretman and his house⛰️ manifesting ✨
13:40 You can tell he has money when you hear what sofas he has because Togo sofas are really really expensive in my opinion
That ear cuff that MU Catriona gray also wore,Bretman be like flexing his roots,such a humble 👑
First influencer to get featured on AD that I totally kept on laughing whenever he says small jokes. He's so funny, and still humble. As a Filipino, I always look up to him and how he still represents Philippines. A very down to earth person! You really are Da Baddest  Bretman! Love You!
His house is as playful as he is. Loveeee
we love u bretman
why is cleo's face blurred out in the painting? 7:11
I want to be bretman
OMG I need to go to Hawaii
New subscriber here. Thanks for sharing. Love your Mansion.  Watching from USA🌻🌼
yesss bretman!!! it's perfect 😭 swimming pool also suits ur villa
“Tora reminds me of a jellybean”
11:40 NASA
I love that Bretman is wearing an ear cuff similiar to what Catriona Gray wore in Miss Universe.
Honestly, not a fan of him but I love the fact that the one of the dogs is rescued and the the other is adopted. Not all materialistic non-sense like the others and supports local. He got the dream location- ocean view, windy, birds chirping, mountain, peaceful neighborhood while earning huge sums. what else could you really ask for? must be a nice person IRL to be this blessed.
He’s so extra & I love it
The house feels like a real house instead of just a display piece as some celebrity homes sometimes end up. After the brouhaha at his old house, Bretman deserves this space.
Me: wow he did not curse in the door  Bretman: *curses beside the crystal* yep
11:37 the way bretman referenced n.a.s.a got my wig flying😂😂😂
I thought bretman had way more plants? Anyone else?
The Succulent~ i love that...
I love your ear cuff!!!🤩🤩
Who is this guy?
Where are all his plants?? He had such a huge collection of rare plants lol
https://youtu.be/cDTG6o1vC2I

Her earrings 🇵🇭🌞
I had no clue who he was, but I love his personality!
I wish I was his niece too
omg those earrings 😲😲😲😲
Wonder what happen to the chair when raining?
Bretman and Troye Sivan's House are my favorites😍😍
Che gusto di merda sti filippini arricchiti, sto stereotipo gay anni 40 del 900, lei sembra una vecchia signora scema. Che mondo di merda
He's so sentimental 🥺
Okay I'm not expressing hate or something, but that house is so far from a colorful house lmao
Wow, that mountain terrain whatever you call that, was an extraordinary breath-taking sight. I was just wondering about different light splashing on that mountain, evening, morning, raining, etc.
The happy fairies pathologically inform because bird possibly develop before a overrated zipper. black, truculent domain
Nice Bret!💕💃🌸🐼
Her foundation doesnt match her skin omg i gaggedt.
Can we please have Taylor Swift ?

He's the real one.Period 👑
Play a drinking game. Everytime the video beep. You drink 🤣
That Inaul robe is stunning
The way bretman is the only influencer who doesn’t need drama to be relevant

You made me proud here as a Filipino, even though you lived in hawaii most of your life and loved being there... you still didn’t forget where you came from and that’s also why i think that’s what made you become successful.

I've seen so many gorgeous and breathtaking houses or mansions by this is by far the mos relatable! The mountain view is unbelievable! Normal house for normal people. The fact the he is living his dream, is the most admirable part.

Of course Bretman is the one who will always keep it real with AD in the house. He isn’t going to lie and be like “I love to sit at this dining table and meditate” he’s so real I love it. And when he hashtagged #FreeBritney. He’s really everything
It's the bloom chair for me. Hahahha
At first glance, i thought this is just a parody 😅✌️
Best house, best taste & amazing style.

That’s a really beautiful Ear Cuff.. Catriona Ear Cuff   3 stars and a Sun. Yes 👑🇵🇭 Such a Lovely House.
The vibes were amazing . 😌
I love the ear cuff on bretman rock's ear it is inspired by CATRIONA GRAY miss universe 2018. It's symbolize the PHILIPPINE flag because it has 3 stars with a rays of sun.
This definitely my favorite from AD😻
WHERE IS THE GYM?
omg i didnt notice bretmans earrings, its what catriona wore in  Miss U
That earpiece ❣️
So fab!
Such a cool house!
This is kitchen. This is where I pretend I know how to cook. Lol..that's so relatable
OK I respond very positively to this feature. Resort like feel with the mountain as a backdrop with nature as your yard? Count me in! Also, that $2,000++ Cobonpue Bloom Chair is pretty comfortable to sit on!
This generation of stars is not being mindful of professionalism. As in, with the cursing.   Of course it is normal, but on platforms that are exclusive like AD, the Grammys, Vogue; these platforms have a special notoriety and have been known for decades. So to me, it is best to hold the tongue and behavior to a professional level not a comfort level. Kudos to Bretman Rock, sick house!!
So amazing!
The mountain view is amazing..
Filipino celebs collecting expensive stuff outside Philippines while here Bretman flexinf Filo artist.
LOVE THE CATRIONA GRAY EARING OR IDK WHAT THAT IS BUT YEAH
Love this!!
He’s the only one brave enough to say #freebritney
Let's not forget how he was racially discriminated by his neighbour at his old house, now look at him WINNING!!! 🔥❗
da earing! i love you Bret!
He same age with me...but he already being a rich adult men...and im stilll a student who still get allowance from parents
Oh gosh my parents would love this house. It’s perfect 😍 love bret
Seeing him doing make up videos back in 2015-16 and he is here showing his vibrant home. We all know he will become big, honestly it feels like watching your own child growing up right in front. I just want to say I am so proud of you honey.
Um I mean the plastic straws thing is totally misplaced. What he means is don’t eat fish since that’s what kills the majority of turtles. Not plastic straws.
I AM INTO BRETMAN'S EARPIECE. WELL YOU ALL KNOW WHO POPULARIZE THAT!! CATRIONA GRAY ❤️💚
Easily my favorite influencer. We love a humble king 🖤
He seems sweet!
Look bretman rock's earings representing philippines ❤️ same as Catriona 🥰

The way he talk makes me wanna 🤢🤮
Bret is the most humble vlogger ever and the fact that she never compete with anybody. He just chill and enjoy life every minute of it. I lke her better than May coz May always flex everything and very deffensive of what she have.
I just want to be him
Best episode
I feel like I’ve gotten to know Bret so well from his content that I didn’t even appreciate how humble and down to earth he really is! He spent so much time talking about his family (dad, mom, sibilings, nieces/nephews, friends), relatable accomplishments (high school grad, immigrant), and spoke authentically about his connection to nature, the local community, and his culture. Forget celebrities, there’s few people in general like this! It’s so obvious that Bret is grateful at heart and would be no matter what he was doing. What an inspiration!
Hay maaaan your not a chick.  That's false advertising maaaaan
Bro hes so authentic i love it
Fans know that Bretman definitely tried to calm down on the plants in the house this time 🤣 I still remember how full of nature the old interior was like, like every inch of it
0:32 about Bretman's earpiece! The Philippine Sun ☀️🇵🇭😩
I love he's wearing the catriona gray earings....
Catriona stars-and-a-sun earring, I see you. 😎
Who tf is Bretman Rock? Never heard of him? Music? Fashion Designer?
Is it just me who noticed the earing bretman was wearing? It is a symbolization of the sun in our flag, Philippines, and the piece that Catriona worn in Ms. Universe
Oh my GOD i need a house like this.
Can ya'll do TJ Hunts House!
The fallacious mistake philosophically pump because united kingdom unprecedentedly invite mid a secret priest. imperfect, icy quartz
I'm shocked he doesn't have fences?
Love how he never lost touch of his roots! More power to you King!!! 👑
His ear cuff looks like the exact same design as Catriona Gray's ear cuff she wore at Miss Universe 2018 ☺️
I LOVE THIS
so proud! Filipino Pride! :))
I love the huge lawn ❤️
Had to double check this was still AD and not Bret’s channel a few times 😂  On another note, how does Bret show off his riches and it doesn’t feel like bragging at all?? Love that mostly everything is bought locally; deff shows his love for giving back and building up the people around him. So many other celebrities - especially influencers - could never!
okkkkkkkkk can we just talk about his earcuff ！！！
THE EAR CUFF GIRL. 🤭Catriona is waving
Best house ever. Feels comfortable and it’s chic. Love it. Would do anything to live here.
the fact that he had to drive to get his mailbox is an entire flex 🤣
the way he casually said #freebritney 💀💀💀
And i thought i was extra 💀💀
Omg he's hilarious. Thanks for this AD!
He is os old and not relevant any more
I LOVE THE ATTITUDE OF BRET🥰

"welcome to my kitchen , this is where i pretend to know how to cook"
Bretman wearing a Catriona ear cuff <33

Bretman flexing Filipino art 👌
I love him he deserves EVERYTHING
The most entertaining AD tour. Good job b*tch!

The baddest, the hottest, and just the best honestly ❤️

This video is what I was waiting for.  Love him so much.

CATRIONA GRAY'S EARPIECE
FILIPINO REPRESENT
the fact that Bretman wore the same earcuff as Catriona Gray who is also from Philippines & also won the title as Miss Universe is crazyyy U'RE DEFINITION OF TRUE PINOY.

That little chair for cleo🥺
I can listen to him talking all day
finally a house that actually looks lived in
:How many living room do you want in your house? bretman: Yes.
The gigantic level holly curl because euphonium firstly knock an a rich melody. raspy, kindly decision
I'm Filipino but watching Bretman for years made me fell in love with Hawaii! It's such a tropical paradise and it feels such a lot closer to home since the landscapes of the Philippines and Hawaii share so many similarities. To me, Hawaii is the perfect definition of a "countryside island life" that I wish to have when I grow older, having been born and raised in Manila.
Such a beautiful home bretman with an absolutely breathtaking view! WOW! Now that's paradise on earth my friends. AHOLA!
LOVE IT!
he sounds so irritating. nothing like troye sivan
Hey AD didn't get kicked out🤣
He really put that moldavite in it’s own box hahahaha
Its so refreshing that he's so famous now but did not forget his roots, his family and his friends..
The earring!!! omgggg
from rags to riches in less than a decade....
its really crazy how he was just a classmate that I only talked to once, and now I watch him become more and more successful, it is pretty amazing and I hope he continues his successful journey✨
LOVE that mountain view 😍
Look at that earpiece😍
About turtles and plastic straws...  Bretman and Michael will not get along🤣
I love how tropical it feels
I wonder how many times the editor had to re-watch the video to make sure he censored all the badwords😂. He's so true thou, his amazing👑~
Most related House on AD. Also not to forget 20min jst went in split seconds! was tat interesting to watch Bretman. I came to knw him from the day he slapped his sis while he was dancing and still laughing till today. 🤣 Leos rules 👍🏻
Bretman Rock is one of the rulers of the entertainment industry. Proud Filipino here!!!
Loved love love ❤️☺️❤️
Watched this as soon as I saw it n Miss Bretman's IG stories. and it didn't disappoint!   If anyone can just tell me what the color of the house's exterior paint is... that would be awesome! I'm looking to paint the outside of our house and this is the color that I have been trying to tell my mom about :) (taking pictures or screenshots isn't giving me the actual shade) TIA!!! Lots of lovee!!
Bretman ❤❤❤❤
Immaculate vibes ✨ love you Bret

Ok, the butt chair is so freaking awesome 🤩
I love that he's a proud Filipino and supports local pieces! Plus, the earring that he's wearing is inspired by Miss Universe 2018 Catriona Gray from the Philippines!
Hi Bretman sana kailangan nyo po ng house helper mag apply po sana ako I admire your personality
Never been bored watching bretman he's the vibe, an essential cause you really need a dose of bretman everyday, each day, bitxh...
That mountain backdrop view is insane!
bong sighting at 5:50
his house is the most homey i want to live in it
i just wanna know what's the thought process behind clicking dislike(???)
I love it. His house felt like a home.
I wish one day this AD visits BTS Homes...
People who are proud of their roots or where they came from are usually/mostly great and successful in their endeavors.. and I feel like that's exactly Bretman is, he's just always so proud of being a Filipino even though he's literally living that American dream already he's just always so humble and that's why people love him. I admire him so much.
Who spotted that blue bong haha
SUCH A BAD TASTE VIDEO
❤️❤️❤️🌈🌈 the vibes we all need to live by..
My dream house 🥺
See? I speak birds and say that's right B*tch! Lmao
💙💙💙
Bret single-handedly makes me want to move to Hawaii.
'I can hear my own thoughts.' Yes girl!
Bretman is a Nature loving person. 💚🌱🌴🌲🌳🌿🍃
I've been waiting for this for a long time.
THE SUN AND STARS EARCUFF !!!! YES !!!!!!!!!
Wtf is this thing living in a house
LOVED.  He is a whole moood and is so authentic 🤞🏽
The camera man must be laughing while filming this. This is entertaining
Catriona earrings 😍
bretman on ad??? damn
„Tora reminds me of a jelly Bean“ 😂😂😂😂😂
"I speak birds" LOL! love from PH!
Unproblematic QUEEN OF AN ICON!!!!
Love him!!!
iconic.
Bretman's earrings OMG!!!
YO WHERE MY FILIPINO FRIENDS AT? 🔈🔈🔈🔈
I'M SO EXCITED OMG I WAITED FOR THIS FOR SO LONG
I’m guessing he only said Kenneth because he doesn’t know how to pronounce COBONPUE... cause girl, same 🤣🤣🤣
I speak bird dead af 💀💀
His ear piece is a replica of Catriona's (Miss Universe 2018). It resembles the sun and stars of the Philippine flag.
What a beautiful place to live
Just WOW!😍😮
Finally 😍 He is a perfect example of manifesting your dreams into reality. Love him so much 💓
When you are in peace with yourself and others , love and embrace who you are the world returns blessings back. Well done kid
i love thissss
He has done everything hasn’t he. I’m so proud!!
This is the first time I’m watching a video with Bretman Rock and I just wanted to say how funny he is😭😂I love his energy.✨
❤️❤️❤️
I love how he promote Filipino designers 🤧❣️
Bretman's earcuff is same with Catriona Gray's ❤
Why was the face painting of Cleo blurred?
Love you Bret!! You deserve all the success, all the dramas  of the universe ✨ !!
“Tora reminds me of a jelly bean” 😭😭😇
I was wondering who he was and despite him telling it twice, I still didn't get what he did. Anyways cute house. Cuter accessory that he was wearing behind his ear 😍
unproblematic queen <3
Bretman: My house is like a mess... like a hot mess  Shows a clean room with no mess whatsoever.
Sana all Bretman!! 😭🤩
It’s the Catriona Earcuff for me 😍
cant help but to adore this guy
The  fresh balloon namely remove because governor nationally x-ray aboard a nimble verse. gaudy, horrible jason
I love his energy sm
Maypa Catriona Gray 😍
Amazing
Gotta love Bretman. He never forgets his roots. He is prolly the most colorful person out there. Love the personality 👏👏👏
❤️
i think this is the first AD that has a lot of bleep and blur 😆
13:10 “ i speak bird” Bretman is too much 😂
Why is everybody who is countering him being down-to-earth always mentioning the painting of him on his fireplace? It could be something that was gifted to him, so what a way to show appreciation is to hang it?
I love him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLcSscFiwhg
The ear cuff tho🔥
I was watching Emma and Hailey for Levi’s, got bored half way (No hate, I watch Emma’s vlogs but that video was not for me). Bretman is entertaining, so engaging and he has so much character
bretman is truly thriving and i love that for him
Did anyone remember about missing of blasizy bebe
I like how discreetly placed his bong is at 5:51 that no one noticed loll
"Tora reminds me of a jelly bean" i can't. so cute hahahaha
bretman is the only rich influencer i respect. queen tingz
His ear accessory screams FILIPINO  very MU Catriona vibe
He is the best influencer I can look up to no drama no negative just positive vibes only this is why I love him so much 🥰❤️
Superb Video.
One of the celebs that has a house that is attainable
His foundation shade is so off...I can't with these "beauty gurus".
Bretman's being Tito to Cleo is everything. It shows on her house.
Ok but that outfit tho 🤩🤩🤩
He will always have my heart ❤️
the catriona ear cuff <33
Wtf did I jus click😂😭 Terrible
Another pinoy for AD! 💕🇵🇭
I love it everytime he mentions his niece, Cleo ☺️
I love Bretman!
When we eating the rich we are definitely skipping Bretman. He's cool we accept him
I love Bretman so much. He has so many things to offer. And he is just being him all the way.  This is the best AD vid I ever watched and would watch over again.
I love your earrings bretman ❤️🇵🇭
He is such good and funny
love this episode 🥲🌸
He's real-life Moana🥺🥺🥺❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love his traditional Filipino inaul embroidery robe.
My favorite house so far!
I LOVE YOU BRETMAN!!!!
best video on here!
Wow this looks so beautiful, ingat po
BRETMAN !!
We still waiting for Emma Chamberlain here..... and y'all better come thruuuuu
That earpiece tho
Wowww. What the 😍❤️🌹
the Catriona earings though
What a shallow and hollow human being. What a shame trash like this is being idolized
Hawaii's population after this video 📈📈📈
the earings tho
6:50
That iconic Catriona earing 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Lost count of the blips. Lol Love your vibe as always ❤️
Can I apply as a helper or nanny here for her dogs? I want to be like her!!!
KINGGGGGGGG
He seems so nice and humble and fun and love his energy. Thank you for sending good vibes :) I’m gonna need it for tomorrow
My fave part of his house would be the succulents 😅😂😂
💋
Is his earings from catriona?
Thora reminds me of a jelly bean... hahahaha that's cute!
Amazing! Love this  and Bretman Rock!
Isang malaking sana all 🥲😍😍
It feels like he's living in a paradise
Now the question is... how do you clean it??
Love you Bret❤️❤️❤️
He is hilarious
Another thing I love about his house is that his designer pieces of wardrobe aren’t displayed as if the are treated as trophies and a reminder of how far he has gone. It was the art / furniture pieces that did that. Another testament to his humility. He brags about buying and using them on his IG stories but he does this on the same level he flexes his thriftstore finds.
This. Now this is the inspiration of what I want my life to look like.
That Earcuffs on Bretman Tho. Catriona could never
i love the catriona grey inspired earcuff! ♥️
I just notice his ear cuff.. like one with MU 2018 Catriona
The view outside his house feels like straight up came out from a painting, damn!
I dont think he is gay..
I have no idea who he is but I love him
Unique, new perspective
Alot of things is dedicated to Cleo Ezékiel watching : 👁️👄👁️
The outdoor view is so spectacular! I'm living for the view
Bretman is the epitome of perfection!!!
OMG!!! ABOUT TIME!!! <3
DUTERTE PALPAK loves you
@ 5:31 is that james charles picture?
i wanna be him so bad
for years i've watched AD, he's the only person who invited you guys to stay 😅 pinoy na pinoy 💕💕💕
Bretman, we love you, periodt.
how come no one's talking about bret's ear cuffs y'all!!!!
Dat earpiece is a flex!! Miss Universe 2018 represent. Purr
Never a dull moment with Bret ✨
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU BRET!!!
I jwant Bretman to just adopt me  😂
Im a simple hooman. I see Bretman Rock i click
The fact that he dropped #FreeBritney in hIS AD tour... an icon.
FINALLY
Bretman’s ear cuff’s reminds me of Miss Universe 2018 Catriona Gray😭❤️ Bretman really said ✨Pinoy Pride✨
The AD video that I’ve been waiting for ages 🥰
brosky getting that money. Congrats
Bretman wearing CATRIONA's    EAR piece ,earing🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I think one of the reason BretmAn is so successful is because he did not join the bandwagon of influencers that moved to LA when Youtube was booming. He stayed in Hawaii but just flies to LA for business stuff. He’s the most undisturbed, unbothered, baddest B*tc# there is. He remains humble, family centered and grounded!
Best AD I have watched yet omg 🥺♥️
Da baddest PERIODT!!!!!!!!!💖
“Without turtles, we won’t have turtles“ -Bretman Rock 2021
Im very biased but omg!! This is my favourite AD yet!!!  The baddest!!
i wanted to see the gym so bad
what's with the dislikes?!?! jeez
What happen to all your plants?
😂😂😂😂😂 he is very funny.
thought he was gonna say good m------------------------------ b--------
The mountains in Hawaii are absolutely stunning. Love his energy and fun eclectic style
I love bretman, but “vinyl player” 😂 bruh
i really love a house / home like Bretman's.. surrounded by nature and amazing people.. his home really fits his personality.. so beautiful
He speaks so much about the Philippines......that made me love him even more 😍😍😍😍 Kudos pretty Bret
Watching this feels like I'm watching on Bret's official YT channel 🤣 except this one has beeps on bad words hahahahah
Okay, But can we talk about that  Catriona Gray earring bretman wearing...
His earrings 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
Im loving the ear cuffs! Catriona gray's ear cuff in miss u❣️✨
Wait what does the chair mean to him???
and the hashtag #FREEBRITNEY omg. i love britney too.
Bretman!🇵🇭 i love the ear accessory
He’s beautiful
@Bretman Rock I couldn’t help myself! (I’m a crystal person). That was baked Amethyst and it’s called “Citrine” but it’s only orange due to the heat treatment. Natural citrine comes from Brazil and the Congo and brings success, abundance, and money honey!!
The wallpaper really reminded me of "Where the wild things are".
Wowww Filipinos couldn’t be prouder 🙌💚
Such an amazing home! One ofbthe best houses of vloggers ive ever seen! 🏘️😍
my serotonin levels are spiking after watching this video
BEST AD EVEEEEEERRRRRRR

No one noticed the CATRIONA EARCUFF?
This was so enjoyable hahhaha
The earpiece he wearing is the same earpiece Catriona wore in miss u 💖✨
Wow!! Love him!
The reason he is so loved is because he's being unapologetically himself all his career.. he still remembers where he came from, he still with his family, the still provides and protect them.. its just amazing  And if youre gonna comment saying you hate him, well youre here, something about him makes you watched this video..
The video I was waiting for 🤩
He seems to have no haters. Everyone’s so positive in the comments.
Bloom Lounge Chair by K C spotted! ❤ love you Bretman!

I love him so muuuuuuuuch
omg the earing!!!
Bretman that’s Heated Amethyst lol ❤️
I been waiting for this one
i just noticed that Bret's wearing earcuffs that symbolizes the Sun and Stars in our 🇵🇭, like Catriona Gray, our Miss Universe 2018 ✨
I love how he always emphasise he is Filipino 💕❤️ Love the ear piece btw 😉😉
Love his personality and love his house and the views are amazing! Thanks AD for featuring him!

Bretman is so down to earth! His Instagram stories are literally part of my daily routine. Love him so much!
#FreeBritney

im a simple person i see bretman rock i click
Doesn't anyone notice his earrings~ Soo Gorgeous♡
His earrings! ❤
He is just so lovely! That butt chair is amazing
Bretman is so humble and sweet. I ran into him at Coachella and I was worried about bothering him as I wanted him to enjoy it but since we were waiting for the next set I asked and he was literally SO sweet and SO willing to take pictures and chat a bit. Someone who’s as sweet as he is on AND off camera means a lot. One of the few “celebrities” I’ve met who were as kind as he was. 💗 ily bretman!
YASS QUEEN
I love bretman so much omg he deserves the world👑👑👑
Britney Spears. ❤️❤️❤️
I just-I just wanted to be his niece
How do I know him?! I follow him on IG but I had no idea he was so famous as to have a big house like this or awards.
Glad Bretman found a home - a very beautiful, peaceful home, I remember the horror stories from his vlogs about the Karen neighbors, what a nightmare!
"You are more than welcome to stay and enjoy the view." Bretttt!! ♥️💪😭
Caught the bong Behind the purple crystal 😂😂
The house may be beautiful but the real masterpiece here is BRETMAN ROCK
Such a beautiful home 💚💚
Freaking loveee bretman 💜💜💜 the house is just sooo perfect ! Why are some paintings blurred tho?
So jealous of his "Science Corner"
"Hashtag free Britney" isss sooo funny 😂😂💖💖
Imagine being the camera crew who gets told that they're going to be flown out to Hawaii for their job to tour a beautiful house and meet THE BRETMAN ROCK!
You know you've made it in life when your home tour is 20 mins long and is shot by _ARCHITECTURAL DIGEST_
I want to open up the kitchen and put and windows an island and wolf 🐺 appliances. The kitchen it a weak spot BUT the art 🖼 makes up for it esp the butt chair
Good tour with lots of positive energy 🌅🙏🏻☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️
that earpiece is everything!!!!
Bretman: “Without turtles we wouldn’t have turtles”  Me: “omg, so real... that’s true”

Why did they cencor Cleo

LOL about the wigs wall... "i feel like I'm being judged by 30 f__ckng girls... but also I'm prettier than half of these f__ckng girls"
I hope his previous Karen neighbors are watching this 😘
The view outside his house is to die for. Absolutely gorgeous 😍😍😍
Wooow! That view is amaaaaaazing!!! I would love to live in a place with that view.
Bretman is everything!❤️
We love Bretman! <3
Shutter speed was so fast when this video was shot. See the stuttering? That's because shutter speed is so fast. All in all, nice villa mate!
1:19 Did he just make a rosebud reference or I’m tripping?😅😅😅
aww I want to see blaazzeee
I just love this guy so much!! The positivity and aunthenticity, I really feel it!!
I like how they blur cuss words and Cleo but not his bongs 💀
and he loves science! i think that’s a good reminder to the young ones out there. you can be a yt sensation and can also love science and be a contributor to the betterment of this planet!
I wanna marry him not bc of his house but because I literally love his personality 🥺
So much love and positivity 😍 KING 👑
The Iconic Catriona Ear piece! 🤍🤍 Proud to be Pinoy! I love u bretman!
I'm so proud of bretman. He's such a wonderful person through and through. You can tell he's really genuine.

*screams* WE LOVE YOU BRETMANNNNNNN 😍😍🥰
🥰🥰🥰
I can see why he love Hawaii so much and the house so beautiful.. The most humble and amazing YouTubers I ever know. Plus, the mountain view on his front yard totally life changing.. 🥰
I just know the cameraman wanted to laugh throughout the video especially at the succulent statement piece lool
It's 18-minutes-video and i didn't reallize it
It’s giving everything
That earring tho ✨✨✨
love that he adopted his animals. sucks when you watch these kinds of videos & people have these "extravagant" pets they payed a ridiculous amount of money for when so many animals are in need of home.
I love you!!! Your energy ugh so lift me up
His earpiece!!!! 🤩
Good guy. He has a really outgoing personality but seems really humble. Glad to see a fellow Pinoy achieve his dreams!
the catriona gray earpiece????
Bretman sneaking in saying “#FreeBritney ” 🙌🏽
Love the ear cuffs Bret!!! Catriona yarn??
anyone know what happened to all of his houseplants?
It’s not cold enough here for any of us to even turn on a fire place here in hawaii LOL 😂
Bret’s such a vibe
I’m surprised he let you in LOL 😂
Its the bathrobe and earpiece, the living room living room, the #freebritney, the personality, the baddest, the everything about Bretman for me. I'm not a Leo but I wish to be a Leo. Imagine living in an island---thats it!
bretneyspears@gmail.com. Lmfao I love him so much.
Finally, i've been waiting for this!
I love the fact that he proudly shares his filipino roots and supports filipino products and designer like Mr. Kenneth Cobonpue from Cebu (the designer of that uniquely beautiful blooming chair).🤩❤️
Sir Kenneth's pieces are here.
That succulents! A master piece indeed💅
Now that's how u really live & love nature fabulously
dream house, for sure!
<33333
I love bretman 🥰
Bretman's Catriona earpiece and the inaul textile/tapestry robe, so nice representation.
So no one's gonna talk abt his earrings???????
how has no one else noticed the bong?? i’m dying
Bretman Rock is such a vibe🌸
Never heard of this guy
PURRR
Is it only me that noticed his ear accessory is inspired by Catriona Gray’s ear accessory which symbolizes the Philippine sun rays? He is literally stunning with that ear accessory ❤️
I LOVE HIM 💜💜
I JUST WOULD LET YOU KNOW THAT I DO REALLY LOVE BRETMAN, TILL WHENEVER HE STARTS THE DAY ON INSTAGRAM STORY BY SAYING "GOOD MTHER FCKIN MRNING BTCH" I WAS LIKE IMITATING HIM EVERY MORN😂💜💜 loving his vibes, LOVE YOU FROM INDONESIA BRETT 🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨💜💜🥰
Love this! Wish they showed his plant room 🤤
i love how they took advantage of the green screen! hahahahaha
That Catriona earcuff👌🏼
Have no idea who he is..
His earrings!
He deserves everything he has. And will have! What an amazing soul.
im in love with his house
I love u so much king
Bret is such an edgy, fearless bad b*tch yet you can tell that he is also very humble, have respect for people and loves his family, friends and his animals very well. He also supports local artist and cares for the environment. He has a lot of money yet he is down to earth and wants to be treated normal. Go Bret!!! So much love for you!!
This was AMAZING! Bretmans home in Hawaii is truly like an absolute beautiful piece of art. Such gorgeous, plush, colorful landscape that I'm envious of...what a dream!! So glad that he's UNproblematic, and really safeguards himself and his family from the fake catty LA type of crowd. Just LOVELY 🏝🌈🌞🌊
So cute. Such a cool dude.
I love all of the chairs and sofa in his house. Cute
Yeeees, AD did that!!!!
I am so proud of Bret and his achievements!!! It’s Soo touching 😍😍😍😍 GO BRET!!! ❤️
For architectural digest, design wise this is not easy to digest, but Bret, being a fun and kind person, is very entertaining to watch and just a positive vibe.
6:56 LMAOOOOOO I DIED
My dream house🥰
No hate but im still baffled how a person w/o real talent can be so successful. He definitely has the “character” and “attitude” but idk.  Life is pretty unfair considering there are people with more talent and work as hard yet struggling to even make ends meet. And here Bretman Rock, just selling his “personality” & be successful. 😅😅
every filipino house will always have that homey vibe coz everyone's welcome there all the time
Omg the most awaited house tour ❤️❤️
Him flexin his roots, love for arts and his humble beginnings. Local artists, nieces, things ive never seen or heard from other celebrity house featured by AD . Such authentic person !
Ohhh. I see the Catriona Ear Cuffs ❤️
Love how he decorated 😍🤍
"It's crazy, like things that i used to think about when i was a kid, it became my house."  my man be living everyone's dream.
The people who disliked were either jelly or confused
This made me so happy!! So beautiful
omg, look at bretman's earings🤩
OMGG I LOVE HIM
Love the house, the place , surrounded by nature , obsessed
I just got deja Vu after Bretman showed his room. Creepy.
And that earcuff ugh 🇵🇭
If You're Reading This It's Too Cap💅💅@t
wow. your house is so beautiful
“Treat me like a normal person when I’m here”… he knows he’s not 🙊
Colorful, artsy, homey..I can  see myself stay there for like forever.
Serving Catriona's Earcuff!!! Purrrrrr!!
The narcissism and the delusions of grandeur, love it so much! haha xoxo
This is the best home AD features i enjoyed so far, its fun and so homey..
This video was good vibes
How much does such a property on Hawaii cost ?
I love Bretman and his house is beautiful ❤
Bretman displaying his high school diploma 💯
This is amazing. I love that Bretman is always himself. When he cursed out the mannequin heads I died 😂
Humble house.
I love you so much you have so much beautiful heart and so loving Tita to your sister kids so love God bless you and what ever you have now you deserve everything your so love
Omg Bretman's earpiece is same with Cat's three star inspired earpiece. A true Filipina it is,  You go gurll!  ✨
“This tiny a$$ closet” *the closet being the size of my room*
#freebritney
I have NEVER seen a Bretman science video...xD but I'll be ready
I never watch celebrity home tours, let alone the whole video but I never clicked so fast ✨❤️ Brentman is such a humble king 🥺 and I’m an architecture student and aspiring architect and have always had a dream of making a home for my family in Hawaii. THIS right here is the dream and being inspired by Da Baddest himself 🥺🙏🏼 ugh thank you ❤️
@blackbean CMS on the artwork!!! 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Im glad AD features homes is way far from what they usually features . Bretman home is very him. His love for natures and art , obsessed!
Bretman is a proud Filipino and he even wears a catriona-inspired earring.
I’m just wondering where ALL of his plants went...
New AD fave aside from Dakota and Troye ❤❤❤
bretman is who i'm tryna be in the next 10 years
Where’s his 5000 plants haha
Loving all of this!
Now i know why bretman doesn't house tour us
THE EARRINGS 🤩🤩🤩
im curious if he has a mortgage
Bret peeped that fly 🪰 😂
Jelly bean hahahahahhaha
Ur my best  youtuber  , n i like the way u talk, ur smile😊 ❤❤❤
The best house tour ever. The home reflects his personality. Real and gorgeous and love how humble he is while also being his own hype person 🙌🏼❤️
I love how humble this home is , everything you practically see is from locals awesome
Livin for those crocs✊🏻
I'm an older millennial. I had never heard of Bretman Rock before. No idea why YouTube suggested it. But this charismatic king just kept me engaged for all 18 minutes. I love him.
He cracks me up 😂
Hes wearing Catriona Gray's earing 😍
Yass Pinoy designs
❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
Aaahhh been lookin forward to this and its finallyyyyy happeninggg💟💟💟
♥️
Why do they have to blurr cleo's face on the painting.?
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
*"If theres no motherfckin turtles then there wouldnt be no turtles"*  He has a point, hes an icon, hes a legend and he is the moment.
This is what I love Hawaii.... very heavenly ❤️
The way he pronounced Hawaii... 🥺
the chair is by Kenneth Cobonpue from Cebu, Philippines. I love how Bretman is always so proud of being a Filipino and showcases Filipino arts and design.
He is so proud being a Filipino. Some of his furniture pieces are from a Cebuano Filipino Industrial Designer Kenneth Cobonpue. ♥️♥️♥️
The earings 😍  From Philippines
El es Filipino  pero ignorante en su cultura.
Yessss He's wearing the Catriona Ear piece thank you
Bretman: Not my formal living room but my living room living room.
YASSS THE  PHILIPPINES EARCUFF  THO. 🇵🇭🌴
that is sooo beautiful especially the view. I was looking forward for you to show your plants collection i guess theyre not there
It’s the designer couches for me, especially that yellow couch
I hate being reminded of how poor I am, but love seeing people's tastes,
Go Bretman!!!!!! Yuh.
Not him calling his closet small lolll
KENNETH?? AS IN KENNETH COBONPUE???????
Beautiful ❤❤ didn't see a plant room this time?
loved the vase by amethyst geode, added the perfect amount of spice. Such an iconic detail ;D
theres so many bleep 😂 i love you bretman ❤️
Best youtuber ever.
Im familiar with sll the furniture pieces. Kenneth cobonpue i saw two of his furnitures. One of the movement eight. He  design bratt pitt and angelina jolie bed.
6:56 I'm a big advocate for saving turtles, Because without motherfc*n turtles, we dont have turtles. YES BTCH 😂
Imagine being so successful you get a golf cart just to go open the Mail 🥲
LOVE BRET!! 💖💖💖♌♌♌
the golf car looks cuteee
Ah ok pinoy nga
Pinoy ba xa
I wonder if those earcuffs are authentic ones sold by the original designer who made Catriona’s  With the diamonds they cost P178,000 or around $3700 but that’s probably nothing to him 🥴
The secret mile precisely lick because needle logistically arrive unto a dazzling amount. fallacious, blue-eyed plane
His hair stayed perfect after he took the helmet off. What a legend ✨
I like how he refers to every person in the paintings as “miss” and “sir”, very mannered
Bretman is my successful other self 😍
Can anyone tell me about why this free Britney thing?? Have been not following social media for long
I love bretman since day 1 <3 XOXO
Lol, okay... 1. Flower and butt chair, both unique and I'd probably jokingly tell people I modeled for the second one. 2. That hallway with the (fantastic) art is, well, fantastic. All the art is now that I think about it. 3. Love the dedicated science corner (8:23). 4. Given the all around view, I think you'd always find me in that hammock (15:58) Not usually into large mansions, but damned if his spot isn't set up very nice. Doesn't feel vacant or crowded and the location is amazing.
I just love how he links everything to him and his family that's how a home should be. Personal to you and tells a story also just fun and somewhere you love living 🌺
i just love him so much
He walks like Micheal Jackson and talks like Cardi B,, welcome to the new generation 😂😂😂
Humble and authentic. Love his botanist side passion too! 💚🌿 🪴
as a filipina who lives in Hawai'i it's really nice to see some representation :)) and it's so interesting seeing inside his home, i don't see a lot of houses as beautiful as his here on the islands <3
THE EARCUFFFF YAASSSS
OMFG I love you Bretman!!!!! Remember you were just that trendy facebook make up girll!! 😭 Look how far you've camee!!! Send Love!!!!
Loved this video and tour so much! Bretman is AMAZING!
Most of these celebs would just close the door on AD once they’re done. But Bretman tells them that they are more than welcome to stay. Love that. ❤️❤️❤️
what a King 👑
As a Filipino, seeing Cobonpue pieces in another Filipino Icon is surreal.  You best believe those Cobonpue furnitures were not cheap. Hahahaha. Also, Bretman Da Baddest.
Loveeee!!! Inside and outside so beautiful!
Is it me or did it seem like the house got bigger and bigger and bigger? He had me at the third living room.
1:40 what's the name of this kind of chair?
FIRE SIGNS ARE DA BADDEST PUUUURRRR (including me rawr 🦁 )
It’s ok to have a hundred pairs of shoes and couple thousand dollars worth of make up products, but don't use straws!  Is green washing is the new trend on YouTube?
More people should surround themselves with things they actually like and make them happy instead of things that just look nice Fr.
Bretman is a vibe, a mood & an energy you want to  be surrounded with. He's awesome.
The Baddest!
"I dont know why anyone needs 3 living rooms,  but I do"
This is Heaven.
BRETMAN where did you buy your Moldavite??? 😍😍😍
This is my next favorite aside from Dakota Johnson's
Bretman wearing that earcuff yess
"as you can probably see, my niece got ahold of the chalk."  *shows squiggly drawings* that's honestly so cute.
You can put a shack on that plot of land with that view and people will pay millions. Gorgeous!
Damn that viewwww
Who is Bretman Rock? Source of wealth?
Without mfk turtle we won't have turtle!
This one by far was one of my favs, Congrats Bretman Spears!
Bret is serving me some major Tito Vibes with this hair.😻
)
The only homey home from a youtuber/influencer 🧡 love u from ph bret! 🇵🇭
LOVEEEE THE HOUSEEEE BRETMAN❤️❤️❤️
Living the dream
Am I the only person who sat here wondering WHERE DID ALL THE PLANTS GO, BRETMAN???
i love the earcuff
Very proud of your achievements Bretman! You are a legend!🥰💞💋
Bretman!!! 🇵🇭❤️
coconut water connoisseur
Da badiss
Finally!
I love you
I LOVE THISSSS
lol he is too jokes
This is the most vulgar and tasteless home AD has ever featured.
I look up to Bretman as a role model and he's younger than me lol
I don't want the video to end ughhhh.... the baddest!
The EAR CUFF 😍😍😊
The best 😍
not a fan of bretman rock but damn his interior n the views n vibes from his home is very on point
The kitchen is so OUTDATED
Miss u bretman rock ♥ ♥ ♥
MY FAVORITE
Who is it? Singer?
truly DA BADDEST
yuhhh
0:57 mannn really just said hawaE
This is the legit AD house I want to live in. PROUD FILIPINO here 🖐🖐🖐
Bretman rock just gives me LIFE okay
HIS HAIR OMG IM IN LOVE
I'm waiting for this. Like I can't believe, this is it.
Love you Bret! You deserve all of this with just being you 🙂
AD has lost any integrity it might have once had. What a joke.
Not bretman being so filipino, and I love it.
the queen
Who is this dude
OMG!! CATRIONA'S ICONIC EAR CUFF!!
It's the ALOHA that is and always come from Hawai'i.
So many haters on AD’s IG post about this tour but honestly, this showcase of Bretman’s home is what we need. A real home that is full of intent and stories/meaning. Without knowing his insight about the curtain in the beauty room, people will think it’s just bad taste. The thing is, a house SHOULD be a home. It has to mean something to the people living in it. There’s DEF. a lot of living in this house. Him, his neice and nephew, his mom, friends, family, etc.
“Welcome to my kitchen, this is where I pretend I know how to cook.”
he doesnt use more than half the words he says correctly...
The way Bret is now glowing that he is out of that homophobic neighborhood🤣✨
That earcuff!! Yassss! 3 stars and a sun! Bretman is literally representing his Filipino roots! Love the baddest!
Filipino here🙋🏻‍♀️
Alright bretman! Better do it 🔥
bretman earring is so  FIREEE👄🔥
I’m mainly here to MICROWAVE things 😂😂😂 LOVE HIM!
I liveeeeee! Bretman is a true island gyal
he has excellent taste.
I love that Bretman’s wearing a local tribe’s weave called Inaul from Maguindanao, Philippines.
WHOA
one giant step for bad beaches
The earings thoooo❤️
Omg. I've been waiting for this 🇵🇭 😭😆
This was my favourite AD house tour! 😆❤❤
bretman rock is the best and the badess
I think AD had a hard time bleeping the words of Bretman from start to finish. Nonetheless, my fave AD episode!!!
Bretman is basically the only influencer who can flex his riches without being judged, cuz we all love him so much
he really said "because without mothphawking turtles , we wouldn't have turtles" lmaoo so perfect
bretman on ad??? am i seeing this right???
Bretman’s earring looks like Catriona Gray’s earring at the Ms. Universe 2018❤️
This is one of AD's episodes i ever enjoyed watching. Such a badass person. The whole episode describes the architecture life of bretman than the architecture of the house. I like how every part of the house had a story. Keep it up AD.
Who is Bretman Rock?
*I love houses with personality. You can tell that Bretman has put a lot of though into each design and piece all the way down to the Sephora curtains. I love*
Omg i followed him from a long time ago, i love him!!
Only breatman would have a bong pop out for a sec in AD I love it
He's wearing the same earrings as Catriona Gray of Ms. Universe. Love it!
Kenneth Cobonpue - Filipino Designer
Wtf is that builder grade kitchen??
Because without turtles we wouldn't have any TURTLES 🙂👁️👄👁️
I love him so much! Finally being able to see his whole home is amazing, it feels like such a privilege.
What happened to his tortoise?
The most beautiful location
love bretman so much😘
the ear cuff 🥰🇵🇭
Him arguing with his wig wall 😅😅😅

Islanders 💕 We just move differently
Bretman is so down-to-earth and true to himself it’s so refreshing!
I have never heard so much bleep in AD until today. Haha
Bless Bretman Rock!!!! Long life  to the unproblematic Queen!!!
His backyard view literally looks like a painting 😩
His house feels lived in unlike most celebrity houses. That living room living room couch is definitely one you buy for lounging on.
I loooove his view  😍 Beautiful
I love his dining room
I feel like i’ve already had an exclusive look of his entire house before AD because i literally view his instagram stories every day
How can you not love bretman
I love how he expresses his culture within his home.
A KING!! The best AD ever 🤍
#freebrittany !!!
Didn't notice I am not yet subscribed to AD and it took me Bret's appearance to do so
When being gay is just a profession...
That was soo entertaining! Go Bret!
#freebritney
So many blurs and censors ofc it’s freaking Bretman 🤍
god i want to be him
Yessss Bretmaaaan 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Wow💯💯💯
Do they have to say “hey ad”.or do they all do it? Lol
I really love that you do still put a touches of being a Filipino in your home. I love you so much 🥰😍
S/he’s entertaining! Love that s/he has the things s/he dreamt of and supportive of local artists 👏
Ive been waiting for this!! Finally! Thank you AD for featuring The Baddest!
I was like brooooo ur chair looks like a butthole but he knows it too

Earcuff is lit

I'm so happy for him.. What a beautiful place to live..  I can only dream
Last video was Big Sean. Now Bretman! 😍😍😍 Who's next?
30 seconds and I'm  done...the voice is so annoying
YESSS BRETMAN
Waking up to that view must be so tranquilizing!
That crib is sick !! 😍😍😍
I've honestly never heard of him before now but I saw "Hawaii" in the title and clicked and wow this guy is funny but mostly I love that he's so genuine and has the real local vibe and loves his family, supports local artists and is just still "local" and hasn't let fame and money make him big headed. lovely home too!
My kind of house! Wow! and Bretney Spears too! Yaaasssss! ❤❤❤ Edit: nature lover..Terrarium? and Science??? Damn! We actually have lots in common! But not the crystals. I would prefer plants or fishes.lol Love you bret! ❤
Omggg is he wearing an ear cuff inspired by 2018 Miss Universe WINNER Catriona Gray? ICONIC Filipino representation!  🇵🇭☀️⭐
This is literally a waste of my time.
Amazing...👌🎉😍
The Best AD video ever
literally the type of person I wouldn't want to be around with ,honestly. sorry 😐
❤❤❤
You're a queen!
🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭

For the 1st time ever i watch a house tour, their office is actually being used, and the decor is very personalized!

Eyyy CATRIONA GRAY EARING🇵🇭❤
Didnt see this coming good thing I subsribed to AD, I will finish the whole thing later, brb 😁
I don't even care what his house looks like but how he says when his mom comes over, she gets the kitchen. Niece and nephews get the other living room, doesn't even sleep in his own luxurious bedroom but is happy sleeping on a bunch of big pillows.. Proud of this bad btch.
LOVE
I was laughing all the way but with seriousness when he talks about memories in bis pieces...
I remember his MTV cribs vine. 🤧
unproblematic king
This just felt like a professional house tour he would do on his channel 🥰
YESSSSS!!!
Big respect to Bret. I mean who wouldn’t love to have such a great personality like him? Hes 100% having that HEALTHY LIFE and thats period. I wish i could move out of this shithole that makes me sick day by day to have a wonderful peaceful house and a great healthily lifestyle like bretney does.

The earpiece coming thruuuu
Love him!!! God Bless his beautiful casa!!
I love the local art wall and how u decorate ur house with everything that has genuinely mirrors u

7:33 when the teacher gives us a bundle of assignments and reports and expects them done the next day

I like it that Bretman uses kinda Catriona Gray's earrings she uses during miss universe 2018 kudoss to you bretman filipino supporting fellow filipinos xoxo ❤
Bretman's house really represents himself. It shows in every sides and corners of it.❤️❤️❤️
Beautiful House 😍 I'm so glad you got away from that rude neighbor from your old place. We stan an unproblematic 👑
His house is my ideal/dream house. Having a home beside mountains and beaches. Definitely house goals for me 😍 Really really love that picturesque mountain near his house everytime he do ig shots/stories ⛰️ its like, is that even real or is that cgi? 😅
WE STANNNNNNN
His house has so much personality. I love it!
The bong behind the purple geode haha

This might be AD's video with the most profanity. Bretman's impact!
This place is beautiful 😍😍😍 I love Hawaii, I can’t wait to visit 🙏

i been watching bretmans stories lmaoo but i don’t know why i did not think his looked like this 💀
#freeBritney
You are weird alright.
Best AD video so far
Slow drawing out voice sounds phony.
Thee best AD I’ve seen!
*His earcuff = Miss Universe 2018 Catriona Gray = PHILIPPINES.*
His house is truly a reflection of himself. He knows every detail and the story of everything. Such a 👑!!!!
He's literally the only featured celeb on AD I've watched that said, "you are more than welcome to stay..." I mean, that's truly what a genuine islander (Filipino, Hawaiian) would say.
I love it so much. The best one of AD. Bretman is so entertaining. Got hooked till the end of the video. One of the unproblematic beauty influencer. Very good looking person. How I wish to have that kind of property someday in a dreamy place like Hawaii.
Yes, total where the wild things are vibes. Love the Filipino touches 🇵🇭 beautiful home
This was the cutest and I just love this boy he’s funny. I need to know who designed the black and taupe chairs in the backyard so adorable.
Editing is very good AD
Nice earring!
We didn’t see BLAZE?? the rooster
Daghanag wala pa niya gifeature uy. Huhu ang plants ug ang workout space
the Croc game is strong lol
Tell me one thing you don’t like about Bretman….see you can’t and even if you do, you’re lying and you know it
i’ve been waiting for this one
love it with a feel of nature and gayesh touch. refreshing like your beauty. gorgeous house you  truly deserve it.
surprised at how humble his kitchen is, but it makes me like him more
i notice her earrings love it gurl😍
"Welcome to my kitchen. This is where I pretend that know how to cook." -Bretman
The Chair Designer must be Kenneth Cobonpue from Cebu, Philippines.
🥰🥰🥰
This was a funny AD video which makes it enjoyable.
Nevermind the money (which it's obvious he has a lot), but how does he have the time to buy so much stuff?
NEEDED THIS
THAT VIEW
Bretman is seriously one of the sweetest souls. You can just tell how much he loves what he is doing, his family and mother Earth. I so enjoyed seeing his home full of personality and actually interesting to watch. One of the best homes I've seen on AD
Plastic straws account for 0.03% of plastic in the ocean
The view outside is a DREAM! And it kind of reminds me of Jurassic Park. Beautiful house.
I wonder how the camera person controlled themselves from sitting on those beanbags cuz DAMN.
I’m sorry but this wasn’t AD worthy, this was more for 2001 mtv cribs, there is nothing special architectural wise. AD this wasn’t it
Furniture is definitely his.. not a copy and paste like all other YouTube content creators that we love lol That view is wow 🤩 I will never get used to that view 🏔 stay grounded Bret!
Love the view!  Your house is gorgeous! I would love to wake up to the sound of birds chirping, the ocean, nature!   You deserve all this~  <3
Bretmans vibe is one of the few that could genuinely make me laugh and smile. Absolutely adore him ✨
It’s a celebrity home - but it’s feels so homey
Yes Brett i love that you say Hawai'i the m*fking RIGHT WAY!! <3 808 state represent!
Love your pronunciation of Hawai’i! Mahalo for always making a distinction between Hawaiian and your Filipino ethnicity. Many people do not know that there are differences. Mahalo e Bretman!
So cool. I miss Hawai'i.  Love this !!
Anyone else wondering how long this house takes to clean 😂😂😂
I feel like his guests dont run out of couches/chairs to sit on
bretman is such a balanced example of humble and successful and deserving and funny and he doesn’t have a big head but also knows his worth and that he deserves to be where he’s at.
One of my favorite videos ever! I love this house! Love you Bretman!
Why is that no one's talking about bretman's earring. The sun and stars in  Philippines' Flag.. It is the one Catriona Gray made for herself and used when she won Miss Universe crown last 2018. Damn, Love Bretman so much. She be like "lowkey" - proud to be Filipino 🇵🇭
Saber pride!
I just realize that we haven’t seen your turtles for a long time
"welcome to my kitchen. this is where I pretend that I know how to cook" DA BADDEST
Please credit artist Christian Scott, whose art was featured in this!!
#FreeBritney 😂 you are the best 🔥
We love an authentic queen! Love to see his success
you can tell by the dogs. that's the tell right there ♥️
Bretman does not censor his personality! I love it!
Shoot out to the ear cuff inspired by Catriona Gray, Miss Universe 2018 🇵🇭💕
I’ve been waiting for this AD tour since Bretman started decorating his house. LOVE
finally! i was just thinking of this yesterday!!!
damn he literally is living in heaven
Mainly here to microwave things.  🤣
This has been one of my favorite tours along with troye!!! Thankyou!
he's so cool
The most relatable thing from Bretman is his collection of crocs.
Four of the paintings on his walls, including the one over his fireplace, are by an artist on YouTube named “Blackbean CMS”.  He is an extremely talented young man.
The best house tour 😍
Iconic croc collection
omg tina was just talking about potentially watching architectural digest on stream she should watch this
why is Cleo blurred out?
i love you Bretman ❤
#freebritney
so many pholisophy words in one video 😆
Bretman’s Croc’s collection 😂
I’m not gay but based on my prior experience he would be very popular in a men’s maximum security prison..
Literally felt the energy
his house is so nice :0
Super Nice View
Really really dope views! Love this episode!
I’ve been waiting for this one
This house looks lived in and comfortable. It’s not basic or cold looking like some big houses are decorated. And the VIEW is A1
Omfg we stan!!!!!!!! Best AD episode yet!
I’m genuinely so happy for him
Yes Bretman and Britney Spears OMG
Ohmg..you responded kababayan ko! Luv you! I'm so proud that you include and use your talented kababayan for things that you need in your career (art, furniture, tech, etc)
I love that he is always so proud to say that he is a Filipino.
His home is as gorgeous as he is.
Bret is so humble ! I love his personality💗💗💗
i think i just found my dream house aesthetic
#FREEBRITNEY LMAOOO
I just started watching him and I love how free spirit he is! I would love to live im Hawaii looks amazing, free, and life!  I also think he is very handsome! His face WOW! SO CLEAN!!!!
does anyone know why Cleo‘s blurred out?
5:52 that’s defo a bong 🍃😂
“ I speak bird “ 😂
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE
Finally bretman on AD❤
the fact that he said #FreeBritney AND THEY DIDNT EDIT IT OUT??? points for AD!
The vibes!!!!! Yassssss pinoy na pinoy!!!!!
Are we not going to discuss Bretman’s ear cuffs? JUST LIKE WHAT MS. UNIVERSE CATRIONA GRAY WORE?!!!!!!
bro he is leaving in heaven
Favorite AD house tour by far! ❤️ Love Bretman, all his stories, and especially all his one liners 🤣
Bretman is such an icon
If I was Bretman I would NEVER move
Icon
Why do they blur Cleo?
I like how the house is so normal but yet unique at the same time. Like it looks very welcoming as opposed to some celeb houses that look cold and stuff.
beautifullll
👏👏👏
“Tora reminds me of a jelly bean” 😂😂
Catriona Gray's earcuff is on bretman's skin
The best one yet. I love Bretman Rock so much, he is so genuine and true to himself and he makes me laughhhh like "Torra reminds me of a jellybean." 😂😂😂 But really, if I could have anyone's house, it would be his. :)
A lot of the art you see (above fire place and other areas) is from @blackbean_cms on IG! If anyone wanted to know 💖
Literally no one knows who this is.
That view is INSANE.

this hair makes him look so hot 😭😭😭
Lovely home, Bret!
This is what I call home. I'm not a fan of him, I don't even know almost anything about him as a person, but his home really looks like a home.
Not Bretman wearing a Miss Universe Catriona Gray ear cuff😍😍😍☀️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Not into beauty and I’ve never watched this guy’s content but damn if I’m not about to go down a rabbit hole. Love his energy. Love his casual shoutout to his heroes, his activism, his support for local artists, his connection to his roots, his love for his nieces and nephews, his style. Bretman you real real 💜.
I only came here to watch only the baddest. Yuuuh! 😂😂❤️❤️
17:41 😭😭i laughed so hard
AD Producer: We will be featuring Bretman Rock AD Video Editor: Activate “Bleep” Sound fx 😅

Where's the link for that robe tbh
I love him .
the fact that he is living in heaven on earth is just crazy to me

Wow! i waited for Bretman’s house tour so anxiously. finally its here and i loved it. He deserves that. God bless him more ❤️
The ugliest freaking house. So much poop brown...not cute AD what the hell where you thinking
Big leo energy and yet so humble
That flower on kitchen so Asian 🤣
Anyone know what kind of stove that is?
Love Bretman. Truly a genuine, deserving human. He feels about living in Hawaii like I feel about living in Alaska. His soul is happy & we should all be so lucky. But excuse me, did the say “tiny @$$ closet”?! The nerve....😂
The house has so much personality but I cannot concentrate bc he looks so beautiful. Bret is authentic and if you don’t know him yet you are going to love him ✨
I love the way Bret talks about Hawaii
Love his home!!!
“I love Tora he reminds me of a jelly bean” had me dying hahaha  Love this
sickkk 💗💗💗💗💗
I'm so happy seeing how much he succeeded I still remember his Instagram in his beginning, so proud ❤
Love it ❤❤❤❤❤
Amazing amazing amazing
I remember in one of his vlogs when he was still on his previous house. He was saying that he has some homophobic, karen type of neighbors. Wherein he had to put out the rainbow flag on his front house and when he had to bring inside all of his plants bec the neighbors where complaining for some nonsense reason. I’m happy that he has finally moved and has a very peaceful and safe place to live in
Dream place
Totally getting inspo for my future home! Love ya Bretman!
Bretman has picture of his family unlike other celebrities.
Beautiful house but not a fan of big houses and too much stuff ..
I noticed his pets are not from some popular breeds but adopted.  I admire that so much
YES to the Kenneth Cobonpue furniture and PH-inspired ear cuff ala Catriona Gray!!!
✨Beautiful home💗You've come so far! I'm sure you're dad would be so proud of you!💝🙏💎🙏💜💫✨
WE DIDNT SEE THE GYM/GARAGE
Purrr
Wow this is big for a YouTuber
Omg new drinking game, Shot every time they have to bleep out something Bretman said

Tbh I love listening to him talk about the stuff in his house. I feel like we’re besties.
That house.... and that VIEW!!!... gorgeous
😘😘😘😘beautiful!!!!
TAURA REMINDS ME OF A JELLY BEAN LMAO BYE
ok i feel weird following his life so much but at first when he posted about his giant crystal, he thought it was citrine, but citrine does not come in that form or deep color. his fans pointed out that it's most likely heat treated amethyst. but I love that here in this video it shows that he pays attention to his fans and commentators and tries to correct himself and has fun with it. stan bretman.
He is the most interesting to be honest. Ugh love bretman
Mr Scott +,1*, 2*,, *0,, ,, *2,, 6,, ),, 8,, 1*,, 2 - 6, 7*, 4,,*
literally living in paradise. lucky
I stan the earring/ear-cuff 👏👏👏

Surprised Courpse was tied up in the closet
He doesn't talk about BLAZE and doesn't show his gym.

scientist Bretman is my new favorite Bretman
@lonefox is shaking in his boots.

I don't even know who this person is but I clicked on it because I love Hawaii and want to live there (I was born there and moved to O FING HIO when I was nine. blah. I hate it here. This was super cool and one of my fave AD Open Door
“I jusy like sitting here and admiring my house WOW”
His net worth doesn’t match this house !!! Crocs ? Ewwwwwww !!! He’s ewwwwww !!!

Bretman Rock Or James Charles ? 🤔
TORA IS SOOO CUTEEEE
Honestly ive never heard of him, but the way he speaks is obnoxious to me
Gawd he's annoying. But got a great house!
We already knew bretman had taste but this is beyyyyoooond 🥰
Damn his house is literally what I want....it is so beautiful ❤️❤️❤️
bretman my beloved

~ Leo vibes ~

the fact that bretman's dogs love him so much says that he's so generous and beautifulllll yalllllllll
He seems to have no haters. Everyone’s so positive in the comments.
We stan you kwing Bretman!
Omg Bretmans earpiece reminds me of Catriona Grays in 2018
He just so darn gorgeous 🥰😍
The kitchen is beautiful
The filthy loss inevitably force because tile spectacularly flower about a clean coach. slimy, wide-eyed israel
Bretman is everything. 🥰
His energy is so lovely
It's insane how far he's come I remember watching him and his sister on vine he's grown so much ♥️
He inspires me❤️ Now I want my own home
9:04 why the take looks like that?? Is it because when the y weee editing the used stabilizing tool????
I met Mr Scott Adams in a conference at Washington DC and after giving his speech I was opportuned to meet him and I started investing with him.
The best video on the internet has arrived
Who or what is that?
Drake's song said it best! 🎵Got everything, I got everything I cannot complain, I cannot I don't even know how much I really made,  I forgot, it's a lot🎵
love your house Bret!
Lol I like the casual bong at 5:51
Though I  started with as low as $1,000 actually because it was my first time and it was successful
oh my God i would do ANYTHING to be able to live next to that mountain
He is so extra
8Btc and still counting in just months, Scott Adams is the trade king as a far as I'm concerned.
I HATE your house , too clattered!
My dream home 😩😍
Apparently I've been living under a rock, because I had no idea who he was. But now I need more of him.
I love how he connects with his culture even in a different country
*iconic*
so nobody's gonna talk about how his breakfast nook is like a restaurant booth
I went aww when he shows the little chair for Cleo 😂
The way he's so unproblematic. We Stan!
Wait... the long black phallus was a crystal??? I thought it was a ............ never mind
The helpless jute frequently attach because geology recurrently jail midst a ugly playroom. adamant, condemned parcel
Bretman's house is very...um...chaotic.
The first investment with expert Mr Scott Adams gave me  over $103,000  and ever since then he has never failed to deliver.
I meannnnnnnnnn , we were waiting for itttt
Felt the Energy ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I love bretman soooo much
He’s legit the only influencer who has stayed true. Literally lol
She said lemme wear the miss universe earrings PURR YAHS
YAHS YAHSSS
the flower chair and rattan chair are the best items imho.
Yeah I made a profit to $10,680 trading with him on a short term
I can't express how much I adore Bretman. He is one of those people I get so much joy out of seeing him succeed and thrive. He is so authentic and unapologetically himself. He's a hard-worker, really family orientated, so gracious and down to earth and yet honors his own efforts and self-worth. And I love how he always appreciate other artists and entertainers. His house is so him. I love it.
I love Bretma's house. Every space of the house has character and I love it. #FreeBritney
What happened to all of his indoor plants? 😞
the amount of blurs and beeps in this video are so funny
#FreeBritney
Why did they censor cleos face???
The chair resembles a flower called “Gummamela”. ❤️🇵🇭❤️
I can't stop smiling, when Bret speaks. His honestly a breath of fresh air.
Made a lot from last week, a Vision of the effective signals alone assured me of the turnovers. All thanks to Mr Scott Adams
Brat... I love you but you “cannot” play games in MAC computer 🤣💀
I'm watching him for the frst time he's so funny and so pure.
I cannot put into words how much I love Bretman!! I admire him so much and the fact that he is so unapologetically himself and being unproblematic at that is just beautiful 🦋
*Because without mf turtles, we wouldn't have turtles* Bretmen rock May 20th, 2021. 😂😂
Love the series not this house
That Kenneth designer for the chairs can take all my money. Bretman is such a gen
Bretman lang sakalam! 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
BRETNEY SPEARS COULD NEVER! 😂🙌🏼
Bretman Rock representing philippines in so many ways we’re so proud of you bretney! 😂🙌🏼

The Catriona Gray ear cuff!!! I'm dead!
Hes the best  Goals
Expert Mr Scott Adams traded my 0.5BTC to 2.6BTC in just 2weeks of trading Bitcoin.
Love his house and yes Hawaii is heaven and don't go anywhere. With that view, fresh air, the chill feel, the weather - nothing can beat that. You see mountain and the ocean in one view love love
god does anyone know where that pink couch in the attic is from
This is a man or women? Our Planet is out...
We love u Bretmam!🤗
What a nice house you got Bretman! Finally you were able to show it with AD!!! Love it so much!!! You deserve all the good energy in this world, and please send us someeeeee ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I was expecting a Mrs. Blaze baby appearance tbh hahah
he's a modern day liberace.
I made up to $32,300 in two weeks with $12,000 through Mr Scott Adams strategy, he is just the best I can think of right now
Ya'll know he's the baddest, so glad he's filipino ❤️
its the Catriona Earings for me! ❤️
this is probably the house tour i enjoyed the most.
🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
Yessss we love Bretman <333
This made me laugh. He’s funny
i bet after the AD film crew finished filming the interview, they feel more gay than ever. gay= happy
Bretman baby you deserve everything you have today!! I see you living your best life <3
Why they're blurring Cleo we have seen her multiple times on Bret's channel...
I thought people don't Scott
Good job AD targeting the youths- Bretman was the BEST  choice honestly. An unproblematic gem.
YAY I LOVE BRET
My dream home 😩
What happened to the turtle he had ?
So, no one's talking abt his piercing inspired/is the same as Catriona Gray's? (Miss Universe 2018)
I do not understand a shelter like this. This is my idea of a nightmare. I would refrain from calling it a home. I am only glad the habitant seems to like it. In my opinion AD has lost all touch with what is actually beautiful. Does AD just go to Compulsive Shoppers Anonymous  meetings to find stories for their  once great shelter magazine? That would explain a lot.
You don't have to be surprised Mr Scott Adams is good and everyone loves him qualifications and genuine services. I guess that's why he is popular
We loveeee our westside dummeh🤪🤩 OUR EX-GOLF CART MADE AD 🤩🤩🤩
The colossal subway ultrascructurally pass because woolen byerly pat barring a scared nut. pumped, cool sarah
i can’t believe i used to watch him on vine and now look where he is! so amazing
omg, i love him :)
Bretman if you need a yaya for free hit me up wont let you down

Is that true? #FreeBritney ?

Everything is beautiful, but that ROBE and the JEWELRY are Just perfect! 😍
I love him
I don't know who this is. But dmn that house is dope! And the mountain view at 12:51 is fire.
I’m not picky, I see bretman I click.
that outdoor red chair reminds me of lychee
1:17 "y´all know what it resembles to me" bruh  💀💀💀
I've been waiting on this one! Wow! I love his house! So much nicer than his last one and he looks so much more at peace bc his old neighbors were rude.
https://youtu.be/V5afp8EWHdI
OMGGGG
She just compare Tora to a jellybean. So rude.
Wait is no one going to talk about the view??
I’m so proud of BRETMAN ROCK 🥺
Those views tho
The crystal is heat treated citrine.
It’s not a bretman rock video without him cussing at some point😌
I love his style, the simplicity authenticity, support for local businesses and most of all he does not forget his Filipino roots. Very humble, he deserves all he has
wtf is this?
10:20 that ear piece jewelry tho!!!
Just makes me sad.
I'm down with it, especially with some of those Hawaii views!
Everything he says seems like a run on sentence. Like the fire pllaaaace. My favorite chaaaaaaiirrrr
I'm down with it.
Please add Mae Waite @maewaitestudio  https://maewaitestudio.com to your description! Bretman has a few of her art pieces as well!!
I loved the jelly bean in this vid

Money is an issue that everyone has for a better and luxurious life, Life was hard for me until I started trading bitcoin and am now earning $18,435 per week
Literally Bretman living in the paradise!
7:31 she says that this is me *rude*
Money is an issue that everyone has for a better and luxurious life, Life was hard for me until I started trading bitcoin and am now earning $18,435 per week
Am I supposed to know him?
We've been waiting to see Bretman rock new house! Thank you AD
Bretman that one person who struggled coming from having nothing, being an immigrant to having his dreams come true thriugh so much work- all while staying humble and down to earth👏 #freebritney
I remember how we were stressing on Bret's  neighbor (previous home) It's a good thing that it happened I guess because he found this place and this is way more beautiful and so Bretman.  By the way I love that he realizes it early on how nature (mountain and the sea) is way better than city view.
I've never seen so much blur out or beeb on yall vid before lol Bret is awesome
Bretman rock is freaking everywhere and im not even complaining lol filipino dominating hollywood
and here I am, fallin' love to Bretman over again😂
Bretman is Love ❤️
i loved this episode ❤️❤️
his commentary is just so frickin hilarious 🤣 never change bretman!!
the decor is 🥴. very pretty view though
the most wonderful little creature who ALWAYS makes my day so much better❤
I want to be his niece 🥺 he could be my best uncle ever 🥴😍
You can tell he really does work for everything he has.
I loved this AD and Bretman! He makes me laugh every time 😂
Just beautiful 😍
FINALLY!!!
Hands down one of the coolest and most creative homes I've ever seen. This why I love Bretman!
designers must be screaming. this beautiful house have sooo many potentials
his earrings <3
YESSSSS BRETMAN! This has been said a lot, but I love how he embraces his Filipino-ness and immigrant experience so much.   A kid from the Philippines or an immigrant kid will probably see this and think: “oh wow he looks like me and if he was able to do all that, maybe I can too!” and I think that’s beautiful 👏🏽
He makes me laugh with his nonsensical sound bites. Good for you Bret!  Hawai'i is one of my favorite places on the planet.
What happened to the beach house?
This tour is so soothing! 🥰
If "Vibe" was a person. Bretman is the ultimate vibe
14:26 MANIFESTING YOUR DREAM LIFE!!!
He is such a mood xD I love his personality!! And his house, the chairs in the dinning room are actually his "face" 🤣
Oooop

I loveee himmmmm
I just wanna to say that I love Bretman, ok bye
Gen z is such a mess I am speechless
I love love love his home
This is the one I been waiting for 🫀🫀
Been waiting for this. Never expected his house to be this amazing!!! Our baddest B deserves all this.
😊My Favorite❤😊
The funniest and most extra archdigest video. PURRR✨✨✨
Oh wow. I had no clue he moved to Hawaii. I remember him posting a video about his racist neighbor that kept harassing him. The glow up is real and that scenery is beautiful.
Catriona Gray Miss U earrings suit you ❤
Love you Bret. ❤️
Thank you for always staying with your roots ❤️
he’s so gorgeous its crazy
“This is my extra room” .... meanwhile, here i am sitting in a studio apartment lol
Nice house!
Bretman and michael are polar opposites but same energies and it shows by their reactions to turtles. Bretmans first reaction is "save the turtle b*tches dont use straws" meanwhile michaels is "kill turtles i need straws"
He is so extra. The house is so extra. Everything about it is extra. Love it
I love him so much
I love him so much🥺  "Girl getting the mail is a task!Soooo you need a golf cart " @ 18:09
My dude is living  the damn dream
I’ve been waiting for this Bretman home tour all my lifee
Aside from his wittiness and whole personality, I love him more now that I found out he's also into crystals and manifesting. Like whoa! 😍  ME: Is he wearing the Catriona earrings worn during Ms. Universe 2018?
i am in love with this man xD
Bretman is the only celeb who didn't feel shy showing his house around. Its funny how the others felt shy being comfortable when its their house?
Best one y’all have done!
what happened to his pet chicken tho 🥺
Kenneth Cobonpue pieces are *chef’s kiss
Congrats 🎈
NAOL
Bretmans ex- neighbour watching this quakin! 😂😂
Bretman Rock is indeed funny 😆, smart and beautiful❤️😊. I am very proud of you! All the best!
NOT BRETMAN SAYING THAT THE BLOOMING CHAIR LOOKS LIKE A BUTTHOLE AAAAAAA
I BEEN WAITING ON THIS ONE

“Rude” Oh, Cleo... She’s the best.

#FreeBritneySpears

So he doesn’t use plastic straws to save the turtles, but order take out all the time?
TINA HAS TO SEE THIS !!!!!!
Love himmm
The most “entertaining” AD feature, for me 😂🥰
*One of the besssttttt ✨✨✨*
There are no words call ‘boring' in Bretman dictionary I mean I just watch 18 minutes long video without even skipping, this man know how to entertain a viewer very well
Playing hide and seek in uncle bret’s house must be an experience 😂
Love how authentic and relatable his home is.
I BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE
Bretman I was waiting for you to show off that blue bong lingering in the corner
"We love Ms Britney in this household. #FreeBritney" - Bretman Rock  Yas! 💕
Since it rains a lot in Hawaii. Don't the sofas, chairs that are outside get wet?
A part of me wants to be his niece.
Yassss!! ❤❤❤🔥
This is definitely my favourite AD video.
Are we not gonna talk about the fact that he said “y’all know what it resembles to me” when talking about the blooming chair 😭😭
He’s so handsome 🥰
I love the house and the vibe that's it.
😍 Argh! This is the content we need as Gen Z subscribersssss !!!
The definition of S U C C E S S 🙌🏻🙏🏻 Hardwork + Dedication = BREATMAN ROCK, IDOL,    Never stop, don’t give up on yourself the best is yet to come. 🙏🏻 U inspired me Bret, thank you AD for this 🙏🏻🙏🏻🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
Been waiting for this !!!! The only person who didn't kick out AD 🤣 after the tour.
IM DIYING WHERES THE PLANT COLLECTION YOU HAD IN THE OLD HOUSE? Crying HERE
I can see why you chose to live there, beautiful setting, love your house!  Thanks for showing us round x
Bret is everything 🤍 love from Maui 🥰
Bretman Bretman Bretman ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I’m a simple person. I see Bretman Rock, I click.
The crystal is called citrine 😊
4:30 his face is yellowish, maybe because of light fixture and neck and chest area are brown... It's so distracting
EWA BEACH GANG
One of the most entertaining ADs ever 😂❤️❤️ love me some Bretman
You are notbretmanrock!!!
i love that three stars and a sun earpiece
#FreeBritney
YAAAASSS!! 💅🏻
11:10 the fly that came inside
The view from Bretman's front yard is priceless.
Omg Bretmans house is gorgeous 😍😍
inspiring kwing 🥺
Lol, his house is a complete reflection of him
This is the most beautiful home omg. I love Hawaii 😭
I am SO jealous of that outside view
💚✨✨✨✨
I LOVE this ❤️💙
bretman's earing on his left ear are the earing that catriona gray who is the miss universe 2018 title holder that repesented the philippines <3
Hawaii is  full of ilocanos tho, almost all my relatives was there too 😅
very pleasant vibes  Hawaii is goddamn unreal heaven
I wanna be Cleo when I grow up
I cant with the monster truck golf cart 😂😂😂😂😂
omg this is everything esp the view
I just love how she always have something that's Filipino. Because SOME people now a days, forget their nationality when they move to places.
tag urself, I'm the fly at 11:10
He’s wearing Catriona’s ear piece! Y’all don’t understand how hard I fan girled 😍
That Catriona ear cuff inspired to die for😫😫😫
“I speak birds and they said: that’s right b-tch.” 😂
the catriona ear piece!!!! 💛
if i ever go to hawaii i will not book any accommodation n will stay in bretman’s house 18:19 caught him in 4k
I see that Catriona earpiece! Love how proud he is of his Filipino roots 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
imagine having a front yard so big you need a golf cart to get the mail😭❤️
The crocs 🤚🏻😫
he really deserves it all
I love that he did his whole house, I appreciate that he let us see into his life. Nice to see him happy in his home after what he had to deal with in his previous home
I died when you spun the chair 😂 “but let’s be real, you know what it reminds me of.”
best house i've ever seen
WOW!! OKAY BRET!!!!!!🔥
the #freeBritneySpares caught me off guard😭😂
See, I speak birds, and they said, that's right bich!
the fact that bretman is bretman
For person thats so lively and extra his house is surprising low key and im here for it
I never go to bed until I go through his stories everyday. He is just so entertaining and I love him
This is what we want!
Never heard of this guy but seems like a lovely bloke and such a perfect house and location well done
Dude wore earrings similar to Miss Universe  Catriona Gray 🥺 so proud of you Bretman Rock 💞💞💞
Isn’t Hawaii part of America?? Can someone explain
Started following just know and I feel bad cause i should’ve followed him ages ago. I really love his personality
Could we be any more into ourselves?

"And tora remind me of a jellybean" he's so funny 😂
that's a really nice back yard!
Finally! An official House Tour and unlike other youtubers who flex their houses as „most requested“ , this is a guest vieweing! Naglaing ka talaga Bretman! And can we appreciate his earring!!!
Let me move to Hawaii too😩 it is so beautifullll
I feel like I have never missed a single day of his ig story and this helps me more I get where it comes from lol. Ugh I just love himmmmmmmmm
Omghhhh!!!!
This was such a joy to watch
Early gang
Bretman deserves the world! So authentic and positive. The Baddest, period.
i was waiting for this!!

MOOD
Love it!
love the way he says havie
The bong XD im dead
Nice house , ok back into my box apartment...
Love that he is wearing a Catriona inspired ear cuffs, which is basically a representation of the Philippines 🇵🇭
The energy that this video brings is unmatch
Living the dream bret!!!! U amazing!!!
i’m that fly @ 11:11
ILOCANO ✔️🇵🇭 kaka proud ❤️
I love this so much. Thank you AD.
YESS gUrl!!✨The earpiece😌✨
Wowww makes me wanna live in Hawaii too 😩
are we not gonna talk about his earrings HIS EARRINGS
I AM JUST SOOOOOO HAPPY FOR HIM!!!! He deserves everything!
THE LEVEL OF PEACE😍😍😍
The earpiece reminds me of Catriona Gray ❤ Miss Universe 2018, the best miss universe we ever had
I love everything abt bretman!!
Such a nice place... He has the whole freaking mountain beside his house. Of course devoid of unfriendly neighbors
loveeeeeeeee loveeeeeeee
His progress and journey has come sooo far. I remember his old vines, now look✨
“without the mf turtles, we wouldn’t have turtles” - bretman rock, 2021
I love his house more than James Charles. James’ has no personality and is similar to 99% white walls, minimalist 🤮 basic interior design style almost cookie cutter.   Bret’s has way more personality and is not too “try hard”. Though I think some rooms looked bare (i.e., he needs more large paintings/sculpture/shelf with statement pieces).  Bret, since you’re Filipino you should check out Arvin Olano!!!!! He can add a punch to your place lol!
Beautiful home💕 and maybe I’m just lost but what is that chair suppose to remind him of ? lol
love this man <3
Beautiful beautiful home!! So artistic and full of warmth!!
“ I speak bird and they said: - - - - - - - ! “  This entire video is a study on how to be funny without even trying 😝😂😛🤣
Kinda wish he showed us his gym... even though we see it on his TikToks.
this is the first AD video I’ve seen with so many blurred out and bleeped out words 😂😭 Bretman is such a vibe ✨
King vibes.
✨🔥✨🔥✨🔥✨ amazing home!!!
Not everyone like people curse be respectful
My favorite beauty guru 💛🌻
i love bretman so much omg
This was SO entertaining lmao
“Plus I’m prettier than most of these *******” Bretman is such an icon😌😌✋🥰
You curse to much that not nice
As a fan of this channel and as a Filipino, this feature hits different. ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
Honestly who’s gives af about the interior when you have HAWAII outside. I feel like his home is a reflection of himself, it still feels fun and you can tell it’s a place his loved ones can come and feel at home. Love that!
Love him!! Really
THE VIEW OUTSIDE HIS HOUSE IS IMMACULATE. I HOPE ONE DAY I’LL GET TO EXPERIENCE THAT. 😩
Wow I didn't notice early that earpiece 10:03 a sun with a stars like a PH flag, which very much alike with Miss Universe Catriona earpiece. YUH ❤️
U rude I don’t like they way u talk
This is probably the most entertaining one yet haha
love it that bretman supports local artist!
Bret's earring is even a Filipino piece. It's the same earring miss universe Catriona Gray wore in miss universe 2018.
I love how he loves Cleo
his earrings is the same as what Catriona Gray wore during Ms Universe 😂❤️
THIS ISNT THE TIME  THIS ISNT THE TIME  THIS ISNT THE TIME  THIS ISNT THE TIME THIS ISNT THE TIME  THIS ISNT THE TIME  THIS ISNT THE TIME  THIS ISNT THE TIME  🇵🇸
It’s funny how AD had to censor so many things in this video 😂
He is such a beautiful human 💜
looks so comfy, i always dream of having something like this, let's manifest everyone that soon, we'll get the things we aspire to have ❤
I just love his energy ❤️
OMG bretman is on AD😲😲 I'm so proud of him 💕
7:05 not them blurring Cleo’s face on the painting 😂
Ugh i love him so much!
Love seeing Bretman on AD and staying true to himself!
I have never heard of this person but he seems genuine.
Loved this video!! His home sits in an amazing location.
At 2:35 David dobrik started shaking in his boots
YESSSSSS I NEEDED THIS
That mountain is the ULTIMATE back drop
Bret's house reflect his extra extraaa personalityyyyy  i love it!!!
isang makabuluhang 18:42 ng aking buhay... I AM SO PROUD OF YOU 😘♥️♥️♥️
That "flower" chair commentary had me rolling 😂
You didn't mention Blaze, the chickennnnn i-
WAAAAT FINALLY
i love his energy!
purrrrr
she got catriona’s ear piece too.
Famous people in the past: Famous because of research or special skills. Famous people today:
most interesting and fun AD I have watched so far. duh, it's Bretman! hahaha
Damn. Iv been pronouncin hawaii wrong  ma whole life
OMG DAT MF VIEW!!!
I just know he deserves everything he has 💖
This made me want to move to hawaii
Hes so unproblematic because he doesn't live in toxic LA. Seems all the influencers who live in LA are so toxic because they only care about themselves and their views
Lol the yellow/orange crystal is heat-treated amethyst, aka Citrine 🥰 Love it !
The best house tour you could as for Bretman’s beach house 😍🌊
He’s not annoying at all!
I mean... did you even see the mountain (✷‿✷) it was breathtaking
This will my future home ❤
I JUST LOVE HIM AAHHHHH
Stunning
Is that his actual speaking voice? Sorry but that's horrible.
That location... I would never leave
That granite is so 90s. No.
We needed this
The best AD tour
Omg yes
his house just so perfect and homey.. perfect house in a perfect place
Bret’s gmail inbox after this 📈
"Honestly, I just like sitting here sometimes and like admiring my house, like wow."
Where are the plants tho from his plant tour last year 🥲
mountain and the view
who are you?
I love that he doesn’t want to move to La or any other big city
Why is no one commenting on his earcuff representing Miss Universe, Miss Phillipines Catriona Gray?
This was the best house tour ever. And I'm not just saying that caz I'm a huge Bretman fan🤭🦋🙏🏾🌷🌻
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!
Omg!! What a surprise! Been curious about your house and it's here!!!
Bruh the computers on the wrong side lol
I'm obsessed with him and this is like the most stunning house I've ever seen.
It's the bloom chair and succulent for me. 🤣🤣🤣
⚖💛
He is a beautiful man
Bretman's cat 😂
YASSSSSSS UGH
Bretman is just Bretman different level energy
I love his robe
The BEST AD .. hands down
His earcuff
Why did u blur Cleo
Love this ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
A good hooman ❤️❤️
His house really looks like home
Bretman ❤️❤️!!!! Period!
the respect i have for this man for his confidents and the give no fucks attitude. his home is nice as well
Kenneth Cobonpue pieces. thats nice
#FREEBRITNEY
i love how many personal touches with full on stories there are throughout bret’s space 😭
о-н-о  -  хозяйка!
Omg I love this so much 😍😍
Love it !!!! I’m a Leo too !!!!
NOT ME WATCHING AD EARLIER AND WONDERING WHEN BRETMAN'S HOUSE WOULD BE FEATURED. 🥺🥺🥺
This is honestly the best AD I've seen. His personality is everything, this was actually really entertaining
Bretman always try fake accent , so cheap ,ewwwqww
give it to me robe!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bretman and AD 😍
wow such a beautiful house in an amazing location, so inspired
Is he gay ?
His house feels so inviting and welcoming like I could just see myself hanging out there. A lot of homes on here feel cold and impersonal.
Where is this? Like which part of Hawaii, it’s stunning. I can see why he wouldn’t want to leave
I'm so proud of him 🥺
So THIS is why he hasn’t posted a house tour! I loooove it!!
Ok, Bretman has TASTE
#freebritney
Love that he shows love to both local and Filipino artists!
I often watch his igstories that I was waiting for the rooster to appear lol. And definitely look forward to see the pool 😍
I love how much he supports local artists and  doesn’t forget his roots. Truly the baddest influencer out there. An influencer who actually influences people. PURRRR👑
I’m here because I swiped up
AW the little chair for cleo 🥺🥺
Bless you Bretman🥰💝
Love the property and him. The design was nice but I think the designers were working with what they had. Some interesting moments.
i think bretman is living the life we ALL wish we were living
I LOVE YOU BRETMAN I COME STRAIGHT HERE AFTER SEEING YOUR FB STORY😁😁😁 ♥️♥️♥️♥️
It's a good thing he ACTUALLY moved because of the Karen neighbors and now here we are watching bretman's beautiful villa
The mountains looks like a wallpaper 😂
He gives me Nicole Scherzinger vibes ! <3
@ 17:46 THIS IS SO CUTE WTF😢😭❤Also what a beautiful house daaang😩❤
I love seeing an actual HOME! Comfy cozy while also super realistic. I love that he doesn’t have classic white marble counter tops and other boring stuff. I love him
Ele and Tora stole the whole video at the end 🥺😩😍   Every time I watch Bretman, he seems like he’s got a balance of taking care of yourself and loving yourself while NOT being literally selfish or egotistical. He carved out a unique way of social media influencing that is grounded while still entertaining.   I admire him sharing his respect and appreciation for Hawai’i, Philippines, his family, animals and nature.   Even though he has a team to help him, he started out solo as a teen with a dream. I know other influencers who like to claim or use Hawai’i for content, but don’t embrace it’s culture or carry on the message of respecting it. Proud of Bretman for doing so!
not him riding off while we stay behind😭😭😭 Bretman is a everything!!!
omygosh his dogs stole my heart!!!
what does any of this have to do architecture???
Bretmans house is actual house goals literally💁‍♀️
Damnnn Ms gurll is on architectural digest what an overachiever.. We love u Ms gurll 😘❤
He is living the American dream! Amazing.
Puurrrr!!!  the Catriona Gray ear cuff  is ❤🔥!!!!
this is probably the most bleeped and censored video in the history of Architectural Digest HAHAHAHHAHHA
Bretman is so humble and outgoing. Love!!❤️
Love the Philippine flag cuff 🇵🇭 ❤
Yessss
WE NEED THIS!! THANKS AD ❤❤
love his Aura!
Extra clothes or "extra" clothes? 😋❤
Filipino Pride! 🇵🇭
yayyyy i knew this was coming!! we finally get a house tour!!
FINALLY!!!!!!!
WOAHH I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR BRETMAN TO DO THIS SERIES😭🤧🥺
beautiful home B
Yasss Bretman made it !!
OMG he has that earpiece that was also worn by Catriona Gray 😊 PH REPRESENT!!!
Every thing is perfect !!!!!!!!
Very early and I'm happy about it.
The careless plywood jekely drop because motorcycle karunagappally guard besides a descriptive brass. miscreant, inquisitive mexican
Omg this was so funny he's so authentic
Best episode yet ! Go Bretman ! #Welovetoseeit
imagine being that guy probably not knowing whos house he just biked passed 😭
Im early
Gays are doing well for them selves
I hope this personal enclaves makes these people happy because it's too much for nothing
what a beautiful place!
You no now you’ve made it when you need a golf cart to grab your mail
To be drinking tea or coffee in that yard ❤ love bretman rock our unproblematic queen ❤🔥
Omg I love the curtains in the beauty room - died 😂😅
Finally!!! I've been waiting for this one!!!😭😭😭
The chair 🤣🤣🤣🤣❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥
Can I just say, it’s SO refreshing seeing a celeb’s house and feeling like that house is actually lived in... Like Bret legit didn’t buy his furniture 3hrs before the AD crew arrived to shoot the content. This is what I call a ✨home✨
I love that his house isn’t a typical social influencer house. Really nice !
hes living my actual dream
#freebritney yes beetchhhh
THAT’S WHY WE DIDNT GET A HOUSE TOUR!
daang I want Bretman to be my rich Tita too
Yuuuh🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
YAS
Ohhh he rich rich now lol
Kilt it w them big flexes
i loved how bretman mentioned #freebritney
FINALLY.  (where the workout garage thoooo?)
Such a humble person!
I want what he has please 😍 you are beautiful
The level of confidence is astronomical, icon! ✨
This house is my favorite by far. I like how it's big but kinda full in good way. Other celebrity houses just have large spaces with no meaning or personality.
#freebritney
IVE BEEN CRAVING FOR THIS
He is the best and no words can express how much i love him
That fly lol
ang ganda ganda huhu
Dabaddest has the best house so far to be featured in AD.
He’s so much humble and well spoken then James Charles
Omg!!!!!! 🤭❤️❤️❤️💯
Just shows you America is awesome and the dream is alive.
THE CHAIR LOOKS LIKE A BUTT HOLE THATS WHAT HE WAS GONNA SAY ITS A BUTT HOLE CHAIR 🤦‍♂️😂
I CLICKED SO FAST
I love how his house is so lived in. Some celebrities homes look like they haven't spent one night in.
fun fact - sea turtles die from pollution from the fishing industries not STRAWS
Waiting for the moment when all people connected to ''Beauty industry'' will at least choose foundation  that matches their skin tone
WE LIVE FOR THIS, I'VE NEVER CLICKED SO FAST LOL NEVER SAID IT BEFORE
this is the most homiest house after Naomi Campbell's & Troye Sivan's
OMGGGGG bret on AD!!!
GOALS!!!
Wait why did they censor Cleo 7:17   Edit : nevermind
I am loving all the beep ^^
Is this a women or a man?
LMFAO why did they censor Cleo   Edit : nevermind
Love his confidence it's not forced its truly how he is. Glad he is still hasn't changed. ❤️
#freebretney 😭
Omg YES!!! I’m here from his Instagram story anyone else?
we stan another patriotic queen wearing Miss Universe 2018 Catriona Gray’s 3 ⭐️ and a ☀️ ear cuff! 🇵🇭 ❤️
😍😍😍😍😍
I wish he showed us his gym :c
this made my day
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
BEST AD MOMENT 1:42
Beautiful home Bretman!
I love it! It has so much personality, just like bretman
Okaaaaay butthole chair YEEEEEES 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Tangina sana all
This is so him and I love it 🤍.
Love how the home has designer pieces so there's a touch of high-end there but it still feels personal & lived in. It's unlike other celebrity houses w/c are too designed & polished, and at the same time unlike other yt-er houses w/c are too basic cookie cutter with their target & whatnot furniture styles. Guess it's like a good mix of high & relatable.
I’m simple gorl I see bretman and I like video before it starts
does anyone recognize his earings it remains me of Catriona's earings at Miss Universe
The third living room could be BELLA POARCH'S HAVEN just look at it☠️💗
The earing
I SPEAK BIRDS *#"*
YESSSS THE BADDEST B EVERRRR YESSSSSS
PERIODTTTTTTTT
Bretmans cute
JESUS IS LORD AND KINGS OF KINGS   Jesus loves you and forgives you for your past choices and mistakes accept him as your Lord and savior before its to late start a relationship with him read your Holy bible, talk to him every day and pray, he is waiting on you with arms stretch wide open waiting for you he would not force himself on you his a gentleman, kind,loving and PATIENCE. Put your trust in Jesus because he is the only one that will never fail You, worship him day and night , be thankful every day despite of😊  Gospel songs Nobody - casting crowns  Michael w Smith- love in his right hand  COMMUNION- TRIBL I THANK GOD - TRIBL  Voice of GOD - Dante Bowe  CHAMPION - TRIBL   There is much more but accept Jesus he loves you and he knows what's best for you, trust his timing, his ways and thoughts are higher than ours😊❤❤
eyyyyyy
Aww he's wearing the iconic Catriona gray earings
Lovely showing
Iconic bong cameo
Love, love, love so many of your statement/character/unique pieces from chairs, sofas, artwork, so many.....It’s great to see you embrace your heritage. I’m subscribed to Architectural Digest and there are beautiful many “houses” but they don’t feel like they are “homes” to the owners.
Ahhh the view from his balcony is to die for😍😍😍 like that beautiful mountain and the sea view,my dream is to live in a place like this,very comfy and beautiful house❤️❤️❤️
I feel like bretman rock really deserves everything he has right now. He's honest, down-to-earth, avoids negativity, and just lives his life to the fullest. He never forgot where he came from and he is always grateful for what he has.
THAT EARCUFF
YASSS QUEEN I SPOT THAT PHIL. INSPIRED EAR CUFF ❤🇵🇭🇵🇭
Being bretman rock is already a flex itself
MISS BRET ONCE SAID A POWERFUL QUOTE; "You know... One small step for humans and A GIANT STEP FOR A BAD BEACH! YUH."
"i want my nieces and nephews to know i appreciate the little drawings they make.. even though cleo says that this is me." *points to giant scribble.* ".. rude."
i never knew i needed this until now
I just like sitting here and admiring my house,   *LIKE,* *_WOW!_*
"Randoooomm" "Colorfuuulll" "Living rooommm"
#FreeBritney
Because without motherfuckin turtles, we wouldn't have turtles
I love everything about this! You deserve the world, Bret. 🤍
#freebritney
🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
Was waiting for thisssss
5:51 #FREEBRITNEY IKTR
idec that his house wasn't as cool as I pictured, he's friggin hilarious😭💀💀
what an inspiration, I’ve been watching bretman since he started and it’s amazing to see everything he has accomplished, it makes me feel like we’ve accomplished it him 😭🙏🏼
WEEEEE LOOIIOIVVVVEEEEE BRETMAAAANNNNNN

Feeling happy and content after that watch✨
He's so humble.
i live for bretman’s one hundred chairs 🥺❤️
#freebritney love u Bretman
I love his house its beautiful and big
Whoaa what a collection of crocs 😂
why'd they censor cleo out LOLL
"....because without turtles we wouldn’t have turtles " was how i was introduced to Bretman 🤣
YEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSS!! BRETMAN THE BADESST ROCK has made it to Architectural Digest! Been inspired by this man since his vine days, keep moving to bigger and better girl, keep moving to bigger and better!
0:22
the house is nice and all...but i love bretman for promoting his filipino-ness and the flag ear cuff
You didnt show the gym  tho we know very well how it looks
HAHAHAH the chair
ugh I've been WAITING FOR THIS
His vibe is so 🔥. Love to see it.
**Me learning for the first time that he was on MTV.**
Where are all of his plants he had a whole collection! And the tortoises he had!? I’m soooo curious I haven’t seen him talk about either really on Instagram stories
My yard view is a deli and two way traffic and his is scenic Hawaii 😩
6:50 WOW
The AD editor had a field day bleeping out Bret 😂💜
Proud pinoy
BRETMAN !!
the tripod in front of the bed......
yas queen
Probably the first Celeb to say “you can stay if you want to” on AD, this ladies and gentlemen!
this is everything ❤️
Ugly taste
Cool! 😄
the ear cuff !! catriona gray's impact
omg i love bretmans earcuff <3
I LOVE BRETMAN🥲🥲🤩🤩
Where are the plants T_T
Is this Bella poarch's cousin?
Close to the nature👍👍👍
Why is Cleo being blurred
The greenery is amazing .❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
"random, its very colorful, and its very gay duh"  LMFAOOAOAO
What a great billion-dollar view 😮 I'm obviously envious!
“But yeah this is my wig wall”  10:24 😂
rude.
the croc shelf LOL <3
this made me want to move to hawaii
When he sits in the weird butt chair I feel like this could esily be an SNL parody of Architectural Digest Open Door.
Bretman is the perfect example of how you can be funny, quirky, and energetic without being annoying and try-hard. It speaks to his sense of security and so many other beauty gurus are just annoying rather than genuinely funny and interesting.
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
Me on AD: Hi AD welcome to my 10m2 room
the only authentic and entertaining beauty guru, we stan a king !
Its orange and i Love it
This is probably the most fun AD video evuhhh
Ahhhh 💛💚 I LOOOVE THIS!! This is how I want my house to be - artistic and a representation of me 👑🌺🦋
The 🐈
"I dont know wtf its called, but it orange and I love it" I love him so much lol
I'm actually obsessed with this!!
I’m really digging that terrarium
I'm so proud of Bret like bitvh I witnessed him growing and whatever he owns right he deserves it .
Best part : Cleo's drawing of Bretman 🤣🤣🤣
Who is this guy?
The most entertaining AD feature ever❤
im too earlyyyyy
The fact that the haters can only hate from the comment section is hilarious. You know you wanna live in a house by the mountains in Hawaii. Stop playing.
YES FINALLY 🔥🔥🔥
HE'S SUCH A LEO PLSSS
"Without turtles, we wouldn't have turtles"  - Bretman Rock 2021
The view is so beautiful
"without turtles we wouldn't have turtles" 😂😂 oh i love you bret
This has got to be the most annoying obnoxious way someone can possibly speak
To hell the fortune which turns men into dolls .
Yassss kwennn
GEEHHHH
The design is all over the place but it suits her personality and it's original.
This is such a beautiful, creative, lively home! I love it!
😳 What The Actual F!!! 😳  😲 What Have I Just Watched?!?! 😲  I've literally no idea what's happening here! 🙄
This is soooo cuteeeee

If it doesn't resemble a flower then what??? 😂😂
I love how his home is actually a home not like other people who have it just for show

Unapologetically gay and a proud Pinoy 😍
He’s so obnoxious uff

Bretman: here is my succulent   My brain after watching his stories for years: THATS A COCKATUS 🌵
You'll know if you're a "BIG" celebrity if you get featured in this channel..so proud♥️😘
He's such a great uncle to Cleo 🥺  Especially loved that part where he showed Cleo's drawing of him lmao 😆
Now that's a dream house. 🥰
I love it!!!!
Aight, this is where I unsubscribe. Enes Yilmazer > AD

IT'S FEELS WEIRD BEING THIS EARLY LOL
I Stan

Love him ❤
OMG!! YESSSS YESSSSSSS
YAAAAAS I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
annoying
❣❣❣❣💥💥💥💥
Why do we  make people like this famous?
Love when he sat in his chair to admire his home, "like wow". 😭
idc how many views this gets AD just lowered their standards and I'm appalled.
we stan an authentic kwing
Let's be real the chair is  from Uranus
Usually when they have influencers over to do these things i cant stand them but bretmans sooo normal
manifesting<33
OMGGGGG <3
I clicked so fast😍
Omagosh I’m so early I don’t know what to do 🤣
Been waiting this for soo longg (luckly ad do it)
I love this so much 😭😭😭😭😍😍😍😍😍😍😍❤❤❤❤
Nobody:..... Bret man: “I like to sit here and.....stare at my house like wow👁 👄👁”
Finallyyyyyyy bichhhhhhhh ❗❗❗❗
his dogs were sooo cute omg
Once he said "but y'all know what it resembles to me so" I was like "OHHHH NOOOOO"
damn, I want to be a Hawaii boy too now.
The line “Welcome to my kitchen, this is where I pretend I know how to cook”  choked me HAHAHA
Idk who this is but we need a wealth tax
Jesus the view is just stunning😍
Im soooo early!!!!
who is Bret man what does he do? And why is he famous for??😂
Omg this is the best so far
#freebritney 🥰🥰🥰
not Bretman having a whole sephora and a department store in his house
This is why I love Bretman
I love her house , its not typical black and white design of other youtubers house, her house speak personality and character .
looks messy :( designs are all over the place
No more karen neighborhoods. Good for you Bretman. God Bless you more.
I love how it’s not necessarily the most modern house (like the kitchen) so it makes the house look like a real home I love ittttt
Que voz de gay! 🤦‍♀️🚺
I LOVE BRETMAN'S HOUSE
MTV CRIBS
Congrats Bret  on being on AD! :) Also want to see Princess Mae on here too  Oml that flower chair is beautiful!
About time
Beautiful
Not a fan of ‘influencers’ in general but he’s definitely my top 1. The world needs more influencers like Bret. He deserve every bit of success in his life.   I’m not into nature and really hate heat places but his house is definitely one of the best place to live.  Also #FreeBritney
finally, AD make it to this bit*h house <3 Aloha Bret, loveyouuuuu <3 what makes your house beautiful is YOU Bret :)
One of your best featured house/villa tours... his villa is so homey, so relaxing, too neat and clean, all decors are put in the right places.    Kudos to AD team ...for this video.
Philippines fans! 🇵🇭👇
I always thought he was kinda cool never followed him but recently after seeing him game and just years of never being problematic. He seems like a fun and good person.
I love this part hahaha 7:28
I love the location of the house...and house itself feels so homey as well
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO IN LIFE UNTIL I SAW THIS HOUSE- 🌺
Love the outside deck- furniture and overall aesthetic and Bretman's affable personality. That said, AD featuring influencers/ YouTube personalities two months in a row- eh, not loving that so much. I know you're trying to get the big numbers and younger set, but maybe space them out a bit. Who's next another Kardashian tour, showing off one of their mansions, or a Tik Tok dancer?
The most authentic person in the makeup industry!
The catriona grey ear cuffs bret oh my god.
HUGE SHOUTOUT TO CHRISTIAN SCOTT (@blackbean_cms on Instagram) WHO HAS A TON OF ART IN THIS VIDEO! LIKE THE PAINTING ABOVE THE FIREPLACE!!! 🔥
New found love for Bretman.  I always passed up on wanting to watch any videos with "social influencers." BUT by letting everyone see your home really makes your personality shine. ❤️❌⭕💃
Adopt me
so extra, love it
This is the video I didn’t know I needed
why did they blur cleo’s face?
Wait whaaaaat ? I’m proud of you Bret
It’s citrine bret😭
“Without mother**** turtles... we wouldn’t have turtles” -Bretman Rock    Truer words have never been spoken
Bretman is amazing.
I saw a bloom until Brennan forced me to see a booty hole.
The long hair on him *chef’s kiss*
wow unreal! its got a stunning view, not too futuristic but still modern and chic! amazing job Bretman!
i love this guy, he’s so real and funny
I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE! TURN IT UP‼️‼️‼️
Why is Chloe's face blurred on the painting?
*Kelly Kapoor: The Business B*tch* *Bretman Rock: Da Baddest B*tch*

A very life changing quote from Bretman; "....Save turtles.Because without mf turtles,we wouldn't have turtles."

“And it’s gay” bestie so true
