From this to “it’s, it’s, it’s, grippy!” 💔💔💔
I have read A LOT of comments and I have also concluded (Psychologically) although J Cole has made Mendes. I sense Mentally a LOT of us still are effected by the BIG 3 situation with J Cole, Kendrick Lamar and Champagne Sloppy. We MUST understand also that, in J Cole's Subconscious Mind, the reason he's unable to give his BEST Performance is because he still feels he hasn't been fully accepted and rightly so, by the Mass audience. And what we fail to realize also, is that the Light we view J Cole NOW is contrary to how KDOT See's him. So let's give J Cole a chance and don't be surprised or be put to shame by seeing J Cole featuring on the Boogyman's next single or even Album for (That Matter), because Kendrick Lamar does have a Heart of GOLD like that. Fr fr
Like this if you still here enjoying this song🔥🔥
Ezekiel 7:19  They will throw their money into the streets,     and their money will be treated as a thing unclean. Their money and jewelry      will not be able to deliver them     in the day of the Lord’s wrath.

I've never seen or heard of this rapper before. Does anyone know what the story is pertaining to the white men in the background at 2:35 who seem to have their wrists bound and their heads covered with bags? Surely there's something to it that isn't blatant, hateful racism.

Cole looks like he's out of place. His face is sad and unhappy. Literally lie he's hanging out with the cool kids but he knows he's not being true to himself. You  can read it all over his face.
Okay so I’ve never understood the Kid Cudi line what is it talking about?
Speaker Knockers did it better but this still 🔥

Give Cole his respect he’ll murder any track
PUTHYYYYY ❤️‍🔥
J Cole Carried
wonderful
0:08 sec in
Dang you back ya cole moneybags yo hella dope
1.25x your welcome
Whoever that is that goes last is by far the better rapper
Why I feel like Kendrick wrote YG verse ......it just sounds like something Kendrick would of done
Cole waa decent but everyone else went so fire he didnt compare
He got the melody from a kid show 😂💀
bro moneybag and j cole was way better than you where did u get this ''scared money dont make no money'' a 13 wanna be yearold gangster?
🔥🔥🅱️💯👌🏾🩸
This has to be homage to Speaker Knockerz he had a song called scared money Rip SK ❤️😔
🏎👀🙌
Listen to J.Coles Who is the King and you can hear the bar can't be scared to make that money
J.Cole inspired this 400 Blassick so Cole being on it is 145 St. Rosecrans and Central Piru
This hella trash ngl
Who's the king by j.Cole inspired this song so yeah scared money 🤑
love this song but he says he isn't rusty after the pandemic, that's why he's cramming lyrics in.  That's fucking lazy.  Love the featured artists, they are so much better with their lyrics.
Rip drakeooooo we know da truth!
I always love to see Memphis rappers doing big things.
Got the drop on the opps we Dora explorer it 💯
"Hhmm shit" 🔥
SK made the best scared money track so far !

Holy shit Cole carried so hard. His verse was a masterpiece and the other two especially YG was just painful to listen to. I skip to Cole every time and skip the song when it ends.

Clicked on this cause i saw Cole on the feature. Then i hear the hardest beat all year. Dammit boy
When Cole gets your pops asking about who's rapping?, you know I'm putting people on.
is it me or i am hearing Kendrick flow
Nothing OG here. Just a Remake of NO LIMIT
This is the first time I've ever really listened to money bag yo and I thought he was a mumble rapper cuz he came out when alot of wack mo fos did. But listen to how he owns this beat and rides this flow and owns it!  💯💯💯He's not my best friend or nothing but wtf! Give respect where it's due!♥️🙏👍

Starting early is the best way of getting ahead to build wealth, investing remains a priority. I learnt from my last year's experience, i am able to build a suitable life because I invested early ahead this time.

My theme song
Trash
https://youtu.be/Epiib6m9FBE
Thank God God as my witness honest to God in the name of the father and son
Unblock God of all gods in the name of Jesus
Fix open chakra in and out of head mental blockages removed from God
We are all different people from God in the name of Jesus Christ lord and savior
God is love Love is God God is great  God never lies God can change gods mind
Yep t h i s is music 💯💯💯
Man you telling me we lost drakeo and now we gotta hear this 😭😭
Yg real https://youtu.be/vJufPkL5xHI
If i ever get to that $$$ im going straight to LA to show my respect. Im going to tell my boss Sonny Barger that he have to tap in whit Melvin Farmer. They havent talked in 30+ years. For ya that dont know, Sonny & Melvin was in the same prison 1976. ™️©️
🖖🏻🩸🎱🩸
Rip drakeo
Every verse was fire.
Every sin you commit is not your fault. You have to blame it on the Sin Family, "The Seven Deadly Sins" because, they are the ones channeling there Satanic energy into your spirit and, Satan is prowling around like a Lion, looking for someone to devour. That means his children the 7 Deadly Sins, that Satan has authority over because, this is there Earth, given to them by God in Heaven. Are to blame! Do not blame yourself,"Child Of God"! When Jesus ask you on your Judgement day. Why did you commit this sin? To be clean repent for all your sins in Jesus name Amen and, blame your sin on Satan because, he came to this Earth first. Then blame the 7 deadly sins because, they are with Satan, that is there God, so they must follow his Satanic orders and, blame the Antichrist's because, everyone is turning into Satan's daughter's and, Son's these days. So really guilt all guilt for your sins is just you forgetting it's Satan's Earth, Satan's fault because, he is the God of all evil. Bible, perfect literature I tell you my brothers. As long as you are written in the book of Life you are! Saved! You are God's Earth Star because, he is watching you like a movie. Don't forget the Antichrist's are infinite, till the end of the world. So if a person does not confess Jesus Christ as there Lord and, saviour you are channeling there Satanic energy, so "Child of God" you are blameless by the blood of Jesus. So no more guilt! How would you keep sin alive in the Kingdom of Heaven if when you die and, go to Heaven. Christ “will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body” (Philippians 3:21). You can only be sober on Earth so never fear death, you just get hi forever and, Always that's true Love.

I like your song yg
I searched for YG entertainment and found this guy
What's with the high waters pants?
Yesss now that's what I'm talking about J Cole when I made that comment about you needing to get on more track with others. It wasn't to tear each other down but to support each other and for you to get on every track and get to the money but baby you took offense and said fuck it I'll just get on every track and kill everybody and I had to tell you that that wasn't what I meant by that comment and that we need to work together because we are better together and can make more money together in turn all become independent and have our own shit and I'm glad you heard me out and ran to the bank with it because you truly do kill everything you get on much love brother from a true fan
Whose gonna take his half million dollar chain? Pussy....thats correct

Oh ohhhhhh get money not make no moneyyy
Jesus Christ Saves  Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time.  Jesus Christ died on a cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later, to pay for the sins of mankind, to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God.  EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God:  1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord.  2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead.  Biblical References: 1. Romans 5:9 2. Romans 3:23 3. Romans 6:23 4. Romans 10:9 5. Romans 10:13 6. Ephesians 2: 8 & 9 7. John 3:16  God bless you, peace be with you always. Thank you for your time.

What's a "truffle boat"? Moneybagg said it costs 7 so that's either 700 or 7,000.  So I'm thinking 7,000 for a quarter kilogram of coke.
Yg really got smooth and catchy flow dude👿

POT FARMER SONG 2022# I got out my pipe stuffed it with pot You better believe it held a whole lot. I whipped out a lighter thumbed up a flame Sucked down that smoke which comforts my brain.  I tried alcohol smoked cigarettes They did nothing but give me regrets. My mom had arthritis could not walk around I rolled her a joint she danced on the ground.  I thought I was losing my lovemaking knack After I smoked some to me it came back. Soon I decided prices were high I searched for some ground I wouldn't have to buy.  I bargained for seeds from smokers all around  Got in my truck and drove out of town. I walked through the woods where wild birds nest  Found me the meadow I thought was the best.  I dug up the ground sowed all my seeds Said a small prayer for strong, healthy weeds. I watered at night with a five-gallon pail  Mosquitoes went hungry for I wore a veil.  Seven months went by; I thought I would die Till the Halloween moon was high in the sky. At night I went out, in a camouflage suit  Used my corn knife to chop down the loot.  I hung it up to dry where it couldn’t be found. Came back and got it, when it had turned brown. I trimmed off the buds, stuffed them in bags Called all my friends and passed out free drags.  In less than a week my crop was gone  I flew to St. Thomas with a love hungry blonde!!  By Kansas City Poet Tom Zart Google = Most Published Poet On The Web Tom’s 1,650 Poems Are Free To Share!

Threw you the obvious And you flew with it on your back A name in your recollection Down among a million same Difficult not to feel a little bit Disappointed and passed over When I look right through To see you naked but oblivious And you don't see me But I threw you the obvious Just to see if there's more behind The eyes of a fallen angel Eyes of a tragedy Here I am expecting Just a little bit too much from the wounded but I see, see through it all See through, see you 'Cause I threw you the obvious to see what occurs behind the Eyes of a fallen angel Eyes of a tragedy Oh well, oh well Apparently nothing Apparently nothing at all You don't, you don't, you don't see me You don't, you don't, you don't see me You don't, you don't, you don't see me You don't, you don't, you don't see me You don't see me You don't, you don't You don't see me at all

Respect is the word just remember you disrespect any of us on the US money part of the money you disrespecting them and their families and there's their all the proof you need right there you can steal you can do anything you want to do that's a big huge gigantic reason why whoever thinks that are any living thing thinks that or do that they don't deserve anything truth been told honest to God in Jesus Sean name hallelujah amen. All hell will break loose if you ever think you're going to take what belongs to me and my family and family tree DNA and my family's legacy like the Bible scripture said if you know how to read and spell and write one the Bible scripture said whoever should claim that is theirs shall losing lesson learned to you cuz God said so and so did Jesus sinners haters all living things or must I say fools I better not hear from all of you again or see y'all again I'll look at you again or hear from you again all the above when it comes to you again or you will suffer and I am a God child of my word and don't go running to God either when you can't handle the power of the money have that same attitude for the rest of your life in days and see what's going to get you everything's going to get you to heaven you're not being honest with yourself and you're lying to yourself and none of that's true it's all 100% lie if you think you want any money at all earn it that means like like everybody else's.
You can say what you want to say that's you mouths bet talking is cheap more money more problems and always remember this to the day you decease if you don't know what that means to the Day all you haters die if you don't know what it means money is the ruler of all evil in Jesus name that's not going to change like it or not agree with or disagree it is what it is GOD don't like ugly and he is not to fine of pretty either this world needs Jesus all of you haters and all living this can't do everything on your own trunk to Jesus and repent on your sins all of you cuz believe it or not all of you are not saved and messed with the power of the money you a number made a whole lot easier piece of cake pie cookie I can go on I'm very disrespectful when you do that and be that way body language emotions and actions that's not going to get you anywhere in life but death believe it or not and that's no threat I'm telling the truth and you should be sorry for all your sins you need Jesus in all your lives if you don't do it Jesus way and God's way and don't listen like the devil didn't listen I got news flash for you reality check God came to the devil and said you're going to lose everything you can be on the devil say anytime you want and please knock yourself out that's y'all life you will regret it you will suffer you will be punished by the almighty God and in the name of Jesus that's going to be a whole lot of regrets shame and doubt and before it's too late save yourselves before blood's been shed lots and lots of blood and guts brain inside your organs or anything could be missing so this is the last time I'm telling you this dumb mess my family cuz if you do is either jail or hell don't blame me and my family because you're broke being disrespectful that's why you're broke doing things your way and that God's way and choosing on wisely disrespecting totally wrong person I wouldn't do stuff for you either you're all on your own you act like you got everything figured out the only thing you got figured out is putting your life and serious Jeopardy all your lives it don't have to be this way you know for anyone's information me and my family and my other brothers and sisters on US dollar bills that worked real hard it wasn't given to them they earned it even if it was given to them that because the devil May deals with God in case you didn't know and the only way to get to God is through Jesus that's the only way choose wisely if I were you be careful what words you say you're buying language your emotions cuz you ain't number hurting themselves you did that to yourselves nobody but yourselves you're independent you're grown you make your own decisions so just remember what choices you make it's because that's the reason why you're broke especially all that lies you're saying all the lies you're talking you're not being honest with yourselves. 🙏🌎🙏🌎

00:46 This part caught my attention on the radio and I must say, “YG got that part correct. I thought that was a diss to Cuders, but Yo is simply stating he is not Kid Cudi. That’s what he is saying. I understand that because Kid Cudi dresses Crisp look.” 👀 All ears on Hmmm Hmmm. 🔥🔥🔥🔥⭐️🔥🔥🔥🔥

Moneybagg is on another level, bro too cold 🐐
Top Song of 2022?
Surely they at least had a conversation about how they were basically just making a bad reworking of humble
How is this not seen as just derivative Kendrick ?
they tell y'all that cash money "the actual paper dollar" is deceased. A new system is underway. it's all digital. That was a ledger Y.G was holding in his hand. Get one for you and your family.
Is that Gibbo onna beat??!!
🌡🌡🔥🔥🔥
Producer.  Check out my beats cuz

Nice track but how much was the bounty for tHa Ruler  ?

Alotta aggression here, and still, I like it.
Kendrick wrote this you could tell 🧐
🙊https://youtu.be/GmXZ-kqPqgY

Scared money don't make no money  while you have fake money on your videos broh  lol   Cartel money Mx
J cole flow is DUMMYYY
J Cole > Everyone else
Why's the begging remind me of kendrick lamar's humble
did jcole just drop a roblox bar?
Y'all saw that dude hand that dude that shank? Drakeo
West coast niggas rapping southern. Saying "whoa". I'm from New Orleans. It's cool, don't get me wrong but c'mon man. I wanna hear WESTCOAST shit

J cole disappointed on this track
J. Cole comin in n doin his goat shit 💯 🔥🔥
Shit Hits Hard
I came for this dope ass beat 🔥🔥🔥🔥 this a banger 🙌🏽🙌🏽
J COLE !!!!!!!!
J cole in that suit 😍
This is 🔥 but moneybagg at the end was perfect. Didn’t want it to end.
Personally didn't like YG on this song but the features made the song good.
This my shit I be at work delivering packages 📦 gotta watch out for Dogs and creeps 🤣 this motivates me
Kendrick Lamar?
YG did money bagg very bad by letting cole go first
YG giving out formulas
When yg say PUSSY go hard
This went HARD.
Ok so moneybag can just rap on any beat I can dude is a rapper rapper
1:00 love he has the Ledger 💪💪 Smart man in crypto 💪💪
Bruh jc a fcking monster with that flow holy sheeeeeesh
this shhhhh go hard
Great video thanks my boy
😭this song lives rent free in my mind
JUDE MATTOCKS
Got Kendrick video vibes
Why the fuck is j.cole on this trash?
In my opinion the opening bars are trash.
Yg , you know for a fact drakeo was on his way to be waay bigger than you it  had you scared out of of your sockless penny loafers. oh and I can hear you copy some drakeo flow so you knew you  would lose in the long run
Money killed it for me
Layton is not on the train !!!!
I'm a K Dot fan but damn I gotta be honest, J Cole has been WORKING no cap. And showing off his versatility. You don't have to be featured only on deep, conscious, serious ass music all the time. Shit even Pac recorded ,"I Get Around" along with him recording " Dear Mama" . Kendrick has yet to show the same ability to successfully blend his sound with other artists as well as J Cole or Drake.
Fye. But not gonna lie the mix sucks
Fire beat
This song is Ann absolute fucking bhanger, I’m fucked on shrooms rn watching the music video and holy fuck is it good. Especially with 15 beers down the gullet
cole always the best on any song hes on, true goat
2:29 "for motion picture use only"

Yeeee

2 goats right there. J Cole and Luka Don(Chick) lol
Twerk twerk twerk, Cole world!!!!
Shits wack gayyyy
At least J Cole didn't throw up the 2 6 rabbit lol
Best voice dude starts 2:23.
Proverbs 4:14-22 Do not enter the path of the wicked, And do not walk in the way of evil. Avoid it, do not travel on it; Turn away from it and pass on. For they do not sleep unless they have done evil; And their sleep is taken away unless they make someone fall. For they eat the bread of wickedness, And drink the wine of violence. But the path of the just is like the shining sun, That shines ever brighter unto the perfect day. The way of the wicked is like darkness; They do not know what makes them stumble. My son, give attention to my words; Incline your ear to my sayings. Do not let them depart from your eyes; Keep them in the midst of your heart; For they are life to those who find them, And health to all their flesh."
Why you gotta say bitch and fuck and nigga and ass

Goddamn this is absolute fire. Such an amazing decision to bring on Cole too. Thanks for this YG, I’ll be bumping this for a while
https://youtu.be/xq8LRIYTwys
Drop on a op , we Dora explore it ! We know the truth
Now just imagine if they dropped a remix with Speaker Knockerz on it if he was still alive 😔  If you know you know
Why it's sound likes Lil pump esskeetit song??
YG verse was amateur level
Let's not pretend most of came here for j cole
The United States of America form a country which has passed directly from barbarism to decadence without ever having known civilization.
I wonder if this’ll make the nba 2k23 tracklist 💀😂
🤑🤑😎😎💯💯💯🔥
Fortune favors the bold Aka  Scared money don't make money
Moneybagg so confident he teaching his foes how to turn the safety on their gun off
Who else keeps coming back to this song?
https://youtu.be/9zM-f5ucN5M
My question, if that's real money, his much did they fucking use????
XRP 🚀 🌒
Sounds like kemdrick lamar humble
this needs Day sulan
Should ove put 21Savage on it
Like everything is perfect.
Can’t decide between Cole’s verse and Moneybagg’s verse.
heat
WHAT THE FUCK?😂
Classic case of features overshadowing the primary artist. YG needs to start writing better.
Sorry but the beat carried.
“Scared money don’t make no money” is speakerknockerz  song. He passed away a couple years ago but he’s the original for that line & they should’ve gave him credit by mentioning him for taking that line 💯
Terrible....🤦‍♂️😂
coleall the way
Cole just havin fun now !
Only here for Jcole; not you Yg 🙄

Very few can outrap someone on they own song. Even fewer will outrap someone on they own track. Cole does both , cuz why not?!
Moneybagg Yo is scary underrated! He is so good and J Cole always slaps! Masterpiece by YG and them
Cole is killing every beat he is on right now he has so much heat right now mahn 🔥🔥🔥 he's making a legacy the music he's putting out right now Is unstoppable he is in his own lane give him his flowers the games to easy for my guy 👌

what everyone should learn from this.  dont talk about it, be about it, put the effort in instead of waiting and praying for it..  time is money, dont waste it.   no risk no reward..  while youre procrastinating, someone is going hard for it...  bitcoin, shib, doge.

YG if you're involved in Deakeo's death sucks. It is a murder committed by cowardly people. Anyway... I like your music, but I don't like throwing up my brother! From Paris 🇨🇵. Parce n love .  PS: Even if you are not involved, for being a man you could say a word of peace for the community. Your little wars of blue or red, we don't give a damn, we in Europe find that stupid
J Cole, make it look so easy. Your lyrics always seem to amaze me. Easily the best in the game
lyrics:  Why you bring that money to the club if you ain't throwing it? How you naked on the 'Gram but in person you ain't showing shit?

Uffff J cole too far in this shit
Errbody gotta get off COLE DICK. Bagg and YG just as good🔥🔥
Moneybagg Gave It🤲🤲
This song is fire but whenever yg says “scared money don’t make no money” it just doesn’t rhyme with the beat
This would have been number 1 on  106 & Park #OnPIRU
Dope ⚡⚡⚡
Bro really wasted a J Cole verse on this garbage ass song
I love all 3 of these artists. Still brazy is still a mf classic but this song is garbage bruh. Go back to yo westcoast roots cuz this is trash
ryanair's sucks
That shit is dope but whered this track come from?!?! Shit is 🔥 = https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRiUaLkaNAxCbZZbsmgEchg
I only watched this to support yg ... but now I'm  A j Cole fan
This a crypto ad.
This is hard
Sheesh! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Crazy 🔥💯
Anyone else keep playing back Coles verse? 🎤
J Cole Respect😎👍👍
Bruh bagg put that beat in its coffin ⚰️ 🔥
Passing the shank is crazy. YG showing his ass.
The line,"pussy",makes my day fresh😋🔥
artists here wanna work ? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipFyVs8rMDw
J Cole had to save this song after that bottom tier rap from YG. I was literally listening to this like wtf, why is he rapping at a third grade level. Cole came in with the PHD
Cole is in an incredible run. Might wind up being the best of this generation if he surpasses Kdot.
This jawn hot but it sound like j roc jawn!
Scared money by crypto face is better..
I’m getting Kendrick Humble vibes.
"Pulling up best dressed but I ain't kid cudi"
YG always better. Also it shows the rise of "LEDGER" Cryptocurrencies
J Cole goes hard on this song!
they should thank meek mill for this bar they used as a title
You gotta?
YG killed this beat, someone call the morgue.
PEAK music
YG The Goat 🐐
YG Goating 🐐
YG out here showing me he received 500 BTC on his ledger, come on man! thats how you should be flexing!
5 stars☪️Blood and Lord
1st time hearing Cole brag about material stuff he owns... moneybaggyo was last for a reason 🔥🔥🔥🤞
This honestly feels like a rip of Kendricks DNA lol
Moneybagg flow 💯💯💯
I been following cole since the original lights please that jay heard and signed before he even finished the song. I remember goin on coles myspace page and he only had like 20k fans. Right when he signed to to roc nation and was featured (only feature on the blueprint 3 by jay z) he opened up at the dub show back in 2009. In Anaheim at the angels stadium parking lot. The night Game headlined. I went because I wwanted to see cole perform. I shit you not only 30 people watched him perform. And wen he asked if we knew whoch label he had just signed to throw up the diamond roc. Only me and 2 other fans waved our diamonds with both hands. I was in 10th grade. crazy how i knew back then he would be one of the best rappers a legend before anyone knew.
Would love to see a J Cole Bagg Album. I need a label
I told my ex “I know u suffer.. but we can turn problems to solutions and relate problems into solutions”.. then showed her coles verse
Nothing but the truth from YG and J.Cole 🖤💯
3 of my favorite rappers but I honestly feel like moneybagg was the only one who hit that beat like it was meant to 😤🔥
I WONT DISAPPOINT🤝🤝🤝

🔥🔥🔥
Kodak Black definitely inspired the flow of some of that hook
YG‘s Life is 😁👌
Bagg’s verse so sick
J. cole never did a bad feature.
Moneybagg carried. He was sounding like Pooh Shiesty ngl...
I like moneybag but he was not meant for this song in my opinion, his voice doesn't go well with the beat
Ignorant rap at its peak. J Cole is good but to save this track you need a miracle
this is trash
Sounds like a straight rip off of humble by Kendrick Lamar. The flow, beat, video everything
yg tryn b like yungsta
J Cole always nice
I always listen to this song when I buy crypto!
0 women in the video.
The whole comment section is just about cole  Seems like you guys forgot who actually owns the song 😂
Cole u don’t gotta do em like that every feature!  🤌🏿
🔥🔥🔥

whooooooa on second hook I realized you straight up stole a christian rappers flow hahaha yo someone hit up nobigdyl and have nolifeshaq react to this thievery hahaha
jcole saved the song haha
Moneybagg Yo is always the odd one out any song i hear with this guy i stop it at his part😂😂
Fireeeee
Moneybagg Yo went hardd
Savii 3rd is a true Cali artist sometimes I feel like yg try and rap like the rest of America u from Cali rep that shyt don’t put j cole and money bag yo on a track that’s the weirdest combo ever put WEST COAST ON THE TRACK … niggax do what ever the label tell em ohh … this the 1 soo we gotta put some down south ppl on it hell no shoulda put your ppl on it … how much y’all wanna bet the LABEL is who got j cole and moneybag yo on the song
Okay j cole it’s enough now lol… how many times is he goin to mention drake in a song this is the 6th track now it’s almost like a secret obsession 😂😂 naw seriously tho y he keep mentioning that man name

Bagg shooting them threes
🤭
Anybody ever wonder why J cole supposedly is so rich yet he can’t fix his teeth??
nice
Everyone went in, but J. Cole’s verse was incredible. He spoke straight truth. They really fucking had him on all sports websites/shows making a couple layups. And that walking up crates line 🔥 so true. I saw everyone doing that too and thought making money was better than potentially hurting myself and possibly missing a check.  😂
2-6 stand tf up! This go so hard thou 💪🏽
To whoever is reading this : May God bless you ! You’re gunna do great for ur school year ! Put God first and everything will fall into place ! John 3:16 says , “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life ! WIshing nothing but love , joy , peace, prosperity, faith, hope, etc. Have a blessed day 💕💕

Claiming that you have Bitcoin is actually dumb, because when the government figures out a way to make people pay crypto taxes, these rich MFs will the first on the list.
10 out of 10 will never play again
It was good until the kid cudi thing
We need a Cole record with only hit boy like Nas did.  Dead ass would be one of the greatest albums of all time without question.
Are we almost done with that horrid flow YG used ? It’s been like 6 years of the same tired ass flow.
The flow and everything kinda reminds of Humble by Kendrick, i really like it.
Did they add in some weird distorted dissonance to the vocals or are my headphones bugging? Shit just sounds off.
Cole kills every track he jumps on. One of the greatest storytellers of all time. Reminds me of this https://youtu.be/H5oi-_8CuLw
“I was thinking about walking up some crates”
Scared money don't make no money... niggas gat the bragging rights until the feds come knocking right...all that talk old never seen a nigga stack pesos like Pablo Esco... Got me like Brave money don't know no history,shiiii!
Hustlers Anthem
Dog this song and video is so crazy ! Hats off to all 3 men in this videos y’all brothas killed this

Why is it all rap is the same satanic sh!t, rob, steal, kill, cheat, drugs n material possessions 🤔🤔🤔
Music with meaning lmmfao same garbage azz sh!t as every other crapper (rapper)
What I love about Cole is how he’s able to make the most introspective tracks known to man. But ain’t afraid to throw his weight around and just talk his shit. This whole track just 🔥
Here for the cole feature 🔥
The mixing for this song is bad
BURN LOOT MURDER
Sheesh! They too lit hehe ⚡🙌🏾
Moneybagg had the best verse
Kendrick Lamar - Humble copy??????
“Like” if you think Gucci Mane would have snapped on this as a feature

2018: big bank  2022: scared money
My bad yall that's just my multiple personalities.  My PTSD.  Like that mulit screen porn.  Split things. Split screen.  One mind set though you Feel me? Fuck bitches. Get money.  Any and all perceived likeness to anything or anyone living or dead is purely coincidental and shall in no way be used against us in the court of law.    But if you have questions come ask me.  He won't be able to answer for me.  He ain't ask to be my teacher.  I didn't ask and I didn't cause a scene over it.  Just waited for him to be around him and have him.  Lol bruh. He stole my whole fucking heart.  I was a kid but I loved loved him.   Do not fuck with him.  I'm your huckleberry.
I fuk wit YG
This kinda sound like DCG Shun n BSavv Hey Baby house party song
Messi neymar mbappe
adin ross :👁👄👁
YG underrated asf
Why my song don't get no exposure but this dude can get it and don't sound as good
Now that that's been established.  Think of this as wine tasting.  You take a small sip and smell it observe how it looks in the glass then you spit it out.  Lol not me bish I drink it but you supposed to spit it out.  And one of these is familiar.  And I personally find it important to say I have nothing to do with certain parts of business. I don't appreciate it when they make it out to be like we all on board with it.  We're not.  And it's Dannfuckinyell.  Not Cole fucking world.  I'm the one who coined inserting a cussword into the middle of a proper word.  Lol it came about after someone said I shouldn't cuss. I was like I don't cuss that much but I can take it there so you have an idea of what too much is.   Then started my whole inserted cusswords catalog.   She knows.  She knows.  And I know she knows.   Call your girl up and... Hey Taylor hey what's good.  Hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood.  What's good Miley.   Cole think he drizzy Drake he got his own plane.  Lolllllllllllllllllllll or is plan???  Like gods plan???  Awe nah I'm tripping y'all.  That PTSD.    Wine tasting.  And y'all done made product weak.  Signed all our names and left others to fight your fight.  Comfortably disrespected the reason you got to go there.  Comfortably disrespect the product and you see there's a difference in doing shit cause you have to and doing shit cause you can and you think business is a game.  You comfortable.  I wonder if red bottoms can save you?  You will let me know?  Or better yet ... Do how you do and have someone else tell me what you don't have the balls to say to my face in person exactly as you are without a mask.   But you run it right.  Ain't you supposed to be able to do that?  And to be clear waiting till you alone with someone to act up cause you that's the only place you get away with shit then spreading your god like night around group to let them say it for you ... Ain't the same.  Fucking someone and editing y'all videos is not the same as fucking your head lice infested bish on the courthouse steps in broad daylight.  Lol.  Fucking someone who looks like her and walking in public is not the same.  You weren't walking round that house while I was there.  Do you forget???  If she the best and you chosen lol then what's the problem my fucking loves?  Shouldn't of been fucking nothing to bring it to my face .  And as man ... That's what should of been done.  But nah.  You took this path and you drug the most single fucking person who is of importance to me down this road. The only one who is required.  And y'all thought you was better. Chosen.  Well based on all this right now you thought someone ain't know something.  Cause I didn't flaunt it. Cause I didn't talk about it.  But my life ain't your fucking business and neither is his.  Required and preferred do you understand the difference? No you don't. But you will.  Some people really are the product.  You can not replicate them in any way to hit better than the original.  We bout thorough quality.  They helped y'all and y'all water it down.   That's why a hurricane hits more like spring showers.  I know my hurricane. I know when to be scared and yall ain't scary. But instead of fighting it ... I'll say ... Go on then.  The world is watching.  Show us your fake goddess.  Show us the queen you have to whisper about lol even though you run this place.   Show me bitch.  I'm from that show me state.  And now we in lilweezianna ... And this special place in tbe middle where we all meet ... Is ours. So with that I say ...     Walk hand in hand with your fake goddess while you come say hi to me. id respect you for it.  Lay hands on someone in public ... And not in the dark ... I'd respect that. Stand by her ... Side by side in yours and her real image.   Not from behind the comfort of business and organizations that lift your voice so it can be heard.  Say it with your pretty fucking voice box.  With your chest. And since you run this place ...  Don't just say it in front of me ... But all of us.  Cause thats how it goes here. And if you can't then you have no ground to make that claim on.  You not fucking mine no more boo.   And them kids done grown up huh?  That's a legal grown ass woman.   Baby won't you come my wayyyyyyyyy.    Wine tasting. We're all in this together and play with people who don't know no better.  Also.  You bit me.  I have my rules.  He had one.  One fucking rule.  One.   And you fucked it up.   Here's a hint ...  Or even a tip.   He's onnnn.  And he's right baby. His One request.... Please don't bite baby.   The small ways you've disrespected this in broad day light and the ways you attacked in the dark... Like you from the dark.   *Clears throat* and lights my cigarette.  Ummm.  Hey there.  I'm Dannielle.  We've met. I'm not the one who's attention you want I've said It often.  And you ain't about to think you'll handle me because bish id rather be doing anything than wasting my time on your shit but you apparently can't act right.   You ain't from the dark ... You don't know nothing bout it and I said back the fuck up enough to last you 40 lifetimes.  But to you I'm just a woman who is on her period.  Jealous.  Angry.  Etc.  That's fine as what I am to you doesn't matter to me. What I am doesn't depend on you.  Doesn't rely on you.  Doesn't require you.  I am fine here.  This space is where I am comfortable so you won't rush me anywhere.  My peace is different than your peace... And I don't attack your peace but you've been attacking me and mine for our whole lives.   He says please don't bite because I may or may not just come around and say do it. That's what you been making noise about ... Well you have my full attention. Not my permission by any means but as you tell it ... You don't need it right??  So let's see it.  Show me my fucking love.  Show me your sweet godlike demon time heavenly yet almighty saving power.  Show us your goddesses that have not one imperfection.  Lol.  Please do.  And know this ... I love a pretty bitch.  I mean ...  I love them.  We both do.  We all do.  So come on. We watching now.  Rollout the past few years and ....???? And dis what we get? This is it?      I have no further questions your honor.
Are you the one?!

This song is if Kendrick Lamar and lil pump had a baby...littt😂
Street anthem 🔥👌🏾🥰
Vid gives me those lil pump vibes lol
I'm sorry but the beat sounds way too much like HUMBLE from K. Dot and YG's cadence was VERY CLOSE to the same. Even the directing is similar. It almost feels like a spoof or a diss track making fun of Kendrick's style lol I'm only 35 seconds in, but that's my assessment thus far. I trust Cole to add some color to it tho.
Is it me, or is this video and song similar to K.dot’s Humble??! 🤔🤔
is it just me or do the vocals sound like really hi-freq
SHIBA INU, DOGE, BITCOIN

https://youtu.be/KWyJrklp-WE
this was all heat 🔥🔥🔥
Dz makes me miss kendrick,
YG really flexed his Ledger wallet and whole port lmao
Beat remind me of Kendrick be humble its🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I don’t really like j cole’s music. But he flowed really good. Him and YG. Could’ve don’t the song with just them two, they didn’t really have to add Moneybag something
Scared money don’t make no money, came from speaker knockerz
Sheesh this shit knocking!!!
Cole world 🌎
COLE fukin WORLD .
https://youtu.be/tnu4DudhDho
Cole really just playing on this song fr cause if he wanted he would murder this beat
This shit hard.  But , WE KNOW THE TRUTH
This is much better than every trash song off of My Life 4Hunnid
Cold storage 💰  Not your keys, not your bag.
This beat sound like a sped up version of K. Dot's HUMBLE. The video direction is similar too.
🔥🔥🔥
This man Cole was like “Y’all callin me homeless? Lemme make a whole verse where all I do is flex.” This man said “3 cribs in the same neighborhood I’m that rich.”😭
Money is scary t those who love it. Spirituality is gold that is shared and enjoyed and good for self.
Los Angeles still run this shit
Yo man its jonny
I normally don’t fw YG at all, but this a certified bop!
i don’t know if it’s in purpose but goddamn this reminds me of elm street by jimmy wopo. respect if it was on purpose rip wopo
When you order "humble" at wish:
Krown Chakra -Scared Money Don't Make No Money
Talk to em young Simba!
we know the truth long live the ruler
Damn!!!,  Cole ate this beat.

Cole World never fails
Hello, I am from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. But I think this is taken from or inspired by the Kendrick Lamar Humpl song
Isn't the beat similar to Kendricks 'Humble' or is it the same producer ? Just saying. 💥track though.
Deserved a Kendrick feature
J.Cole is a serial killer like 90's Redman, that Kid Kudi line by YG was sick. Moneybagg never comes half ass.   Good collab no complaints here.
The goat on here big speaker 🦌🦌🦌
sounds to much like be humble
J Cole the true GOAT🔥🔥🔥
4💯💪
Danm this bro really next
Shout out to all the Gs who’ve been rocking with YG since Bicken Back Being Bool 💯

Most fire collab of the year!! Why'd they go so hard though!?!?!
they say: it is not what you say, it is how you say it. Unfortunately this video got neither, except the beat. (VIP I am very important?? ) (non is original)   Delete this video, and make new one, pussy!! (go back some of the vibe from "Go Loko ft. Tyga, Jon Z" )

I see everyone talking about J coles goated verse, but props to moneybagg, his verse slapped
Banger🔥🔥🔥
Nobody gonna talk about how crazy Moneybagg went ? 🔥
If just one person reads this it will make my day. I'm a music artist from Virginia. So I'm fully aware that folks usually post these comments all the time, but I honestly do  believe that I'll be the one person who you'll be so happy that you did hear out. . If ONE PERSON could just give this a thumbs up, you will be a great step closer to helping a person's dreams come true. I swear that I don't suck and you won't be disappointed. I Just need one chance and 3 minutes.
RIP DRAKEO

So dope from africa
The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “There will be a tribulation in which the one asleep is better than one lying down, the one lying down is better than the one sitting, the one sitting is better than the one standing, the one standing is better than the one walking, the one walking is better than the one riding, and the one riding is better than the one running. All of those killed on both sides are in Hellfire.” I said, “O Messenger of Allah, when will that happen.” The Prophet said, “Those are the days of slaughter.” I said, “When are the days of slaughter?” The Prophet said, “When a man is not safe in his own gathering.” I said, “What do you order me to do if I witness that?” The Prophet said, “Hold yourself back, restrain your hands, and stay in your residence.” I said, “O Messenger of Allah, what is your view if a man breaks into my residence?” The Prophet said, “Go into your house.” I said, “What is your view if he enters my house?” The Prophet said, “Go into your prayer room and do like this,” and he grasped his elbow with his right hand, “And say ‘my Lord is Allah’ until you die upon that.”  Source: Musnad Aḥmad 4286

Am I the only one who thinks asap rocky belongs on this
This like the sequel to Humble lol

LIT Reaction on #goldfam 🔥
YG always go be lit💯 no matter if he do or don’t drop a lot but always seem to drop a banger everytime he drop
What a waste of 3 minutes and 24 seconds. I feel like I'm an alien from another planet. These are young black man I can't relate to this culture whatsoever. None of them talked about building a strong black nation. Hip-hop and videos is a downgrade of black cultural soul of black folks.
What is going on with those bots under every video ?
fire
I can’t fuck with YG due to that whole Draco situation.  J.Cole and money 💰 bag went in tho What little respect I did have for YG went out the door 🚪. I feel like he started moving funny once Nip died !

Someone listen to Krown Chackra
Fkn amazing colab!! 👏
ohOK!! *headbangs
Epic
Gotta give Jermaine the slight edge in this one, but each of them did their thing no doubt!! Even though I’m an underground rapper and producer with less than 500 subs, I feel so lucky just to be able to create in the same sphere as these three artists! It’s both an honor and a privilege to make hip-hop music. Even if I never go anywhere! Great song boys! This collaboration was dope!
YG  aint rusty🔥🔥
cole shouldn’t be on tracks with these bammas
Your hooked right away
Check our newest single "Through the Smoke" on the channel, drop a like and comment if you like it!

Amazing song! the only thing I don't like is how J. Cole pronounces Luka Dončić. Next time you should learn how to say the  names of people you mention. Besides that I love the song.
I saw this as ad on YouTube they played the hole song before my show started I said wtf is this 🤓 I did not no they do that
sounds like shit off a stick
Am surprised Nicki's song ft Lil Baby has got more views than this gem. Yet it was whaaack

Coulda did Better than that
This is how you keep those urban kids poor and working slave jobs while buying plastic shoes they can't afford.
@YG we need a new album . Some west coast feel.
It's YG 4Hunnid.. #bloodz
The beat wack
This a L
As a person who listens to these 3 a lot I feel they each could've went way harder. The beat style is definitely different but the bars was weak in each direction
Big speaker 🔈
The music video looks like a Kendrick Lamar music video, same style
Cole 🐐 ‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️ I needa tape with bagg n Cole that shit would be crazy
🔥
J Cole dummied down for this song and still murdered it... 🔥
Hot take but money bag went the hardest🔥

👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽✊🏽🔥💥💪🏽⚡️
Bro kid cudi would murder YG any day
Man… I’m disappointed in Cole for this one.. he usually don’t spit mindless flex bars.. he normally got a story and some knowledge to drop.. or some shit that make you think.. this was his worst work.  His flow is still fire.. bars are below his ability.
Y’all know if YG threw any more fans off the stage for not doing what he said?🤣 lame ass. Only here for JCole
Who mastered ygs vocals 🤢
Cole always gives it his all
🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬
Idk bout yg but the rest go
Damn does MoneyBagg have the best flow?
Bitch yesssss
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
That was beautiful. You have skills Kristine.
This shit slap
🇧🇷🔥
This would hit different if Johnny P’s Catty didn’t drop a few weeks ago, Cole gon have to drop another album to compete wit that
Do not trust the man in the mirror 🪞
Lol it’s like I’m fading away
It’s like I’m here but I’m not here
Omg I just had an outer body experience
The ledger tho

Bars after bars from all 3 😂.. 3 headed goats 😭🔥
The World's Top 10 Funniest One Liners!  1. Few women admit their age; few men act it. 2. It's been Monday all week. 3. Why is "abbreviation" such a long word?   4. Atheism is a non-prophet organization.  5. You can't have everything; where would you put it?  6. Ask me about my vow of silence. 7. Nothing is fool proof to a sufficiently talented fool. 8. What happens if you get scared half to death twice? 9. I went to the fights, and a hockey game broke out.  10. A flashlight is a case for holding dead batteries.   Maybe the most thought-provoking one-liners is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com

So good
Cole is 🥶
Everybody ate in this shit .. Especially Cole World 2_6
Yg sounds like he recorded his verse with a cheap ass microphone in a cheap ass studio with an awful ass mixer. Same goes for J cole's. Neither were bad but i feel like the mixing on their part was pretty bad. The audio (vocals) quality did not match the video quality nor the production quality at all until Moneybagg Yo came in.
He’s never coming back that’s really that !!

It’s a lot more to this music video. The black people are wearing white face. And moneybagg yo watched the white people fight while he sat comfy in his chair about to smoke.   In slavery time they woke them up in the middle of the night and made 2 of them fight while the others watched. And it was to the death as well….  Great vid tho.
Gangsta.. b**
Yg just put y'all on game. pay attention to the crypto wallet "Ledger"
Wow they going up to heaven😮
ooooo you rich
Who’s vibe does this match?
Here for that cole's verse. Flames as usual 👑

Cuhz ion even listen to blxxd but this jawn hard asl
#Familiar... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvTRZJ-4EyI
This Rap/Hip-Hop shit is the same crap everytime. Flaunting money, "Bitch this Bitch that," always talking about who the "Baddest," is this the only thing that they talk about? They wonder why there is all this looting and violence in the young black community. It's shit music like this. Same garbage everytime. That's why Hip Hop/Rap is trash. It's trash beats with just some guy talking shit over it. No actual musicians or talent. It's always about money, guns, killing, bitches. I'm not even old and this shit is wack and played out.
They got one ☝🏾
Yall sleepin on moneybag
I can’t be tho only who thought the song was only good because of moneybagg…
21 savage would've went hard here too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Krla_UxRg&t=40s

Whoever produced this needs to work on YG voice. Sounds way too robotic
Haha This man straight pulled out a freaking Ledger. If you know, you know.
The Cole rhyme was whack guys. I'm so lit Sports Centre gotta post my clips. 3 cribs in the same neighbourhood, I'm that rich. Hahahaha, guys. This is weak. Weakest verse Cole I have heard in years. But I still got mad love for Cole above everyone. #ColeWorld.

This mf don't miss
We are all born with a sinful nature. To live eternally in paradise and escape eternal torment in hell, we must accept the sacrifice that Jesus made on the cross.  Even though Jesus is God, He came to earth to be a sacrifice for us so that we could live with Him, God the Father and God the Holy Spirit forever. We can't save ourselves by doing good works. Only faith in what Jesus did will save us. Just by believing, we are saved eternally. It can't be lost no matter what. After that, we trust God to do good works in us. It's all about what Jesus did, not what we do.  ...if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.                                                Romans 10:9
It was YAH  Hallelujah Yahweh Shalom Amen  🙏😇☔🕊️🕯️✝️🛐🙇‍♂️
Numbers don’t lie. This joints 🔥
WE KNOW THE TRUTH!! LLTR!! 🕊
LONG LIVE THE RULER 🕊 STINCTEAM

YG isn’t an OG Blood gang member he is just simply a very skilled assailant in the criminal lifestyle who lived long enough to share his talent and knowledge with us. In YG we trust

Luka Donchick? Cmon man….
Urgent:for the wages of sin is death.Jesus Christ is the only one who can save you from your sins! This life is your only opportunity to make it to heaven. There is no more chances in the afterlife but judgement! Yes, you are living on grace but how long will that last. Today is the day of salvation for tomorrow is never promised! Sin leads to death but holiness leads to eternal life so be holy as God is holy!
YG spreading lies to the youth

Organ harvesting is one of the worst human rights violations imaginable, and it is hard to fathom that a state could systematically take so many innocent lives for their organs, said Peter van Dalen, a Member of the European Parliament (MEP), on November 29.  Mr. van Dalen made this remark at a hearing held by the European Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human Rights (DROI). During this event, legal experts, witnesses, MEPs, and other officials called for the European Union (EU) as well as the United Nations to take action to stop organ harvesting by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).   MEP Peter van Dalen at a hearing held by the European Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human Rights (DROI) on November 29, 2021

Are you afraid of death?  Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word, the holy bible. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 );  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.

#fromlosangeles
Scared Money Lyrics  [Verse 1: YG] Why you bring that money to the club if you ain't throwin' it? How you naked on the 'Gram but in person, you ain't showin' shit? Why you go against the gang? You can't beat 'em, nigga, join it Ain't tap in when you got to Cali, got your ass extorted Brand new coupe, I floor it, brand new bitch, gotta whore it Brand new Glock, I adore it, have a nigga runnin' like Forrest V.I.P, I'm very important, in the hood, I ain't never no tourist Got the drop on the opp, we Dora explore it (Ay) YG from the streets, YG went legit (Ay) YG lit, YG start a business with your bitch (Ay) Fifty bitches flew to Cabo, YG a trip (Ay) YG think he Kanye West, he got his own kicks Woah, fresh out a pandemic but I ain't rusty Woah, have a baby by me, bitch, come be lucky Woah, bitch I'ma throw it all, all the strippers love me Woah, walk in best dressed but I ain't no Kid Cudi  [Interlude] Girl, did he just say what I think he just said? Bitch, yes  [Chorus: YG] Talkin' like you lit, your bitch better not be ugly Pull up with a ten, her waist slim, ass chubby Half a milly on my neck, who gon' take it from me? Pussy, we ballin' on you fuckin' dummies Scared money don't make no money (Woah) Scared money don't make no money (Woah) Scared money don't make no money (Woah) Pussy, we ballin' on you fuckin' dummies
Long Live the Ruler!!!!!!
4000000000000000000
Yg goes hard
Cole bodied this it’s verse of the year!!!🔥🔥🔥
Bagg 🔥
J cole had the hardest verse YG made it a hit  Moneybagg was pretty average
❤️ from India 🇮🇳
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."     -John 3:16 God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.  Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Savior, and you shall be saved.   May God Bless you all
- [x] Time to get right with Jesus. nobody is automatically gonna go to heaven at the end of it, we all have lied or stolen or had sex before marriage and the punishment is hell. Jesus died so you can get a clean slate and forgiveness of future sins if you repent of them once you commit them, so you receive the gift of forgiveness by following him. When you start you have to stop sinning, and follow his word and obey it. That’s following Jesus. Read your Bible!!!!
pov: everyone sees the j cole feature
COLE FUCKING WORLD

I be clowning on yg because he damn near 40 tryna keep up with the trends but this cool right here🔥
I'm see how it come into play
Cole is usually so humble. I love that he’s talking his shit now. Well deserved  略 shout out to YG & Moneybagg Yo
BRO COLE TALKING HIS SHIIIII. THIS IS HEAT
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!  "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus

Talking like you lit yo b!tch better not be ugly
0:46 “Woah, walk in best dressed but I ain’t no Kid Cudi” is this a Double Entendre?! The girls’ comment after that phrase threw me off. Not sure if it was a diss( with the honor he gave to Kurt Cobain, wearing the white dress) like saying you won’t catch him wearing a dress or complement or a play on word? 😖😖😖
Is like YG just read Will Smith's book (Will)
This nigga rapping just like drakeo....😂😂😂

Whats the name of the model on the phone? I need it for research 🔬🖐🏼🧐
J Cole is the only rapper giving Drake his flowers constantly. He shouted out Drake his last 2 out of 3 songs (Heaven's EP, Scared Money). Every other rapper sneak disses or is scared to mention him
Im sorry but Moneybagg did it on this song.

Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life887
The fact it on  add make me confused

Cole doesn’t really flex but when he does shit hits different

This too fire
They shoulda dropped Yg off this song 😂
reminds me of “humble” by kendrick lamar
YG never disappoints !!
In my feelings tonight and J COLE  is fire as usual.  I need more.
Coles features are just ridiculous at this point
Psalm 46  King James Version  46 God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.  2 Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;  3 Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.  4 There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High.  5 God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early.  6 The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted.  7 The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.  8 Come, behold the works of the Lord, what desolations he hath made in the earth.  9 He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire.  10 Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.  11 The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.
Shit lit fresh out the pandemic we needed this
Remember when j cole went platinum with no features
Not my cup of tea

Respect to YG and Moneybagg Yo, but J. Cole for me has been the best rapper in the game 2018-present: Countless features, unexpected release songs out the blue and two albums and two LP's releases, and a group album. He's a living legend
People keep riding Cole's sack but YG and Money Bagg was good too!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
This is shit 😂
They literally telling you to invest in crypto. Well I hope you all bet on the right digital asset. Lol once the rappers are paid to advertise the masses are following suit. XRP🚀
Banger 🔥

Proverbs 1:7  “The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.”

Yg I like u the producer need to do more to the beat deeper 808s
They all had a lit verse.. yessir
OH OOOKAY!!!
Mark 8:36- “For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?” Anyone that does not make sure they have taken care of their soul will end up destroyed. Your soul is the part of you that is eternal. It is tragic when a person dies and is not sure of where they will spend eternity.
🔥
No entiendo inglés pero esto suena a otro nivel.🔥🔥
Hello everyone. How are you where are you from 🥰🥰🥰
Don't act like you didn't see that Ledger Nano X.   Mass adoption coming soon. Bullish.
“Checc into LA and get extorted 😈” Chris brown 👁👄👁
Jcole yup this is it
3 As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately. “Tell us,” they said, “when will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?”  4 Jesus answered: “Watch out that no one deceives you. 5 For many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am the Messiah,’ and will deceive many. 6 You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. 7 Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. 8 All these are the beginning of birth pains.  9 “Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me. 10 At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other, 11 and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. 12 Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, 13 but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved. 14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.
This is toooo 🔥 I wish Kdot was on here as well would have been even more Epic. Two gangsters vibes two Lyrical vibes priceless 🤘
In case y’all missed it, YG pulled out the Ledger nano X.     It’s a crypto cold wallet. Now go out and Invest!!!!!! Crypto here to stay.
Everybody talking bout cole but Moneybagg was fuckin on point better than Coles verse imo
First verse YG can’t even follow a beat and he sounds like a 6 year old chick purposefully making himself sound gay.

25 It is enough for students to be like their teachers, and servants like their masters. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebul, how much more the members of his household! 26 “So do not be afraid of them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known. 27 What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the roofs. 28 Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
I would’ve never imagined this collab

La muerte, es uno de los eventos más grandes que jamás tendrá lugar en tu vida.   Afrontamos la muerte todos los días, consciente o inconscientemente de ella; la muerte acecha en cada rincón de nuestra vida. Como un león esperando atrapar a su presa, la muerte nos llega a todos en muchas formas y formas; aparentemente no hay nadie que pueda escapar de las fauces de la muerte.   ¿Pero sabías que hay una razón por la que morimos? La idea de la muerte con la que está familiarizado es solo la punta del iceberg. Mira, morimos porque hemos pecado contra Dios. La muerte según la Biblia es paga "porque la paga del pecado es muerte" (Romanos 6:23).Debido a que el hombre pecó contra Dios, vivimos en un mundo caído, antes era perfecto, pero ahora está en ruinas. Ahora que el pecado existe, Dios viene a juzgar al mundo con justicia. Está establecido que un hombre muera una vez y después de este juicio "(Hebreos 9:27). El estándar por el que te juzgará son los 10 mandamientos, la ley moral de Dios.   Él es tan serio acerca del pecado que le dio a cualquiera que pecara la sentencia de muerte, la Biblia dice que te la has ganado pecando contra Dios y cada vez que pecas, acumula su ira. "El alma que pecare, esa morirá". (Ezequiel 18: 4) El castigo son los fuegos eternos del Infierno "Donde habrá llanto y crujir de dientes" (Mateo 13:42)   Tendrás que enfrentarte a Dios el Día del Juicio.   ¿Irás al cielo o al infierno?   Aquí hay una prueba rápida:   1-No tendrás otros dioses delante de mí. 2-No harás ídolos. 3-No tomarás el nombre del Señor tu Dios en vano, porque el Señor no dará por inocente al que tome su nombre en vano. 4-Recuerda el día de reposo. 5-Honra a tu padre y a tu madre. 6-No matarás. 7-No cometerás adulterio. 8-No robarás. 9-No mentirás. 10-No codiciarás.   ¿Alguna vez has dicho una mentira? robado algo? usó el nombre de Dios en vano? ¿Alguna vez has mirado a alguien con lujuria? Él ve la lujuria como adulterio, “Cualquiera que mira a una mujer con codicia, ya adulteró con ella en su corazón” (Mateo 5:28). ¿Alguna vez has odiado a alguien? él ve el odio como un asesinato, "Cualquiera que odie a otro hermano o hermana es un homicida" (1 Juan 3:15)   Santiago 2:10 dice, "la persona que guarda todas las leyes excepto una es tan culpable como una persona que ha quebrantado todas las leyes de Dios".   No confíe en su propia bondad o buenas obras para salvarlo. Eso es como sobornar a Dios para que te deje entrar al cielo; Ni una iglesia, pastor, sacerdote o religión alguna. Ninguno de nosotros es bueno en absoluto, incluso los asesinos, violadores, incluso Hilter se llamarán buenos y tratarán de justificarse por sus buenas obras. Pero la biblia dice:   • "Pero todos somos como cosa inmunda, y todas nuestras justicias son como trapos de inmundicia; nos marchitamos como una hoja, y nuestras iniquidades, como el viento nos llevaron". (Isaías 64: 6)   La definición de Dios del bien es moralmente excelente y, por lo tanto, exige perfecciones absolutas. Nadie puede igualar sus estándares. Por eso Jesús dijo: • "Nadie es bueno sino solo Dios". (Lucas 18:19)   Si ha hecho alguna de esas cosas, Dios lo ve como culpable de quebrantar su ley y la Biblia advierte que los culpables terminarán en el infierno. ¿Serás culpable el día del juicio final?   "Porque la paga del pecado es muerte, pero la dádiva de Dios es vida eterna en Cristo Jesús Señor nuestro". (Romanos 6:23)   Dios envió a su Hijo a sufrir y morir en la cruz. Jesús tomó el castigo sobre sí mismo y derrotó a la muerte en la cruz; no por tu Bien sino porque Dios es rico en misericordia.  "Porque tanto amó Dios al mundo que dio a su Hijo unigénito, el que en él cree no se pierda, sino que tenga vida eterna". (Juan 3:16)  Jesús resucitó de entre los muertos y venció a la muerte. Arrepiéntete (vuélvete del pecado) hoy y confía en Jesús y Dios te concederá vida eterna; también nacerás de nuevo.  Él te dará un corazón nuevo que desea la justicia, lo que es justo y un corazón que amará a Dios.  por eso Jesús dijo: "De cierto, de cierto os digo, que el que no nazca de nuevo, no puede ver el reino de Dios". (Juan 3: 3)  Luego, lea la Biblia y obedezca lo que lee.  ☆ ¿Cuándo vas a estar bien con Dios?  "Hoy, si escuchan su voz, no endurezcan su corazón como lo hicieron en la rebelión" (Hebreos 3:15) "Ahora es el tiempo aceptable, he aquí ahora el día de salvación". (2 Corintios 6: 2)   • "Tampoco hay salvación en ningún otro, porque no hay otro nombre bajo el cielo dado a los hombres en el que podamos ser salvos". (Hechos 4:12)   Es tu elección. Los dejo con esto: "¿De qué le aprovechará al hombre si gana el mundo entero y pierde su alma?" (Marcos 8:36).   Si te estás tomando esto en serio, ¿te gustaría una oración? Esta oración no es garantía de que serás salvo, eso es entre tú y Dios. Sin embargo, me gustaría que este fuera un buen comienzo para su viaje.  "Padre, te agradezco por el corazón abierto de esta persona y le pido que se arrepienta y confíe solo en Jesucristo. También te pido que guíes sus pasos en su camino para que pasen de la muerte a la vida. En el nombre de Jesús Amén.

Death, it's one of the biggest events that will ever take place in your life. We face death everyday, conscious or unconsciously of it; death lurks around every corner of our life. Like a lion waiting to catch its prey, death comes for us all in many shapes and forms; seemingly there is no one who can escape from the jaws of death.  But did you know there is a reason why we die? The idea of death you're familiar with is only the tip of the iceberg. See we die because we've sinned against God. Death according to the bible is wages " for the wages of sin is death " (Romans 6:23).  Because man sinned against God, we live in a fallen world, it was once perfect, but now in ruins. Now that sin exists, God is coming to judge the world In righteousness. "It's appointed a man once to die and after this judgement" (Hebrews 9:27) The standard he'll judge you by is the 10 commandments, God's moral law.  He's so serious about sin that he gives anyone who sins the death sentence, the bible says you've earned it through sinning against God and God pays you in death. Each time you sin you build up his wrath. “The soul who sins shall die.” (Ezekiel 18:4) The punishment is the eternal fires of Hell " Where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth" (Matthew 13:42)  You will have to face God on Judgement Day.   Will you go to Heaven or Hell?  Here’s a quick test:   1.You shall have no other gods before Me. (Have you always loved God above all else?)   2.You shall not make yourself an idol. (Have you made a god in your mind that you're more comfortable with, a god to suit yourself?)   3.You shall not take God's name in vain. (Have you ever used God's holy Name as a cuss word?)   4.Remember the Sabbath Day, to keep it holy.   5.Honor your father and mother.   6. You shall not murder. (God considers hatred to be as murder, 1 John 3:15).   7. You shall not commit adultery. ("Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart" Matthew 5:27-28; this also includes sex before marriage).   8. You shall not steal. (Have you ever stolen anything? the value of the item is irrelevant).   9. You shall not lie. (Have you lied even once? Including answering these questions).   10. You shall not covet. (Have you ever jealousy desired what belongs to others?)   James 2:10 says, “the person who keeps all of the laws except one is as guilty as a person who has broken all of God’s laws.”    The Bible says that God will punish all murderers, rapists, thieves, liars, adulterers, etc. He will even judge our words and thoughts.   If you have done any of those things, God sees you as guilty of breaking His law and the Bible warns that the guilty will end up in Hell. Will YOU be guilty on Judgement Day?    "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Romans 6:23)   God sent His Son to suffer and die on the cross. Jesus took the punishment upon Himself and defeated death on the cross; not because you're Good but because God is rich in mercy.   “For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.” (John 3:16)   Jesus rose from the dead and defeated death. Repent (turn from sin) today and trust in Jesus and God will grant you everlasting life.   Then, Read the Bible and obey what you read.   Pray something like this:   "Dear God, today I turn away from all of my sins (name them). Today I put my trust in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. He is the only way for me to be saved. He is 'The way, the truth, and the life.'" Please forgive me, change my heart, and grant me Your gift of everlasting life. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen."   When you find time please read this, it's Christian principles for growth:   https://www.livingwaters.com/save-yourself-some-pain/

Mike WiLL Made-It was too good in 2017 on that "Humble" joint. After a while, a lot of West Coast MC's began to wish those Kendrick Lamar type beats. However, this song is dope.

At this point I feel like it is just impossible for J. Cole to miss. There is no such thing as a good J.Cole verse or song anymore. Now everything he spits is just straight legendary. There is no more good now. Now it’s just the best. Top notch shit 🔥🔥🔥

Cole Classic 🖤
Jermaine is out here bodying everything. Forever making the other artists on the song work harder than usual, we love a delivery 🔥📦
Hey Cole fans, YG and Moneybagg killed this shit too.
🔥🔥🔥
Here in the 1st hour
This had jcole and moneybag in it only 4.6k views in 1 hour 21 salvage n king von just released a non video song and had 76k in 1 hour hummm something ain't right but moneybag yo sounded the best in this song always the southern rapper to me who stand out the most
Cole sayin' stay tuned. Ib talking about it's only January and Cole already outdoing himself on features. Hope we get a another project this year, maybe something small or finally get to hear more of kill edward. Probably too son for a rotd 3. Maybe something like Truly Yours but aggressive like the off season. It's a boy maybe?
LONG LIVE DRAKEO THE RULER 🕊
Why this song got me GEEEKIN THOOO💯🥩🔥💨🍖
