Wow..🎼🫶.Was für eine Stimme...gerade durch Zufall entdeckt... Was für ein Song....❤😢🫂
J’adore son timbre de voix...❤
Here I am again for another episode of heartbreak
This is such a beautiful arrangement. He has an amazing talent, he doesn't look like that voice is in him but its literally perfect in all ranges. I tried to sing this in the car with my girlfriend and she stopped me 😂
Total dedication in every way ❤
amo regresar a escuchar esta versión, es perfecta. la banda es muy talentosa y ni hablar de la gran voz de Conor junto con las letras de las canciones que transmiten demasiado, me encantan.
Outstanding voice live 😳
SO GOOD
superb.
Waiting for someone to make me feel like this
Love u guys ❤🇦🇷
The pure emotion in this song gets me every time it's beautiful ❤
Love it,Joe is the Son of my cousin Gary Brown,i too play lead guitar,and was thrilled to find out about he and the band from one of my Aunt’s,and what a great discovery
Hab schon Karten für Düsseldorf das wird Geil ❤
Don't suppose you'd play your cover of What can I do when the fire goes out at Anita's theatre on the 28th? 🤘🤘🤘🤘
One of the best produced videos I've ever heard
In 2025 The Impossible—Just what you need when you need it most! ❤ perfect timing
Love this!
He’s so fucking cute in this video, and this song got me through covid. So, I’m just here to tell you that I wish he was singing to me personally lmao
TOP
This song makes me feel like I'm in a slow-mo moment in the middle of the crowd and I just spotted the one to marry
Thinking of walking down the aisle to this song, what's everyone's thoughts is it too alternative?
The dude looks like Perry from Kevin & Perry, and then FLOORS YOU with his vocals. Insane.
I like that his voice is similiar to mine I was considering to music with him but how can I make a comment online without people chewing me out omg I would rather be alone
great song
❤
que puta locura de canción!
We love you NBT !!! 💖
1 word AMAZING
Chills...amazing
ft. trafalgar Square!
I cry every time l hear this song, it's so relatable for every one who ever struggled with mental health issues, but who refuse to give up! I got older too and still dance the dance! Thank you from the bottom of my sometimes still broken heart!
❤🖐️✌️
Sobrang ganda, 🥺 so in love with his voice.
That voice though!  ;0}
Falling in love with this live version over and over again
These guys are effing amazing. What a great song, what a romantic love song and what a unique and powerful voice.
Beautiful track guys thank you ❤
I fell deeply in love with a girl with who I spent the four best years of my life she chjeat on me 2 time and destroy me. Even 25 years later, I’m still alone, unable to love anyone else. I'm still gasping for air,  but I just can't . Love can be cruel..."
welcome back is me
peak crashout song
01:53 magic ✨🎶🎶
Do you guys agree that this is one of the most beautiful music pieces ever made? It’s definitely not just me and all my musical friends, right? 🤔
영상편집 색이 너무세련되어요. 한국인이라 무슨말인지 모르겠지만 그냥 음악들으면 좋아요
I just fell in love with song, the arrangement the song, the lyrics the singer, the band I play this song at least once a week, it's truly beautiful ❤️
OMG @verycherri

Perfection..  we need an hour long version of this
Absolutely brilliant
Omgg 😭
Bello sigo viéndolo en el 2025 y sigue siendo bello. ❤
Best live performance I’ve ever seen ❤
For me Conor is the best vocalist in rock today..the genre of songs from love to rock / classical is unreal. My favourite band and vocalist to date
I’m obsessed with this song.
I’m not crying! You’re crying… This is so beautiful. The instrumentals just magnify an already brilliant piece of art
I listen to this almost every day since 2022. Masterpiece.  Went to see them live 4 times, not enough.
M2 😂❤😊🎉 2025
Outstanding
Hidden Gems,good music
I always wish I could relike this every time I watch it
Magnifique ! ❤
Holy crap!!! This is 🔥🔥🔥🔥

Fue una de las hermosas canciones de mi boda! 🥰
Merveilleux

Masterclass
2025, one week after seeing them in Rome. What a band!
Крутая песня!:)
2030 anyone ?
Один из лучших голосов в современной истории

This is about me where's me royalties?
Still listening, still awestruck ❤

The feels. I love this song, but this version elevates it to another level, and the orchestra adds to the magic of this epic performance.
Jesus fucking christ.

Please come to Mexico, you are great and your music is fantastic. I had the chance to see you at Indie Rock Mexico and it was a great experience. Congratulations!!!
This was my nephews first dance wedding song this past weekend. How perfect. Beautiful song.. Gives you goosebumps.
Magnifique ❤
Song song is beautiful in a codependent kind of way
who is listening in 2025?🎉🎉
2025 anyone? ❤
🌹
This my all time favorite band. And that will never change.
Absolute peak human form.
such a soaring tune, when i feel down i wack this up and pretend i can hit conor's notes...i can hang until he goes all belty then i am a mere mortal ...fuck these dudes are so talented though
I'm really impressed with this band. I'm older and coming from radiohead generation I would never imagined that a new band would be on that level again. Bravo!
This is perfection xx
gewoon een geweldig nummer , xxxx, Marijke , The Nether lands
Is it just me or do I hear  the theme of James Bond in the background.... Super awesome❤
Heals my soul
Coming here religiously because the song makes me feel something
Jesus❤️
Good Evening.🌹
The Singer has the English version of my Surname.🌹
Me.
I got married 7.12.24, this was our first dance ❤
🌹🌹🌹🌹
I studied Music for 14 years.
By this Simphony.🌹
By His Voice...
By Conor....
By this Song.
I am Obsessed.
Trop bien😅
You did it.🌹
I thought it was Impossible to melt a Heart like mine.🌹
Me.
Me.❤️‍🔥
literally how is his voice so good omg  Goosebumps
Am I the only one here that thinks this song has a very distinct James Bond vibe? The melody, accords and choice of instruments? This is a compliment by the way..  In 2017 NBT did express their wish to create a James Bond anthem. Well; they did..
They are Astonishing.🌹
This is how Marriage should be.🌹
...Goosebumps.🌹
its Impossible not to love this tune & Conor's voice is off the scale
how the fuck people miss out on this beautiful song?!?!?!?!??!
This song has never failed to give me goosebumps. An incredible and talented band
Questa canzone mi distrugge
This was 4 years ago? Why I didn't found this masterpiece sooner? This song deserve more views🙋💖
what a voice....i could listen all day....very emotional
❤ Nádherná píseň
The fact that this was live is utterly astonishing ❤
Whaou❤❤❤
Impossible😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
just saw them for the first time yesterday in Chicago.  Great show.  Lovely work.
❤
But they did cheat. Two separate Sessions in Audio. Mixed in one Video for what Impression? Not very nice. Bastille did so much better. Sorry. But its truth.
chills
From which planet does this dude come from?
Moore Eric Johnson Maria Clark Susan
Pablo Cape
I'm obsessed
Jaren Street
This whole production is truly sublime & Conor's vocals are freakishly perfect!
What a killer performance and fantastic song --  and a big, giant exclamation-pointed response of "in your face!!" to all my old guy peers constantly moaning there is no good music anymore. Have to see these guys in person soonest, and so should you

This song got stuck in my head this week, I keep singing and humming it. Great song writing, enough hooks for 3 songs. Takes me back to simpler times.  ❤
Anderson John Smith Patricia Clark Anthony
Johnpaul Forge
Whoa!
I would like to see them do a duet with Billy Ellish
Viola Row
This stupid song. I have been divorced for over a year. Met an amazing woman after I get divorced...and we are about to get married. But this song makes me think of my ex..the woman who doesn't want me...and makes me question my soon to be wife...a woman who loves me....and all I can think of is my EX. All because of this stupid song that listen to over and over again
sorry for coming late, but this is so magicaaal

This band, This song, This Performance! I am literally going through a change! Life is turning, This band is the current and major influence for me. Cheers!
I was listening on my headphones and thought this was the studio recording until the slight variance of pronunciation in “take the smooth with the rough” and holy shit, what an outstanding live performance! His voice is out of this world
Such a great voice!!

This is so beautiful and one of the best thing I've ever heard.
This is my video of YouTube
You are good but of the late great Jeff Buckley. Thank you tamed me cry again
Took a breath, let it go Felt the moment settle so I couln't wait to tell you why I'm standin' here with this awkward smile And that's because I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible Love, it stings and then it laughs At every beat of my battered heart A sudden jolt, a tender kiss I know I'm gonna die of this And that's because I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible I'll take the smooth with the rough Feels so fucked up to be in love Another day, another night Stuck in my own head but you pull me out You pull me out I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible Somebody told me and I think they're right There is a change on its way tonight And I feel it's so But I fear it though Somebody told me and I think they're right There is a change on its way tonight And I feel it's so And I feel it so I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible
64 years old and love it ❤
Super artiste je comprend pas pourquoi ont ne l entend pas souvent.❤
Too good.
I love this song!!! His voice is fabulous!
Wauw 🤯
If you haven’t been to see them yet you won’t believe me, but they are even better than this live.  Conor’s voice is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever heard.
Good morning 🌅
What a fucking set of pipes, good heck
wow they just stole my heart i don't think i can take a breath without appreciating the beauty of this masterpiece❤❤❤❤❤
Absolutely beautiful lyrics and unbelievable voice.
i want to take singing lessons and sing this song to my wife when we renew our vows
Took a breath, let it go Felt the moment settle so I couln't wait to tell you why I'm standin' here with this awkward smile And that's because I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible Love, it stings and then it laughs At every beat of my battered heart A sudden jolt, a tender kiss I know I'm gonna die of this And that's because I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible I'll take the smooth with the rough Feels so fucked up to be in love Another day, another night Stuck in my own head but you pull me out You pull me out I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible Somebody told me and I think they're right There is a change on its way tonight And I feel it's so But I fear it though Somebody told me and I think they're right There is a change on its way tonight And I feel it's so And I feel it so I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible
What a beautiful convergence of a James Bond theme like key signature and Beatles influence. Brilliant.
II drowned in love for a girl with whom I spent the 4 best years of my life. And 24 years later I am still alone, incapable of loving anyone other than her. I'm still trying to catch my breath. But it is impossible... The love can be cruel....
Perfection
so glad i came back to this song, truly amazing
This version of the song is the best, goosebumps🥰
It is a sort of crime if you are not evaluated enough. Believe me.
You are my Cure; I am in Rehab from a Chain of Fools...😊
His voice kinda reminds me of Jeff Buckley
You are doing it.🌹
It is still possible to make Poetry through Music.
You are breaking my Heart.
Non mi scomodo per cose da nulla.
I really thank you for this.
Finally somebody who has something to say.
Perfection is inside the Heart.
Forget all the rest. You are perfect this way.
The rest is useless.
This is Class.
Yes, it is still possible to break my heart.
I am glad to hear some real music.
I just sent away a fool.
You are already talented like this.
All the rest is a Circus.
Remain essential. This is your Force.
You are trying to steal hearts...
It does not worth it. Believe me.
Do not become cynical.
Keep this style, please.
I love Understatement. Real Talent lies there.
This is Romance.
You can give me Goosebumps. You are Real Musicians.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jMlFXouPk8
A real Concerto.
This is Harmony.
Only David Gilmour is the other one capable to do this to my Nervous System.
I get Shivers...
Live at Abbey Road... My compliments. I would have been at your Place.
You are good at doing your job. You are poets. Really.
Your inspiration is this, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFkCPufcoCg
The show Intelligence.
I love hybridations.
Culture.
I think you have something in common.
Like the Led Zeppelin.
I wanted to do that myself....
For how long have you been playing?
Few people do that.
You use violins. It is innovative. Out of schemes.
You deserve more.
Who is here ready for tonight's euro 2024 final? Come on lads. Its coming home.
I really like thus band was thinking of seeing them this year till I heard the accusations of domestic violence sorry his voice and the music is amazing I got chills but I won't support abusive men
Why have I only discovered this band watching Glastonbury. What a genius and that voice, goosebumps alright ❤
"Feels so fucked up to be in love"....
This is outstanding. Just saw these at Glastonbury last week and were definitely one of the highlights of the festival. Been listening to you guys ever since and this version of Impossible is incredibly perfect.
Absolutely insanely great singer and band.
Voice of an angel,honestly never heard anything like it,my new favourite song.Takes you to unimaginable highs. Love you guys.🎉😊
Goosebumps on goosebumps.So so good,im crying,Conors voice is from the angels.A song that brings emotions out like that,incredible. This band,so underrated its criminal.

Connor reminds me of Jeff Buckley when singing this~
Instant goosebumps

I regularly cry out to this song and this version is so heartbreakingly beautiful!!! Hits me right in the middle of my musical soul. Love these guys ❤ I really wish they would all see and hear it for what this band is, a musical synthesis of the arts 🎶❤️
🫶🏻
Pure talent!  Thanks for making real music and doing it so well.
Conor, if you ever read this comment, I want you to know that nobody makes me feel seen as you do with your lyrics and interpretations, and I'm deeply grateful for your talent, your commitment, and especially your vulnerability, which allowed me to feel truth through your voice and connect. I hope from the bottom of my heart that the Universe overflows your heart with all the happiness, joy, and love. You're so unique! Thanks a lot for everything! Listening to your music has been a profound experience of self-knowledge and growth for me. See ya at Lollapalooza BR. 😘
Semplicemente meravigliosi
the most amazing live band I've ever seen. They should sell out stadiums.
❤
One of my favourite songs of all time x❤
[Verse 1] Took a breath, let it go Felt the moment settle so I couldn't wait to tell you why I'm standin' here with this awkward smile And that's because  [Chorus] I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible   [Verse 2] Love, it stings and then it laughs At every beat of my battered heart The sudden jolt, a tender kiss I know I'm gonna die of this And that's because  [Chorus] I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible  [Pre-Chorus] I'll take the smooth with the rough Feels so fucked up to be in love Another day, another night Stuck in my own head but you pull me out You pull me out  [Chorus] I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible  [Bridge] Somebody told me and I think they're right There is a change on its way tonight And I feel it's so But I fear it though  Somebody told me and I think they're right There is a change on its way tonight And I feel it's so And I feel it so  [Chorus] I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible
с оркестром шикарно  вообще!
One of the tracks of the past decade 😊
J'adore tellement cet enregistrement est troo génial...
One of the best voices in the world today.. look up 'SORRY"... Absolutely incredible
If I listen to this, I cannot help but think how epic it would be for these guys to do the next Bond soundtrack
1:18 that smile :)
I wonder how many takes they had to do to make it sound so absolutely perfect. Most probably just the one because Conor can sing anything so beautifully 😭💖
Esta es mi versión favorita ❤
I just have on thing to say, and it's :    ❤❤❤❤❤
AMO essa música e essa banda ❤
I’ve seen these live and his voice is just as flawless 🤩
Modern day U2, music that brings the world together,
Awy
Obrigada xdinary heroes por apresentar essa obra prima
Application for a Bond soundtrack?
Beautiful version.
songs of them that has the vibes like this? i want to feel.
jooyeon is everywhere here... from the vocalist's voice to the blond guitarist 😂  BUT REALLY GOOSEBUMPS! the emotions is too much i cant take it all...
W❤W
Was this used for an advert? I feel like it was but can't think
Shout out to Hey Neighbour Fest for introducing me to this amazing band 🤍
Few bands made me cry this year, but this shit always hits like a focking dumptruck. 😅
And just like that a harmonious universe was created and filled with love & hope sprinkled between the stars and galaxies as Life sprouts...
WAUW ❤
Fucking chills. Brings me to tears. And yes I am a silly old man but I love it
Zo ongelooflijk mooi en met een heel diepe impact, hoe komt het dat ik dit pas eerst gisteren heb ontdekt.. Special item Top2000 🙏🎶❤️🍀
Listening to this piece of Art,makes me shiver and Cry,this is the Ultimate song by far,the voice the orchestration all toghetter gives you tears and shivers,the voice is like honey to my old soul,i'm 72,and this is it,and the singer Coner's is one of the finest voice,like heaven opens the  sunshine,wonderful MATERPIECE
I'm hearing the James Bond tune in this. It's the guitars. This should have been the theme for 'No time to die'. Great track. Kudos🙌
Every so now and then I stop by to play this song. Just beautiful.
Hacía tiempo que no escuchaba una voz tan privilegiada y hermosa como está ❤❤❤
Absolutely love this song .Brilliant singer and band
I made it possible to you
Brividi, energia, lacrime di gioia per questo capolavoro che mi dona vita, e tutti, band, cantante e orchestrali si sono resi conto del momento speciale che hanno generato, dell'emozione della quale erano protagonisti. Grazie Nothing But Thieves. Chills, energy, tears of joy for this masterpiece that gives me life, and everyone, the band, the singer, and the orchestra realized the special moment they had created, the emotion of which they were the protagonists. Thank you Nothing But Thieves.
Wow! Truly Amazing. What a voice ❤
This is a master piece. I have been listening to this song from the moment it came out, and I still do. Absolutely LOVE this (and the band in general)
His voice gives me chills. I can't get enough of this song.
Theme song version for the next James Bond movie 😲 and the movie will be 'Nothing is impossible'
A reason why i love music
Had this song sent to me😊 I may just be in Love forever with the sender 🥰
Hermosa voz ! me recordó a jeff buckley
I found this band this year  The best discovery ever
I got married today in Bisbee AZ. This was our wedding song. Our first dance was to this too. Thank you ♥️
My heart just beating so fast. I wanna scream inside my heart. 😢😢😢
This is sooo awesome!
My current crush just sent me this link and I am doing my best not to read anything into that but COME ON.  *dies*
❤️❤️❤️❤️💕💕💕💕💕
Amazing song
They would sound so great as Bond movie soundtrack
Way to less likes!
What a beautiful song, beautiful voice and beautiful text .❤❤

This song is pure love.

Juste une dinguerie😊😊😊

wat een geweldige opname en wat een strot heeft die jongen!
Gracias Conor, por esta jodida maravilla! Qué voz!
I thought it was impossible to reach that note huh

Far better than the original version.. very talented..
Ayer se la dediqué a mi novio, creo que le gustó.
Brings me to tears 🥺
❤
Jeff Buckley reborn
Just watched them live for the first time… imagine this but 10 times bettter he’s sooo gooood ALL OF THEM ARE!!!
I wonder what it feels like to love and be loved this way. It sounds very beautiful
Absolute perfection. No one else could sing this as well. NBT should be the biggest band in the world right now!
I thinked he was a lesbian girl. What a Voice!!!
I'm in the moment when you realise a few of the song you love hearing on the radio are by the same band, you look in to it and find them and become addicted to hearing them, find the lyrics and versions like this. WOW I'm in love with NBT...Next stop, tickets!
Se me hace la piel de gallina, está banda es de lo mejor que he escuchado WOW!!
Insane ❤
Proper talent right there
Absolutely Outstanding 👍🏻
Quand j’écoute cette chanson je m’envole , je m’en vais retrouver mon ange gardien. 💖
Beautiful doesn’t begin to describe this song. My heart was heavy when I fist heard this song. Now I’m full of hope for the future. Thank you. ❤️
What a voice! I love this song
I love this song and this version is my favourite... after ending 5 year long very toxic relationship I fell in love with a great guy... I was terrified to say the least. But I fell so hard and suddenly everything was possible :) I remember it was the first song I played him when we talked about music and now it is forever connected to our relationship :)
Fucking A that was beautiful!
Why are these guys are not massive is beyond me
I just discovered this band and OMG… as a 46 year old woman I can hear the 70’s/80’s influence in how they arrange songs. My heart soared (no joke) when I heard a guitar solo in their songs, strings, horns… Man, keep it coming. Gen Z has earned my respect.
Incredible song, orchestral arrangement and of course Conor’s vocals.  What I don’t get is why NBT haven’t won more awards or made it to the mainstream singles charts? The most underrated band of the decade.
Never had a band instantly become my favorite band as fast as you guys. The vocals the composition,  every song being different and great. Cant wait to see you guys rock the fillmore in detroit i will be there!!!
Just saw them at Leeds festival. They are absolutely amazing!!!! It sounded like this. Great band!
Sublime
Meravigliosi  brano, voce e arrangiamento 💯💯💯
💓
How have I not heard this version … stunning 🥺
Just.Beautiful.
His voice is heaven ❤
A song for every battered heart xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Absolutely stunning...❤
Most beautiful love song I have ever heard and on top of that there is this fantastic voice.
Wow, just discovered him, amazing
Im F....in speachless. ....The Best!!!!
The lyric, this level of romanticism seemed to be lost in our sick postmodern world.  So if the great British philosopher Terry Eagleton argues that great scholars do not even know their own feelings, this band, this singer, make their feelings shine, great!
Phenomenal...tugs at my heart...😢
What about an entire concert with orchestra? It'd be great 'coz this version of Impossible is perfect. ❤❤❤❤❤
That was stunning
Oh gosh... this makes so many emotions erupt straight from my heart and come out as tears. What a blast!
Wow. One of the best videos on YouTube. Let's see how long it takes to get to 10M views from here (currently 5.2M) after all the exposure for the new album (which is amazing).
Damn….that boy can sing
Perfect for a wedding song 💕🙌🏼
Kocham ❤❤ słyszałam na żywo dla takich chwil się żyje 🥰
I almost forgot to breathe while watching this. Completely took my breath away!
WOW !!
Utterly superb
Amazing performance
This was done very well.  Nice!
Absolutely insane performance, even better than the original studio recording and of course, one of the most incredible singing voices ever.
What a moment for everyone in that room, my word
This is perfect!!!
This song is pure romance. If you don’t feel something listening to this, you're dead inside. Goosebumps!  Love this band. ❤
He is easily one of the best, if not the best, singer in rock right now.
Does anyone know which brand is Dom's guitar? Shape of a 335, but it ain't. Thank you for any leads.
You know the song is good when the Most replay section of this clip is the begining!!!
I have to admit.  I started judging the book by its cover with all those cluttered cables, the non-atmosphere, ...  My god, I was so wrong...
Can I marry a song?
Omg,  absolutely Beautiful 🫶
Found you guys like a month ago. I was having (probably still am) a rough time and I needed your music and didn't know. Thank you!
This is a masterpiece from a great band. I would love them performance on night of the proms . Also please in Belgium.
This is a Bond theme...prove me wrong.
We used this song as our first dance at our wedding, beautiful and i can't wait to see you guys in the Ziggo Dome in  2024!
Jeff Buckley vibes ❤️
I played this to my husband the other day. He said it was okay 😢. .... I think it's time for a divorce 😂
holy cow batman...who the heck is this amazing singer...wow
!
Absolutely Stunning!! Gives me Jeff Buckley vibes which makes my heart explode into glitter ✨
most beautiful song, Conor's vocal is incredible!
This is one of the best performances I’ve ever seen. Mind blown
still brings tears to my eyes , god I love this song
Beautifull song for lover) but i dont like so wary sweet song. So sorry
Awesome
Jesus, Mohammed, everything sacred guys. Please just drop the fucking album! I'm so disappointed, I'm expecting signature vinyls delivered to my home! Love from South Africa!
WOW
This band has gotta be just about the best thing to come out of Southend in the 21st century, and the only thing that makes me proud of my home town.
Can you record every song with an orchestra? What a masterpiece! I could not love this more ❤
я тут після чергового перегляду каверу XH на цю пісню 😍
Conheci essa música através de um cover da banda coreana xdinary heroes, desde então me apaixonei 😍
I’m totally in love with Conor’s voice!! The best i’ve ever heard ❤❤❤
Bravi!!!
HOLY CRAP 🤯 THAT WAS AMAZEBALLS
Espectacular ésta versión.  Gran banda, saludos desde Chile
Beautifil music
This is the best new music I've heard for a while.
Beyond words
Great song
Chills. Just love this band so much. His voice is one of the best I’ve ever heard.
¡Joder, que temazo y que voz más llena de emociones!
This song is divine. Goosebumps every time.
Nothing is impossible!🥰
Madre del amor hermoso <3 INCRÍBLE
Literally no words. His voice is nuts!!
No male vocalist that I can think can match Connors range. Gets better on every album.
Love, love this song!! I performed it at my end of year concert in 2022 @13yrs old ... hope to sing like this one day 💕
I could drown myself in someone like you 🫠
I don’t know how many times I’ve listened to all of this bands songs on repeat. His singing voice is literally so amazing. My favourite song by them right now is probably “You know me to well” I know every lyric in the song lol. I also went to go watch this band a y not festival 2022 and they were so good. This is my overall favourite band xx
i came here after xdinary hereos
.
Here I'm 'cause Xdinary Heroes performance. This is the great song I've ever heard. So touching and the meaning sooo drowning me so bad ❤️😭
This sounds like it could be a 007 song for its movie😊❤️
Unreal performance..love it more each time Hail Hail Bhoys
Nothing But Thieves - amazing music and lyric writers, musicians, singers and lead vocal. This orchestral version is so good. Congrats orchestra and the music arranger.
The orchestration on this is amazing!  The vocals sublime.
NBT make me fall in love with them everytime I listen to their songs over and over... and Connor's voice is something out of this world.
Currently going thru a heartbreak  and this song reminds me a lot of her, describes perfectly how I feel, till wherever u are are, hopefully ur doing great sosy 😮‍💨
I can never get enough of this song and music video. It pops up again and again in my YouTube list. Almost on repeat. Wonderfully bombastic
2:59 (inspirational music) Yea
OMG ... MADE FOR GREATNESS . INSANELY GREAT BAND . WHAT A VOICE .
Rock Angels xo
I feel like this.. i am so in love on someone who never can answer my feelings 💔
Why tf am I crying in target rn
Masterpiece
Stumbled upon this today and it gave me goosebumps.  Good God what an incredible voice and song. Bravo.
This orchestral composition is sooooo beautiful. And I always my favorite vocals from Conor Mason.  Edit: You know it's a masterpiece when you get MORE goosebumps on the second-listen-in-a-row.
Omg how have I never heard of this band, absolutely amazing 👏, loved every second
What a beautiful song. I can’t believe I’ve only just discovered it.  The vocal is amazing, brings a lump to my throat
Some of the most underrated talent🥶
Best version of this song.
it's so amazing and beautiful to hear Jeff Buckley influence in his singing. Love it.
If I don’t dance to this version of this song at my wedding I’m not getting married
Imagine being that good… I can’t. 😊
I like your song, but i love cover version from The Voice of Romania with Diana Guia and Smaranda Marian . I try mashup those two version :)
What a voice and what a song!! Amazingly good!!! 😮👌
Un moment qui t’emportes loin, j’adore
Holy shit they are amazing
even more perfect omg
I really want to press the like button each time I came back here...
imagine the pressure on the guy playing those last couple notes to finish out the song... don't mess up, bub
I remember sharing this on FB a couple of years ago and 2 people actually criticised them. Music snobbery at its finest. What a pair of w4nkers.
Vetusta Morla  (Band) was here Google it
Back again to this performance haha
The Strings are incredible! Who are the players?
This is exceptional! Great song, striking performance and....utterly fantastic singing. Wow! 🤩
This is a song of my life... I want to they Play IT on my funeral
Itch. I saw NBT in Vancouver at the Vogue theatre. They sounded as good as I hoped they would. Conor is great singer.
The best from nbt, hello from indonesia 🤘
Here because Diana Guia vs Smaranda Marian. 🎉
His voice is a gift, I hope he reads these comments ❤❤
Love them! Is that not enough for Grammy?
Fun fact: The Netherlands is absolutely in love with this version! So much that the biggest radio event of the year (Radio 2  - Top 2000), which lists the greatest 2000 songs of all time according to its listeners, put this Abbey-road version on the 77th place this year and last year on 97th place. This is an incredibly high notation for a live-version along other bands / artists such as Queen, Led Zeppelin, Eagles, Deep Purple, Metallica, David Bowie, Pink Floyd just to name a few.   The Netherlands loves you Nothing But Thieves!
Here’s the “”LYRICS””   Took a breath, let it go Felt the moment settle so I couln't wait to tell you why I'm standin' here with this awkward smile And that's because  I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible  Love, it stings and then it laughs At every beat of my battered heart A sudden jolt, a tender kiss I know I'm gonna die of this And that's because  I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible  I'll take the smooth with the rough Feels so fucked up to be in love Another day, another night Stuck in my own head but you pull me out You pull me out  I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible  Somebody told me and I think they're right There is a change on its way tonight And I feel it's so But I fear it though  Somebody told me and I think they're right There is a change on its way tonight And I feel it's so And I feel it so  I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible
i cant explain my feeling for this song and the weird thing is ive never been in love or in a relationship before
Holy shit this is amazing.
Still addicted to this song, who's with me? X
What a powerful crazy beautiful song!🙏🙏🙏🔥🔥🔥🔥
MUITO BOM
No word cand describe how sublime this song and how good nbt are as artists. Also Conor will never stop amazing me.
This song is how I feel about my beloved. It’s stunning x
Here because it’s amazing
It's surprising that I am the only one who knows this song. After all, I account for all 4.6 million views.
Crying, thank you for this
Took a breath, let it go  Felt the moment settle so  I couldn't wait to tell you why  I'm standing here with this awkward smile  And that's because  I could drown myself in someone like you  I could dive so deep, I'd never come out  I thought it was impossible  But you make it possible  Love it stings, and then it laughs  At every beat of my battered heart  A sudden jolt, a tender kiss  I know I'm gonna die of this  And that's because  I could drown myself in someone like you  I could dive so deep, I'd never come out  I thought it was impossible  But you make it possible  I'll take the smooth with the rough  Feels so fucked up to be in love  Another day, another night  Stuck in my own head, but you pull me out  You pull me out  I could drown myself in someone like you  I could dive so deep, I'd never come out  I thought it was impossible  But you make it possible  Somebody told me, and I think they're right  There is a change on its way tonight  And I feel it's so  But I fear it though  Somebody told me, and I think they're right  There is a change on its way tonight  And I feel it's so  And I feel it's so  I could drown myself in someone like you  I could dive so deep, I'd never come out  I thought it was impossible  But you make it possible
This is so beautiful and I have seen a lot!<3
I freaking love these guys, I'm an independent artist, this song is very influenced by these heavy guitar riffs. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu5WC23lnps&ab_channel=PaoloMazzilli If you want to check it out, I swear you'll find a lot of NBT in the sound.
so good it hurts
Criminally underrated song
This version is amazing! makes me wanna cry of how good it is! I love so much his vocals <3
wow
Bruhh how is this even live …
😁
I think his voice is an incredible gift of the nature. Seems to be impossible to sing this song in a better way. An iconic voice, a perfect mix of power, beauty and sweetness...
💜
Simply my daughters’ song, 01/01/21 born
Masterpiece
That voice is incredible. I'm a metal head really, but nothing but thieves has me questioning everything musically.
i love you!
This makes me so happy and that beautiful voice is not bored. That's how you make music that always stays!
best song on Youtube :)
Great song
❤
시발존나좋다
Simply outstanding
Why is Kylian Mbappé playing the trumpets @1:22 😭😭😭
So dramatic and joyful at the same time... Can't help to come back to it, when I need to cry, shout, or say 'I love you'. Ok, born in '65 in the past century, I'm an out-of-time Beatle fan. This studio means so much to me, therefore... Mais bon ! Je suis aussi trèèèès Français, poète, de surcroît, pas gay (mais bon, "nul n'est parfait", disait Platon, je crois... ou peut-être Zaratoustra) et je t'aaaime, fort fort fort, sacré Conor ! 😁 (attention : pas loin, chez nous, il y a "sacré connard", mais, tu l'as déjà dit : I'm sorry...) Bravo, brava, bravi !
🔥🔥🔥🔥🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷
Can’t believe I’ve only discovered this song now. I think it’s my favourite song of all time. Beautiful.
네~
#Xdinary Heroes bring me here... I love this song so much that i get drown into it. And it keeps playing nonstop in my head...
Magnifique version, les violons, melange de classique et la voix de conor digne d un chanteur d opera😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
The first song that made me fall head over heels in love with Nothing But Thieves and Conor's voice and soul... Thanks for you ❤
This was my wedding song for walking in to my now husband ❤
POV: you’re trying to find a comment that doesn’t mention xdinary heroes
Amazing
If cold play and radiohead had a baby but in a good way
I love my life!!!! 🇨🇿💝🥳
When he sang this live, I swear my soul left my body.
Che bella!!!!
Very glad I stumbled upon this, what a performance!
😶😔
i missed the target the same way I missed your company 🥴😔😟😥😞
Criminally underrated song
Amazing!!!!🔝🔝🔝🔝
live @ pukkelpop  , it was great !!!!
:)
Took a breath, let it go Felt the moment settle so I couldn't wait to tell you why I'm standin' here with this awkward smile And that's because  [Chorus] I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible  [Verse 2] Love, it stings and then it laughs At every beat of my battered heart The sudden jolt, a tender kiss I know I'm gonna die of this And that's because  [Chorus] I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible  [Pre-Chorus] I'll take the smooth with the rough Feels so fucked up to be in love Another day, another night Stuck in my own head but you pull me out You pull me out  [Chorus] I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible [Bridge] Somebody told me and I think they're right There is a change on its way tonight And I feel it's so But I fear it though  Somebody told me and I think they're right There is a change on its way tonight And I feel it's so And I feel it so  [Chorus] I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible  Lyrics from genius.com
are you telling me that those background voices were just those 2 guys?
crying rn 😭
came back and decided to leave something on the comment section, how beautiful the lyrics after u realize there's someone out there that could make you give up everything and effortlessly drowning yourself. Thank you nothing but T.
Который раз слушаю и мурашки бегут Эта песня как глубокий глоток свежего воздуха и много солнечного света, очень красиво
After reading lots of the comments, I feel very lucky to be in the U.K. and have watched these guys from, just about, their beginning. I’ve seen them 4 times, or is it 5? live and have singed albums etc. This version of Impossible is simply breath taking. So glad so many other people are getting into them.

Superb version. Connors vocals are simply stunning
When you get double Goosebumps when listening to this song for the unnumbered time <3
Thanks Xdinary Heroes to cover this song and introduce me with this masterpiece.
the kpop stans in the comment
Stunning 💞💞💞
I love you, G.  And I always will.
There is very little music of this calibre now. Phenomenal.
Шедеврально!!!
That “deep” at 2:54 is perfection
Xdinary heroes brought me here
1100100010110110
The guys from Xdinary made a decent cover, i really liked the added guitar part. Regarding pure singing this here is on another level, Xdinary is mostly autotune and very shallow. His voice here is amazing with so much more depth and feeling.  I love this orchestral version!
If the James Bond theme started a band when he was a teenager.
I saw them live a few days ago and I want to say that they are absolutely amazing, they blew everyone away and I can't wait to see them again! <3
I got goosebumps 😳😳😳
Beautiful , love it <3
one of the best things I've ever heard
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Why am I crying?
:(((((
Gracias a Xdinary Heroes, que hizo un hermoso cover, conocí esta banda es genial, increíble la canción, su voz, todo.
A MASTERPIECE
the violinist with the bangs was tearing up towards the end
CHILLS. My word.
A MASTERPIECE
This might be the 607th time listening to this song and crying. So gorgeous, so much power, so much emotion.
Beautiful song! ❤

Hello from Ukraine.

🥺🥺🥺
I rediscovered this song yesterday and man it's still good, the feeling, the goosebumps, everything
This song is beautiful anyway but the live orchestra with the band just takes it to a whole other level
Conor Mason's voice and the instrumental are so good, I'm touched by this song 😭💘
Beautiful song indeed 💖
😭😭No words...

씨발 존나 완벽하네
Best love song! Unbelievable talent
wrapping things up that did not see possible 😁
For us pascal
is this version on spotify? I'm adicted to it and need at all time
Listened to them for the very first time last night, and LIVE to boot. Mad respect, for Conor being in top form and the whole band for the amazing music. They made a fan out of me in less than an hour.
I was 14 when ads for Nothing But Thieves self-titled album started coming up on my youtube feed and I have listened to them ever since. I’ve never not loved an album. I adore the song Impossible and I love the addition of the orchestral arrangement. It’s beautiful, chilling, and emotional. Thank you, from an OG.
Best song of the 21st century....fantastico
ive been listening to this 24/7
Magical 🤘
this song is so beautiful at the point it hurts
god tier song
Wow, intense! Is there a Jools Holland in the house...reminds me of the days when Oasis in 1994 went live on Jools Holland...
I LOVE THIS SONG❤❤❤❤❤
THIS IS EXTREME DOPENESS. Nothing best. ever ever
🤯😭🥇💘👌🍾⛳🎯👏

Bt Sport champions league final?
2022 Champions League final song love it. I can't find it now #BTsport where is it ?!
The champions league final brought me here
I thought new music was dead but this is a fucking tune
Where can I get the UEFA version?
I heard day because champions league final amazing
This has to be one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. It's May 2022 and I want to know how I've missed out on this for so long. Thank you UAEFA for playing this at the end of the final. I'm hooked, stunning 😍
Who’s here after the BT Sport outro
Liverpool in the mud 😭  Yes REAL MADRID
Just watched this video edited with the 2021/22 champions League run from group stage to finals. Incredible because Real Madrid kept doing the impossible. 👌🏾
Here after hearing this at the end of the Champions League, how have I not heard this before, just incredible!
I came here because Real Madrid!!!!
Hala Madrid!
UEFA champions league final 2022 brought me here. Unlucky Liverpool
I put this together with Paolo Nutini's Iron Sky on Abbey Road. It has the same vibe, it's awesome.  It just has so much energy, that by the end I sigh (in a good way)
the voice is heartbreaking...
His voice is SILKY smooth! Fantastic to listen to.
INCREDIBLE!!
Uefa champions league brought me here
Stupenda!!! ❤
No words...💙💜
Can't stop listening to this song...what a masterpiece 😍🥺
nothing but a masterpiece 🙌🙌
This is FUCKING BEAUTIFUL. I can not understate how much this song gives me goosebumps
Honestly on of the best songs I’ve ever heard in my LIFE!
Magnífica versión,  felicitaciones!
Minha singela homenagem a essa verdadeira obra de arte como já falaram aqui https://youtu.be/t3If_CA3WHY
This guy has got PIPES! ❤️
Very nice tune, but Dear Prudence and My Iron lung are toooo much similar……
Господь всемогущий, как же я люблю музыку этих ребят Меня уносит куда-то в космос Гениально Абсолютно гениально
what a masterpiece.
I wish I could be that microphone
Who’s introduced by Xdinary Heroes? Amazing song. 🙏🏼
In 2050 people will say: "Still one of the songs ever!"

라이브 맛도리 낫벗띠🤩

Jeff Buckley voice vibes!

groupe découvert il y a peu par leur titre Amsterdam (merci les suggestions youtube), mais je ne peut plus m'arrêter, chaque morceau est excellent, et quelle voix !
I don't like this song, i adore it !!
I loooove this song so much!!!!!!
Wunderschön und auf den Punkt. Vielen Dank dafür❤️‍🔥
This hits me so strong. Thank you .
You guys need to put this on Spotify
If this song won’t be played at my future wedding, I won’t show up.
São os maiorais
Every song gets richer and better with orchestra support, even the brilliant ones :)
damn...this is like storm in my head....how can.....
His voice gives me so many goosebumps.. Kinda teared up too. So awesome..
i’ve loved nbt for many years now even went to one of their first shows and it was absolutely amazing i’m so glad they have never changed their sound
WOW!👍😃 never thought that some tears would run down my face today... beautyfull Song🌈🔥
Such a gold ✨
Sings from the soul beautiful voice the band is amazing I'm 60 yrs old scrolling down the music Amsterdam blew my mind
Absolute masterpiece. Easily one of the greatest tracks I’ve EVER heard. Probably one of the best that had been tracked at abbey road. Massively underrated band. Absolutely mind blowing songwriting.
Waarom ontdek ik dit nu pas? Wat een stem, ik blijf hier naar luisteren!
"I know I'm gonna die of this." Every line is gorgeous.
기타로 뚱띵거리면서 간들간들 부르는거 진짜 개좋네 오늘 듣는데 자동힐링 됨 이 노래 짱
Absolutely addicted to this. Epic.
I adore this song so much. :')
Love this band. But hate this song so much, to me its horrible!
you know, i used this song.. told the woman i loved that I would use this at our wedding. Well (shocker), but she cheated and decided to leave me behind. I was so fucking scared of this song for nearly a year now. and I finally came back to it to listen to it. Ready to cry, ready to think of them. No tears came and infact.. I felt better. Knowing I can hear this song and think of her without ripping my heart out. So i will keep this song with me, maybe someone else will appreciate it.
Made up my mind. I believe that this is the most beautiful song that I have ever heard.
You make it possibleee 💜🥳
This song is one of the most beautiful songs I’ve ever heard. I want them to play it at my wedding one day!! Ugh it’s so beautiful! A big gay wedding with their beautiful and amazing music. You’re ALL invited! Lol some. I can’t pay for all of you. Lol
Absolutely beautiful. What a talent 👏
I love it. Hurts. But I love it...
another year and th eperson i am in love with is still a figment of my imagination, and I am sick of waiting, so I love this song so much, but it is for me, a let down, and I have to make it happen for myd=self now, or I will be lonely forever.
Amazing!! OMG, I'm crying!!!
It gives me chill
Conor is on another level, this band is very underrated!
Thanks for everything!
two years late youtube recommends me the best song ever. haha
Absolutely beautifully sung, played, shot and edited!😍
this is fucking good
Blew me away thank you
This is so beautiful. #masterpiece #goosebumps
wow his voice is amazing
after listening to xdinary heroes cover this song has been on repeat. I love both versions and nothing but thieves poured his heart out in this song ❤️
I wish they were picked to make a Bond theme song. His voice is otherworldly.
Oh my god
i actually got to like xdinary heroes because they covered this song 🙌 they did pretty good
i can't get enough of this song, it's so beautiful
What a ridiculous vocalist. That is some crazy shite.
Conor tiene la mejor voz de la historia y del mundo, fin.
Canlı dinlemeden ölmeyeyim lütfen
mooie stem!!!!
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷 2022
A taste of Jeff Buckley in this quieter tones. An amazing talent. Big things to come for you.
Co za głos ! Masakra !!
What an exquisite song 👌
Это волшебно. Я болею вами. Ваше творчество заставляет сердце биться. Люблю💗 Thank you very much. I love you so much
Best rock voice on this planet
Funny how YouTube keeps things and brings it to you when you need. Beautiful song and acoustic was amazing
I thought I couldn’t love this song more but I was WRONG! Amazing, amazing, amazing 💖💖🙌🏻🙌🏻
Superbe !!
THIS IS MASTERPIECE. Thanks Xdinary Heroes to cover this song and introduce me with this masterpiece.
Gracias Zoram por mostrarme esta banda, es genial y tú también!

Is he England? Or American?
Perfect!!!

Wow wow wow just wow👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻❤️
THANK YOU YOUTUBE RECOMMENDATIONS

Just look up their cover of What Can I Do If The Fire Goes Out. Full body shivers and tears.
breathtaking
!!
Fantastici
whoa vocalll
Test
Soooo good
Okay. I thought this is a kids band. 😂
It’s criminal how underrated this band is.
Timeless
how can it not be brandon flowers singing? soooo similar!
xdinary heroes brought me here, an amazing song indeed
I am so bummed their Feb dates are canceled 🥺
He reminds me off Jeff Buckley.
I went here because it has already stucked in my mind, thanks to Xdinary Heroes for introducing this song...Those lyrics the guy has throwing and his voice makes me more in love with this song🥺
Xdinary Heroes sent me here... i love this song
This is just utterly beautiful.
Banda maravilhosa, música linda e a performance do Conor é antológica.
I'm here to tell you all.. The next James Bond soundtrack will be produced by Nothing but Thieves.
Abbey road studio!!!!! Dudes!!! I felt the beatle magic !!!!!!
Awesome !! Never heard before , but I love it!!!!
soooo gooood
Xdinary Heroes, thank you for this song ♥️
This song is an absolute masterpiece
Que dom divino
if it takes a kpop group for you to find out about this band, then you have been living under a rock. thank god, you are here
Here after Xdinary Heroes cover's, I'm obsessed with this song
his vocal range is just crazy
I've been listening to this for a whole year...but I've never heard the album version!! Is there an album version?? 🤷‍♀
tears in my eyes... oml my ears and soul are so blessed
спасибо xdinary heroes
I think his voice is like a combination of Jooyeon and Jisung's voices
Can't go wrong with any masterpiece that comes out of Abbey Rd Live Sessions.  Nothing But Thieves, Michael Kiwanuka, Paola Nutini, etc.  This arrangement is nothing short of talent, emotion and magic and I prefer it to the original.
I never want to climb out of this eternal, perfect bowl of human emotion, beautifully depicted by Connor's gorgeous vocal ..... I wish everyone were able to find, or be allowed access to, either music or books, within which they may, even fleetingly, be able to use that media, to escape, fly over the narrative of their life and be transported via musical or written note, to another head space entirely...... the world would be a better place
Coming back everyday to this song.  What a beautiful marriage of all the pieces.
Here from xdinary heroes ❤️❤️
i wonder what he feels, thinks about when he sings the chorus part.
his voice is insanely mindblowing.thank you xdinary heroes for introducing me this masterpiece.
I feel like i’ve heard this before
Just came to check out after listening to xdinary heroes cover and it's actually a masterpiece I'm amazed...literally gaped through the whole performance 🔥🔥🔥😲😲

omg i'm sorry i'm so late. i should've discovered you guys sooner :((((
Got to this version by accident and I like this so much I'm afraid to hear the original version
Came here after watching Xdinary Heroes cover and I have to say that this song really gives impact on me. I have been listening to it on repeat. Hearing this song makes me heal from all the things that I have been going through in the last 2 years. Hoping for 2022 to be a year that I can be confident of myself and putting myself first instead of others. Wish those who read this to have a healthy and happy year!!
Thx so much Xdinary hero's 😭👍👍😁

No telling how many legendary musical ghosts got stirred up over this one. John Lennon and George Harrison no doubt on guitars rocking along. Wishing they could play just one more audible note....

im here bcz Xdinary Heroes cover this song 😍 omg this song so beautiful 😭
Currently considering making multiple accounts so I can keep liking this fucking banger.
"Impossible"  Took a breath, let it go Felt the moment settle so I couln't wait to tell you why I'm standin' here with this awkward smile And that's because  I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible  Love, it stings and then it laughs At every beat of my battered heart The sudden jolt, a tender kiss I know I'm gonna die of this And that's because  I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible  I'll take the smooth with the rough Feels so fucked up to be in love Another day, another night Stuck in my own head but you pull me out You pull me out  I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible  Somebody told me and I think they're right There is a change on its way tonight And I feel it's so But I fear it though  Somebody told me and I think they're right There is a change on its way tonight And I feel it's so And I feel it so  I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible
Vi amo 😍🥰🤙🏻
i love how the xh stans are here, this is a good song 😭🤍

Ух, какие скрипачки.

This song is amazing
Conor, bravo! Muy buena comosicion. Una de las mejores en el mundo musical de ultimos aňos. 👍👍👍
I agree with their recognition status right up there better than so called top bands for real 🤪😛!!!!!!!!!!
The drummer sucks though!
Just another 1 hit wonder.....
Was never a fan of his voice until this version of the song came on the radio. Immediately hooked. This is so good!!
My 14yr old daughter was due to perform this solo at her school and covid got it cancelled. God I hate this pandemic 😷🤬😡
Boss 😎

If there was ever a song that expressed what loves sounds like... ah here it is!
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCXPZpKtj78nsQqwBUNdyaA
Sounds like a James Bond song. Dope!
This song is so beautiful 💕
Muttu laut hören, und zusehen natürlich. Ungestört! Was für ein emotionaler Song, und ein genialer Streichereinsatz. Da läuft's dir kalt den Rücken runter. WAHNSINN!

Honestly, Conor's voice never ceases to amaze me. So much feeling, so much soul. No other singer out there can ever compare.

This is the most emotional song I've ever heard... this text... reminds me of the greatest love in my life I never had.... W.

I haven't felt in a long time what this live version of this song made me feel. His emotions, the composition of the song, everthing coming together just sounds like the most beautiful song I've ever heard!
I just came across these guys and HOLY SHIT! Like how does this talent exist?!?! Conor's vocals are beautiful and powerful and this song is just, BRILLIANT! lol
Amazing. What a voice. ❤️
Tremendous...!!!

If this doesn’t play at my wedding I’m not getting married.
Обожаю
This version takes this song to a stratospheric level Amazing 🤩
Back again .. such an underrated band man..
ti amo.
To me this song is like the word butterfly,  if Imagine Dragons was butter and Panic! At The Disco was fly; on their own they can be enjoyable but put them together and you have a wonderful thing called a butterfly :)
Beautiful
can't wait to see yall live in Philly again!!! 😁😆♥
Now why does this song have my crying over a love I’ve never had?! I’ve been single my whole life!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Oh man! I'm so happy for the 3M, they deserve everything in the world.  Nothing but thieves is my favorite band and I really appreciate the 'Moral Panic' era because it was the first album I listened to.  Thank you so much 😭💖
Nondeju wat is dit mooi!! 🥰🥲❤️
I do love Nothing but Thieves ❤️
Best song ever
Waouhhhh ! Qu'est-ce qu'il chante bien ! J'en reviens pas qu'une personne puisse chanté comme ça. C'est sublime
masterpiece

Siete grandi!! Poesia in musica! Grande voce! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Man this is masterpiece
my heart
영국의 넬이다
I feel a great sense of sadness for anyone that doesn't know the amazingness that is NBT
I'm 38 next week.  My parents brought me up on the Beatles, the rolling stones David Bowie and Lou Reed I found my way into the strokes and radio head in my mid twenties now I'm so glad this band has came up. Bravo.....
What I imagine falling in love sounds like
I'm adding this to every 'Opera singer reacts' video channel I can find here on Youtube. You should all do the same.
Magical...xxx
Conors voice is unreal, so powerful.
🤍
Great sound, would never have listened to this band if it weren’t for the song with Rag N Bone ✌️ Great range of vocals
just WOW
Conor Mason could literally sing the words from the dictionary and I'd still be saying how can he make it sound so good
and i thought this song couldn’t get anymore magical… i was wrong
Masterpiece
Good how I love this song, and always love to watch this video when listening. Truly excellent, thanks 👍
This guy is feeling every note
I never thought I'd fall for anyone else again in my lifetime. This song makes me think of the lady I'm in love with, without fail, every time. You make it possible... <3
Thanks!! sa awesome
이걸이제야보다니♡♡
Best song of 2020
Is this version on spotify?
The first time I felt the need to applaud a video......
I LOVE ALL THE INSTRUMENTS IN THIS SONG!!!! They sound perfect together, you can hear each one of them!!
How?! Just How?! Is this not a Bond song??
Incredible ❤️Impossible
Li ho scoperti nell'ottobre del 2020. Me ne sono innamorata grazie a questo brano. Ogni volta che lo ascolto, ho )a pelle d'oca. È possibile ancora emozionarsi.😍😍😍
Love seeing all these artists together ❤
This is the most beautiful song I have heard in ages. Conor is IMMENSE!!
Holy jeez, Conor.
Stumbled on to this version while on Holiday, it's almost 40C here, but I have chills to my toes
класс!
- Son, turn it down. - Why? - We have bigger speakers downstairs!
My god😭😭😭😭😭
If the trees are very beautiful with their green color, and the sea is very beautiful with its blue color, and the cool breeze blows over the mountains. So this song is a combination of all these beauties. God gave a very beautiful voice to Connor, like God created trees, seas, mountains with all their beauty
Wow, absolutely stunning song!!!
Why the hell wasn't this number 1 for 17 weeks?!
Why have I only heard of these guys now, been around since 2012. This song is so strong and brings me to tears.
gracias abbey road
impossible es imposible
No favourite band!!💪🏻
Speechless...
He has to be in my top five male singers of all time.
So wow. Just… so wow
When Conor closes his eyes and just enjoys the music, that's exactly how I feel about this song.
this makes me believe in the existence of love
One of the most beautiful song I ever heard🥺♥️
Wow!
this is the best i think
The best voice! Wow!
Maravilloso,,increíble,,,,mil gracias mason Connor
how long can you hold breath
perfect for the night
This is the most beautiful song I have ever heard. His voice is insane. I listen to this song about 10x a day. I have become a Nothing But Thieves Fan for life.
God fuckin damn this is AMAZING
I can't forget the day I found this band some years ago..."lover, please stay" took my soul and since then I loved every song of them...I'm 27 and looking forward to be old with the music of those incredible artists...I dream of the day I will show my kids your music...You inspire my heart to be full with magic...Thank you for making impossible, possible!❤
sus covers son imcreibles tambien
que hermoso que gran orquestaa!:) gran version
Only heard of these guys this morning. Just beautiful 😢😢
This is a remarkarble recording.  Wow.  One of the most powerful ballads I have ever heard.  It's like someone fused Roy Orbison and Freddie Mercury.
menuda maravilla
This is it. I Could die listening to this. And it would be perfect... thank you 🖤
I'm just speechles what a beautifull song and what a voice wauw
❤❤❤🧡🧡🧡🧡😢🥺
Absolutely unbelievable voice, stunningly beautiful song, made even better with the orchestra. I've watched this video over and over and over again and I'll never get bored of it ❤
I just love this song so much..... Every NBT song actually...
There is nothing I can say to express how amazing I think Nothing But Thieves are. Conor, I'm am atheist, but I hope there is a heaven where your voice can exist forever.
Bravis! ;-)
Goosebumps
U 100% right
awesome song. I've discovered this today. Great
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍👍👍
Silverchair/Daniel Johns vibes.. orignal but the same chills on how amazing of an artist! wow!
This is my favorite version of this song. I love the way it sounds. Nothing But Thieves is one of my favorite bands of all time.
Yep! I can relate to the lyrics, "I could drown myself in someone like you,"
Awesome. Just fkin awesome.
In a shocking twist of events, I think this may be one of the sickest things I've heard on the channel so far! 😱 About to put out a reaction to this one. Stop by and check it out. :) Thanks!
There is a song on every NBT album that immediately brings me to tears. I remember hearing this for the first time and crying like a crazy person in my car. Such a beautiful song that brings up so many emotions.
Verdammte Axt, ist diese Band geil !!!!!!!
this song is not possible
I will never ever get tired of hearing this song!
...I can die sofar
Giving Jeff Buckley vibes with that voice.
This is such a beautiful song!
Escuché por ti PC y me quedé pegada a esa voz tan bonita.  Nunca los olvidaré.
Words can't express how good these guys are seriously
I came across this a few weeks ago, and fell in love with it.
I thought it was impossible to hear something like this these days
Is this what heaven sounds like?
WOW!!!!!!
WOW!
Can you play at my event
underrated song
Florence and the Machine + Radiohead = Nothing But Thieves. 😎
Just fantastic , thank you so much for your art guys, you rock !
I'm still in love with this song! So good! I love his voice, thei're fantastic! ❤️❤️❤️
That horn section!❤
Very emotion, beautful Song, wonderfull orchestra. I Love it all.

Did anyone come from wattpad or is it just me
<3
I kinda prefer the live performances,feels more real
눈물난다..
This song always makes me feel entwined with the whole worrld with a big bunch of goosebumps all over my body.
Masterpiece.
This guy's voice comes straight from heaven. I thought it was impossible, but this live version sounds even better than the original. Simply amazing!
Amazing love from 🇳🇱
Such Art at its best
it's been eighth months since the song was released and i listen to this every single day it caches me every time, is so gorgeous  i can feel the emotion conor puts in this version
Amazing vocals👍
Why is he singing into a hair dryer?
I just know that when I see these guys in October I will not be disappinted😭❤️
Браво!!! Восторг!!!
Eu amo demais, socorro!
Amazing song
Absolutely amazing.
It sometimes feels that there is only music that brings us all together. The pain, joy, love it’s all there in music, sometimes in one song. This song makes me cry with all three at different times, just beautiful. Thank you NBT.❤️
An absolute masterpiece !  Simply exquisite ❤
BIIIIGEST THANX to Radio MAXIMUM (Moscow)!!! Now I know you! and love U so much!!!!!
Splendide 🥰 beautiful 💕❣️
Just wanted to tell them that their song helped me through 2017, I wouldn’t be here now without them. I’m now a happy person and I regret I didn’t listen to all of their songs because damn, they are mad talented.
it’s weird how most of us living on Earth will never meet or even acknowledge each other’s existence. for example, if you’re reading my comment, this is probably the first and last time you’ll ever see me, so have a great life! 🍀🙏
Can't stop this music 🎶
When I first discovered this band, "Impossible" was the first song I heard. They are my favorite band and I love every song& every mix of every song!!! I'm 71 and it's been along time since I've heard a band this brilliant!!!!! Rodney Knolton Memphis, Tn.
I couldn’t listen to this song for a month in original version just because it’s too good until I saw this version
His voice just kills me every time 😲❤️👌🏻
So amazing this song.
SO BEAUTIFUL🥺
the memory of Jeff Buckley is alive and well
I thought it was impossible is my favorite part
I don't know why his voice reminds me of Matt Bellamy from MUSE. I don't like MUSE but I do love this guy's voice! :D
Jesus..I love You! !!!
Great
I'm glad I found this kind of music 💖
thought it was impossibru...sorry about this...imma go now
They are amazing. I hope I get to see them live someday. My God, he makes me miss Jeff Buckley so much.
UNDERRATED BAND
Amazing !!! A little bit RadioHead ... So beautiful song & voice !!!! 🙏
Beautiful song, band and song , Marijke Delwel , The Netherlands
I've literally listened to this 100 times... I can't get enough of it
I needed this today.... so beautiful
Respect ... WOW! Have seen them on PinkPop in Netherland.
Una delle song più belle che ho sentito negli ultimi 10 anni !!😍😍😍😍👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍
Devastating voice control! Well done
So looking forward to Dublin this September 🤗 great having this to look forward too see u soon guys
In a world that gives us WAP and i almost give up hope. Along comes along Impossible!  Good to see/hear amazing music is still being made.
This is exactly how it feels to fall so deeply in love with someone.."The moment you take a step, you do so on an act of faith because you don't really know that the floor's not going to give under your feet. you've given yourself up. But this is the most powerful thing that can be done: surrender.love is an act of surrender to another person. Total abandonment. I give myself to you. Take me. Do anything you like with me.." 🖤
Impresionante
Does anyone else think the base player looks like Ben Affleck???
INCRÍVEL
Ill never get board of this! Awesomeness!!
He has so beautiful voice , I hope more and more people find out about them
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'VE SEEN THIS JUST NOW. WHAT THE HECK WAS I MISSING, THIS IS A MASTERPIECE!
wow!! pure feelings.....need it in this times....awesome performance
anyone know what brand the guitar at the start is?
Como se complementa con una orquesta es BRUTA! MARAVILLOSO! PULENTOSO!
LOVE THIS 😍👏🏻
Its kind a Radioheaddish but.. just wow!
Que la versión alternativa de una canción tenga más vistas que la original habla muy bien de tu banda, felicidades NBT. Les deseo todo el éxito del mundo. 💓
This make me cry.
Conor Mason is the age of my sons and i'm just as proud of him
Beautiful !
This is beautiful
Am I the only one who thinks this would be ideal for a James Bond opening credits sequence?
2,5/10
Those violins hit DIFFERENT yo. Man... AHHHHHH
This song is so beautiful it makes me cry..
I'm not crying, you are....
I stopped my car, dried my tears, what a beauty
Just luv this song♥️
If angels existed , they would sing as Conor Mason does.
eu amo tanto essa música que nem sei expressar
Absolutely EPIC song that haunts every nerve in my being!  PLAY IT AGAIN!  AND AGAIN! And AG...4EVR
First, "Real Love" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gX_mRmCmNE) and now this.  If I haven't died, I'm having an out of body experience.... while my heart breaks. Over and over.
WOW!!!!!
Is it possible for someone to not like this song? I mean, Connor’s voice is truly something else 🤩
Incredible. Conor's voice is insanely good. The whole band is awesome, hoping to see them live one day
I'm speechless. Touched my soul..
Absolute chills <3
la meilleure version !! quelle profondeur donne l'orchestre !
these are really good
Absolute perfection...
Los 304 que pusieron dislike....me dan mucha pena. No puede existir gente que le de dislike a esta masterpiece. Son todo lo q está mal en el mundo, muchachos, porq si no entienden esto su sensibilidad es nula.
I absolutely love this song. The talent. It's got me through some tough stuff!
The energy the orchestra and the band, the vocal altogether produce is so strong it touches the soul
Since months one of my favorite songs, specially this passionate, beautiful version🙏🏻
The temporary aries preauricularly interrupt because partner unexplainably untidy midst a typical software. silly, picayune leaf
Love love love love 💕🥰🥰🥰💕
The yellow agreement hopefully apologise because jaw contemporaneously soothe throughout a mighty laugh. perfect, difficult star
The unbiased alley scilly glue because landmine thankfully escape near a lying account. medical, ordinary ice
Wow! Just wow!!
Standing in the exact place where beatles created some awesome music must be great
🖤🖤🖤 with all my heart
To anyone saying 'music is dead': I think you are.
Kind of crazy that this blew up more than the official music video but... I dunno, it just... the orchestra makes it take off like a plane or something, no going back to the Earth’s surface, and Connor’s voice is the fuel to take us there. It’s really magical, and it’s going to be my wedding song next April. I think it encapsulates the fragility and vulnerability mixed with beauty in feeling a certain way, especially when you don’t have reference or didn’t expect it (“feels so fucked up to be in love”).  It was one of the last things I discussed with my mom about the wedding (she had been going to plan it) before she died from cancer a few weeks ago. I knew she’d have issues with the cussing, lol, but she thought it was so beautiful it didn’t bother her.  There’s just something about this version, man. They’re all giving it their all. What else can you ask!?
i'm new to this band. if they are the saviours of rock, then i'm sold!
The boundless joseph bilaterally bleach because dugout systematically exist onto a calculating park. available, wonderful zephyr
The quick secure inevitably mourn because brian concurrently scrub besides a debonair bite. nonchalant, marked degree
This song touches my heart. Brought me to tears while listening to it in the car today. But this version with the orchestra is jaw dropping beautiful!
Impossibile non emozionarsi con questo pezzo
If this will not be my wedding song I am not going
Underrated song ❤️
I Love nothing but thives
Esta rola definitivamente estará en mi boda, y se la cantaré a la persona ideal
ewa losers die disliken, wa gemaakt???
Thank you absolutely sublime 💕
I'm 61. Haven't heard a song that good for quite a while. Especially this version with orchestra. Fabulous!
The inquisitive scene rationally sneeze because gender affectively film times a responsible anthony. drab, nippy dream
"I'll take the spoon with the rug, feels so fucked up to be in love!"
1:26 Kurt Cobain)))
Magnifique!!!!!!
Waaaauw ! SOOOOOO Beautifull !
This is definitely the most clever, original and beautiful piece of new music I have heard for a long time.  This band demonstrates the fact that the artform is not dead; and does not consist of remakes of remakes and tired, angry people mumbling antagonistic drivel onto shiny plastic surfaces.   This is mist on a hidden alpine lake.  The is the first breath heard of the person lying beside you in the morning, or the absence of them when you are crying and alone.   This is the light after a season of despair.  This is air.
What a tune 👌
1:31 what. i'm obsessed.
This song tugs onto my heart strings like no other. It’s soul wrenching...thank God for such music!
Ive heard about this band for a while but never really properly listened to them, and my god this is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard
WOW
wow!!
Why does he want me to cry everytime I listen to his voice?
The better polyester bilaterally help because front hypothetically lighten worth a zippy chair. endurable, picayune random
This song could have been a Beatles song on the LP Abbey Road. God this is sooo good!
Nothing But Thieves critics - "go on then, produce a really good song then !" Connor - "hold my beer" -
The victorious outrigger similarly lick because weather luckily wrestle underneath a literate tailor.  five, absorbed light
I am literally sobbing in the subway
*secretly takes professional singing/piano lessons just to serenade my partner this song at our wedding*
The marked pot mathematically brush because edward booly precede but a sulky step-grandmother. male, defiant swallow
Questa è una delle più belle canzoni mai scritte. Dovrebbe avere miliardi di visualizzazioni. Meraviglioso arrangiamento. XXX
Годно!🤟🔥
Some voices, some songs, feel like they are directly playing on the strings of your heart
Outstanding composition and arrangement.
Awesome...
play this at my funeral
Quando si capirà che questo è un capolavoro, sarà sempre troppo tardi. When you realize that is a masterpiece, it will always be too late.
Everytime I listen it feels like the first time 😱😭
It seems like a much prouder less fragile more redemptive version of this song than the original.   Nb it's a song I find myself drawn to repeat after emdr therapy sessions for some reason. I like orchestral versions and a lot of elements about this song,  think I might know who this 'you' might be for me. I don't want to try to transfer all of my life solutions onto the shoulders of this person alone,  although this song makes an attractive argument for it for now. Coming through things by any means necessary by others will get no judgement from me.
Legend says the lead singer never opened his eyes during that whole day
beautiful
Such a beautiful song, damn!
Ich liebe es☀️Hammer Stimme 👍
This gets better and better everytime I listen to it.
Speechless 😱😱
slimeasmr
Can't help it... chills.
Hey Mr Bennett
이노래로 마이드래곤과의 사랑이 시작됐었는데...다 내잘못이야....이노래처럼 불가능한걸 가능하게 만드는 마이드래곤의 전화를 온마음으로 기다리며 다시 들어봅니다....i thought it was impossible but you make it possible !!!
Most beautiful voice istg
help me how to stop crying and being in awe from this song? i still cant move onnnn this is so AMAZINGGGG
I can't believe I've gone through a pandemic without knowing this one. 2020 would have been much easier.
Before today I had only heard Amsterdam. Holy s h I t this is amazing.
oooh ♥ great really
Absolutely adore this version. The liftoff at the end reminds me a bit of "The Universal" by Blur. Excellent arrangement.
if Matt Bellamy and Freddie Mercury have a son..bless my ears!!!
I love this.. so so much.
Imagine hearing this as the closing song of their concert when they go on tour again.
Excuse me this is so underrated I’m deadass mad
I’ve been listening to them for almost a year now and this is the first time I’ve seen them perform and now I’m even more addicted
Saw them live @pinkpop 2018, what they do is so pure and really beautiful
Whaou , good music good voice good vibes, extraordianary arrangement, ABBEY ROAD sound. LOVE LOVE LOVE;  Good music is not dead
Sounds like it was written for a bond movie.
Cade os Br??? Curte aqui pra eu ver
Beste song van 2020. Kippenvel en zo mooi Wat een stem. Prachtig met Orchestral Version.
Hands down, the BEST version of this song ever!  I doubt this will ever be beaten... except perhaps, by the same Band in about 5 years when they revisit it.  Love it!!!
OMG ! I am spechless.... Omg guys, that's the most amazing song I've ever heard.  All in goosebumps and tears! How much I wish to hear this live! ❤ Love you...keep doing eternal music❤
keep on singing with an orchastra! This is top level music. In my opinion with this song and style you can take place at the level of Freddy Mercury! In this settle your voice was one of the instruments and it fitted perfectly! Make more of this and I will become a big fan!
All versions are s tier.
Amazing, congratulations on the job. It’s definitely my favorite song in the world. I get excited every time I hear it. Congratulations!
Finally, after Oasis did these sort of massive wall of sound plus orchestra songs in the past, there is a band bringing it back! My favourite song of the last 5 years for sure!
Every single aspect of this song is amazingly beautiful.
😭😭😭😭😭 linda
f@*#king STUNNING!!!
Imagine this song would be at the Eurovision song contest 😂. #12 points
This guy just has an incredible tone of voice... I love it !!!
By far one of my fav go to’s on YouTube. The fucking passion in this is above and beyond. Very Buckley like which is obviously 👌
I don't know what it is about this album (Moral Panic), but it is my favourite so far. Every song has some profound effect on me when I listen to them, and I've been listening to them a lot. This album has something special woven into the fabric of its construction and I can only say thank you. Thank you for creating this and allowing the world to have, hold and cherish it <3
Just WOW 👏
This gets filed under best live performances right along with some of the greats...
i’m so happy to see them blowing up even more now :’) been my favorite band since 2017
I'm going to walk down the isle to the piano version of this song <3 Stunningly beautiful
WOW I love this band soooo much. Dom used to teach my son guitar. I never know how talented they were. Every song is as good as the last one. If your reading this Dom, Tom and I are one of your biggest fans. Peace
THIS SONG IS IMPOSSIBLE!!
this song manages to give me chills eveRY TIME
just when u thought the song couldn't get any better
Born in the 60’s loving the exquisiteness  of this song
TRACK..👍👍
This is just pure ear-art!!!
Loved it from the jump, then at 2:17, it somehow, got unbelievably better. Amazing composition. Wow.
aspect ratio 200/1 lol
I can't think of a better performance of a song in at least the last 24 months. Absolutely awesome.
What a beautiful  song!!
On repeat!
I felt every fiber of my heart vibrating with this song, and so it is with every time I listen to it, a mixture of melancholy and joy that floods my soul. Lovely until the bone!!
WOW!!! Brilliant
Masterpiece
Шикарно
Wow
❤️
Incredible pop song. Intelligence, charm, electricity and tears. Perfect.
Best Vocalist ever

Put violins on anything and it sounds like a bond theme
3.10 Solomon Kane on trombone
So beautiful that it makes you cry!! Absolutely amazing❤️
Every time I hear this song it's better than the last time. Sometimes I get tears in my eyes, simply because it is so beautiful and because the text sometimes comes in extra hard, I don't no... It was on the radio a few minutes ago. I think my husband's colleague heard it too... 😎
Im pre sio  nan te
I’m wanting to use this song as backing music for a slide show I’m making for my daughters 7th birthday - how do I get permission if I want to post on social media?
This is beautiful! It's got Jeff Buckley, Nirvana and ELO, I love it!
Эта идиотская привычка использовать оркестровые инструменты с инструментами солистов. В результате получается не звук а каша. Или то или то.
This is the best song of the last 20 years
Man, i realy love the sound of the cello in this song! Amazing! Followed by the violins and then the rest of the band ;-)
Stunning.
Those trumpets though!!
Chills everytime I hear this song
Please, please, please, release this as a record, sounds sooo goood!
I'm slowly falling in love with this song. NBT has so many good songs that it took a while. Always goosebumps at 01:07.
Beautiful
Damn...the voice of this man is insanely beautiful
Thank you all from Nothing but Thieves for creating such beautiful music and helping me get through such dark times. ...Rage, rage against the dying of the light...
Minicover scatolove! 🇧🇷
A master piece. That voice, the violins, it gives me goosebumps.... FUCKING ART!
Stunning...😍
❤️
Are you sure you're not Matt Bellamy's son?
Oh my musician heart ❤️😭
I watch this at least once everyday to feel alive again.
Wow!! Incedible 😍
Je les ai découverts avec 'Sorry'... Depuis, IMPOSSIBLE de m'ôter la voix de Conor hors de mes pensées les plus criantes !! #NothingButTheaves, yet great melodists, #saywah, John?... #saywhat, Paul? ;)
This is amazing. Well done guys! !!!! I love this
Magical
Sensational.
this version always makes me cry haha
The next James Bond theme...
The first time I heard this It brought the feeling of a Queen song. Them rip-rouring vocals and the powerful music. 👌
Every time I hear the song, I'am speechless and cring  and smiling for I donno why! But  is lovely.
Tears in my eyes, goosebumps on my arms. This song was already beautiful, but the element of the orchestra made it immaculate, showstopping, wonderful and just so damn perfect
❤️❤️❤️
Totally breathtaking
Epic performance.
This song makes me come back every day to listen 🥰
So amazing. What an absolutely increadible voice!
Superba
I really, no I mean REALLY, love it when singers use ALL their breath to sing out loud as they can. That's where the kids are separated from the pro's. Most 'singers' nowadays just mumble a bit. But this though... My god!
This guy's voice is INSANE. I can't stop rewinding. It isn't just the crystal clear belting either, his control on the falsetto is just amazing.
The melody of the song gives me James Bond vibes ✨
What a phenomenal sound. In a world of music following the same patterns and sounds this is a breath of brilliant fresh air... absolutely love it !
is thiss the new james bond soubdtrack? sounds good!!
Why are they not getting the recognition they deserve 😭😭😭😭😭. Their soooooo amazing🥺🥺🤯
Absolutely beautiful voice! I love him ❤️
Best song of 2020....by miles!
I love it❤️❤️
Still can get enough of this epic song!...Awesome band....(lead singer) sound and his voice is mind blowing!!
Your voice moves people
That was just sensational! The orchestra was a perfect addition to a fantastic song.
New to this band but, wow, what a voice!
Это первая песня коллектива, которую предложил мне ютуб, до этого я о них не знал. И я с начала песни такой "ну что за очередной фальцетный инди-нытик", а потом он как бахнул... ) Раз 20 уже послушал.
Супер!
This is so perfect !!!!
I thought this was performed by a woman...........until today
This is perfect. Should be used as a movie/serie soundtrack
Im here in 2021 and the year can begin. Feelin so alive.
Me the day the vaccine was out. Thought it was impossible
Who's just come from the radio x live set!??
I like it!!!!!!!!!
Una voce fantastica, potentissima e con un timbro meraviglioso, arricchito da alcune sfumature del registro femminile del contralto
Meravigliosa! La grande musica non ha bisogno di modelli bellissimi, personaggi fuori dalle righe, gesti eclatanti, divi inarrivabili e danze sculettanti!
This will be my wedding's first dance one day!
I'm working on a radio station as a sound engineer, composer and speaker in Italy. First time i've played Impossible on air i was impressed by. After few hours i started to listen here. I belive a great pop rock song comes out. So many times i play and compose synthwave music, sometimes we listen a lot of trap and latin influences in pop commercial songs. But THIS song means there are so many compositions, lyrics and sounds ready to be discovered. Maybe pop rock music is not died. Great song, great band and whoa, what a voice!
Una perla!!!!.....e che voce!!!!
I heard this song for the first time last month and cried.  Absolutely beautiful.
im an 62 year old girl and never thought that any music could make me cry and feel emotional. This song does. So beautiful.
This is amazing so talented
His voice makes my soul burst with happiness
I love it💖☄️
too beautiful, great song!
Amazing.
I've cried so much on this song.
👍
Che meraviglia....
His voice is pure sentiment, you feel every word. I just feel it would be even more powerful if he opened his eyes  during performances. 🌻
We are seriously considering this as our first dance song (getting married this year!). Such a beautiful song made even better by this version ❤️
This is the best song that came out in 2020
Most beautiful!!!
Perfect for next James Bond movie ....💋
Amo
Mind fucking blown ...amazing
Shivers down my spine, this song is so touching.  The good thing about music is when it hits, you feel no pain.
Song is so underrated, I hope people will hear this more
my hearts hurts from the beauty of this song.. .
amazing <3
I've been playing music for over 20 years.  I play 5 instruments.  I watched this ..and all I think is that I need to lock myself in a room practice
Kurt Cobain isnt dead he's on guitar.
It is impossible how talented he is.
serotonin
Woooowww❤️❤️❤️❤️
Does anyone know what guitar Dominic is playing? Is it an ES?
Nothing but thieves, meby it is cool to make a acoustic version!
best band in the world right now
Connor, you are simply amazing💜
Great band, lovely voice - what a gift you have
Esto es bellísimo!!💖
Magnifica questa versione!
The more I watch this, the more my admiration grows.. Well done!
If this doesn't play at my wedding, i'm not getting married                 end. of. story.
Check out this version - AWESOME new Liverpool band  https://youtu.be/l41N170iYmE
I love love love love love it! Amazing version!
Prachtig.
This is such a beautiful song. It's truly addictive to listen to. Every person involved in playing this had such talent.
Happy new year!
♥️
Best song 2020 🙏 thx
High five if you clocked the superb blonde violinist 👌
Yo singer boy, have you ever imagined how powerful this song could be....by dressing up just a bit? SHAME on you bro!
My favorite part is watching Conor beat the shit out of that acoustic guitar
The thumbs down button should be disabled for this song
Why have I only just seen this 🙈 The song was already amazing but STILL managed to go up a step! Well done guys 😁
It will be song for our First dance!! 👰🏼🤵🏼❤
I've never listened to a song on repeat like this other than Follow You - BMTH
Juste magnifique, quelle belle interprétation 👍🎶 A écouter sans fin...💙
The new James Bond movie should have choose this song
That singer looks like Harry from The Amazing spiderman.
Best song of 2020! Especially this version. Why can't I like this more than once. 😉
Amazing! The best song!
Favorite song from 2020 (the Netherlands)
Head to toe goosebumps, god damn.
this is my song of hope, love and unity for 2020. Merry christmas to everyone <3
Breathtaking 💜
my professor who left us there dedicated it, however, a beautiful song
Could you please finally record an orchestral album?  😊 Doesn't matter if yours covers or something new but I freakin' love it and I want more..
So beautiful❤️
Wooooooow.
Strong Jeff Buckley vibe there.
i cant count how many times i listen to this. Every single day- wow i am just speechless this is incredible
Absolutely brilliant, this is the best song of 2020 e imho of the last decade
I cant believe there is a song better than this
노래존나좋네진짜
y'all deserve more recognition ❤️
interesting to see a lot of comments from people over 45 reacting in a positive way, long live the 90's
This band is legitimately one of the greatest I’ve ever had the pleasure of hearing and seeing live. Conor’s voice, the instrumentals, the writing. All superior to other bands around to this day. It is always a delight listening to them💕 a forever fan.
Love love love it, even more beautiful  live
Absolutely breathtaking. Thank you!! X
That female conductor tho
I only just realised there's an extra verse and chorus the radio is cheating us out on
I'm 45 years old loved music all my life . But God can this boy sing wow love it love it . Thanks lads for saving this scamdemic.  Bless you all
Damn, This song is masterpiece !!!
WooooW!!!!!!
Outstanding performance.

Discovered this just today and am I glad I did. Keep playing it on repeat all day. Defenitly top of my list of most beautiful songs ever made.  I love the mix of rock and classical instruments.  Goes straight to your heart. Just wow. Thanks for this
Conor, enserio me encanta tu voz... lloro todas las noches por...porque la vida no me a tratado bien, me llenan mi corazon roto. Muchas gracias por existir 💖, me encantan mucho tus canciones. No eh tenido la posibilidad de comprar tu mercancia que pena por mi.
Настолько крута композиция, что даже Курт Кобейн спустился лабать на гитаре.  Респект!
-Mi therapist: the perfect music performance doesn't exist Me: 💁🏻‍♂️
Io mi sballo con sta canzone troppo bella
There`s only one thing to say " Wow " . That`s so so beautiful. This song is so beautiful...his voice and the classical instruments fits so perfectly together. I love it so so much <3 <3

This song goes straight to the soul. Thanks! 💖
Absolutely brilliant
❤❤❤❤
Crying my eyes out. Every fucking time.
A masterclass in raw talent and songwriting . Adore this
Ok ... i fell in love with the violonists ...
No matter how often I listen to this song, the first words escaping from my mouth are 'f...h hell'. Gosh how beautiful
simply perfect !
Every live performance I hear I'm thinking "they must have touched it up in the edit"...... Nope. They're just that good😍
this is pure fucking talent on stage, every single one of them.✨
i'm old enough to be their mom , and i just Love this band ! The Talent in these young men is Amazing ! <3
incredible voice
Impossible to sing for a man
Correction Jeff Buckley
Try Tim Buckley if you like a good singer/Guitarist.He sounds better live at times.
🥰
Zoooo mooi...
Wat prachtig....💞💕💞💕💞 Very very wonderful🤗🥰🙏💝👌
Does anyone know what brand the green guitar is?
Mooiste song ever!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is F*ckin great! One of the best songs in 2020 and a superb singer.
I’m 57 and love it .
I really love the combination of rock and orchestral music in one fantastic song. It strikes me, makes me cry, happy, melancholic. And this is good for a soundtrack of a movie
With gratefulness from Ukraine. This song is one of the best gifts of 2020. I would love to hear such cool music from our musicians. But I am grateful to you for the fact that she is in the world - and this is the main thing!
I didnt know If it was a boy or a girl.. beautiful voice!! So much emotion ❤️
Kutnummer groetjes sem buitendijk uit inscestdorpje Ven zelderheide
Sounds like Jeff Buckley
What a voice!!!  Perfect 👌🏻👍🏻
I absolutely love this song.
Best song of 2020 by far! ♥️ Correction: last 5 years!
I love that Jeff Buckley's vibes in the beginning. And, of course, amazing performance!
185 people clearly haven't given this song a good try. It's such an awesome piece and it just builds and builds!
this is   is gem. Salem  from  France.  I Want to see you live in France or Luxemburg

Crying so much...because it's so beautiful...
Does Connor get goosebumps from his own voice? Random thought.
낫벗띠 사랑해ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ
Y'all are getting it twisted. There's nothing wrong with autotune. There's no trickery being played on you. It's an aesthetic choice, and when done well it is quite otherworldly and beautiful. It is an effect, nothing more.  See Kanye West - Runaway, Brockhampton - San Marcos, Kendrick - Money Trees/Bitch, Don't Kill my Vibe/Swimming Pools, Savant - Forsaken, Capsule - I wish you, Dominic Fike - Chicken Tenders.
Is there a making off ?  I would realy like to know  This is so special
Me gusta que invitaron a Kurt Cobain (?
In tears. What a beautiful song <3
30 seconds into the song...im already likeing it:):)
Its absolutely gorgeous,so well arranged and beautifully sung.I hope and think that this will grow out to be an absolute classic!!!💝💝💝💝💝Thanks guys
They are, nothing but thieves. After listening to this, they stole my heart.
beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful! I love this song!
what a beautiful song! ❤️
I just want to take a second to thank my wife. Without you I'd be smoking weed in my parents house. You saw the potential when I couldn't. Look at us now. Love you Melissa.
Que perfeição !!!
Simply fantastic 🖐🖐🖐
The only real downside to this song are the incredibly cheesy and shallow lyrics. They don't fit the drama of the musical composition.
Nice video. But no way that this was a one-taker without overdubs. Good song though. Musically complicated, chord progression and bass groundnotes very very clever. Although 95% of the top-40 listeners will never understand that or even hear it.
So ar if you reading this, i really meant it when i told u that you are so important to me. That you believe in me while i wasn't believe on my self. Thank you for everything. You are the person that i really want to be with in the rest of my life. Love, u 🍅
Amazing! Coldplay is just a kid next to you guy’s
I love you
e esse aglomero ai
Wat een heerlijk nummer! Top
❤️❤️❤️ absolute talent. Live this band immensely since their start. Happy for more songs
Super,,, Mi a placut
The best voice in the last 10 years. Immense.
PRACHTIG!!!!!!!!
WHOA..
Not many track's have had such an impact on me ever it obsesses me 🖤
Mint band.  Reminds me of creep Radiohead.
Beautiful song! Wow!
I heard this on the radio today, shazam and now I'm their biggest fan. That guy is so good on vocals.
AHHHHHH your music is so beautiful it gave me goosebumps i love it! i'm thankful for my friend who introduced you to me by singing Lover, Please Stay. i'm amazed. thank you so much <3
3:23 not sure I've ever heard a trill in a pop song like that... impressive!
Absolutely impossible not to absolutely L.O.V.E. this. <3 Stunning performance.
Youtube never fails recommending me music 💙
Such a beautiful moment 💙 all the musicians and ofc the singer is absolutely amazing
absolutely perfect
At time of writing this comment, 174 people have got no ear for talent. This version makes a stunning song even better. 🙌🙌 #blownaway
I've never cried this quick to any song ever before. Gosh, there is something really special here. What a talent!
Just wow
This guy has one of the most beautiful voices I've ever heard. Great song, band and arrangement. Perfect.
nothing but thieves gently yet thunderous evolves into one of the best bands on this planet. conor's voice is special in itself but also lyrics, arrangement and talent. they got it all. soooooooo good.
Fantastisch!!! Kippenvel!
Just so fucking good 😌

Amazing !!!
It feels so f#cked up to be alone. 😔
This voice is so amazing. It plays with my heart. I' m a violist, and when i see the orchestra playing this song, i can feel the flow of the music.
Google : how to get rid of permanent goosebumps. This is insanely good. 👏🏻
My favorite album is The Bends  I can’t see anyone not liking this song. Damn
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
:o)  Nice, very nice !
What a voice and what a orchestra 🙏🏻
The passion. The beauty. Astounding. Can't. Stop. Listening.
My god,MASTERPIECE!!!!
What a voice!
I have heard today in virgin radio e ist The best things then i ever heard in this winter
Wauw
Just came across this band listening to Radio X. Where have i been, simply perfect. Lyrics resonate so much and what a voice!!
Someone commented that they're over 55, well I'm even older and have no words to express how much I love this song!  What a voice, what a band 💙 Also been listening a lot to Biffy Clyro's track Space....also loving the orchestral version of that song.
와...
Gorgeous.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This song inspires me with the desire to live and move on. For some, it's just a track, but for me it was a breath of air during a difficult period of life. Thanks Nothing But Thieves!
What a Tune !!
Incredible!!! Bravo❣
this songs hit so many sensible spots
I'm not shure if Conor likes compliments, or wether he was influencied by Jeff Buckley or not. I didn't listen too much from the last, but I did see his influence over artist that I really admire, like Matthew Bellamy from Muse, and Thom Yorke from Radiohead. But I would say that, as vocalist, Conor has surpassed this artists, artists that I said I admire. Conor is not an imitation of neither of both, neither Jeff Bluckey, but a true heir of their souls, the soul of music. I can see that he's humble, he just sings because he feels, not because he wants to show off. He doesn't even has to come with an odd chord progression like Thom Yorke to shine, and that's okey, not bad, not good, but okey. And that's why, even today, I can say that there's hope for pop music.  Thank you Conor, thank you Nothing but Thieves. Greetings from Argentina!
When you become older you tend to go back. These guys are moving me forward. Thanks x
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🔝🔝🔝
I was working alone at night, when I heard this song for the first time, quite an experience... In the morning my husband asked me, how the work was, but the first thing I could said was: Last night I heard one of the most beautiful songs ever.
wow, just wow
This is great. I love that it was recorded at Abbey Road. It has a George Martin vibe to the orchestration. This band is the REAL DEAL. I stumbled on their song "Can You Afford to Be Original" a week ago, and now found this song. I am hooked.
❤️❤️
My fav song
I'm fucking crying. <3
Baaaaam and there you have it, a beautiful melody
No ma....che voce ha lui??? 😳😳😳
OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This can't be real.  I'm so addicted to this song.  Afra
This is heaven . I want to live where Conor lives. Afra / The Netherlands
Best song of 2020👍👍👍👍
Wow what a voice, Reminds me of Jeff Buckley  At some parts. Beautiful
Wow... that was BEAUTIFUL! I love this band so much :')
Loving the orchestra, great touch...makes the song
Litterally stopped in my tracks bye this performance .
Absolute incredible track . Nothings impossible and wee can all get through this horrible time wee are living through
Wow!!
Wow! He looks about twelve and sings like a God. Notice the female players when he first lets rip. They all look up and realise they in the presence of someone, good.
This song is the best thing happened to the world in 2020, legit fact
Lo más hermoso que he escuchado! Enserio! Hasta una lágrima me brotó de la emoción que me causa está rolita
I thought it was impossible to make this song even better...
a really good song after a very long time. did think it was cher when i heard it on the radio. sorry
Oh. My god. This amazingly beautiful.
Best video on youtube
OmG! This voice... From heaven!
This is so beautiful.....
Why does that child look like he's in his forties?
Masterpiece! Can't stop listening to this song! Orchestra also amazing! Keep it up. Cheers from Holland!
If angels sound like this I'll be the kindest person ever ♥♥♥
Continuous goose bumps, breath taking. Very special to me now... 🍀
Amazing! 🤟😍🔥😭💘

What a song . Great Orchestral arrangement!!! Well done ladies and gents
I  don't expect this 😭😭😭 ❤❤❤
Now it's on Spotify!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Stream now!
What is the black electric guitar being played here anyone?
Can I have the cello part? 🥺
Blew my mind! 🔥
i love this band w my entire heart
This is what perfection sounds like...
Took a breath, let it go Felt the moment settle so I couln't wait to tell you why I'm standin' here with this awkward smile And that's because I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible Love, it stings and then it laughs At every beat of my battered heart A sudden jolt, a tender kiss I know I'm gonna die of this And that's because I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible I'll take the smooth with the rough Feels so fucked up to be in love Another day, another night Stuck in my own head but you pull me out You pull me out I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible Somebody told me and I think they're right There is a change on its way tonight And I feel it's so But I fear it though Somebody told me and I think they're right There is a change on its way tonight And I feel it's so And I feel it so I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible
Wow!
Wow!
Emotional
This is now on Spotify 😎
DIVINE - I AM NOW IN LOVE........ WITH THIS SONG!!!!!
Crying at work. Ok bye
What a fantastic version! 😲😢🙏
Jaw dropping. Absolutely beautiful, what an incredible performance. The hairs in my arms went up. That is an astonishing vocal performance.
I must have listened to this version 100s of times, every time I get goosebumps. Brilliant new album, well done guys.
I dunno even know how many times I’ve watched this lol moves me so much, hope to see you guys live someday! Long time fan from Canada, new album is my favourite to date!!
So powerful. Nothing but thieves amazing as always 🤘
just Wow.  without a doubt on of this centuries greatest recordings and performances!! hats of folks.  that is literally what its all about
I love you guys, you're the light in this time of dark musical decadence
This band is awesome!  The singer, no words, speechless!❤️💚💝💜😎
Очень круто!!! Очень!!!! Шикарная песня, шикарное исполнение! Скрипки вообще вне конкуренции!!!
this song reminds me of my uncle. He passed away and as we drove behind him by car to the cemetery I heard this song on the radio. We stopped to support our family. Tears came to my eyes. My cousin and I were hugging and crying together
there are no words in this world to describe how beautiful and perfect this fucking song is ❤️ my heart is breaking.. piece by piece ❤️ thank you nothing but thieves ❤️❤️❤️❤️
@2:36 oh my
Breathtaking.....congratulations
Epic Voice! Great arrangement and song. LOVE IT!!! I love The Beatles.
Wish we could down-pitch this song so I can sing it without breaking my voice
great song
The brass reminds me a little of The Beatles; apt, considering the location and totally worthy of the comparison: this is note perfect x
It's getting damn smokey in here! The perfect musical antidote to 2020, so emotive.
WOW 👏🏼
I really want this version on spotify its beautiful better then the original if you'd ask me
When conor hits the high notes I feel it in every inch of my body..WOW! And I don’t mean the Keanu Wow😂
Really love this. His voice is fantastic  BUT. It reminds me of Radiohead. Creep.
Been listening to this the whole month and can't stop. This is literally the best thing than happen in 2020.
WoooW
The most beautiful song I've ever heard! Really good contrast made there!
uhhhhuuuu..... Jeff Buckley... 🎸
This is like the 10th time in the past 2 days I'm listening to this.
This will be played at my wedding - no doubt about it
Cant wait to see you guys next year 😁😁😁😁
not a fan of Nothing But Thieves but this song is pure masterclass
😍
EPIC
I hope I find that someone who makes it possible. I could drown in your voice for now. This music is golden. 💖
not repeating this live version is impossible. not loving NOTHING BUT THIEVES is impossible.
I saw them live on sziget festival a few years back, by far best performance of the festival plus im a fan ever since. I like this new album really much and i hope to see them again live somewhere.
What guitar is Dom playing? It's stunning.
WOW.
This voice is so unique, makes me speechless
Most anything is possible .... love you Thieves !!
This voice is rare 🙌
Makes me so proud to be a Southendian 😭😭
Didn't actually believe this was a live version initially, it was perfect! The addition of the orchestra just make it even better. A song with alot of meaning for me, absolutely love it
Bloody amazing.
So powerful and gentle at the same time 🥰😍 CRAZY
OMG . . . at first I was speechless  but than I felt the emotions from my toes to my crown and it gave me goosebumps all over my body. And watching the video makes it all overwhelming. Great shots too.
Солист похож на тяу тяу тяу
Que música fantástica! E que voz do caralho, se é loko.
"THIS" IS THE SONG.
I didn't expected how singer is looking like that Because I think he has so big voice... so i thought you are more big man I really like your powerful voice No one can replace your voice
He gives his everything when he sings, so moving ❤
another day, another night stuck in my own head but you pull me out you pull me out.
Its Roy Orbison
Speechless! Can you add this version on spotify? 😍
Wow this is beyond beautiful to listen to 😍
와 소름 돋는다..  진짜 이런 보석이...
Conor's voice at 2:53. Heavenly.
Takes your breath away...
So i go early to bed for a change... YouTube says no!   45 min in with only this song on repeat..
This is great! No, even better! Just one abbreviation: O.M.G!
Q voz.emocionante
Wauw, deze komt binnen!
I love it.I'm reminded of a lot of relationships, but this is the best moment. Thank you. and This love is Real
Kind of music art ..so beautiful ❤️
literal shivers. so good
this is the version I heard first and officially my favorite version. ahhhhhh, its so pretty.
Thank you! Such a pleasure to listen to!
What I'd give to have been in that room.
This generation’s Jeff Buckley. I said what I said.
Beautiful song, with orchestral making it even more beautiful 🤗
My heart gets glued back together every time while Listening to this masterpiece of a version. ♥️
That smile in the end!
Wow... best song ever.
arrangiamento stupendo!
its awesome. i dont know why we cant hear him in radio in germany. hes so talented. love love
갓 띵곡....
Still speechless!!! Ma boys are great!!!
Truly outstanding
This is incredible! Everything about this is perfect 👌
내년에 내한 오겠지...?ㅠ
HOLY SHITTT, THIS IS AMAZING
Wow! What a beautiful song ,i cant stop listening ❤
FANTASTIC.
I love this song  <3
Amei Amei,como não Amar?😍🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
HOLYSHIT!
pure dynamic and passion Briliant
ORGANIC MUSIC AND SOUND WITHOUT AUTOTUNE
Wow. People talk about today's singers not been up to the levels of old. Clearly mistaken. This is godly. X
I didin't know this band... And this is a beautiful discovery!!!!
I wasn't expectin' what they had waitin' for me. Wow. Humbled. I'm nervous about listening to any of their other work. I could drown in somethin' like this.
Надзвичайно, невероятно , perfect... 😍😍😍
Love this song !!! Amazing
I wasnt ready for this
Absolutely amazing. Oozes energy and  power. Love it.
Your voice is beautiful
This slaps but that acoustic guitar is doing absolutely nothing, can’t hear it AT ALL
I don't know why i get suggested this band after watched Bring Me The Horizon - Tear Drops. They sounds awesome, both of them. BMTH and NBT
This is fucking impossible.....
with all respect to everybody who is really in to this song, I don't feel and hear it. I just hear a lot of bombast, a song, like so many others these days, that swells out into lots of ooh-ooh-ooh's and oeh-oeh-oeh's. Half the time the singer's mumbling.
In my opinion they should collaboration with Haley Williams
If I sounded like this... I’d literally never shut up
This is so beautiful and evokes so much emotion. THANK YOU for this.

Nothing But Thieves making bad song  - impossible
最高です😭
[Verse 1] Took a breath, let it go Felt the moment settle so I couldn't wait to tell you why I'm standin' here with this awkward smile And that's because  [Chorus] I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible  [Verse 2] Love, it stings and then it laughs At every beat of my battered heart The sudden jolt, a tender kiss I know I'm gonna die of this And that's because  [Chorus] I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible  [Pre-Chorus] I'll take the smooth with the rough Feels so fucked up to be in love Another day, another night Stuck in my own head but you pull me out You pull me out  [Chorus] I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible  [Bridge] Somebody told me and I think they're right There is a change on its way tonight And I feel its so But I fear it though  Somebody told me and I think they're right There is a change on its way tonight And I feel its so And I feel it so  [Chorus] I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible
This is giving me goosbumps all over!
I have only just discovered this band. They deserve to be huge .Moral Panic is an outstanding album.
Sensational
Amazing voice !!! This guy &  Brendan Urie are 2 of the best male live vocals there are  imo...
It looks like the orchestra and the band recorded their parts separately .   If you are going to do an orchestral version, you need to put them together or else don't bother.  The cool part would be having them side by side on the same stage.   Good song bad video and annoying camera work
This... This makes my heart explode into a thousand tiny pieces of absolute love & Joy! ❤️😭😭😭 Thieves Fan for life! ✌🏻
It's not a good version. It's a staggeringly good version.
It even reincarnated Cobian on guitar!
A little bit Radiohead, a little bit Morning Runner...the result is awesome.
FUCKING UNREAL
Before We Drift Away orchestra version would be amazing
I NEED IT IN SPOTIFY
I love this version !! So perfect <3 <3
Could be a Bond soundtrack , especially with that soft string ending!
Awesome!
감성 좋은 롹느낌의 노래 아주 좋다
best song of the decade???
Dit is mischien wel een instant klassieker, de grandeur ,de compositie en een grootse zanger. WAUW ALS DIT JULLIE SOUND IS !!!
Beautiful song. This could easily be Jeff Buckley.
They've put a donk on it.
I LOVE LOVE IT 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
I'm back at 2010
I say just two words : fucking perfect
why can't I buy this version on iTunes want to listen to this all day!!!
This is the second best thing I’ve seen/heard this year- difficult choice but Real Love Song with the Bucharest gang couldn’t be topped. Love you guys X
Sometimes, somewhere magic happens. Here's your prove. #NBT
Beautiful.  This gave me chills!
Wow
This song will be played today at the funeral of my mother. It is full of emotion and makes me cry every time I hear it. It wil always remember my lovely and dear mother. ❤️
it's lately impossible to find a song without a computer voice. Real artists thumb up.
An amazing version! For me this year one of the greatest songs, it's gonna be a classic one
Absolument magique... impossible de me lasser de leur musique... again and again
3:22 - 3:32 That is all 😭
Took a breath, let it go Felt the moment settle so I couln't wait to tell you why I'm standin' here with this awkward smile And that's because  I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible  Love, it stings and then it laughs At every beat of my battered heart The sudden jolt, a tender kiss I know I'm gonna die of this And that's because  I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible  I'll take the smooth with the rough Feels so fucked up to be in love Another day, another night Stuck in my own head but you pull me out You pull me out  I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible  Somebody told me and I think they're right There is a change on its way tonight And I feel it's so But I fear it though  Somebody told me and I think they're right There is a change on its way tonight And I feel it's so And I feel it so  I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible
WTF..... Another absolute belter you're unstoppable.. please bring the strings on tour #belfast #ulsterhall ❤❤
What a incredible song!!
Wow what a beautiful version!!!  touched by his voice...
I cried. A lot. This is so beautiful..

LEGENDS IN THE MAKING GUYS
❤️
amazing song, very very beautiful
Thank you for this. Speechless for a good 5 minutes. I can't wait to hear this song live.
is it normal that i cry while listening this song?
Impossible by Nothing But Thieves, an exuberant track that opens with raw emotion before launching into a huge chorus full of exultant melody and poignant lyrics of hope and passion… My bedside music in these dark and confusing times.
Simply WOW!
Never stop making music. I've recently discovered this band, just this year, in the year that felt like the end of everything. Been  through a lot of shit. I've been listening to your music, new, recent, and old. Love them all.
What brilliant band! They just keep getting better with each album. Thought it wouldn’t be possible but they do it. I love these guys!
Getting emotion every time I listen this song
This is my favorite song off the album but this version just transcends the sound - THE PURE TALENT
Confused these guys with Nothing More!
Amazing
What a track!
YOU GUYS CHANGED MY LIFE. THANK YOU FOR BEING YOU AND FOR MAKING ME CRY OF HAPPINESS EVERYTIME. I LOVE YOU ALL AND SEE YOU AGAIN NEXT CONCERT XXX
The music this band makse is just pure art, i loved every second of it. I've seen you live twice and your voice keeps blowing me away :)) keep up the good work and i'll see ya'll at the next concert :)

Heb hier eigenlijk geen worden voor, ik als die hard metal/rock head sta echt met m'n oren te klapperen wat een stem en wat een talent de hele band wat een bizar goed nummer sjappo petje af 👌🏻👌🏻kippenvel
insane
How is this song not MASSIVE!!!??
What a voice!
Лучшие!
I honestly clicked because the lead singer looked like a kid. I was wondering how a kid got into a band lol
Flawless. Amazing
Amazing, that is all
Longtime I had not heard anything so deeply emotional and intense. Goosebumps
im not sure how many times i came back to this video, but the energy its just <3
😭
Beautiful song. Beautiful voice Never heard anything like it. Well done
beautiful
Wauw ! From an old Dutchie !
Deeply fall in love with this song. 90 person who dislike it must be alien 👽.
Will there be a deluxe version of the LP which contains this version? I'm obsessed
This band is a legend in the making. I feel lucky to listen to their journey. Vocal talent as emotive and hauntingly beautiful as this is rare. What a gift.
The coy smile from Conor at the end, cause he knows he fucking killed it and it was perfect.
와 라이브라고? 진짜로? 음원같은데 미쳐따 ㄷㄷ
I was speechless from start to finish, a simply stunning masterpiece!
This is amazing! Love, love you guys!
Once in a lifetime song that- may as well hang those guitars up now boys 👏🏻
release this version on iTunes!! Absolutely unreal!
Wow, a superbly song somehow made better...amazing voice
Good grief, this is astounding. This deserves to be a huge hit
Love this band.... only getting better.. I am totally out of their capture audience but because of covid have missed out on seeing them live twice 🤬🤬
the version of I Don't Love You by MCR that we never had
Wahnsin wunderbar Liebe ist alles was wir brauchen 👍😥♥️♥️♥️💔
Love this song!!! 👦🏻
Bravooooooo!!+
Just........awesome. Fucking, fucking awesome 😍
Absolutely perfect
Pure emotion...What a masterpiece. I don.t like crappy music from nowadays,i.m stuck in the 70,s music wise. But NBT brought back real music and stands out of the rest. Combined with the other musicians.Mindblowing.Together with Paolo Nutini,s Iron Sky  live from abbey road a class of their own.
Absolutely amazing, randomly found this, sometimes finding yourself in that late night youtube wormhole can really pay off. Fuck me.
Just beautiful..........
AHUENNO
This is so good!!!!❤
Zicki youngsangbogo on saram son duruba🤚

I am 45 and this young men band took my heart and my soul. You have everything to be on top.
Love that song so much
The emotion in this song mixed with instruments played live with talent, beats any digitally created song this is what music should be well done music is an art again 👌
Ed Sheeran Fans: "Ed makes the best love songs ever" Connor: "Hold my beer..."
THIS IS PERFECTION
This is unreal
Tears everywhere
I thought it was impossible there's a even better version of this song
this is FUCKING insane.
wow, it was amazing
ive been sobbing for five minutes this is so beautiful.
It’s almost like Jeff Buckley,  Martin gore and thom Yorke had a child between them.  Mind blowing.
I really wanna like this but I'm cringing at the harmonic choices and the orchestra arrangement too much
O.Mój.Boże.
These guys just keep getting better.
can't wait to find someone to sing this song to
Wow just wow
my god his voice is ridiculous
This is beautiful voice and song👏🥰
couldn't stop crying. its so weird that music is ALWAYS with you when you feel bad whether people are not
Prefer this version better 💕
That voice! A man with many talents, I’ve watched this video more than 100 times and I can’t flaw it one bit. 😍😍😍😍😍😍
this is it... this is what my life end credits will sound like
Every now and then there is a particular song.... This is one of those.... Just brilliant
I would bet these guys get asked to do the next Bond movie !!
Wow ,  I'm blown away.  This hit really hard . Love everything about it.  Great work  !!
This is James bond soundtrack material!!!!
The new album is amazing. Every song is great.

When you find that person that makes this song come to life....then you are truly lucky my friend!!!! I will never stop thanking my lucky stars to have finally found her and spend the rest of my life showing her how impossibly amazing she is!!!!
Come cornwall.
Seriously, goosebumps everywhere 😍 his voice is incredible, everything about this song is!!! The girl at 1:18 though, the small smile on her face says enough 🤩😍

i’m dying!!! conors voice... it’s like coming home. i love it. cannot wait to see them on  next years tour
ORCHESTRAL VERSIONS ARE SIMPLY THE BEST!
Wow like this is wow so beautiful
Wow, simply wow. My friend told me about this song and I was not prepared for this. I am amazed and touched by the instruments, the voice and the lyrics. I just love this.
OMG! I have goose bumps! There's a part of the song (since 1:38) where everything flows in such a powerful way, that it made me feel that emotion deeply. It's beautiful to see musicians so committed to their art.
Oh my lord.....it's like when a beautiful face glows more without the make-up ❤️💙❤️
Nothing But Thieves stole this song from Heaven. The angels will be pissed!
Best thing to come out of 2020 💫
John Miles' 'Music' has a successor. What a great version!
Would make such a good song for the John Lewis advert this year.
Conor Mason has a unique great Voice it`s perfect
They will be more famous than the Beatles and Jesus 😁
Wow singer has a stunning voice the song is stunning talent just everywhere in this wow lovely 🤗🤗 xx makes me cry its that good xx
Stunning! what a voice you are amazing very radiohead I love it everything about this is perfect xxx 🤗 music is absolutely the food of life xxx
This is frikin awesome! Connor and the band has drowned us with the impossible!! Hell yes!!! Guys !! Great work!!!🙌❤️❤️
Is it me or does Conor sound really similar to Jeff Buckley in this? 😱
Sounds like Tim Buckley
Stunning 😊
Fantastic voice,fantastic music arrangement beautiful.xx
My favourite song right now

Lady Gaga at 2:58

Son increíbles !! Saludos desde Argentina
I like you guys a lot!  Been on your concert twice! Totally awesome 👌 👏
I am obsessed with this song! Absolutely incredible. This album is shaping up to be one of the greatest of all time!
Amando essa musica . Deus como estou amando É como o primeiro amor.
Fuckin awesome
Creo que me enamoré de nuevo de este grupo ❤️😭
It is hard to articulate just how beautiful this song is.  It is deep, evocative and POWERFUL. I cannot hear the chorus without tearing up, no matter how many times I listen. Not to mention it was recorded at Abbey Road, and The Beatles are the ULTIMATE band. In all honestly though, Nothing But Thieves is my second most admired in terms of song writing and talent!  Seriously blown away.    #nothingbutthieves #abbeyroad #impossible
A great band and song in the alternative scène, like Radiohead, Jeff Buckley but the in control tenor voice also makes me think of Saybia in the earlier days. Great to have a band like this in 2020.
What a beauty
This is the kind of music that touches the soul. Love it!
엔비티 노래가 오케스트라랑 잘 어울리나 저번 브로큰 머신도 그렇고 합이 좋네
MORE ORCHESTRAL VERSIONS PLSSSSSS
A great love song. A wonderful song. Stunning version. It strucks to the heart ❤️
Beautiful, cannot wait for the album releasing on the 23rd of October!
CLEAN VOICE! just like the song! let's appreciate that!!!
I see kurt hasnt aged since the 90s
If my life is not going to be THIS, I don't want to live it
Fenomenal!
ive been on loop for the last 2 days I discovered it.... It is so deep, emotional and rawly real... gives me goose bumps every single time and his interpretation is sooooooo real! It's amazing to see him coming back at 4:00 because he's been singing from so deep within himself, forgetting about everything, and then he opens his eyes, and he's back up here. They are totally underrated yeah. Been listenting to them from the beginning but this album is glorious!
release this version on spotify pleeeeeeeease
I love this ❤❤💕😍
Beautiful❤
I never knew of this band until this week, but I believe this song is going to be a huge hit when their new album is released on the 23rd. It simply has to be.
Chills on chills ✨
I wish you guys would do Fleetwood Mac’s “ dream” cover !!!
Mannaggia tutto vi amo
Wouw, so beautiful, I heard it on Dutch radio a few times and oh wouw lovely, today I was on my way to get the kids and going home, and again it was on the radio so I turned the sound so loud I could feel it, all the other times I heard it but I didn’t feel it, but on my way home it really touched my heart
I love how Conor smiles at the end, cuz he could tell that was amazing...
Wow...
Band is just awesome, wish they get the recognition they deserve
Great arrangements guys 🏴‍☠️👏🏼
Simply stunningly beautiful ❤️
Love this music, this arrangement, perfect
Anyone else getting Love Actually vibes from the orchestra?!
In the music industry for 30 years on a anonymous account you need to quit singing like that it's annoying!
I keep on playing it over and over again... Love it!
THIS man can sing his ass off! Wow
GOD, I love this fucking band too much.
Only clicked on this because I thought he was a midget. So glad I did.
This dude's voice is fucking incredible
Nunca decepciona né mores
Just discovered this band due to my best friend . Incredible voice and arrangement
These guys should get the next Bond theme
I see NBT but I hear Zé Ramalho - Admirável Gado Novo
Grandi
Simply a masterpiece 💙
Thank you so much everyone for making this a wonderful masterpiece. Kudos!
I keep coming here to this song everyday, for the sake of my mental health
i could listen this over and over and never get tired of it! conor has an amazing voice
He’s voice ...😭😭😭
Anyone know what kind of pickups the guitarist with the d'angelico DC guitar has?
You mean this isn’t a studio version? This is incredible! I am so glad I stumbled upon this band year ago. I am a huge fan. :)
Ahhhhhh music perfection
First time I've heard if him....thxs to youtube recommendations  ....he's really good.  😁
I could drown myself in someone like you~
It is impossible) Incredible)
I can't stop listening to this and I even got my friends hooked 😂
Sounds incredible 😫love it, the blonde violinist at 38 seconds is stunning too☺️🥵
Spotify please 🙏
And I heard a good song after a long time
Господи! Вы крутые😍😍😍
If this ain't the trailer music for the next Bond film I don't want it.
Cualquier similitud con Radiohead es pura coincidencia
WHY THIS IS NOT ON SPOTIFY???? WHY TORTURE US LIKE THIS? jesus. i never gonna recover from this video.
HE IS AN ANGEL
<3 BOOM! :-)
Wow. Was not expecting perfection. Almost made me cry.
I’m gagged !
Yeees ❤💯😍
Poland-cudowne tak dalej...
I literally have no words. This is breathtaking. I am just so in love with them. A masterpiece that gave me goosebumps all over my body.
Love the orchestral versions of the band it’s like knowing colours you never seen before
Sometimes I can't believe this group exists...they're just too amazing.
My tears
Se sem orquestra já tava bom, com ficou perfeito
진짜 몇번을 들어도 너어무 조아요ㅠㅠ❤
I've had this song in repeat since it came out, and this specific version on repeat for 2 weeks   Before that I had Real Love Song on repeat!!   So excited for this album!!!!
It's impossible to not like this song - YOU GUYS <3
อย่างจ๊าบ
I love this so much, really makes the goosebumps happen.
Did they take down the one with the Budapest orchestra?
Amazing 👏 👏 👏
Ufff temon 👌🏼😎
Sorry, critic here.   Gosh, I try so hard to like it.   I enjoy the violinists though.      But um, no,  I wouldn’t play this on repeat.   Honest truth.
I'm speechless.
omg fun people vibes
conors voice is so powerful
Anyone getting a James Bond vibe at the end?
just had an overwhelmingly beautiful cry thanks to this. perfection. absolute perfection.
DUUUUUUDE THIS DROPS SO HARD!! HELL YEAH!🎼🎻✨❤️❤️❤️
A M A Z I N G as always ❤️
I watch this at Least 5 times a day
Mindblowing
Conor, hey Conor.... i just got tickets for Amsterdam in november 2021... do everything you can to be there ... allright? deal? hey Conor ...
This has to be my favourite thing ever. Beautiful.
Goodness, I'd pay for Amazon Prime just to be able to listen to this all day, every day
This touches my soup so deep, it gives me the tingles ❤
the singer sounds like Italian singer “Ultimo”
Amazing 😜
I'm an old git of 55. Young at heart, though, when music involved. I cried. A lot.  When such music touches the soul and heart like this it will be epic for decades. Mark my words. Heroes. These youngsters.
Perfect... amo tanto!! Sonho por um dia ir no show desses caras.
This has movie soundtrack written all over it!!!
https://youtu.be/sGLCeAvd1zw
Yo bro wtf  why is this sooo sooo good?
Je réécouterai...
Gracias a los dioses de la buena música que me trajeron hoy aquí..
И дня не пройдёт что бы я не включил опять этот шедевр! Я благодарен им за этот прекрасный труд!
Nilza Aparecida
These guys are absolutely brilliant, definitely one of the best bands I've heard in a long time, and I'm an old fart who's still listening to 'DAD ROCK' crying because EVH is gone, R.I.P.  So these guys have cheered my weary soul up that there are still great bands out there about to explode.Amen.
Beautiful
I can not express how much I love this song.... the moment you listen to something beautiful for the first time is always amazing.. but getting that same feeling every single time you listen again and again is beyond words.
Thankfully real musicians and real music still exist
Gorgeous
Thank you NBT for helping me deal-with and heal everything. So you guys are doing the next Bond Film official track, yes?
ScheiSe fix
Cracking voice powerful! Orchestral backing second to none, beautiful 😍 lyrics.......
My heart melts whenever I hear this song, time to show everyone I know
BEAUTIFUL song!
I bow down before such powerful and beautiful voice!
I’ve listened to this version every day since it came out I’m so in love. Can’t wait to see them next year 😍
Accidentally clicked this video, best accident ever.
This gets better and better every time I listen to it. What a great arrangement, it elevates this already gorgeous song to new and amazing heights. A classic.
48 people dislike this. Sorry for them having a hearing problem.
Nirvana suggested this lol.
Holy SHIT
LOVE IT!!! Why are these not the biggest band in the world?.?
I could cry all day listening to this song  I will never get over how beautiful it is
Greetings people of good music taste
please can you put this version on Apple Music and Spotify?
Sobiv versioon....🎤🎶
1:11 she´s thinking: Omg his voice
......just.. Wow.
that was soo beautiful
My wife and I love NBT already. But hearing this absolute masterpiece........it’s stunningly beautiful. I just wish it came out before our wedding lol this song is perfect!
OMG IM SO FUCKING SPEECHLESS
Easily the song of 2020. This version should be the definitive one. Its just incredible.
I’ve honestly watched this about 40 times and I’m not even done yet
Janken zo mooi.. 🥰
Please stop with the Mark Kelly ads. This guy is a political hack.
John Lewis Christmas advert song worthy 🤧
😍😍😍😍
Amazimg❤️
This is amazing 👏
I never click on songs I don't know. I'm so lazy I never like wasting time. The only way I learn songs is through the radio at work and through movies. This is one of the first times I remember ever discovering a song on my own. I randomly clicked on this as I was getting ready for work and this is all I've been listening all day. Spend all my breaks listening on a loop. Wow. How truly beautiful. Powerful, special, perfect. I cannot wait to spend all day tomorrow listening to it all over again.
Pure beauty ! Congrats !!
It doesn’t matter how many times I listen to this, I cry like a baby every time. This is literal perfection
♥ 2:52 BEAUTIFUL, OH GOSH :3
Wow.......just, wow
definition of Real music in this new era
Agradecida de encontrar esta canción, ahora procederé a escuchar otras canciones de este grupo
Que coisa mais linda, a cada música,  fica impossível não ser apaixonado por essa banda
Está es música añoraba está música 😭😭 Chiquillas ahonde están 😭😭 🤣😂👀🤑👀NO
Guys, y'all make me drown deeper than last... every lyrics was remind the sweetest momment that i've passed by last... every impossible could be possible when we're meet true love. Is a right? Or am wrong?
Seriously think he sounds so much like Sam Fender
Can’t stop listening to this
뮤즈화 되는건가..
goosebumps all over...
politically correct orchestra
Just simply spine tingling 😃
thumbnail made him look like a 10 year old  great song tho
Woah, these songs came out so well with the orchestra! <3
Wow!!!!! Goosebumps, so beautiful
SUPREME, YOU'RE SUPREME
YES
WHAT THE HACK IT IS 2020?, INTERNET NEED THIS SONG, OH GOOD SO GOOD.
Conor, you are perfect.
This song is so beautiful and I’ve been jamming to it in the car everyday, but this live version is even more beautiful ❤️
This is one of the best things I’ve heard!!
This is truly off the charts...I can't even see the keyboard. Please don't change.
God.
It has been on repeat since the first time I heard it.
OKAY POP OFF CONOR
It’s been a long time since I’ve been totally awestruck by a performance... dang...
Oh God, that voice ❤️
진짜 띵곡인데 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 언젠가 한국인들 댓글이 도배되길 ㅠㅠㅠㅜㅜㅜ 오케스트라 너무 전율돋아여....
Has to be the best voice of any band currently!!  Insane vocals.
This is the best song I've heard since forever
my heart <333 thanks for keeping music alive lads!
This is spiffing, best song I've heard for ages
Wow...blown away....❤
WOW! This is magic ✌️
Just amazing x
Beautiful. But something is missing.
Beautiful. But something is missing.
3 times this year they’ve released a song where I’ve said ‘this is the best tune of the year by far’
His voice is soul piercing 💖
petition for your next album to be fully orchestral
First, i heard this song..   i said"wow..." this word is enough to praise this song
Holy crap, NBT stop making me speechless, will ya? Can't wait to see you at the O2 Arena!
Absolutely great! Thank you guys! 🙌🏻
stunning <3
can i like this 1000xx 😭😭😭💙💙💙💙
Ese tipo canta bien
Conor's voice is just amazing, as usual. Love your music, guys!
3:21 mark Conor turns into a Demi-god
one word.. "goosebumps". I was working and randomly playing YT on my background then I heard this. I needed to pause what I'm doing and watch. English rock bands never fails to amaze me
Good movie music.
OMG, THIS IS AMAIZING! I LOVE IT!!!!
This music can heal the world.
If y’all wanna drop an entirely orchestral style album I’d be more than fine with that. Goddamn this is beautiful.
A brilliant song and one of the best voices ever, love this new song. Respect my dear friends 👍😎✌️
amazing
Son enormes! 😍🇲🇽 💖
This is a masterpiece!
Love this song, come to Perú someday please 🙏❤️🇵🇪
This is so pure !

YOU ARE THE BEST BAND EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! COME TO SAO PAULO - BR HAHAHAHA
My God what a voice !!!!!🙌👏
Since I found their songs on YouTube, 3 years ago, I can't get enough of listening any of their songs. They became my favourite band ever.
Holy Shit!There are 32 people somewhere in the world with serious hearing issues
This is gorgeous.   I can't wait for 23 Oct, but I also really want Nothing But Thieves to release an album of their orchestral mixes, and some of the awesome lockdown stuff they've done.
Okay, wow. They made an amazing song even better, as always.
Bliss.
Wow this is magical
Marvellous
OH MY GOD. THIS IS SO BREATHTAKING. I had chills all over my body when I listened to it <3 I thought you couldn't be better but you surprised me again
A perfect song, perfect voice  and perfect harmony, I loved this.
How do they even do this...
Perfection..
I found you guys by random chance a few years ago and omfg I’ve been following ever since. If you guys come anywhere the south East I’m so going.!!!
I’m in love with his ❤️
OMG Just wow. Love it.
This blows
Kevin and Perry finally made it
This made me cry
Thank you YouTube Recommendations for introducing me this band.
Magnificent!
I have listened to heaven
Wow.Just wow. Incredible! Can’t wait to see you guys at the o2!
It's the best song ever
I loved it so much.  Conor's voice is indescribable
Oh my god yes.. I'm so glad you've done another one ❤❤❤
Stunningly gorgeous.  I'm constantly amazed at Conor's voice. These guys are so, so gifted.  May they have every good and lovely thing!
💛❤️💜💚💙🧡
Nice/lovely track but could have been better/longer. Maybe by improving/extending the rubbish Bridge...
Es increibleeeeeeeeeeeee. Amo esta banda con todo mi serrrr. Estas canciones con orquesta que han estado subiendo son una delicia. Y esta especialmente!!! AMO. No paro de escucharla xD una y otra vez. Los amo :D
Idk how many times I’ve had this on repeat but hey ho
Just one of my fav bands ever, bloody brilliant!
I love you guys
damn.
Wonderful, you are the best 👏👏👏
I'm conviced that artists like him should be recongnized by the world mostly because of conor's voice, it's special, authentic, precious. And then you've autotuned voices, lol what a world.
Where can I buy this?
Welcome back.  I know its not your first time.
Absolutely brilliant lads, go from strength to strength.
This is beautiful.  Thrasher shirt is a great touch😏

Solo puedo agradecer por tan hermosa canción. Sin ser cirujanos, con esas melodías llegan bien adentro mío y recorren mi cabeza, mi alma y mi corazón. Gracias eternas y espero vuelvan pronto a Argentina

I need this in a movie to legally cry to this
Could you combine rock and orchestral music in such a smooth way? “I thought it was impossible.. but you make it possible”  Huuuge Greek fan here 🙋🏻‍♀️❤️
true.
Sweatpants and talent - it's all you need.
I have goosebumps
Beautiful. Shivers and tears in my eyes. Like some others, I’m torn between sharing it with the rest of the world and hugging it to myself.
Just.... wow 👏
The most underrated band 🤷🏻‍♀️
He's voice is good with any kind of music...I would love to hear him sing some RnB soul...
As good as it gets. Beautiful, moving song to listen to. Those vocals, strings and a very talented band.  Played over and over!
🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
That gosh darn fucking smile at the end.
Wow. No puedo con tanto. GRACIAS INFINITAS.

Please do this version at the O2 next year 😍😍
I like songs with an orchestra 😍
This is one of the best songs I’ve heard this year. So beautiful
I've been listening to this on repeat. I've never bought a single so quickly. It's beautiful melodically and with Connor voice and the strings and the brass.... I'm so overwhelmed!
Judas Priest that was amazing! Well done boys, well done.
Did Did you Did you really have to push me in that way ?
art
Man, this song keeps blowing me away
Didn't think this song could wreck me more than it did the first time I listened to the original and yet here we are
I'm crying  So beautiful
Wow ❤❤❤❤❤
This has serious John Lewis Christmas advert potential!
This is unbelievable. HELLO major Bond vibes
I SERIOUSLY CAN'T LOVE YOU GUYS MORE IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE
Upload this to Spotify.. challenge
I’m cryign
Live is always better than studio version from these guys 😍😍😍😍😍😍😗😍😍😍
Though I don’t like the song, Connor’s vocals here are absolutely perfect
honestly whoever originally decided to put a rock band with an orchestra deserves a nobel peace prize
323 Jesus what a voice man ! Hairs on neck standing
não tenho certeza se estou pronta para ouvir o álbum todo
I love how modest / not flash they are
This is, without hyperbole, one of the best songs I've ever heard.
My God....this is so beautiful T_T
This is what heaven must sound like
They definitely Aced it, as usual🤍✨🥺 i love them so much!!
Y yo pensando que impossible ya no podía ser más perfecta
In my top ten songs list on spotify. So much emotion
Ever felt like you get so short of words to express how much you like something?   I wish I could sing like him to express how much I loved this song.  Edit: Spelling.
Amazing song ....i love it ...
THANK U YOUTUBE FOR RECOMMENDING ME THIS MASTERPIECE
Ever since an app suggested me "I was just a kid" I can't stop listening... but let's just say this live video is a new peak, like every Nothing But Thieves release. Just hoping the quarantine ends so more people get to see the band and Conor's voice live!
This was magic, very good song and singer.
Omg this is so beautiful
I didnt think it could get better T-T and it did
So ready for 23rd
Wow I love this ❤️❤️❤️
Help, I can’t turn this off. I am drowning myself in this version ha
Took a breath, let it go Felt the moment settle so I couln't wait to tell you why I'm standin' here with this awkward smile And that's because  I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible  Love, it stings and then it laughs At every beat of my battered heart The sudden jolt, a tender kiss I know I'm gonna die of this And that's because  I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible  I'll take the smooth with the rough Feels so fucked up to be in love Another day, another night Stuck in my own head but you pull me out You pull me out  I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible  Somebody told me and I think they're right There is a change on its way tonight And I feel it's so But I fear it though  Somebody told me and I think they're right There is a change on its way tonight And I feel it's so And I feel it so  I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible
This is Crazy Awesome!!!!!!!!!
Out of this world...speechless...Darn you Conor u carry this song to another level! <3
"This can song can't be improved anymo-"  "Uh, well."
Damn, this is so beautiful 😍😍
Wowowow this is incredible ❤❤
This is stunning 🤩
Hasta ahora estoy conociendo está banda y WOOOW Dude, son increíbles
He sings the emotions off from his chest
Absolutely brilliant..... Well done to all involved... What an awesome song 👍👏👏👏👏 xx
That’s incredible.
Unbelievably amazing, completely speechless, literally crying.
Oh, so this is what a masterpiece sounds like
I... feel I can't move, I just want to lay here and listen to his voice for the rest of my life.
uao🤩🤩🤩
This version gave me the chills. Amazing
0% atotune 0% playback 100% REAL TALENT
For any other guitar nerds, I can't be the only one stressing out that Joe is playing the telecaster, and Dom is on the hollow body humbucker guitar. Just feels wrong haha
WOW! The orchestral version of Broken Machine was my favorite video performance of NBT... until now. Absolutely incredible!!
👌🖤
Oh my fucking goodness.
Magical - yet again these guys make my soul soar ❤️
My soul has transcended. You're the best band of the generation. Simple as that.
Petition to see Conor’s awkward smile.
I thought it was impossibile, but they make it possible
THIS IS AMAZING
CARALHO ARREPIEI TODAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
He's so fucking passionate THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL

This song is perfect for a flashmob proposal lol

The best band ever! The best performance! THanx!!
Круто, это нечто мужики!
They would be so good for a James Bond song
Nothing but talent, damn it, those feeling increasing and then bam they just burst, everything is so intense and at the same time fragile, I swear that's witchcraft at that point  Can't stop thinking that the orchestra is blessed to play with them
this is just...wow!!!!!
I don't know why but I just think this song  gonna blow up and they will get more recognition.
This is so beautiful ❤
💛💛💛💛💛💛
Omg omg

From the first time I heard this song, it had a big impact on me, I cried, I enjoyed it, and I fell in love with it... But listening this version, I felt something inexplicable, I'm delighted, and watching Conor performance gives a plus, really incredible. 👏👏😍😍😍

Guys u gave me goosebumps, congratulations, you're gettin better n better, you are my favourite band now. Beautiful work. Greetings from Argentina.
Es tan bella su voz uwu
didn't known need this
I wonder what the orchestra band members thought when they heard connor's voice
Having been a fan of this golden group of talented people for about 5 years now, i have never heard a single bad song from them. This song particularly is so special. I just embodies my own feelings for my wife perfectly in a way i never could. Their orchestral versions always add another layer of emotion and perfection to the songs and i just cant get enough
sensational, congratulations to those involved
I really like the way it's shot, props to the cameramen and editors.
This has made my weekend.  Already watched at least 10 times.
Conor's smile at the end is so sweet.
How do I get just a single signed sheet of this beautiful song its absolutely takes my breathe away i love you guys
those four notes sound a bit like James Bond. love this song!
We all agree that this need to be the main soundtrack of a romantic movie, right?
eu amo essa banda desde a primeira música que ouvi. essa música tá fantástica! nunca decepciona. ❤️
i never do full screen watching videos but this one deserve it ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🖤
This song is soooo beautiful 😭😭😭 and even more beautiful with this orchestral version. 🥺😭 I wish you also do an acoustic ver. as well. 🥺🥺
I’m in tears! 😭 my heart just melted like an ice cream from the beauty of this song! I didn’t think I’ll fall in love with it so fast! Conor, angel, please keep singing! 😍😍😍
It hits REALLY HARD, DAMN <3
Beautiful❤👍

Wow! That's the quality they deserve! Btw my fav song
Импасыбл! 😍
The song is perfection, probably one of the best songs of the year. But this version - even 10% better.

Wow, absolutely beautiful and amazing version.
This is the most beautiful thing ever I'm SOBBING
Qué final tan delicado y absolutamente precioso
Amazing.  They just keep on growing ❤
So beautiful 😢 I can't believe I'll never get to perform anything like this in my life 😭
Four people have brain damage
ly
Just cured my post-Summer depression
I couldn’t imagine that this song could be even better. But now I know.  It can.
I've heard this version on Spotify and I loved it. You' re awosome guys. 😍
Always surprising me, beautiful music to the ear and art to the heart, really makes me very happy! I can't wait to see them in Argentina again!
I'm sorry NBT but it's really not fair how you throw these things at us without any sort of warning to prepare emotionally.  I require 3-5 business days usually. Thanks.
I love it!!!! so amazing!! you guys  are the best band ever!
Woahh.
Pleeeease put this version on spotify!!!!
No one could sing this better!
This is art
Whenever I think "okay, they've hit peak quality, they can't get any better than this, it's literally not physically possible for them to get any better than what they already are" they just go and prove me wrong again and again.
Goosebumps for days
Goosebumps!
My two favourite bands make orchestral versions of their songs. I guess I’m one of God’s favourites.
Amazing strings and lead vocals!
shivers in the first second <3333
❤️❤️❤️👏🏻👍🏼
Sounds like it should be the soundtrack to a film 👀
Absolutely incredible. 2020 just became a whole lot better!!!
Been following these guys for 5 years now, HOW are they not huge!!! Absolutely amazing band, but this is just a whole other level. I dont think there is a vocalist around that comes close to just how damned good Conors vocals are. Roll on the new album, and next years tour.
Wowww, esto es demasiado hermoso 🥺🥺🥺 I'm in love 😍❤️
I feel so lucky to be alive at the same as this band.
ouch
Amazingly beautiful. Love it 🙏 ❤️❤️❤️
THIS IS AMAZING!!!!
crying in the club.
Love Love Love this guys!! So good!!
This is perfect
no puedo con lo hermosa que es esta canción.
so so beautiful.
This is awesome
Wow. Conor is just an incredible singer. But what a band .
Wonderful! The final remembered me the song "Carinhoso" by "Pixinguinha"
3 words to describe this song. Ass town ding!!! My wife said it should be a James Bond theme tune, I think she's got a point...
Who are these people who dislike?? Some heartless monsters with no ears?? Can’t even imagine.
NBT touches those feelings that we dont visit twice.  Heart-felt
Wow im speechless!! This is a masterpiece!!! Love you guys so much
too much talent

Uma obra de arte
Every time this band releases a new song it’s a piece of art.
I thought this song couldn't get any better. But here they drop the orchestral version. *I'M DEAD*
This is better than we could have ever asked for!

Absolutely amazing
I'm crying on the floor
[Verse 1] Took a breath, let it go Felt the moment settle so I couldn't wait to tell you why I'm standin' here with this awkward smile And that's because  [Chorus] I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible  [Verse 2] Love, it stings and then it laughs At every beat of my battered heart The sudden jolt, a tender kiss I know I'm gonna die of this And that's because  [Chorus] I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible  [Pre-Chorus] I'll take the smooth with the rough Feels so fucked up to be in love Another day, another night Stuck in my own head but you pull me out You pull me out  [Chorus] I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible  [Bridge] Somebody told me and I think they're right There is a change on its way tonight And I feel its so But I fear it though  Somebody told me and I think they're right There is a change on its way tonight And I feel its so And I feel it so  [Chorus] I could drown myself in someone like you I could dive so deep I never come out I thought it was impossible But you make it possible
WOW this is unreal!!!!
Too good. Thanks.
This song makes me cry every time. I can’t wait for the new album. I hope concerts can safely happen soon.

How can classical instruments and electronical instruments be mixed together well??  I can't drown myself in someone like you. Because there's only one band like you in the world. Nothing can mimic your music.
This warms my heart♥

Can’t breathe. Just perfect. 💙
Why am I in tears? This is so beautiful. I can't
I've had this song stuck in my head for the past few days and I can't tell you how much I needed this.  MY GOD THIS SONG IS A MASTERPIECE
Nothing But Thieves is giving birth to a musically beautiful decade. I'm 23 and I'm telling you, my kids will know about this peace of history (and how much Conor loved alfajores).

this is definitely all I needed. I love you guys.

I don't know whether to cry for the song, or for how much these guys grew up... I'm in tears 😪❣️
¿Esto es el cielo?
just when I thought this couldn't be better
this is beautiful
Amazing ❤️❤️❤️
Make this song sounds even more epic... I thought it was impossible... but you  make it possible!   You’re the best guys!!
2:18 this part was already my favourite of the whole song but this version makes it even more precious I love it. Their orchestral versions are always so beautiful and this reminds me of that Broken Machine Live which I still wish was on Spotify... ❤️
I've been listening to this band for over a year now and I can't even begin to describe how much they've helped me. Right now, I feel like I'm tearing up myself inside. Not sure if I want to go, or I want to stay and fight. I can't see future for myself. I don't even know why I'm writing this here, I guess I just had to take it off my chest. Also give this band the recognition they deserve.
I'm ready to cry again.
Esperando con ansias el nuevo álbum. 🇲🇽🤪
NBT is on another freaking level.
Wow 😍🤤 best day of my life
Why am I crying in the club right now
