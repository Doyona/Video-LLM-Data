Thank you for what? Talking shit to everyone and then not backing up your talk , losing all your last fights and then still having the nerve to come up there and talk shit again and act like your still untouchable and that none of these fighters have anything to offer you even thoe you just had your ass handed to you , being rude to nice people asking you simple questions telling your fans to f off when they want to see your training videos? These our your loyal fans who been with you from the beginning and you tell them you dont care about them ? Talking shit to Khabib one of the most respectful fighters that was in the ufc lying making shit up , thank you for what tony? Take your pick
Lol another cocky twit put in their place.Tony needs to be silent.In fact every twit thinking paddy going to get wiped out.Lol im glad paddy wiped the floor with Tony's tiny mind lol
Sometimes words don’t work….this is a case in point.
Lmaoooo this guy
Good to see Tony again
Был дурачком , стал ДУРАКОМ ( после боя)
Cte tony a walking L 😂😂
Tony is a legend but got his ass handed to him
So tony lost the last 6 fights lots of ppl saying he should retire (37 o 38 now) clearly past his prime and getting old but some genius somewhere decided giving his a full week with David hogging absolute hell likely the hardest thing he ever done, so was people expecting him to be fresh and full of energy 😂😅,  does the human body works like that? Would it not in this occasion be better do nothing at all for the last couple of days or so?
Tony is the type of guy to strike an enemy's fist with his face.
Got his ass kicked by a freckle punch- just retire
Tony stop it.  RETIRED
Gues not😊 it was the way around
i wanted so bad for goggins to motivate him to victory and be like a movie
Tony is a goof
I was really hoping that Tony would come out on top but he just didn't have it in him. Honestly I'm amazed that he made it through the first round, fucking unbelievable. It's time to retire Tony, thanks for all the entertaining fights
☝️🖖🥳🪄🎀🔓🔓🔓🌁🌌🌁🔓🔓🔓🎀
☝️🖖🥳🪄🎀🧚
Dude is mentally ill, Tony isn't known to be lacking cardio and David Goggins is a cardio/endurance coach, but he doesn't know shit about MMA, that shit just doesn't make sense, not only did he lose it, he's becoming clearly mentally ill.
And here I am again after the loss…… up to 7 please retire tony
Tony is just a f@@@ing weirdo without his wins. Exposed finally.  The backwards chair… 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Tony has lost his mind! Seriously
This is the type of guy to beat up his wife and call himself a fighter.  He wears sunglasses to hide the fact his eyes have been punched 5 inches into his skull.  Khabib would have murdered him.
retire dude
No Tony.. you F%€$ off 🤣
TONY ISN’T F*CKING AROUND ANYMORE ! 😡   0-7 now
Except Paddy fucked that boy up lmao
What a tool of a man.
Tony - classic example of how to sh@t all over your own legacy.
Tony the type of guy to take his shades off in the sun and put them on in the dark
So much for this "American takeover" . Both tony and Colby are severely deluded idiots.
He lost to the white boy
Too much hype for this guy.he would have lost to khabib,to Conor .got hit on the head too much
HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHmjHHHHHHHHH
HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHmjHHHHHHHHH
Dr Ferguson 😂
I feel if Tony loses to Paddy his career is over
how did UFC keep this guy. And not Yeol Romero
Tony and the Diaz brothers have by far the biggest fanbases
Tony's cardio will be the death of him. He'll keep moving forward and getting damaged.
Tony is very delusional and that was always funny to watch.. but now its getting quite concerning 😅 he needs the confirmation so badly that its getting kinda sad to look at. Knowing when to stop is also part of being a professional.
Hey Tony, why did you choose that walkout song? The smell 😂😂😂
Tony the type to ask you a question then say 'hold on brother I'm talking.'
I will be honest i hope Tony beats the fuck out of fatty, but either way i will always watch tony fight. Call him what you will but he comes in to fight and doesn't stop.  👍
Your not smiling now Tony 🥺. We with you and Chief 🔥🔥
It's like story time with your insane uncle. :)
Man Tony reminds me of Diego Sanchez
"He said I'm washed up. Guess that means I'm cleaned up. I feel fresh." That was a cold ass quote from Tony, ngl.
Bron been at it 35 yrs too. Tony is confident af here and sounds like he’s ready to rip.
Tony is always referencing the pandemic. Bro, that was 3 years ago. He clearly has not moved on and no one on his team is telling him the truth. Dude is delusional and is deteriorating in front of our eyes.
Pretty sure you're gonna get fucking destroyed, but ok. I can't believe he wasn't cut after his fucking 6th straight loss. Dude lost to Bobby Fucking Green, lmao. Please retire after Paddy finishes you.
Tony always has a reborn story before every fight. Just proves that he’s grasping for anything to elongate his career. He always has an excuse…time to hang it up.
I really hope he does it!!!  He seems like he's in a great place again which is awesome. W or L there is only 1 T F
I love Tony and people are getting the wrong idea about David Coggins and Tony training together. It wasn't really as much about the cardio he said it he needed to be pushed. Because all those losses he has is because of getting predictable and stagnant etc. He hasn't changed anything up he gets submitted because he didn't do what was necessary in training. Tony is tough he had the cardio but his age and all that wear has caught up weather he wants to admit it or not.
He’s walking death 💀.
Tony is the type of guy that diagnoses the doctor during an exam.
TF has lost 6 of his last fights.
This looks more like he needed to talk to some one than an Interview
Big mouth but not big on fights.
This guy lost 6 in a row how's he still fighting in the ufc. It's just a tune up fight for paddy.
I need a camp with this man
El cucuy lets go
500k + Views happy too see Tony still being relevant
Tony the type of guy to weigh a scale
I’d kick Tony’s ass
He is just hilarious 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Tone the Bone is as socially awkward as Michael Scott!
win or lose, let's go Tony!
In a Dagestan accent: I like the Tony Ferguson but the Tony Ferguson is the stupid guy
Tony is the type of dude too be a home invader who introduces himself when he comes through the door.
Hope Tony kicks ass - love this guy
Tony loves the spotlight hence he keeps fighting and not retire...
Tony is a G
I do think Tony is gonna win this match. If not, i think it's quitting time. He should be able to win this.
lets see that fuckin smile tony🙂
Hope Tony is seeing a psychiatrist/therapist who is qualified to help him.
Tony actually looks over the hills but I think he still might win
So cringe 😂😂😂
Tony is the type of guy to say “enough about me, let me tell you what you think about me.”
Tony is fuckin out to lunch lmao
12:26 his shoulders aren’t that big
All these Tony comments haha they never get old, love to see them! at this point I think it’s pretty safe to say that Tony is simply just him😅
Tony has a shot against Paddy but there aren't a lot of other guys he can still beat at LW. Everyone hyping him up cuz he trained with Goggins but that doesn't prove anything. His cardio and mental toughness were never in question, it's the accumulative damage and age that are his problems. Nothing he can do to fix those things either, it's just reality.
He's honestly one of the best fighters to never be champion, possibly the best.  Even if he cringes me to death when he shit talks and I feel like he's probably a super nice douchebag in real life lol
Tony is the type of guy to order a bacon cheeseburger without cheese or bacon.
I’d love if Tony could get the win, but his time is up.
Too bad they can’t both lose
It's alley oop, not ollie oop
Let’s go Tony!!!!!
Time for a new mic boys the audio always sounds good awful
Tony is the kind of guy to lose multiple times and still be the "hype train"
Tony is the type of guy..❤
We love you Tony. It after seeing you fight Nate Diaz…. Man, paddy is gonna being the heat man…. Praying for you. We love you but as Dana has said. This is a young man’s sport
Quote of the day.  Life would be a lot harder if I wasn’t working harder - Tony the shades & blades Ferguson.
Hear the same shit from him.  " I'm not fuckin around any more" lol 🤣
Tony is gunna lose.  His last six fights he said how he's gunna eff up his appointment but still got beat.   Now he's saying the same thing Patty.   Granted ik tony was great for a while.   But he's washed up now.   Stop talking shit Tony. Do the shit talking after the fight.  If u win.
Tony had some losses... But idc he is still one of the best in his era... I hope Tony tares Paddy up... I want him to come back n leave with his head high  and his fist high!!!
Paddy cakes 😂 gotta love Tony
If Tony doesn't fight like he's light sparring then he can do it
hate on the movement and hate on the astblisment.
This may be the last time we see Tony if he drops another 1.
He’s done
This guy is way too into himself. Paddy get the job done 👊
The chair shit 😂😂
Hope Tony whoope his azz
I love when fighters pull that monster bottle and set it under table.  Saying sooo much by saying nothing?
Says he's not here to have fun like patty cakes but turns around and said he's here and he's having fun 😂
I love Tony but if he loses he HAS to retire. I hate watching him decline and tarnish his record
#LLCOOLJIMTHATYPEOFGUY
This dude is annoying, extremely overhyped too. I hope Pimblett batters him into retirement for good.
Buzz
Tony is a proper muppet and always has been,  can fight but is so far up his own arse he should be called tony constipation ferguson,   Mentally stronger than anyone?  Dude you took your misses and your kid on a trip across the country for what exactly??
Tony is the type of guy who will have another 10 fight win streak...
11:55 Tony #1 UFC Fighter ❤
Bravo 👏
if I wasn't doin this I'd be somewhere else ,never a truer word spoken
I hope that Tony wins, but it would be damn funny if he got got…
Man this dudes brain is scrambled!  He's always been a little weird but it used to seem more focused and held together, now he just seems so all over the place it feels loony
I am Groot?
Does USADA not test for methamphetamines?
Tony is the new Chuck Norris 😎
He wasn’t smiling anymore cuz he’s been getting his ass whupped lol
lets go tony, you got that cso energy i love it, good luck this weekend g
Scary brain damage ..
I love Tony. I need this victory badly.
Great vibes from this legend!
If "Yeah, that SOUNDS good" was a person...
Gotta love the guy but damned if this isn't what he says before every fight lately
How many alley opps in this interview lol...
Tony is the kind of guy to wake you up to tell you he’s going to bed
You wanted to get hit by Gaethje, he almost killed you T. Even though i think you should consider retiring, i really do hope you beat the crap out of Paddy. He's an arse hole!
He is to old once you hit 4o you definitely  start to slow down its a young mans game sorry tony your a warrior but an over the hill one
Tony do us all a big big favor
Tony kick is ass for everyone
Damn i cringe at myself for liking him.
Seemed like a therapy session for him!
tony: "thats classified..... let me explain it to you"
"Paddy Cakes"! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 And just like that, Paddy's got a new name💯 lol
I believe everything he says but shit he talks shit
I don't get how people like Tony. I respect him as a warrior but this man is so annoying and cringe
Is this not like Brock Lesnar vs CM PUNK??????
The legend on METH But walks in like he's  VOODOO MASTAAAA  and just off a 4 week bender  WHY IS THIS FIGHT HAPPENING!!!
Shut up already  Unreal  Straight nerd  Go win a fight geek
I was really hoping for Tony to get this win then  retire but after hearing this interview, I don’t think he’s changed at all and Patties probably gonna win cause tony has lost it , wants to be a doctor be a ceo in UFC , 🤦‍♂️
I see a man that's been through hell, and never stopped moving forward, a man that when things got worse he didn't lay down and die, he said, bring it! and kept moving forward. That's who I see right there. I like this new version of el cucuy
So nice to see Tony smile again.
Bla bla bla drama bla bla bla excuses bla bla bla crybaby bla bla bla delusions bla bla bla lies lies lies bla bla bla Pitt party bla bla bla im so awesome. This is all I hear when Tony talks
Tony is weak, he constantly has to tell people how tough he is, saying no one else could be as mentally tough as him. Which is funny to me cause I think Tony is incredibly weak minded. I just can’t do the delusional shit. I honestly believe that Tony got lucky as Fuxk when he won any mma bouts. Actually his living proof that 90% of everything is telling yourself you can do it, he doesn’t really have skill he just makes shit up including his training, he isn’t smart at all, he has a pain tolerance and believes his good and that actually Carried him for as long as it did. I just don’t like Tony at all. His drama and loves to talk and he talks like a rambling meth head. Actually his entire demeanor is like a meth head
L Cucuy up in here yeah!! Lets go champ!
IM WASHED UP THAT MEANS IM CLEANED UP I FEEL FRESH 😂
5:48 Tony is the type of guy to say “That’s classified 🔒" Then gives a complete answer 😂
One of the best to ever do it.  GO AHEAD, TONY!
👎
Wish he NEVER got cooked by Justin
This dude lives on another planet.
This dude is too cringy  Go away my dude
I love Tony cause Tony is always gonna be Tony!
Tony is the type of guy to show up to a interview and ask the interviewer questions
Tony talks some absolute nonsense
I hate how emotional and serious it got in the middle just for the media to go back to simple stupid questions, tony was really TALKING again
This man has deep rooted pain.
This man can’t even formulate a string of thoughts anymore . Fallen hard from where he was . Makes me sad
Poor tony he's gone completely delusional.
Tony is type of guy that says iam the type of that guy to the mirror 😮
I am scared of tony being reckless and getting KOed. Otherwise easy win for my boy Tony 🎉
Imagine all the haters and people writing tony off for him to come back and win a title would be the most greatest stories of ufc history also coby wins too makes things in ufc a lot more interesting I'll certainly be tuning in good luck and god bless to all guys !
Im rooting for Tony in this fight !!!
did he just say the hays in the barn lol
why is he so cool
The GOAT speaks once again
If he is going to win one fight this is the one. Saw his training with goggins and I don’t think there is a chance of him losing. Paddy has to be just a bad motherfucker if he wants to beat this guy.
Tough talk for guy 0-6 in his last 6 fights 🤡
Joe Rogan needs to have Tony in to share the story!!!!!
“Siezing the day and that devil being like holy shit he’s up again” damn
Is he here to have fun? Or is he here to be serious and just fight? He keeps flip flopping. CTE is taking over his life. This has to be the last one. I hope paddy hurts him so bad that he has to stop, as mean as that sounds
Love the fighter, rooting for him, but he is the cringiest person on a mic.  Lmao
Tony is the kind of guy to smell his own farts and lie about it.
The Comments Section Are The Type Of Comment's To Comment On Other People's Lives & Not There Own... 😮
Tony needs to stop and see a mental health professional. My guy has given us his best yrs. Its just sad and honestly concerning to see this now. He should focus on his mental health and his family for all of their own sakes. #LegendaryStatusAchieved
I’ve learned to embrace the cringe, love this guy, truly one of a kind. Gunna be so bummed if he takes another L
17:27 I love Goggins laugh
Hes peaked too early with this fight. Paddy is gonna knock him out.
“Backwards chair Tony” does not have good luck lol. Best of luck my man
We love story time with Tony
Tony the type of guy who even Conor and Khabib didn’t want to fight during his prime to going on a loosing streak to make them fight him
😂😂tony mannnnn
Something’s off bout Tony, not to bash him but if you know what I mean u just know 🤷‍♂️
I think Tony gets the last laugh, if Paddy somehow out points him it will be in the latter rounds. We will see a war for most the fight and I’m praying he gets it done for 🇺🇸
I would love if you talk more AFTER the fight Good luck Idol ❤
Paddy do not deserve to fight Tony
Lousy ass “what’s up” from the media guys lol
Tony is done. I can see Paddy submitting him
Goggins really gave him ptsd 😂😂😂
🐐  CSO If it goes the distance and the refs screw him, never watching ufc again
TL:DR Tony is still a head case cringe lord.
Tony alley oop Ferguson new mythical fighter
Why train with goggins? Cos goggins dgaf who you are he'll take your ego and squash it, punish you then turn out a machine, Tony got an "update" if you will. Stripped his ego and replaced it  with brotherhood, he's going to take you to a dark place but he'll be there with you, making you wish you'd never fuckin met him 😂  but only one way to get rid of him..... outrun him.......🥶💀
Im crying 😂😂😂😭
I pity him, when it comes to fighting there's nothing worst than a fighter who doesn't accept he's over!
Tonys getting old bro.. Dudes nearly bald and super grey now haha shit!
CTE is REAL.... Tony will lose, badly. Retire fool.
him not fighting khaib really fucked with him, i think he was really ready to fight maybe even beat khaib but once the fight didn't happen, tony started losing fights. its mental game man its craxy.
Tony about to breakdown man. he seems unstainable. he shaking about cry from his emotions. i think he should refrain from alot of these interviews man so he can focus more on the fight.
Tony's the type of guy to beat the fat off of paddys face
Tony shouldnt be here... i hope he proves me wrong.😢
I think Tony levels him quite easy, paddy's stand up is average at best......Round 2 Tony time !!!
He is having fun but he is not here to have fun 🤔
Rip
Defo lost the plot crazy ham shank come on the paddy retire this loon BOOTLE UK 🇬🇧
Tony is the type of guy to show up and say he's having fun then says "f*ck you, Im not here to have fun"
Yikes. Tony is nuts but he completely sounds outside of reality.
Tony is now a parody of himself.
Gawd! Tony is so cringe and hard to hear him talk he says one thing he believes and outta know where changes his mind he's just cringe 😬  honestly hope patty knocks  his ass out make him retire already
Guys such a mong
Tony the type of guy to say alley-oop five times during an interview
No matter what you think about Tony, he's one of the most honest and vulnerable fighters ever to grace MMA. Respect to this dude for being in the game as long as he has.
Yeah... he's going to lose. He is on tilt, erratic, delusional, and about to get caught in a submission round 2.
Tony Ferguson the type of guy to ask you a question and say "Hold on I'm still talking"
The David Gogins effect kicked in
Tony is on 🔥🇺🇸🇵🇱💪
I think tony in his prime is the only one who could  stopped khabib. Man is a champ for the fans
Come on T….light Paddy’s ass up!
If Tony Ferguson has been training with David Coggins goodbye, Paddy
TONY NEEDS HIS OWN PODCAST
Tony the type of guy to declassify his own classifications
Tony -“I’m not here to have fun.”  Tony - “hold up ! Let me talk.  I’m having fun”.
Sounds like he’s tryna convince himself aswell as us
You can ttooooootally hear Mr Goggins in Tony's speaking here.
I like Tony but i dont see this fight end different than last one ..
Goggins is a perfect match for tony. Paddy likely to get sparked out in round 1 if he decides to Street fight
Whos more of a physcopath Tony or Goggins?
Mint.
The best press confs.
all talk he is gona get slept in the 1st round😂
LEGEND and future Hall of Famer.
I fucking hope so
Tony and Tito are very similar.
Tony the type of guy to record the media
Please Tony sort that guy so he doesn't come back 😊
Most sane I’ve seen Tony for a long time.
I think that Tony thinks he's in the military and Goggins is actually his Chief.
Goggins has changed his psyche, he is much stronger. He'll fuck up Paddy.
Tony: Paddy shouldn't be such a bitch because someone is talking shit online and then he blocks me.  Reporter: Paddy said you blocked him.  Tony: Well yeah! I didn't want to hear his shit!
After seeing Tony going through what he did with Justin G. as a human who really respects Tony I am scared to see him go through any more damage
Tony is the type of guy to retire from the UFC then sign with Bellator/PFL to keep from getting bored
Hopefuly will retire after this loss to Paddy.
Go Tony!
Tony looking old af
FFS. Drop the schtick already...
Tony did the complete wrong type of training. His cardio and toughness were already there, he's going to get KO'd bet the house on it.
Tony is the wipe of guy to read his biography at a press conference
He's just talking nonsense
cringe
Can't wait to see this one, I got respect to both fighters so best of luck to both 👍
👏👏👏 love you Tony, win or loose you always keep it real man
I really like fergurson in this match up. Losing streak or not i think he gets decision
I am big paddy fan but tony is a dangerous man and he is tough as they come. I dont want to route against paddy but this is going to be a tough fight.
everyone pray for tony to win and cheer him on every second!  god bless tony ferguson!
Tony is looking old :(
Tony is the type of guy to be trash and keep losing for no reason
Tony would have made a great Navy Seal
Tony's gonna smash him.
Sort of bloke to let you sleep with his wife to condition his feelings
Am hoping Tony wins this one then retires 🙃
His skill might decline but the mic skills are on a level of its own 🤣🤣
That was a most stupid interview what I seen all my live...This guy is mad..probably becoz he got to many hit at he s face.Brain damage or something..That's talk will be good in Wrestling😂😁😂
"i wanted to get hit by gaethje" ... ya .. thats what happened... lol
How come you guys are always dead when I walk in.... Because you're the most unlikable fighter on the UFC roster lol
7:57 Tony: Hold on brother, I am talking never gets old....xD
his career is regressing faster than his hairline
His mind is like stupid
This fight on face value is intriguing, but I have a feeling that it is not a lose, lose situation for Paddy, maybe it will be a Win Win for Paddy, Tony and the UFC, after all its a business, and all involved will want to win, just saying,
Tony i really hope you get the win this time, you need it.
There's only 4 fights on the main card. That's ridiculous for what the price is.
I think this is it! Win or Die! Good Luck Tony!
Tony will win by to much pressure  not going down and ref stoppage with to many slicing elbows he will still retire aftwrwards
Tony and goggins perfect for each other two.people.that absolutely do not give a fffuuuuuuuuuuu.........
Hey sunglasses😂❤
The people giving questions have done an absolutely perfect job. 100% objective, with zero ulterior motive
Paddy is the type of guy that wins when he loses.
cte is real bro its sad too see
lost the plot.. mid life crises while being on a losing streak as a ufc fighter must be tough. Tony is unstable
"who's gonna carry the boat!"
Your desc reads 294 not 296 just letting you know so you can change it, gonna delete this when you done bro, get way better publicity on the video too.
Tony use to walk the walk now he talks the talk. I hope he wins though.
Classified !!!!🎉
“Hold on brother I’m talking” I love TF 😂😂
Tony's the kind of guy that should have retired
I really relate to this his attitude about everyone judging and not actually knowing crap
Tony Ferguson the type of guy to apply Vaseline to the cutmans face in between rounds
I've been watching some of his stuff, and I think I believe him about him being better than ever.
This guy has issues. No joke.
I hope El Cucuy brings his A game to this one .......  Paddy could be in for a real miserable , brutal evening
I think he might retire
I don’t think we ever questioned Tony’s toughness. Not sure why that would be the point of emphasis this camp, or any camp. He just can’t compete with these guys anymore.
Fucking goggins and tony being friends is a match made in heaven
Dana needs to tell him no, Tony will be the first man to die in a UFC fight. he cant quit someone needs to do it for him.
I think the hell week was probably amazing for Tony's mental state, seems like it really helped.. the issue is he's older now and it was essentially putting himself through a war which puts wear and tear on the body, I hope I'm wrong
He’s trying too hard to be bad 😂he’s done for ❤
Tony has lose to many Brian cells. You can tell he have some type mental illness. More delusional than ever. He need help.
Tonys the kind of guy that is surprised he is being videoed at a press conference
"If I could I'd fight in son glasses" tony.. never change
I felt like I was listening to a Spoken Word piece. Tony is def. one of a kind.
He seems delusional af still…
Tony is the type of guy to block someone and then call them sensitive... Tony is the type of guy to say I'm not here to have fun, to say 2 minutes later "I m here having fun" 😂 😂
Tony really does rate himself high , great fighter to watch though
. Wow its a lesson in talking ego  gone mental  total  rubbish .. surely he's got no normal mates that listen to him
Tony is just unwell mentally, he needs help! I cant' believe that no one is telling him to quit yet...sad.
Should he not have been cut from   the ufc already for his loses. And his mental health
I really hope Tony wins. Or this could be his last fight 🤔.. No hate to paddy. But Tony is a legend,  and I still class him as an all time great lightweight UFC fighter. He needs this win. CMON TONY!!!
I know Tony's past his prime, but I'm glad to see him pumped up again. If he can get back to his old self, Paddy's going going to have a rough time in the octagon.
Beating Paddy the Saddy would be his greatest achievement since starring as Cyrus in Trailer Park Boys.
Puts a smile on my face to see him being in a good mental state  edit: the honesty and self-reflection is inspiring
Washed up old bum, over the hill hahah still talks tough but give it up Zack Morris Hahaha
Tony's ode to Goggin's.
Ufc want paddy win no matter what, its just business
so sad that tony does not realise that his time is gone. bro really needs to stop fighting.
You’re going fold like a cheap deck chair
Tony is the type of guy to not do this for the fun of it, just for the fun of it.
I'm excited to see him wreck Paddy!
Im soooo hoping that big T gets a big W this weekend. One of the greatest
Tony acting like he didn't just lose 6 in a row 😂
some ketchup to go with my mcnugget face.
When Tony turns the chair backwards you know he’s in a good mood
Why doesn't Tony listen to what Habib said after Justin beat the s...out of him?
“I’m not gonna say his name” and yet EVERY  fight we get the same comments about Khabib. I can’t believe he still holds this resentment in him about it.   He needs to let go and heal.
its so sad because when either of these guys win, the other gets canceled out. its like a lose lose situation.
Let's go Tony!
Tony is the Kenny Powers of MMA lmao
Tony is the type of guy who says he cant answer a question then proceeds to answer it.
goggins changed him
Tony working on getting more tough is not the problem, never has been. You are one of the toughest people to ever do it. You stopped training with teams, because you were ahead of your time when you came up but now everyone has caught up and surpassed you. You need to get back to a gym with a big group of guys to grind with and spar every day. Go to Stricklands gym work with him
Is it just me or Tony really was holding his tears every time he talks about goggins... I mean his voice trembles every time he speaks about goggins ..
Funny as. Fight with sunglasses on 😊
I don’t think there’s ever been a fight more where everyone wanted one person to win. Even if you don’t like Tony or you will definitely prefer him to that pimblett.
Tony Ferguson is super buu
Tony the type of guy…..
Tony type of guy to bring and show off the greatest loosing streak interim belt
Tony if you win set up a go fund me so we all donate to you from U.K. lol
You sir is a crazy MF 😂
Hearing tony say "I have a losing record" broke my heart
Man just look at the numbers in views when Tony is here. Will always be a legend🤞🏼
Love you Tony, hope you win with a cool finish too❤
I love Tony and this is why, *they say you can take the man outa the dog, but you can't take the dog outa the man* . *You can think to take Tony outa of the fighting game, but you cant take the fighting game outa of Tony. Much repect Tony for all you've done for the sport
"I'm washed up, that means I'm cleaned up. I'm fresh" good lord tony 😊
Dude sounds like he is trying to bring people into a cult.
Toney the type guy to retire after this fight 🤫😢
David goggins will be the reason Why he wins if it fails it will be very sad but I can tell there’s a different feeling about him this time
Hold on brother i'm talkin' .....Lol classic Tony Ferguson. You gotta love this guy
I hope Tony documented his training witch Chief Goggins!!! Gonna make a great documentary 1 day!
You can tell this will be Tony’s last fight.
Tony is the type of guy to record the cameraman  Hope he wins
Jeez Tone, bit long in the tooth there ey?
If he wins this fight he needs to retire for real
Damn , you can tell he's been training with chief David goggins
Paddy is gonna murder this dude & then after tony will still think in his damage brain he has a chance at winning.
Fuck Tony acts like a recovering drug addict  talking in his weekly meeting 😮.
If I could I wear my shades in there YOU BASTARDS!!”😂😂
man tony lookks too old. but  i know what kind of devil he is
Tony looked horrible in Bobby Green fight.
Sound quality is shit
Damn he might beat tf out this kid
Sounds like this man has some inner demons and is a bit lost. He’s not the same tony anymore. He lost his way path.
Sry but as much as i love him hes finished. He wont beat paddy He should just  hang up the gloves, go in the hall of fame and open his own gym 🥋
Tony going to get choked out again lmao he definitely over trained
“I’m hardly not going to be the same me”… okay next question…
These interviews are such casuals. Didnt even laugh to hold on brother
Unless Tony finishes him, the ufc gonna make sure the kid with the ridiculous haircut wins
Really looking forward to this one !
Sunglasses looking sharp
Tony the type of dude to ankle pick his demons
Did he just train a weekend with Goggins?
He's such a gimp!! A gimp, but an entertaining one and he does this thing so.. . Respect.
Tony is the type of guy who before to text back his wife, he puts on the shades and sprinkles the phone with Holy Water...🙏➕
Everyone is rooting for you Tony !!
Tony is a douche bag. He needs to be defeated and retire. He's always trying to show he's a tough guy, deadly, people going crazy for him and all that BS. He's got delusion of grandeur.
That time with Goggins is like a bad kid going to military school 😂 got his whole life together
Tony is the type of guy to wake their kids up in the middle of the night to tell them that daddy will turn paddy’s face into ketchup
Tony's the kind of guy to carry the boat.
Father time beats everybody its gonna be sad watching tony loose again😢
Tony the type of guy to be having fun and then tell you he's not here to have fun
Champ shit only 🔥💯🏆
Tony is humble now, you can feel through his words where he's coming from.
Imagine being in Tony’s shoes.. dudes one of a kind on this earth and whether he wins or loses people should recognize his mental fortitude and how he carried himself like a real man through his trials and tribulations
Honestly, Tony's looking old and angry. Snapping on that reporter for no reason was cringe, and I'm sorry, but I hope the ufc will retire Tony when he loses this fight.  Age doesn't matter if you don't let it matter...however, Tony isn't performing or acting like he should anymore.
Come on Tony😭😭😭😭
11:32 whos he talking about?
18:44 Classic Tony! 😂😂😂😂
This is the start of Tony's next title run
Tony is the type of guy to go on a 12 fight win steak only to go on a 12 fight loosing streak just to condition his brain more
Tony is a type of guy who doesnt want to now...he is done a long time ago
Imagine you go to the doctor and it’s Tony 😂
You guys are going to find out toughness doesn’t win fights
Just getting painful to watch now, please retire this weekend
Man there's only one real king of cringe. You can't dethrone him
Tony ferguson is the type of guy to swear whilst wearing a cross on his neck
Tony is gonna get fucked up lol.
I dont think Paddy is hyped. He might be popular, but thats not the same.
Take a shot everytime he says alley-oop
Sorry to say but Tony is not ok man. This is absurd to listen
Tony isn't mentally stable and I don't see anybody else talking about it
He's looking an old  man now ain't he was a beast in his prime
"the most mentally strong" coming from the guy that quit during the Justin fight. of course Tony would waste his time with goofy "chief" Goggins lmao. Tonys cardio was never the problem
Tony went from im a great mood boys let’s gooo to I’m not here to play and fuck around or be your friend 🤣🤣
Does anyone know what time it'll be on (British time) I'd pay to watch this fight but I'm up for work early next morning and not sure if I'll be able to
big fan but hes washed up now Justin sealed the deal with that
psyyyyycho
He nervous AF.
Wish the best for Tony. It’s easy to judge and cast stones , but I hope Tony gets the W
Tony, you better smoke this kid
Just retire bro.
I hope Ian recovers from his fractured clitoris. 🙏
Tony is the type of guy blaming khabib for all his losing streaks
Ferguson didn't need extra cardio but I bet goggins take non of Tony's 💩. Bet  he keeps him on track mentally
🐐 talk
Tony is the type of guy to play chess when you were playing checkers and by the time you started playing chess he was done playing games 😂
Stfu Tony you getting slept 2nd round
Tony the type of guy to make David Goggins an MMA world champion coach.
There's no other sport like mma. It's such a brutal sport and lifestyle that you have to be a different human to take part. And seeing these people over the years, express themselves, lose and win. You almost feel like you know them. Crazy sport.
This is peak Tony.
whats up la
Tony is the type of guy to send location.
shadow of his former self, i wish his body allowed him to fight like he used to.
Tony is the luckiest man in the UFC. He gets to pound the crap out of Paddy. 🤣
Dudes a therapists wet dream 🙄😂
Just win this one fight,fuck the record we still remember the al cucuy Ferguson
I pray Tony gets this win and walks off into the sunset
I wish Tony would walk out to "I'm that type of guy" by LL Cool J.
CMON Tony!
Like Khabib Said. Tony is good fighter but little bit stupid.    P.S Anyone more that noticed how much some people try to cancel khabib from US, specially from ufc latly.
So sad :(
This is just sad....
Sounds exactly the same sounds like he's on the road to another loss
If i wasnt here i would be somewhere else 🤨
This boys cheese done fell off his cracker
Paddy is not good otherwise he would be champ Tony is not good otherwise he would be champ.  Tony going with that state of mind is so sad to watch. So sad so sad
tony needs to retire its sad to see him fighting now
Sad sad face
Is he doing fight conference or a TED Talk?
Cringe imposing Ferguson again
He wants to be a doctor?!  Calling doctor Howard, doctor Ferguson  doctor Howard.😅
Sounds like he really beat the crap out of his sparring partners this training camp. He did not hold back.
Tony's brain is fried
This was his therapy session
Just when you think he cant be more unlikable, he outdoes himself again lol  Hes so cringy
Tony will show everyone that those last few losses were flukes. In '24  he will have the LW belt. This comment will age well.
I'll take 3/1 about Ferguson.
Reporter "Tony how did you train for this fight?"  Tony "I trained until I cried. Until some Nationals were laughing at me and it gets hard to carry everybody. I gotta Focus on myself and that's the question."
He is just so damn cringe.  Im torn on this fight.  On one hand, I hope he wins.  But, Im afraid he will keep fighting.  If this was h8s last fight. Id love to see him go out with a great win.  Listening to him talk.  He still thinks he is at the same level.  So, maybe its good if he loses.   It really is a lose lose situation for Paddy.
Tony needs a win bad
I like Tony a lot but it’s to the point I can’t listen to him talk
Ketchup sandwich..... really.....
Tony the type of guy to be on a 6 fight losing streak, just to snap Paddy 6 fight win streak.
Hope he has more moves than he has words or he's in big sh-t.
Ollie oop, when skate boarding meets basketball
Ahhhh tony bro , go get some vacation couple of month you really need that 😁
Lets go Tony
A certifiable lunatic. Having a full on nonsensical conversation with himself.And the media pretending they know what the feck he's talking about.
Tony starting to sound like tito is not good
I'll always be a fan of Tony. Tony is a real fighter. Still sad that we never got to see him and Khabib.
These dude is in trouble. Mentally I just feel like he’s not okay and mark my words when everything is said and done he will be a legit threat to his family because of all the brain damage he has taken. Also this is a mirror shell of a man trying to convince everyone else and himself that he is still Tony of the old and it’s just not true.
Paddy is going to eat him alive. I hope he goes down easy and doesn't have any long term health problems as a result of this. I get the desperation of training with goggins, literally last fight before you get cut so you throw the hail mary but what he should have done is hard focus on his basics, he didnt but not sure if it really matters, our young will always eat our old in this sport and that will happen again.
I still love Paddy, but I'm pulling for Tony!!!
I'm not sure he understands what an alley-oop is😂😂😂
this man is completely narcissistic and delusional
Please God, allow Tony to win 🙏
Tonys the type of guy to keep his balls between his legs.
Tony the type of guy to have fun when he’s trying to not have fun
Tonys is the type of guy to join the navy seals for a training camp
in tony's mind, he thinks people are impressed with goggins in his corner and the new and improved tony. For me, it's the opposite. It looks sad, delusional and small. He's inflating himself to be bigger than he is. His abilities are gone. Don't shoot the messenger. This is coming from from a ferguson fan. Paddy will finish him. After that, i really hope he can figure out his life, go away or reset. I wish him well.
You can do aint shit!
He’s still pretty coherent and good with his words. No Brenden Schaub that’s for sure.
Got to love tony ad his day but still a dog in the octogon  not the best but tough as they come got to kill him to stop him but like i said ad his day paddy beats him.
Oscars questions are brilliantly worded and straight forward
Tony - The Cutter - Ferguson ❤
He tries too hard to make himself a personality but he’s been hit in the head a couple too many times, it’s getting kinda sad now
Hold On Brother, I'm Talking ✋🏻.... He's guna win off that!😂
Hoping for the best for Tony
unfortunately, 6 losses in a row speaks for itself. I think most of us are giving Tony a chance based on who HE WAS - NOT who he IS. This is not the old/prime Tony. I think he is getting KO'd in round 1 because he is too slow to keep up with Paddy's fast hands. BUT - given how Paddy leaves his chin so vunerable, Tony will probably get a few good shots in before he goes down.
Tony: I want to be a doctor  Also Toni 10 seconds later: I want to do damage to all of them
Ferguson fan here, but tony will get finished
Tony is saying all of this and yet he will still look worse than when he fought Bobby Green 😂
Guys it’s about to get rough in these streets for Tony furgason fans. IF paddy beats him
I hope so Tony, I hope so. Shame how his career has turned out.
weirdo
Tony Ferguson by Decision - 2 to 1
Feels like I could watch Tony talk for hours. Dude deep and real as hell.
He's a hard man to like. If I was a journalist I'd ask him: if his mental toughness has never been his let down in any of his matches so why focus on that rather than his actual technique and power output? Doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.
I wanted tony to win but now i want paddy to knock him out in the first rd1
Tonys the type of guy to get pardoned without ever being in prison in the first place
de lu sion 😵‍💫
Say what you want about Brock, but I admire Tony's loyalty to one of his most important coaches.
He’ll be killed in this fight
It's sad how people disrespect  Tony afte all his done for the sport .
Tony’s the type to try and buy the ufc to tell Dana he’s got TONY WHITE PRIVILEGE 😂
This guy is punch drunk. Makes no sense.
They said “ you could be a little more nice” and I said “FUCK YOU!” 🖕🏼 lol!
Tony is the type of guy to baby sit pattys kids after the fight.
Paddy by submission
Tony the type of guy that shows up every fight younger, stronger and faster. Hold up brother I’m talking.
WAR Ketchup Sandwich Tony!
I get a real sense of projected confidence, rather than genuine confidence. He might just get dropped
i dont like him to much, i think he is a little stupid but i hope he wins this time
How is this fool still fighting in the UFC and didn’t get fired yet ?
7 fights later and on a 6 fight losing streak. This man still saying he isn’t at his best haha
What's up boys every time I am walk here everybody so quite respect Tony Ferguson prime time
Tony has lost his damn mind, “not here to have fun”…. 2 minutes later. “Let me talk, I’m having fun, smiling” 😂
If you go in for a doctors visit and your doctor comes out and it’s Dr Ferguson you really went to the wrong office
Tony said he isn’t fucking around anymore the last 6 fights lol
this interview is legendary win or lose on this one tony we still riding with you. youre a absolute legend. insane career these new fans just don't know
Tougher Tony!?! How? Scared for Patty's face
Why does Tony always refer to his ‘Team’ that team sucks and Tony hasn’t won a fight since he’s been with them… 🤦‍♂️
Tony " alley oop" Ferguson
Tony the type of guy to tell his watch what time it is
He's the guy that goes to the barber then still cut his own hair
Tony has lost it, what is he talking about. Brain damage. He's gotta retire ASAP. If Paddy beats him idk even know what that dude can do or say.  He says all this tough shit everytime and then doesn't show up.  He's lost it He's slow and doesn't have it anymore.. RETIRE ALREADY
Tony is the type of guy to have fun while not being there to have fun
Is it sad that I clicked on here just to watch how delusional he is?
I think Tony is going to rock Paddy's world, any one else thinking this ..................
It's annoying I can't watch it for free on bt sport like I normally do
He looks frail and thin tbh
Iff i could i would fuckin with my sunglass 😂😂😂😂 he killed me
tony's already in a tough fight with his hair line.
I wish I had a Tony is the type of guy comment, only Tony knows what type a guy that he is, hanging with David Goggins, Tony is the type of guy that is willing to die to get it done,let’s go Tony get it done
Last fight for Tony but he was a fun guy for the UFC
delusional, crazy anyone thinks Tony has a decent shot.
imagine paddy knocks him out in the first 30 seconds after all this talk from tony
7:10 through 7:45 feels like tony is trying hard to convince himself. Anyway, wish him luck
That quiet you hear Tony......that's what happens when everyone in the room is talking shit about how washed you are, as you walk into the room! It's the loudest silence you've ever felt. The last 3 press conferences have been so cringe and uncomfortable....it's not funny, it's sad dude. Tony, we really do love you brotha, you were the best dark horse id ever seen tare through a division!!! Go be with your family and count your money  PS everyone keeps saying "Tony doesn't need goggins, his cardio and mental game are fine"   No Tony's mental game is NOT "good" mentality is actually EXACTLY what tony needs fixed! His confidence broke when his knee went....he's been on a stinker since the pettis fight..... Anthony was FUCKING HIM UP when his hand broke. Maybe David can help him find his smile (confidence)
I would love to know everyones opinions on this. Do you think Tony Ferguson should be in the UFC Hall of Fame?
I love Tony
Hey Sunglasses 😂
Showing immense signs of anxiety. Obviously his mind isn't quite there yet but I do think his experience alone will be enough to beat Paddy. I'm a scouser, I hope Paddy wins but I don't think he will in reality. Ferguson is still very dangerous.
Paddy by way on tap out
A guy who treats people like he does and says FUK U to anyone other than his family or his gay ass coach is not in a "good mood" or "mentally stable". Looking forward to his retirement. Tired of seeing this bum fight.
Think it’s time to have that uncomfortable conversation that Tony’s actually a bit of prick
Tony "It was everything I had to give and I still have more to give" Ferguson!
They’re frightened to death that they’ll encounter you in the car park afterwards…..in case you run them over, in another dui 😂😂
Tony is the type of guy to have severe signs of cte
Please Tony🙏🏼🕶️
Man I love Tony
Tony is the type of guy to go to church and interrupt the pastor explaining why he needed to be at church.
Respect TF but his time has passed. The younger fighter will prevail & I’m rooting for TF to win.  Obviously anything can happen but money on table or gun to head…  Youth
What a nut job. I can’t stand Tony or paddy. I hope they both loose
Tony is the type of the guy who looks into the menu to know what the menu wants to eat
Tony doesn't need to become a doctor; he needs to see a doctor... that's a toxic hot mess. Couldn't imagine living around that on a daily basis
It's classified is the most Tony answer Tony can give 😅
7:20 I could feel the nevousness
Please win Tony 🙏
Imagine if Tony was wearing sunglasses when chandlers foot met his chin 😬
love tony but if he loses this time, only brendon shaub might be able to help tony,i.e. to quti the fight business.
Every camp is "the best camp ever" with this guy now.
So confident for a dude's that's been slept a few times in his last few fights.
Tony is the type of guy who still has legions of fans even on a 6 fights losing streak.
I think Tony going to bring something this fight ….. I can feel it
Kids these days: "oh look it's the guy who lost like 7 times in a row" Us as Kids: "damn who's this guy next victim"
Tony do a flip
I don't think he will get a W, I am honestly not reading him as being stable or doing fine. I don't think he has the capacity to stop
Bro lost to Nate Diaz 😂😂😂
Ah backwards chair guy lol
Tony's the type of guy to block every last human on Instagram.
what a fucking press conference....GO TONY WIN
Tony the type of guy to marry himself at a wedding
Tony is the type of guy to turn your face into a ketchup sandwich
in simple my mouth n heart is willing but physical is done n finished ...
I want old school boogie man Tony soooo baaaaaaad!!!!    One last ride brother, come on!
Talks so much shite! gets beat again,  by a bum from Liverpool.
Tony is the type of guy to say “I’m washed up, that means I’m cleaned up. I feel fresh.” 🧼
Justin really did a job on Tony. He'll never be the same . Reminds me of the Lawler vs Rory or Jr vs Vasquez Trilogies but way worse.  He's too tough for his own good and basically just dellusional at this point , look who hes fighting.
Tony is the type of guy that stays in a professional sport to display the effects of CTE
Audio went out of time again 👎👎
Tony’s wife is probably one of the best wifes in the world. All the things she goes through and she still loves him and tries to help him anyway she can.   Tony knows he’s crazy, he knows, trust me, he knows. When you’re crazy for that long, you can’t hold on to the in-denial phase anymore.   When she calls the cops on him, she sounds so worried about him and worried about the cops that might encounter him. She has a huge heart! Tony knows what he’s got. When you’re crazy and you have a wife that sticks with you through all your bullshit, you love her, I mean really love her. You love her more than you love yourself.   I’ve been crazy for years, I cherish and appreciate my girl more than anything in my life. Tony might have episodes of paranoid delusions, but he loves her.   I had to stop fighting because taking blows to my head made me way worse. I really think Tony should stop fighting, not because I don’t believe he’s got it anymore. I really think he can get his shit together and win. He is still Tony, if he used his jujitsu more and fought more intelligently, he would win a lot of his losses back. But I think he should quit and take care of his mental health. He’s had his time. He was the best in the world and had an amazing win streak over sharks.  I hope he takes care of himself and his wife, and lives a happy life. He has earned it.
They should just prep his retirement tribute video now...he's dunzo. I miss the boogeyman
Tony is the type of guy to declare himself winner inside the locker room and go home
Oooohhhh Tony is not playing around anymore, watch out everyone! Smdh. Tony, you been washed up, stop acting dangerous. Retire already dude. As for everyone else, stop hyping this weirdo up damn.
Hold on brother im talking 😂😂😂 Classic
Had to swipe off bros just waffling nonsense trying to stay relevant and going off topic telling his own stories instead of staying on topic. He’s washed guys he gets beat Saturday and goes to the press conference and says I still think I can be a champion hang it up
Really sad Bro has serious brain damage. How are we allowing this fight to happen I just don't get it. Tony is seriously deranged, his own wife called police several times worried about his manic and erratic behavior. Bro drinks from the well of delusion
Paddy is going to put you to sleep first round and make your face looks like a ketchup sandwich 😂😂
We need a cipher when tony talks about stuff. Bros on another plain.
Probably the best presser I've seen in years.
Real question for all the mma fans on this comment section. Do y’all think Tony beats Paddy? Do y’all think he’s washed? I want to know your opinions
tony needs to let go and shave his head 😅
Tonys title run will be legendary 🔥
Get of your high horse, paddy gave you respect in his interview 😅 up the scousers. I think you retire after this fight and don't just a book by its cover 😊 you'll never walk alone...if your stressed and blocking people on social media maybe talk to paddy..he'll give you that many lefts you'll be begging for a right lol 😅
Tony's takeaway from his career is definitely brain damage... sad that he'll never know that.
Tony already lost, Mentally..  Why is this guy still fighting?
Regardless of the losing streak, Tony HAS to be inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame
Goggins is a marathon type guy… ufc is more like a sprint I think
Tony is the type of guy to say, float my ballon, but meant to be float my boat
Can't wait for the press conference
Tony "its confidential " 2 minutes later explains the whole story
TONY THE TYPE OF GUY TO LOSE 7 IN A ROW
Tony Ferguson gotta be the most narcissistic person I ever seen lol
Tony is the type of guy that can make 5mins speech without even answering your question
Tony has had his day. Paddy is a nobody. If Tony doesn't beat him he needs to retire like he should have 2 fights ago
I watched Tony being interviewed yday where he pretty much blamed khabib not fighting him for the reason he's been beaten in his last six or seven fights including gaethje. Tony's still one of my fave fighters but I believe he shudda packed in after the chandler fight. It's hard to watch him being pieced up by guys he wudda smoked a few years ago
A ketchup sandwich. Tony’s shit talk is the only thing worse than his fighting. Where’s your baseball lmao
Good answers 👍🏻
“That’s confidential”   Continues to explain 🤣
Compare this to an interview earlier in his career and youll realize Tony has always been weird 😂
I don't think Paddy Pimblett is anywhere close to Tony Ferguson's level, even at this late stage in his career
I literally had a dream last night that Tony got choked out ... hope this doesn;t come true...
It’s sad but the only hope is that paddy is as awful as we tease him to be. Goggins is hard but not an mma coach. Probably great life lessons for Tony, I’m sure it was brutal training but youth is a bitch… he’s going to take this loss mentally, like CSO… but it’s just lame that all our legends pass.
I love tony but gsp put the suits long before him
Kinda dumb.
25 mins of non-sense. Tony talks the most and says the least.
It's Tony time!
It's Tony time!
never rooted so much for a fighter in my life until this camp. for everyone the uk, please piece paddy up 🙏
Tony batshit as ever. I guess we'll just have to wait and see if the Goggins magic really works.  I hope so! 🙂
This guy doesn’t know how mentally I’ll he is, he needs  to go see a doctor not study to be a doctor 😢
Did they do this instead of having a normal press conference?!? To protect the little Cuck 😂?
I hope Paddy drops you in the first 30 seconds...then you can change your name nickname to El clablewy😂😂😂😂
Tony the type of guy to say " 7:57 " while his kid is about to say his first words
These interviewers are not at Tony's level. We need other kind of questions for him to rise up the real Tony.
Tony: What gets you up in the morning  Press Guy: goes to answer   Tony: hold on I’m talking   😂😂😂
Nothing but love for Tony seriously.....BUTT. you kitten 😺 me. GSP wore a suit maybe before any ufc fighter at press most definitely. Chuck day time I think he wore a collar t-shirt and blue Jean's. GSP was the marker of professional/HESPECT  mannerisms. that and his style I have too say he's will always be my 1# favorite fighter. Again very much enjoi and love Tony. Worried have been wanting him too retire badly hope the best. Dude is WILD I love it. But I worry about him have an amazing day or night if you read I appreciate you got love 4 everyone until given strong reason's not too. Health / wealth/prosperity 4 you and all loved one's take care 😘
I wish the best to Tony
Tony seems angry and fed up. Its actually quite worrying how he will handle losing to a guy like paddy.
"Holyshit he is up again 🤣"
Love that he turns the chair around lol
Tony’s the type of guy to Hand himself into Federal Prison because he’s just Toooo Gangster
This Tony looks angry and focused. Those elbow daggers will take Paddys chin off
Holy shit man TONY  good luck to paddy that's all I can say
Tony gonna ruin paddy.... haters gonna hate
Hope this mentally ill trainwreck wins
Man Its A Great Weekend For UFC
Big Tony supporter here. He blocks a lot of people on ig. Me included for some reason.... 😂
Tony was great... he is now trash... slightly mentally deranged.... i hope he proves me wrong
is he psycho ?
I think he will do paddy dirty
"The Highlight" Justin "The Career Killer" Gaethje
CTE has just been victimized by another guru.   Unconscious round one
Dudes GONE David can't fix his brain 😅
I can't believe the negative thought process in peoples heads regarding this fight, Tony although on a huge losing streak is still the favorite in my head, paddy looks really inexperienced on the feet and got pieced up last fight.
This dude has got actually brain damage. Justin leading up that bad he’s got brain damage there’s no two ways about it. Listen to the way he bloke carries on. Are used to really like this dude?
Tbh i think he beats paddy..... But am i the only one who thinks Goggins is a joke? I know wtf he has done, still think its a joke. flat....out.....joke.
Tony's the kinda guy to ask a question back and immediately follows up with 'shut up' let me aswer your question'.
This guy is in his own head. Christ.
Tony the type of guy to record a professional film crew
GOODBYE TONY. *** U are literally "stuck" on urself & I truly feel sorry 4u. Bless u bro.
I hope it's a WAR. (So he finally fucking retires) - & I hope he gets a spectacular finish
I dont why but if Tony wins this one, I want to see Connor vs Tony at UFC 300
Dude need to retire honestly. UFC will take all the juice from him as Khabib use to say.
Hey sun glasses go and retire
Man, his ears stick out hard
Wanna see tony win this and retire on a high 🤞🏼🙏🏼
Tony the type of guy to completely fall off and come back and win a title
Tony the type of guy to get pulled over and let the officer off with a warning.
Dear Santa, just skip all the presents this year and give us vintage Tony one more time.
Tony is the type of guy to make ketchup sandwiches great again !!
Tony is the type of guy to "get tired of his own fucking story's" but continue to tell his story's 😅
Sounds like he's worked hard for the fight, but hopefully all the physical conditioning didn't dull his fight skills.
Tony's clear mood swings are very clear
Im scared for Tony he’s rambling and doesn’t seem right … oh right that’s another Wednesday for Tony
Let's go Tony. Please fucking win.
Bro, Tony is CARAAAZY
Man this card is soooooo wild but don't forget we Muslims own this sport
Dam, Tony sounds like Gogins at times here...lol
How you gonna get the description in the video wrong? UFC 296 not 294.
Tony might make the best ketchup sandwich we've ever seen this Saturday. Paddy ketchup with 25lbs of saturated fats.
tony please just retire
No tony, youre not.
xD
only if tony didnt cut weight twice in one month and said not to fight with justin damn he could be still top
Chuck Norris asks Tony for advice.
Loses every fight he gets yet they still let him fight. 😂
Man I hope he wins
Im in a good mood guys
Hold on Brother 😂🤣
Did he say cuck that kid?
Diego Sanchez Junior junior
Paddy's gonna win
his face already looks like a minced up burger
He's very clearly mentally Ill
Love Tony but he is past his time. Hate seeing these older guys becoming stepping stones for the younger guy coming up
Tony is the type of guy to interview the interviewers 😂
Respect what he’s achieved in the past but man, I’d avoid getting into a conversation with him like the plague. If we’re gonna be mad at that ref for not saving Bobby Greene from unnecessary damage when he was incapable of intelligently defending himself the other week, then we should be equally mad at the UFC for offering the sad old corpse of Tony more fights. He ain’t intelligently doing shit.
It's TONY TIMEEEEE!!!!!!
Good to see you back, Tony!
Okay this guys needs help. I genuinely feel bad for him.
Tony is still a monster. Paddy is young and strong but I don’t know if he truly knows how crazy Tony is. He is always dangerous. Hope it’s a battle.
Tony buys shin pads for his kids for  christmas   And starts kicking presents around while wrapped still
to much bullshit, he just done and need to accept the reality 😂😂 of course he good fighter but their prime has done after fight with gaetjhe
Talks a lot of talk ... i dont really believe there is much future for tony ferguson .
The Baddy by submission. Come back here when it's done guys.
Tony is the type of guy to wrap his fight skills and give them to his kids for a Christmas gift.
CSO
This mans broken.
This guy hasn’t won a fight in years why still so much hype?
BKFC or PFL after this fight for Tony
Tony: Im so happy  Also Tony: Im not here to have fun  😂
I really hope he does well. Even when he lost it with his family he wasn't violent towards them. He's genuinely a good guy, just some real mental health issues.
Tony the type of guy to buy a case of water and set it free in a lake somewhere
Tony is the type of guy to record the cameraman.
Lets go Tony !!
Nothing but love and respect for Tony...real man who question himself every day..
Paddy is gunna spank Tony trust me
👀googins in his camp .. paddy is getting grinded on we’re going to see Tony take down pats in go primal
Come on Tony kick Paddy's ass. From a fellow Brit. Your an OG. LFG
Paddy gone Retire Tony!
Poor Tony this is quite sad to watch. Walking contradiction and trying to find reasons to keep going while the reality is his body is far too damaged.
At this point I don't even think Tony knows what he's talking about 😂
Fair play to toney ferguson considering his metal health problems .
OK Tony.
Tony will drag him to deep waters. But he really needs to apply his bbj
No matter what Tony is a badass! Total respect...
Damn! A Goggins Hell Camp really takes it's toll on a dude!! 😮😅
Tony is the type of guy that contradicts himself in the next sentence.
David Goggins
IS THIS GUY OKAY??? WHY R THEY LETTING THIS GUY TO FIGHT
"Im gonna make his face a ketchup sandwich" is what i tell my kid.
Tony's such a delusional cringe if he loses again Dana needs to make him retire his delusion is gonna get him hurt 🤦‍♂️
Hopefully paddy finishes dudes career, he been a great fighter but boy does he talk some shit
7:56 😂
I think he and Steven Seagal should get together a write a movie
tony ferguson and khabib era was awesome and time to live. cant believe it passed
braindamaged as always
He spent a year in the hyperbolic time chamber with David Goggins
Tony’s not doing well mentally
Tony is about to be the first human in history to ankle pick Father Time and tell him hold on brotha, I’m not done yet.
Best of luck to Tony. I'd love for him to get a win over Paddy.
Tony is forever goated
“That’s classified” 😂😂😂😂😂
Tony is the type of guy who interviews himself and refuses to answer his own questions.
Tony is the the type of guy to ride his helmet without his bicycle.
Tony is clearly a very mentally scattered guy. Not sure if its the damage or just his personality, but it's difficult to really know what he's going on about most of the time
I think tony is in for a shock sat nite i hope not but a gut feeling says hes in trouble from paddy p
Tony will kick paddy’s legs shin to shin he will test that conditioning
If he wins please quit. If he losses please quit. Always Legend.
I hope Tony whoops his ass
Tony “the eggs are in the barn brother” Ferguson
I hope we see a more technical and disciplined Tony
Oooooooo Paaaaaddy the Baaaaaaaaadie !
fully supporting Tony on Saturday! I hope he really manages to get back to the place he was before and that his self-confidence gets the things done.
The best
Damn Tony sounds more like Tito than ever. Definitely don't need to be fighting
Buddy trained with David Goggins and became a motivational speaker 😂
Hope my boy tony wins
i just want to see tony celebrate after fight with coach brock and david goggins
Boy gets hit by a car and his Father rushes him to the ER at the hospital.  Dad: "Help! I need help! My Son just got hit.."  Dr. Tony Ferguson: "HOLD UP BROTHA I'M TALKIN!"
Tony’s the first A.I fighter.
Nothing but respect for this OG in MMA!!❤ 😘
Tony the type of guy to lose 12 in a row to equal his winning streak an test his mental toughness 🥷 😎 🍺🏨😢🍕🏆👀👻🏋️‍♀️🐕💍cso
Ahhh, he's a phone flipper!
So cheesy
He let Nate Diaz win that fight. It was weird.
Something an old dude would say lol
Tony is going smash Paddy up so much… after Tony does it, can’t wait to hear Paddy excuses 🤣🤣
Extraterrestrials finally make first contact with humanity.  Alien: "We..."  Tony Ferguson: "HOLD UP BROTHA I'M TALKIN!"
5:05 😂😂😂 TF, Legend!
Tony get help bro
😜😁👍
6:00 I needed to get to where it needed was?
Tony was in a good mood until the first question.
I put $100 on Tony since the Justin fight. This will be the one time I don’t and watch him win. Break the curse
Justin gaethje ruined this man. He should be checked for mental stability.
Wow, he is in a really bad condition. Feel sorry for him.
So annoying
I love el cucuy.. hope he smashes paddy soo baddy..😂
When this guy talks all i can think is “ Tell another jackal story”
Tony International mate its classified
Tony gets this one done! Bet the FARM!
A Tony interview is like listening to something in a foreign language and you know a few words but can't quite piece the whole sentence together.
Tony “TITO” Ferguson…..What the fuck is he talking about. CTE IS REAL FOLKS
Really hope he's still the type of guy to be able to smash Paddy 😢
The charles bronson of mma
Read between the lines, he’s already lost, he’s done.
Would love to see Nate Diaz interview Tony
Tony really went "Hould out im talking brother" one more time
I think tony has some brain damage (not to be a hater, just honestly think that)
Its painful listening to him rambling
Tony the type of guy to alway flip his chair around when he Interviews
His future is going to involve alot of interactions with the local Police Department.  He's the type to barricade himself in his home and have a standoff with Police after a domestic. Don't see him making his remaining days easy for himself. Ever since that kick to the face that made him look like a character in a Gorillaz music video.🦿🦵🦶🦍
Tonys the type of guy that will go build the octagon with only hand tools right b4 the fight and tell paddy good luck and then go to the medics GET READY.. get em El CuCuy..
We all have options, whether they are right or wrong but Tony is super experienced Paddy. No need for the foul talk, just scrap it out and we'll see.....
Imma get a Tony Ferguson quote tattooed on me when he retires what’s everyone’s favorite ? Mines “ goats sink im a boat best of all time “
C’mon Tony!!!
He said he was in a good mood and the says fcuk you I'm not here to be nice 😂 3:06
Seems like a big Cope. Learnt the word alliupe recently too. He sounds mad, I sort of want him to win because it sounds like he's nearly broken
He is like 50 😢
Paddy has to fight a fully grown man this weekend it looks like it would hurt to punch him he’s solid made of granite
People acting like him losing to the top best LWs in the world who are all championship level fighters makes him washed litterally everyone besides Bobby and Darius’s held a world title and Nate diaz was on short notice at higher weight when was the last time Tony actually lost to someone who wasn’t well rounded established veteran? It hasn’t happened
Tony is a type of guy who says “you don’t know me son” to David Goggins
Tony, being able to make the cod hitmarker with his hand, is next level of human evolution
Bro is one bottle away from brains on the wall
He is a GTA Charat
I'm English but I hope Tony demolishes Paddy the fanny
he's gotten older and his face has changed after Chandler kicked his face into Tommy Lee Jones
Not here to have fun and make friends, well it it did look that way when he came in smiling having fun with his camera and making friends with the reporters.
Cheif goggins that’s awesome
Legend. He reminds me of like a real life Trailer park boys character mixed with neo from the matrix
Love the respect his giving goggins. Watch a lot of goggins motivation videos, truly helps
The bad thing about this fight is that tony will make a mediocre fighter like Paddy the Fatty look good!  Also, Tony really is coo coo for coco puffs! 😂
Got to love Tony
This is the best Tony interview ever. The struggles he is going threw is real
I hope dana is not using tony to hype paddy, hoping tony gets smoked. The whole world hopes tony wins
This sadly will be Tony's retirement fight i hope paddy doesn't knock him out it will be really sad
fucking hell, here comes the maniac.
Great last press conference Tony, right on dude
Whats mental health? Watch this
Tony has me dying
I like Tony feeling good
Tony was already a damn tough SOB, but NOW? After Goggins had him, OHHHHHHH sheeet for the Padster! Better ready for a different kind of monster, let's hope we see the old Tony we all love in that cage, the one with his hand raised at the end.
Hold on brother, I‘m talking
This tony is back for another lose
Legend
Love how Tony always flips the chair around 🙏🏻
Tony the type to block everyone on I.g  just so he can be the only one to like and comment ☠️
Tony is the type of guy that peels a knife with an apple.
this gonna be a good win for Tony man
Tony - I hope I answered your question   Everyone -
Cte ?
Tony is like a guard dog by the door will never leave ufc gates! Shame
We will still luv you T no matter what.  You are legit one of the physically toughest men on the planet and you will always get that respect.
Bro sounds like he watched 30 min of his own edits before this fight😂
Tony the type of guy to maintain an erection the entire press conference
Tony the kinda guy to start a sentence in a good mood and finish it in cold blooded anger.
A great gladiator always wins the crowd first, then the battle. He seems like he's against everyone now, even the fans. You can see he has passed his prime. Also, the Paddy fight can be an easy win for a pro. This would not prove that he is great, just to stroke he already has-been ego. Good luck during the fight Tony! I hope you finally retire and get your issues worked out.
Bro wtf is he talking about
I feel like this is a young, annoying kid who we’d all like to see get handled against an aging veteran who we are all concerned for
Paddy losing this fight will actually do his fan rep a favour
It’s getting a bit cringe how he makes sure he gets all his classic quotes in to every interview.
We love you Tony
He’s kidding himself, talking shit more than anyone else, old man, paddy will choke him out in the first round
Come on Tony!!
This dude is clearly not right
The best audio in the game
Tony man nothing wrong with retirement
we're all rooting for tony 💪
Paddy is getting taken to a place he has never been before even if he gets the win he’s gonna work for it
why isnt he trainig on his punches and defence? He got KOed straight the last 6 times. For what you need Mr. Hell week? If it is for getting him up again Mentaly stable, then i understand him.
They crazy to let him fight
You’re all the type of guys to bandwagon a comment section because you’re followers in life.
Tony CTE Ferguson
Tonys the type of guy to offer Paddy a rematch before the fight 😅
Tony the type of guy to sit the wrong way on a chair
I think he's broken and too stupid to realise it.
Brain damage 101
And the crowd goes wild. Cte. Cte. Cte.
Im like devastated that Ian Garry pulled out. I wanted this press conference soooo bad. Almost as much as the fight itself i think. That dudes career is over 😂😂😂😂
tony the type of guy to buy a can of monster and put it under the bed and tell his kids theres a monster under the bed
I’m rooting for Tony he’s always been good to watch
How about every SEAL that did BUDs , that’s the other people on the world that can and did do that
Imagine walking into a examining room at a hospital with a minor problem and your doctor is Tony Ferguson
That opening 😅😅😅 When your boy with the drug, drink and stripper addiction turns up at the stag do…
Tony is the type of guy who lays his own eggs
Tony, the type of guy to go to a drive through and order a ketchup sandwich
Tony is going to kill paddy who tf made this match happen
Hope Tony does exactly what he says to Paddy the pig.
God bless you Tony! Good luck  this weekend! We love you !
If this is the last ride in the UFC then thank you for the memories Tony, and let’s have Tony time just one more time 🫡❤️
Old school Tony gona change this lads face. Hope he shows up as the young Tony
Really hope there’s no CTE
In his Prime he Will beat Kabib and choke the fuck out Conor.... ... ...if you are a hardcore fan you must love Mr Ferguson
This really put smile on my face
Its crazy how he says nobody on earth could go through his hell week 🤣🤣  How about all the Marines who go through actual "Hell Week"  Good one 👍
@20:22 “I’m washed up” 😂😂😂
He’s a lil nuts, but he’s game 😂
Khabib living rent free in these fighters heads. Tony talking like he would've won if he fought khabib at the time instead of going on a losing streak is comical.
Paddy is scared of after listening to this bizarre interview
As always, word salad from a dim guy talking like he thinks a cool guy would talk. Just let the dude fight -- microphones aren't for everyone
Tony  the type of guy to do a eulogy at his own funeral.
I wonder if he was talking bout khabib lol
it just shows you how personality will win you fans ..always entertaining ...I'm a hit man ..Go Tony!
Tony „Selfquestioned“ Ferguson
Please win Tony
TONYs BACK MAN!!! Wooohooo!!!
"...I'm gunna cut this kid..." love Tony man!!! Bogeyman is back bitches 😂😂let's go Tony u have it in you mate💪🫶
I don’t buy what Tony is saying. I think he’s going to be KO’d by Paddy.  Then he’s going to think about the hell week he went through and how even that couldn’t give him the win and he’s going to retire.
lol 10:48
Love him or hate him, hes at every presser, big smile on his face, enjoying life… gotta give it to him, he takes the decline better than just about any fighter ever across combat
Wish Tony could’ve got a fight that he could actually win ngl normally it’s good to see a man’s confidence but with Tony for me it jus feels like hes physically not there no more and he’s jus gunna go in there an get finished again
Tony the type of dude to fight at 170 and weight in 155 😂😂
Tony is mentally deranged
Tony goin to loose for sure he talk to much more then my ex bitch
19:24 😂😂😂😂
Just retire pal
I love this guy!  It’s great to see him in good spirits and enjoying life.  I hope he absolutely destroys Paddy and I’m English 😂
He speaks very well ,unlike dumb Coalby shovington
Tony out here with the Boats and the Logs!
Rooting for Tony!
I would have had a heck more belief in Tony if he had went to Thailand for this camp or spent the time with a legit camp.
7:56
Tony wins this one.
💬💬☠️🤡👺👻👽🤖🙉🙈😎🤯🥳🥸🥺🥺🥺🥸🥸🥸
Tony’s smile is back!  He has that fire again, he drops Paddy in the first, after he bloodies is face.  Go Tony !  You’re an inspiration bro!
This clown has no shame 😂he is a Loosseerr 😂a chicken boy 🤣
Goggins is a bad inflluence; yet Tony, bro, Love You. Cake walk this upstart. Ankle Pick the scouser back to the mid to low productive rice field.
What a strange thing Tony is and I love it 👌
They both got good jui jitsu. And tonys striking has been historically better. Will youth play a factor? Will paddy crumble under the pressure?  I think tony on a good night smashes paddy. But does paddy smash tony when tonys on a  bad night?
“Everybody say what’s up” 😢
Is tony on drugs or something? I wish him the best but SMH!
Imagine a conversation between Tony and Stipe!
I feel like everybody knows the elephant In the room when Tony answers, questions is stop lying to yourself. It is cringey the way you answer questions.. He better beat Patty pimlet. Because this is the way he talks every single time before his last six losses. And then after camp he says well this is a problem. This was a problem and this is what I need to change., And I'm still going to fight for the title. I hope you stop lying to yourself, That's where all that anger comes out of Tony stop lying to yourself. That's where all your anger comes out of..
He’s showing his age now love Tony he’s a absolute legend but I think paddy will have this it’s just my opinion I think this is the last of Tony Ferguson ❤
He talks so much crap. Backed it up 5-6 years ago 😂, not now
Tony’s the type of guy who says he’s having fun after saying he’s not here to have fun
People forget how close paddys last fight was against that guy.. many thought he lost.. Tony has been and can be a beast still. Lets see.
I so desperately want Tony to win this. That would be the perfect swansong if he were to simply win and then retire. Problem is, even if he can win, he's gonna carry on fighting. That will inevitably mean further losses. I love the guy but his talk doesn't translate to the fight any more. The game has changed and he doesn't seem to have it in him anymore.
Tony is washed and paddy aint that good but will still win
Tony is a badman 😎 🇬🇧
It's official --- Tony has schizophrenia
Old man gunna take another L
Talking such bullshit, Gaethje whooped you mate you didnt let him hit you
Dudes an absolute nut case. He clearly can't afford to be hit n the head anymore.
Tony’s career is like his hair line lol it’s from way back in the day 😂
I love tony man if he loses I’m not watching mma
He should move up in weight ASAP
Can't wait to see tony carry paddy like a boat
😴
David Goggins "chief" 1st time 💔😆
Legend
Guys lost the plot ffs , doo lally !!
Haha Tony is straight up bonkers
David Goggins "Chief" @ 3:07 💔😆
He doesnt seem to be in a very good place mentally..
Tony is the type of a guy to work on skills he’s good at but ignore obvious areas where he needs improvement.
Imagine going to have surgery and el cucuy walks in
Tony is the type of guy to stink out the shitter and then complain that it stinks.
My view has always been that Tony isn’t the greatest fighter. He has always had a screw loose and trained in really weird ways. But he was an athlete, fast and very coordinated, and his insane cardio together with his craziness/strong mentality meant he could break opponents mentally. With age his athleticism is gone and he can’t do what he used to do. What’s left isn’t top 10 anymore.
Such a big ego for someone whos had the worst ass whooping in ufc history at the end of his career
CTE with a microphone.
Tony Ferguson, Thank you , We Love you regardless of anything,, I wish you a good luck brother
Yall thought tony had his prime already but hes really entering a new power creep
Hulk smash welcome come back Sir
“I’m not here to have fun”  “I’m smiling, I’m having fun”  Tony is straight up crazy
Such a good video🔥
Certainly talking a good game
Fight game is brutal and father time is undefeated…especially at these lower weight classes where you need that speed to compete with the hungry young fighters! I pray Tony somehow pulls this off but you can see from his recent fights that he kind of looks lost out there after the first round, mma gods please one last time let tony win😅
Please MMA God, it's me again. I just want to see Tony win and retire please.
I wanted tony to win before I seen this, I hope paddy puts him to sleep now
"hold on brother im talking"
Would you rather a ketchup sandwich or a mc nugget ??
If God is real, he will help Tony this Saturday
Tony's something else man 😂😂😂 protect this man at all costs.
ketchup sandwhich is scary AF
Going to get humbled Tony be careful with your attitude 😊
Seeing Tony just makes me sad...I really hope he wins this one.
Please bring el cucuy please whoop paddy's ass
Go Tony!!!!
Vulnerability or cte. Hope tony enjoys retirement whenever it comes.
Gotta love this weirdo!!! Good luck Saturday hope you beat paddy’s ass!!!
Word of the day  ALLYOOOP
tony should skip press conferences in future
Respect
The BOAT 👑
He’s going to get beat up unless paddy decides not to try
Tony.. it's 'the end' boys.
As an Englishman i really hope yoy do it Tony
Paddy's gunna bang out this washed up bum!
Paddy cakes 😂😂
People need to think twice about how they behave themselves when they're wearing a cross around their neck. I'm pulling for Tony but if you're going to claim to be a Christian you better act like one in every aspect possible. Hallelujah to the Lamb of God
that man's a complete walking contradiction.. I really do wish him well though.
7:56 😂
Please just beat Paddy. PLEASE. Then retire.
Tony's the of guy to train 140 hours a week with David Goggins and gas out in the 2nd round
Im in a good mood today!  2 mins later, F you! Im not here to be nice! Tony has just lost the plot.... 😂
Tony a fucking true champion , love you !you men destroy the opponent! I believe in you!
Like Gaethe turned yours
Wow he’s annoying
Paddy had better have learned to get his hands up and chin tucked in , as he has holes the top ten will eat up !
Rip tony
I was waiting for hold on brother am talking this whole week
tony doesnt look good he has that cancer ill ness look like the life has been sucked out of him. he needs to retire he aint winning this fight.
Ramblings off a mad man
Walking contradiction right there folks
"Thats classified" i fuckin love tony 😂
Look paddy a good kid still cld hv a gd career Tony needs this win n let no be kidded paddy smashes him then u start thinking mby he taking shit serious now. He said he's stopped the eating between fights. Either way both fighters be fine in life
Tony is the type of guy to beat Khabib. How long must we wait
Hold on brother I'm talking!!!
🥱
Tony is really delusional. He need to wake up and smell the coffee. He is old, washed up. If he realizes that then maybe he could make the adjustment to win 1 fight and retire. But this dude thinks that movies should be made about him. Crazy washed up fool.
Tony pleeeeeeaaaase win.
Wow he’s so motivated… Paddy R3 by TKO
respect to tony i hope he wins this. seems to mean a lot to him
The CTE started hitting at 12 minutes
The universe did Tony a big solid favor, Khabib would have taken his soul, he can't even mention his name!  #Til This Day!
He cant walk away from the sport, might be the next Jason Miller
I'm not a religious person but please for the love of fucking god, give us the old tony back this time.
Gotta love Tony and all the ups n downs! Love to see him beat paddy! Good luck Tony
Tony Ferguson is the yype of guy to do a month long Hell Week in 3 days.
Come on Tony. Smash Paddy. And that’s coming from a scouser in the UK.
His answers sound choreographed and cringe, tbh..... All the "chief" talk and all that bs..... Tony didn't need cardio and mental strength, he needed the technical aspects of MMA, boxing/defence, checking kicks, etc.... Paddy should be easy now... Right,  Master Chief SIR!!!!!!!  In all seriousness Paddy is one of the easiest fights for him, he's coming off a 6 fight L streak, this is a winnable fight for him!!! Good Luck Bud, hope he pulls it off for his own mental health post fight!!
Tony sounds very confident in this interview.
That's cute, Paddy by unanimous decision
This is gonna be a sad fight for Tony 😔
"Hold on brother i'm talking"
Unstable guy
Pov: paddy kos tony round one "hold on brother im crying
Tony - Ask me a fucking question!!!! Ask me mother fucker..... Reporter - What kee Tony - HOLD ON BROTHER I'M TALKING!
He looks like a Rabbit 🐇. What a fool ! This will be his last fight and he will get out through the UFC’s small window.
SUNGLASSES 😂😂
For me Tony is in my top 5 UFC fighter's of all time, i like paddy but i think he is going to get a wake up call from this fight.
This guy is going to be a cautionary tale
Always have, always will pick Tony 👊.
Tony please retired please 😢😢😢 we love you but you have to go to take good care of your health
CTE is nasty
Tony is going through a mid life crisis right now. It’s easy to see he’s not really telling us what motivates him it’s him telling himself this to try and mentally be strong.
Paddy's a good fighter I'm a fan but I hope Tony wins just because it's Tony 🏆
No matter how many times Tony loses, he always makes me think he figured something out and he'll win the next 😂
Anyone concerned with Tony's cardio hasn't watched him through his career.  One of Ferguson's strengths is his unstoppable cardio and will to win.  I ran cross country as a kid...  some people are just on a different level...  Tony is gifted with elite endurance.  Patty better be ready for those cold... deep waters!  PLEASE LET PATTY BE HUMBLED!!!!
This man's mind has gone. So rude and delusional. Thinks everyone is against him. Pathetic.
I wanted Paddy to lose for him to progress and improve.
I just hope he wins this fight, spectacularly (& I'm a brit), & then sails off into retirement ! He's taken far too much damage to be going on beyond this fight ........should have walked away a coupe of fights ago in all honesty !
This guy has definitely been punched couple times to many! thankfully he’s not fighting top ten anymore! pattys the perfect match up!!
What was he talking about all this time?
I’m sorry but this dude isn’t very smart or mentally stable
Alley oop
I want Tony to win so badly 🥲
Hee sounded and felt good. Good blles you Tony
Yea Tony has to retire now, dude is clearly not well!! not to mention he looks like he aged 15 years since his last fight
Tony is the type of guy to beat up his bed for not making him sleepy
Talk about a must win fuck plz tony don’t be the first ufc fighter to die in there
When Tony is meant to win he loses and loses and loses again . And now that everyone thinks he will lose , he will win to piss u off xd
Tony- paddy blocked me on instagram Also Tony- I blocked him on instagram
Tony the type of guy to have a Harvard business degree and never use it
Please tony one more win
Tony the type of guy to go onna 6 fight losing streak just to lul paddycakes into a false sense if securityy prediction is a tko finish via elbows
goggins😆
God I want Tony to win so bad but if he loses again I don’t ever want to hear from him again just be talking to fucking talk holly shit
U had a whack crowd. WE STILL LOVE YOU EL CUCUOY
gunna be on a 7 fight loosing streak after this weekend, the guy has lost it. needs to just be handed his papers and move on. guy got subbed by green and diaz but is still on khabibs nutts. got ko'ed by chandler and just destroyed by highlight but thinks he'll beat Connor. last fight he won was because he hit cowboy after the bell.  his 12 win streak was handed to him, he beat a bunch of low rank guys. hes a gatekeeper and thats all he ever was.
Bipolar this lad strange man
This is the worst shit talk ive seen in a while
It's so weird to think how different Tony's career would be if he had knocked down Gaethje 10 seconds earlier and finished him
"Stay hard!"
Tony, is the type of guy that licks his finger when turning a page on a kindle.
Walking brain damage. Sad.
WIN OR LOSE TONY IS STILL MY FAV FIGHTER
beast
The only way Tony makes any sort of resurgence is if he starts doing roids. Paddy finishes Ferguson, unfortunately.
Bro didn't had to run until he puked blood today. He's happy af       PS: I have videos
He's had a great career but should retire if beaten by Pimblet, go before your pushed.
Tony has been gun shy like a mofo since  Justin and Micheal. Hopefully, he's lost that. He can't turn away from the fire. He has to face it. He's been afraid of the smoke. He turn his back to his opponent now scared to get hit. Timid.
Everyone gather round he’s gonna say it again!  “Hold on brother I’m talking”  *Everyone Cheers*
Gonna be a sink or swim fight for paddy
Tony is the type of guy to smoke cigarettes to condition his lungs..
This could be a banger
Can hear him blaming goggins fault if he loses. Love Tony but never seems to be his fault IMO
all talk no walk
I don't want to alarm anyone, but I think Tony might be crazy...
Everyone is talking like Tony has changed or done something different.. he sounds like he always has. Ranting about this or that. Talking about ninja turtles "which ones your favorite?" Yada yada yada. Seriously listen to him during any fight week in his last 4 fights he sounds just like this. Acting like he had to go change everything and "go back to the drawing board".. "all the hay is in the barn".. yeah yeah... The guy just sounds the same to me as always. Until I see a difference I don't believe it. We will see during the fight if he still wants to be there. And I still personally believe that he didn't even actually go to sleep when Bobby Green was choking him.. and yeah I know people can still move and clinch up when passed out but he wasn't choked unconscious .. it's obvious to me. He just quit.. I think he just got caught in his mindset of lay there and let the submission hold like he did with Charles and the other sub he was in I forgot which one where he just stayed there in it not even trying to get out.. yeah you can call it tough and it is but he just sat there instead of trying to get out. The ref should have stopped it during that arm bare Charles had him him to protect the fighter.. you can be tough all you want but if your not actively protecting yourself the fight should be stopped even if it's strikes or subs. If your getting hurt and not trying to do anything to stop it or if you just can't stop it then the ref should stop it..
Oh boy.  He is so back ! lol  don't recall ever seeing him like this.   He got the aura of a insanely goal oriented guy.  You can feel the danger as he is talking.   Love those moments
He is gonna get is ass kicked
Tony has always been very slow in the ring I think paddy will come in too fast for Tony
He needs to get a proper nutritionist and pack on the pounds not lose it. Cardio was never an issue, Goggins just making him fitter.
Tony is so mentally ill that it makes everyone in the room uncomfortable
When was Tony nice? Lol 😂
Tony talks alot, I still don't think he will perform good
Mike Perry vs Tony Ferguson in bare knuckles is the fight we need
That guy is absolutely piping
Hope he fucks paddy up
Tony is the type of guy to break himself just so he can put himself back together .
Wishing this guy nothing but the best
Tony's the type of guy to knock a Scouser out.
Tony’s back!!!!
I can't get over those moments of him thinking the everybody is scared of him "Fuck, it's Tony! Let's be quiet".  No, Tony. They were quiet because there was no one there. Relax.
He looks ready 🦾
I get scared for these fighters who’ve been in the game for a significant time. I get scared for their health, and what the long term consequences are going to be for them. He’s been in wars….absolutely mf wars and he still has desire, ambition and passion to continue and improve. I honestly don’t know whether I admire it or am horrified by it. But I absolutely respect him. I’m anxious to see whether what he’s put himself through pays off on Saturday. Is he a genius or completely mad?  We’ll see.
is that Tony or Schizo tony?
I like Tony I'm hoping he gets the win against the born again beetle
Ughh tony gonna get pieced up from a young hungry paddy
I really like what Im hearing from Tony. Hope he destroys paddy n really boosts his confidence
Can’t tell if it’s because I’m blazed but my audio fell out of sync with the video at the end 🤣🥲  Love some tFERG though
Tonys time is over. After all the defeats, he should just retire. Sad to see him loosing
lets go tony !
I hope you beat him Tony I really do but …….
TONY TONY TONY. GOD BE ON HIS SIDE. PLEASEE
You did save us in the pandemic with that great fight bro.
Lets go tony✊️
CALL ME DANA , IM GOAT MATCHMAKER, I WILL TAKEOVER FOR YOU, I UNDERSTAND ITS EXHAUSTING, I LOVE IT
Paddy is gonna get mauled
CONOR NEEDS GUYS TO STEP UP, NOBODY IS DOING NOTHING, BUNCH OF BUMZ, NOBODY WANT TO MAKE MONEY, ALL SELFISH PRICKS NO LONGTERM THINKING
Tony is the type of fucking guy to use the word fuck every fucking other fucking word.
Tony the type of guy that if he wasn't here, he'd be somewhere else!! 💯🤣
CTE Tony will always be hilarious, but in reality he's absolutely fuked in life, hopefully he won't have any crazy illness
Eh GOOD LUCK TO HIM HES A GOOD DUDE AND PROPER WARRIOR 💯 TOUGH MF HIM
Tony is the type of guy to tell you that the answer you seek is classified and immediately continue and give it to you.
5:10 Ahahahahahahaha
bummer intro people should bee excited ey cuy cuyie, og legend
Most of Pimplett camp is just losing weight and Ferguson has been training with Goggin's. His conditioning must be next level
YOUR NOT DANGEROUS TONY , YOU DONT EVEN UNDERSTAND YOURSELF HOMIE
Old man Tony needs to retire, he is becoming a complete joke. Paddy will embarrass him
Luque says talking about family is crossing the line. So Garry talking about Magy kids crossed the line.
Tony the type of guy that still smoking spice.
Tony Is a loser, hes an overated fighter, when he came amongst the big boys he was exposed
Tony looks real old dawg
LETS SEE IF BELAL TAKES THE FIGHT DANA , I RESPECT RAMA BUT HES BEEN TALKING TO MUCH SHIT , HES CONVERTED, REAL MMA FANS KNOW SHOW UP  BELAL TAKE THE FIGHT
Tony is "the last of the Mohicans"
Tony’s the type of guy who asks the Referee is ‘he’s ready ???
Tony is going full WWE sometimes I love it 😂😂
Tony will alleyoop anyone anytime anywhere 😂
Alga Shavkat✊️🇰🇿🇰🇿🇰🇿🇰🇿
I cannot wait until David Goggins actually has one professional fight. We will see how much his heart carries him through when he's unhealthy. Lacking strength tired against a professional elite fighter. You can't pull your gun out, You will not win you will be defeated. You and your mind will be buried.
UFC 300 CONOR VS CHADLER, GARRY VS BELAL, DILLON DANIS VS SEAN BRADY, FILL THE REST OF THE CARD THEN COME TALK TO ME
Seven fifty one tony replies with a question when the other guy responds he said Hold on I am talking. All this cringe I am Going for tony but the way he keeps acting crazy and like a total @$$%le, I hate patty so i'm stuck between A man who thought his wife was a witch and had charges against him to a man who is still acting out of control live in public. Let's go, Tony. I hope you win for your own mental health.
This dude is cringe... This man in person, would suck... Man's an entertaining fighters but as a person, wack.
Best idea ever atheletes cross training with atheletes from different sports, I think Ferguson wins this!!!
BETTING WISE, HUMAN WISE TONY IS THE GOAT , BUT HE CANT ITS AN ALL IN.
Yo this is intense
Absolute wetwipe of a man 😂
Damn I thought Goggins would convince Tony to shave his head.
Tony seems like the type to wear sunglasses as night.
DONT LEARN NOTHING
HES STILL PLAYING THE VICTIM , GUYS DONE
Six straight losses…
REASON I SAY THIS IS I USED TO BE THAT, I KNOW WERE HES AT, ALL IN ON PADDY
He definitely has been training with Goggins
Dudes definitely on the spectrum
No chance
Plz retire
LOCK OF THE CENTURY, TONY STILL PLAYING VICTIM, ALL IN ON PADDY, HE CANT CHANGE IT, VICTIM MENTALITY STILL IN HIS BRAIN, CALL DANA TELL HIM IM THE BEST MATCHMAKER ON THE PLANET
Poor Tony has gone 🍌🍌🍌
lol tomato face 🤣
Ian Garry is out
Tony better win, I can't stand paddy not so baddy England boy. Let's go USA
Paddy by KO round 1, Tony retires.
After this, only 4 fights to the belt. Its Tony time
"No hands...  Commands" reminds me of Jake LaMotta at the end of Raging Bull. "That's entertainment!"
Two types of people wear sunglasses indoors, old people and assholes.
Well, he certainly sounds like the Tony of old 😂! I hope he fights like it
Ferguson Goggins will be the next Sanchez Fabia
Tony is the type of guy that constantly loses 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Man I’m a Tony fan but he just needs to retire
Paddy gonna smash old wash up
A few guys have still fought well into their 40s, itl be sick if tony actually goes on another run of wins
Tony is the type of guy to train with goggins and call him chief
Tony has been an excellent fighter over these years and grateful I had the chance to watch him. As far as this fight goes, if one fighter can pull it off, it’s Tony.
Here before Tony knocks out Patty
I don't like pimblett,but Tony is done, he won't make it out of the first rd.
Tony has lost his damn mind ...
I'm sorry to say to all you fan boys, but he is a mess.. I think in order to be at the top level of your game you have to be mentally sound.. It's pretty obvious that he's not mentally sound.. I would say his worst trait is the lack of rationality.. And second worst would be he's extremely egotistical. This is what he gets wrapped up in his little speeches because it makes him feel important like he's talking to you as if you don't know these things in life and he is the almighty one with all the knowledge.. He's going to get smoked for the fifth time.
Gonna be sad when he’s snoring in the middle of the ring on Saturday. He looks so fucking old.
This guy is gonna get smashed 😂
Tony is the type of guy to let Patty beat him up so he can mount a come back and say "Champ-Shit" 200 times on Twatter.
His brain is cooked. It's over man. He's gonna have to die in there to understand that. But I hope he wins though. Just because fuck Paddy.
Tony should give up....we can see another sad up again... I don't wanna see this
I need paddy to sub this guy to sleep it’s over now
Tony's the type of guy to walk straight through a cage wall, then get confused as to why no one else can
I guess when you lose this much you become an even shiitter person
Watched Tony since the TUF days.. I thought he shoulda retired 4 fights ago.. even when he's doing good (Nate Diaz) it ends badly.. I'll always root for him and even if he gets a slim decision on this he should walk.
He sounds like an old guy reminicing hard. His mind is that of a 70 year old. Its unbelievable how washed he is, never been a fan, so its really easy to clearly see how whack he has become.
Tony is the type of guy to eat wagyu pork chops
It was good run Tony maybe he will do Bare knuckle next.
Love Tony
OG
Anybody else think tony back he seemed very on the ball man leeettsss gooooo
Paddy to win within the first round
One day you’re gonna buy a decent mic for these videos. I believe it.
Let it go bro you're to old
This is hard to watch. The brain damage has accumulated. He doesn’t even know what he’s saying anymore. Cringe …sad
After the head kick from Chandler and what it did to his face, I cannot accept that he wasn't permanently changed from it for the worse. He's living with psychosis now and no one's stopping him from getting even worse.
Whats a ketchup sandwhich
Ian is out of this card due to pneumonia. Wag move?
fuck he looks old...... Im so keen for him to knock Paddy the Fatty the fk out... I hope he does... but his body isn't what it use to be obviously ...
There is a reason why they call him "El Cucuy" man he is pure crazy person and the fighter . You either love him or hate him like a marmalade. I think he is a future Legend no matter what.
@10:47, that’s Tony Furgerson right there .
Can't wait to not see this guy no more
i hope Tony wins his next fight!🤞 He was so tough in his prime
Fcukme He can talk a glass eye to sleep Ferguson can ! He's fought some great fights in the past but that's exactly what it is im afraid ? The past ! Paddy's gonna retire him Saturday ! 👍🥊🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Come on Tony. Make this one of the best performances ever!
Tony is the type of guy to wake up in the middle of the night to brush his teeth
I came directly to the comment section and booooy it didn’t disappoint 😂😂
Dude is delusional. Ge's not ok ...
Tony aged 10 years in 1 year, I hope he retires after this fight.
We trust Tony wallahi we trust
Tony is still drawing people in...we are all waiting for a win!  Too much self hype...sounds like the drunk uncle who hasnt drank in 5 days....  Sorry Tony
Tony sucks man sad to see him keep going out there just to lose
Needs help. Faking it and ignoring his mental issues will be hes downfall, fighting wont help his problems.
I'm actually scared for paddy lmao
"I'm not here to have fun" also "I'm having fun here".
his 'good spirits' lasted all of 2 minutes. haha. Tony
Tony is Like the Dallas cowboys........I swear this year is the year 🏆
Tony is my Nikka --i love the dude he's nuts
Tony Is gonna get beat up by Paddy.
tired of tony he sucks he sucked for awhile not sure how he employed. I hate paddy but he will win tony has looked like shit the last 6 fights.  He doesnt move  the same. tony talks but he wont walk the walk.
Respect to David goggins getting trained by tony
He didn't record anything or even open his camera just held his phone up like he was recording then he locked his already locked screen which actually unlocked the screen then he turned it over as the screen lit up. The dude is gone he's running on pure act alone.
Reminds me of a buddy I know that's an alcoholic. He's so disturbed and uneasy in his mind. He gon lose this fight
Tony is the type to ask to train with David goggins and train him
Tony is getting knocked out, he doesn’t have to get broken or give up to lose
What’s an holly-oop he keeps talking about?
He's lost it... not only in the ring but in his head... definition of a psychopath.
Tony's the type of guy that wakes up at 4am and removes his sunglasses....only to reveal another pair of sunglasses underneath.
Tony , fighting is one on one. . At the end of day we all came in and will go OUT by ourselves.  But Tony , if you  preach about someone isn’t a team mate with you ! You telling ppl that  the guys ARe not your team mates .?  You have problems internally.  Even a REAL COACH WILL CLAIM HIS TEAM HAS TAUGHT HIM so much .  Smdh !!! I hope you win . Because if you don’t! You don’t  have a team for support!  The more you talk the more I hope you win.  Because. You ain’t just a coach.. you are loser. .
Think we’ll see the return of el cucuy on saturday. Paddy in for a torture session.
He looks way too skinny :/
Tony: "Im not here to have fun" Also Tony: "i'll answer your question, Im having fun, im smiling"
Tony the type of guy to beat himself up more than his opponents do
Still the best walk out song EVER!   We salute you , el Cucuy!!   💪💪
😢
I think tony has actual issues
Tony the type of guy to make himself a pb&j and whisper “it’s Tony time.”
Khabib said it
02:17 Tony - I’m not here to have fun, then minute 08:03 Tony be like - I’m smiling, I’m having fun.
I well miss these interview when all set and done
Man… he’s honestly lost his shit…
He looks terrible. So skinny. Does he not do any weight training?
Tony, please eat him.
This guy shouldn't be fighting ... this is getting cruel. No one wants to see a delusional old man getting his head kicked in
Comes our friendly then goes tough guy instantly
It's Tony time!!
El Cucuy: "hold on, brother. I'm talking" Journalist: "I'm apologize"  😂🤣🤣
Damn.... Just want to see you win.❤
At least lose on decision, dont gent choked or knockd
Tony the type of guy to put ketchup on his face just to turn himself into a ketchup sandwich.
Tony putting the chair backwards is CLASSIC Tony
Tony looks old
Got 400 on you, do me proud like the Tony of old.
He's still brain dead from Justin!!!
Dude is mental...
Come on Tony, please listen to your wife.
This dude is mentally unstable
Ferguson is washed up
Tony is still delusional 😢. Or being smart for self-promotion.
Tony the type of guy to alley-oop Ferguson.
Hold on brother I'm crying
Well Tony?! redemption time! lesshgooo!
I'm watching this interview, and I think Tony is the kind of guy who is WAY better in the cage than he is with a microphone in his hand...
Pls Tony keep it like this... I'm really happy for you and you look damn sharp ...💪🏻 GOD bless you Brother ...
The real king of cringe.
Tony's the type of guy to have a fight before his fight
Tony the type of guy to be at the top of his prime
Tony is starting to tell story's like tito
Love the vulnerability and authenticity of Tony. It’s been heartbreaking these last few years watching his fights but also motivating how determined and confident he is despite the “setbacks”. God is good.
He’s not gonna do anything.   It’s a joke they still let him fight and get beat up.
We all love you Tony! Praying for you to Win.
Honestly I hate to say this but paddy probably gonna win
I like how Tony is always happy at every fight week
Can’t bare him.
God damn I’m going to be so sad if Tony doesn’t pull this
what gets him up in the morning? breakfast? lol. i thought that was something paddy the fatty would say haha.
Awkward
Imagine Tony gets a new win streak and challenges Gaethje for the BMF
Tony would let a lion eat him just to give it gut cramps and be spat out
Tony can get knocked out 500 times by the same Person and still say he can fu** him up LOL
How many times have we heard this nonsense from this clown since his loss to Justin 🤣 “oh I’m better than last time, I’m faster, stronger than before” lol no you’re not you’re getting old, it’s what makes us human. Dudes delusional as f**k 🤣 not here to debate or argue. Don’t like what I have to say keep scrolling 🤷🏽‍♂️
Tony sounds dangerous
One last ride for Tony Ferguson!! Let's go Tony!
Why does this guy act like he's doing this shit for anyone but himself. You're not helping anyone but yourself mate. Keep virtue signalling. I remember supporting you when everyone in the comments hated on you. But the fame went to your head. And you became a clown.
Tony has an edge right now and I feel something has changed in him and a W is about to happen. There will be carnage I feel 😳🥊
Tony said alley-oop twice😅
Tony is the type of guy to have CTE
Tony is the type of guy with a prince Arthur
It's classified!😂 ohhhh Tony Tony Tony, we love you but my lord your most definitely one unique human being
This guy needs a ct scan asap lol he says the same shit every interview but get destroyed and he has zero respect for anyone. I’m calling a first round knock out or submission
Tomy is the type of guy to tell his watch what time it is.
Seems like he’s soaking everything in this is probably his last dance
Tony is the kind of guy that will go on a 10 fight losing streak just to find out who's with him at the end.
Tony the type of guy to keep wearing shades indoors even after they caused him to destroy his career by getting tangled up in an electrical cord, tripping and tearing/shattering his knee
Calling him Paddy Cakes is absolutely hilarious. 😂😂😂😂
Sounds dumber every time he interviews...
I see Tony going out with a bang, if he wins, I hope he retires, in good spirits, and with a victory. Nothing but love and respect for all the fights you've given us.
KETCHUP SAMICH.
Tony is the man. I hope he's overcome the mental aspect he's been facing in the ring since Gaethje. That seemed to break him. Go to war Tony, rooting for you.
Legend! 🫵😎
I got my money on Tony! He is gonna win with a bang!
I hope he doesn't fight as emotional as he is here
THIS is the Tony I was wanting to see, but I’m hoping he brings this energy to the octagon
Tony the type of guy to record the recorder recording him
Love Tony . He boutta get KO’d cold by paddy ): wonder where he goes after this
Paddy sleeps him 😂
Imma be real wit chu
Let’s go Tony you still got it in you brother
Will never not root for you tony.    Lets go get that win.
Tony the type of guy to retire Goggins.
Always so up and down never know what's coming out his mouth.
I actually have a feeling Tony is gonna win this one, and he looked happy at his last press conferences, and I don’t hate paddy I actually really like him, but it seems like Tony is hungry. He might get him.
Tony is the type of guy to make David Goggins do hell week
“Hold on brother im talking” 😂
Blades an Shades CSO
Ferguson : “I’m gonna turn his face into a ketchup sandwich” Paddy : '' mmmmmm sandwich''
Love you Tony hope you do what you have done to make us fans of you my boy👊
Bro got that dave googgins dont give AF vibe. Stay hard brother, you got this all day every day
Tony is the type of guy to make Ian Garry take his last name
Goggins watching like a proud dad I bet
Tony ferguson ali-oops himself
That "my breakfast" comment was pretty good lol
"FUCK YOUU" Tony Ferguson  2023😂😂
Tony thinks he's god
Tony Furguson is the type of guy to wear sunglasses at night because when you're Tony Ferguson,  the sun shines on you 24 hours a day!
Tony is the type of guy who eats ketchup sandwiches'
Tony dishing out alley-oops with his shades on.
This will be the beginning of a new tony era mark my words 💯  He seems to be at the right place
If oppositional defiant disorder was a person
Tony is not mentally right. Maybe he has CTE, he’s a warrior and he has been through many battles.
If it was 5 years ago nobody would doubt that Tony would have actually butchered Paddy. But now, its impossible. 😭
Tony is the type of guy to break his training partners rib because he made him do it
Please win Tony. 🏆
That was a lot of alleyoops
Tony is not what he used to be. I feel sad for the guy. He's got nothing to prove. His health is what he should be worried about.
Why is he so angry 😂
Tony go home and retire.  Your presence has become cringy and toxic
🥫 🥪
Paddy didn’t win his last fight! Steamroll him tony
Dude has been hit in the head way too many times!
I used to like Tony, I have respect for the grind and what he has done for the sport throughout the years. but this dude shut shut his mouth, there is a time to talk and a time to be humble. when you get knocked tf out and subbed by a guy who should be on paper way worse on the ground. 6 fights ago Tony could talk. Not now. and to you idiots who's gonna say " he would beat you, yada yada get in the cage ". Yes he would beat tf outta me. and yes ive been the cage. but this guy is washed, If you dont thnk that you are living in some other reality. Even if he beat Paddy, doesnt prove anything haha
He’s not fcking around anymore guys he’s back
Tony has to retire. He sustained too much damage throughout his career. Better take care of your health
I can see number 7 coming 😂
Ketchup sandwich......
Tony is completely insane and I'm here for it all. No same human trys to keep up with Goggins. I know 1 thing for sure he won't gas out.
tony is the new chuck norris
"Tony is the type of guy to tell you it's classified & then explain it"
Tony has the best media days 🔥
When he used to win his cringe talk was inspirational but now it just sounds stupid
Tony invented sunshades Aka sunglasses 🤣😂
I’m sooo disappointed watching Tony’s last fights. I just am done watching him get beat up. 🤕 it keeps getting worse every time and is hard to watch cause I really cared about him. Just sucks to see 😣
I think Tony Ferguson broke the record (NBA included) for most uses of the term "alley-oop" in a press conference.
Tony the type of guy to fight till his teeth starts sweating..
Tony might actually win this fight 😮 something about him man.
Mythical fighter unlocked: Tony Goggins
Cte
I really feel bad though there's clearly something wrong with the dudes mental state
Exhausting listening to him after 30 seconds 😂
Pretty standard tony bullshit. Hope I answered your question
Tony is different, that KH aib fight is going to haunt him for ever
Why nobody ask him if he regrets wearing shades indoor and tripping over cables in the tv studio, and therefore missing Khabib fight? Sunglasses Tony.
What a weird guy😂
*FOR HOODINI🗿🍷*
Go Tony. I like you
Kookoo
Gotta love this guy, in his prime he was scary
Hold on brother, I'm speaking 😂
tony looks like a phukin ewaaaaak   i dont know what an ewak is  but something with ears and what the phuk combined
Tony 'holdup brother I'm talking' Ferguson
Tony’s still fighting. I was hoping he would retire. He’s been a bloody punching bag for the last 4 to 5 fights.
Let's go Tony!
Tony could win this. Pimblett is the least dangerous of all the fighters Tony has lost to.
I have no medical degree and just assumptions but Tony really is kinda showing bipolar mood swings on these interviews, joking around and then going very serious given of course something triggers him. win or lose I wish him the best and I hope he retires happy and contended soon.
Go show us one last clean elbow Tony 😁 🫡
They dont know him son!
They need to give Tony the Connor fight. He’s payed his dues and deserves that money fight. It’s the fight that makes sense, both are past their primes, both were running over everybody during the same time period but never faught . It would be a competitive fight, would be a money fight because they are both huge names with huge fan bases, and it would be the fight that the fans want to see.
Tony is a Real WWE character, and I mean Real!
TBH Tony is looking in a good place.
This dude doesn’t know who he is!! Trying to sale himself every time! 8:53
Tony is officially Navy Seal fit....We with you 💯 War Tony 💯💯💯👊
i so hope he gets this win
Tony still a cringy weirdo. Never humble even after all the beatings. Never liked him. He’s going to be a punching bag again
I think that’s the happiest I’ve ever seen Tony, hopefully “happy” T Ferg becomes a mythical fighter come Saturday night.
He never need more cardio, he needed better defense and strike accuracy.
😂❤
Yep he does exhibit cte symptoms ie sudden mood swing s
Tony speaking so much sense it's confusing.
Tony is a washed up douche bag. I hope he gets a Paddy smashish!
Tony the type of guy to call an Uber then walk to his destination.
One thing is for sure! Paddy is not walking out of that Octagon clean  Tony will cut him
Story time with uncle Ferguson.
WAR EL CUCUY!!!!! Hes going to make Paddy quit on the stool for old times sake. Then hes gonna retire and we can cry in joy and happiness!
I honestly think he’s going to destroy Paddy.
Tony is the type of guy to guy a type if there ever was such a type of guy.
People keep saying Tony’s lost his mind…I don’t see evidence it was ever there, I just hope he’s okay and gets out soon
Justin disfigured this man..
Last Tony’s fight
Tony the type of guy to tell goggins u can't f with boat crew 2 !!!
Listen Tony, I understand you just wing it and say things but... So you're saying you'd never ever heard of this goggins guy before you hired him? Honestly that's the ballsiest thing I've ever heard. Ok so wait, you hired a guy you've never seen or heard of to be your head coach? But how did you know he even existed to begin with? Bro not gonna lie, I don't believe you and if I find out you actually did know of him before he became your life guru and coach... buddy... Imma revoke your library card, your hall pass and your trainer bras. You'd be in biiiig trouble buddy 💯💯
TONY FERGUSON........." THE TYPE OF GUY "
Really hope Tony drops this cuck
Dam, tony is looking like an old man. I wish we could just freeze time and watch these legend just fight in their prime forever.
He needs a W badly
Most delusional punchbag in the ufc 😂
These "Tony the type of guy" comments is why im here
Tony on that David Goggins energy
Tony’s the type of guy to wear sun glasses to bed
7:57 lmaoooo
fergusons jibberish is hard to watch and hear...retire already you sound foolish. Gaethje destroyed this guy,he fights scared ever since.
Tony is the type of guy to ask questions to the reporters
Man I believe it look at him vs chandler that 1st round he was clean I feel like his confidence was f upped
Tony asks the reporter what gets you up in the morning.   Reporter starts to answer.  Hold on brother I'm talking.  😂
tony doesnt have cte hes just psychologically f 'd up, i love that eddie bravo is his true friend, tony we love you bro get right for your kid
Tony got this on Saturday.  Can't wait to see these guys on Saturday
I believe in you Tony
Tony “ Ollie - Oop “ Ferguson
This guy is fully delusional
Tony is the type of guy to make Ian Garry "Machado" start onlyfans and become he's manager
Tony is the type of dude to burn the roof of his mouth with hot pockets on purpose.
Tony is the type if guy to give and get olley oops
tony is such a cool guy, i have a friend like him he overthinks way wayyyyy to much AKA paranoid... no need for it
Tony the type of guy to get a new team every fight week.
Tony has lost his last fights to fighters that are worlds above "paddy the baddy". He doesn't have the power to do what they have done. Maybe a wrestling finish, but if its standing, he will get taught a nice lesson.
Tony gave Goggins PTSD
Tony’s the type of guy to bring David Goggins in his corner and still say “hold on I’m talking brother”
*If Padded Record Pimblett wins we riot!*
*"He's STILL my boy!"*
Only crazy Tony can make Paddy look like the good guy in this one.  I started watching this video thinking I might cheer for Tony...now, I hope Paddy makes you wake up in a puddle of your own drool.  You're a piece of sh!t dude.  Worst of luck to you!
Tony was never the same person….let alone fighter after the last 2 minutes of the fight with Justin….Chandlers kick was just the icing on the cake! If anyone was meant to go out in the octagon….its him! RIP 🙏🏻 Tony
I’d pay soooo much money to watch Tony fight with the shades on 😂😎
Tony is the type of guy to go on a 7 loss streak
Tony said he's the most(or one of the most) mentally tough dudes to walk in that cage. He may have lost some fights but I would agree he is def one of the toughest. You literally have to hit his "Off" switch otherwise he's still coming regardless if you popped his joint out the socket, etc..
The problem with Tony is he is delusional.
A defensive Tony could be champ…..still😩
I think we all know Tony likely needs some help for CTE, but damn I like the guy. Just pure
He is going to hurt himself patting himself on the back
Tony is the type of guy to use that many words and say absolutely nothing
He looks different and acting diff in a good way
Tonys wife is either on the same level of fucked up as he is or shes living in hell everyday trying to understand what the fuck hes talking about
Paddy is going to destroy this guy lol all this hype for nothing
“I’ve said it before that’s classified”   Goes on to continue to tell you 😂  Hell yeah Tony Take this W
CooCoo-CooCoo
I bet his kids first words were fuck fuck dick of a man where I'm from you would be called a simple Simon
Tony is the type of guy to become a sniper shooting only with his elbows
Tony is the type of guy to still smile like his on a 20 fight win streak
Sounds like hes auditioning for his own movie
Lol fogging sounds like a fucking cult leader lol brain washed this guy
Tony says this shit every fight and he ends up fighting the same way
God bless Tony ❤
PADDY THE BADY GONA GET KNOCKED OUT
Tony is the type of guy to take Ian Garry's wife's boyfriends last name
How has the training helped you as a man as a father as a husband
Just watched Tony highlights, man hes so right the way he was seriously hurting dudes this is completely winnable I believe in tony
Tony is the type of guy to do a hell week with Chief Goggins the following Monday as a reward for victory, whilst others are rewarding themselves with a cheeseburger.....
He reminds me of Ken Shamrock. 😂😂😂😂
I wonder if this PPV is going to be remembered as the one where the old heads (Covington, Ferguson, Thompson) get smoked by the new class 😮
Tony, do me a favor BRO...... bust this Chicken Mcnugget up.  I looked on Draftkings and they didn't have odds for Ketchup Sandwich Face.   But do that anyway.  I want his post fight braggery to be incoherent from swollen lips and cracked teeth. He wants to retire TONY FREAKIN FERGUSON??  Retire him. Let him have that record. that fastest retirement from UFC at 28. Disrespectful MUTT.
The past five or six pressers Tony has explained how he was off and now he's back. REALLY hope its the case this time.
Tony 😢 i have a bad feeling about this
Tony’s the type of guy to switch his camera on whilst being interviewed and then start interviewing the interviewers.
It's curtain down for Tony if he don't pull this off
Its TONY time!
He should have retired a long time ago.  David Goggins training won’t help him.  Sorry Tony, please retire
always been a fan of tony… he’s a dog !!
Tony: I’m not here to have fun Also Tony: I’m here having fun
Tony is the type of guy to win this fight and say that it's his first fight, and he's looking forward to starting! #CSO #ElCu
Tony is the type of guy who you bet against but still want to win
Tony gets submitted early round 1
Bro if tony loses to paddy
Tony talks like he’s a guy whos on a 8 fight win streak, no one has ever questioned his mental state.. we question his age and skill
This is sad
Tony the type a guy to......   Stfu! 😂 none of you know what tony is the type a guy of. This dudes mental is out there and im still not convinced he wins.
I hope tony is doing well
This is emotional for everyone including Dana white I can feel it it hurts so much when they get old
CTE!
I'm in a good mood guys. 3 minutes later, fuck everyone! 😂
He literally rambles like a meth head that hasn't eaten or slept in three days
The vibes are in ... let's go Tony.!! #CSO
Tony the type of guy to be here not to have fun
This guy will be have a terrible hard time after he is forced to retire. I’m worried about him. He doesn’t seem to understand where he is at in his career at all. You don’t get 2 primes. No mythical fix or mental thing will bring back testosterone of a 30 year old. God help you Tony.
EVERY SINGLE LOST TONY HAD DURING THIS STREAK, HE SAID THE SAME THING BEFORE THE FIGHT AHHAAHHA
RIP TONYS CAREER.
TONY THE TYPE OF GUY TO GET KNOCKED OUT AGAIN
He had to say it ! 😅
And I said “FUCK YOU”😂😂😭
Donating life force to the Ferguson Spirit Bomb  One last W and retire brother
Tony sounds great. lets go!
Chiefs are wack
Just imagine he wins then goes on to have another 12 in a row without losing
I think it's awesome where Tony is at right now mentally. I don't know though I just feel bad because Patty isn't really a bad guy and I feel like there's a lot of hate going towards him. I just feel like if Patty loses to Tony his career is over and if Tony loses to Patty I would hate to see him put up his gloves because he does looks very focused coming into this fight but it's hard to say because he could very well end his career after this fight whether he wins or loses. He says he doesn't see himself retiring anytime soon though so it really just makes me wonder if he does win what's going to happen to Patty because I honestly like both these guys. Despite the hate that Patty is getting at this current point in time.
He looked good on chandler fight and he got caught.
Tony is the type of guy to say something is classified then give you the answer
Mind is out of his Tony!!!!
Tony Ferguson the type of guy to ask a reporter a question and then say “Hold on I’m talking brother”
Bro these comments are fucking gold
Khabib: Stupid guy
😂😂😂😂 I LOVE TONY!! NOBODY LAUGHS AT HIS JOKES UNTIL HE LAUGHS FIRST!!😂😂😂😂
tony “oli oop” feguson
tony knows he loses hes out
Tony is going to come out as a trans sexual after this fight.
I have a feeling tony win this fight
tonys last fight i felt he was dominating until he got eye poked
One last run please, Tony. He’s probably the last of the old breed whos unapologetically himself, a savage of a fighter, a great man who was the UFC’s first boogie man.
The fact that Tony regains my confidence every presser is a remarkable conundrum, but man I love this guy. Team Tony ftw 🫡
Tony looking rough. Wish the best of luck. He'll always be a savage.
"There he goes...one of God's own prototypes. Too weird to live...too rare to die." Hunter S. Thompson.
For a sec. I thought I was listening to  Soft White Underbelly!!
He’s gotta stop if he loses this fight
Where the hell is John Morgan?
I thought for a real minute that Tony would be a little different and personal...nope back to the same douchebag as always
always with the shitty sounds quality… just invest in some good equipemnt
Blades and Shades
Tony the type of guy that makes a huge title run and makes it look easy.
Tony been training in yapology
Tony cleaning his glasses to make sure no accidente occur 😂
No matter how many losses he had, tony just keeps on coming
tony is the type of guy to cuss all thru the interview then tell you to watch your f***ing mouth
Tony will erase his recent losses with a win this Saturday.
The type of guy to not answer your question then say I hope I answered your question
Yeah this guy is in a good place .... dont forget he had a death row of opponent's.... i believe he gets his hand raised and puts on a show... maybe for last time... but paddy will also come out stronger after the defeat in the long run afer becoming paddy the daddy
That reporter said goggins saying was who’s gonna cary the loges ? lol
Ferguson sounds even more deranged than usual.  I see him going down the Jason " Mayhem" Miller route.  It's obvious that his inner circle refuses to get serious with him, in regards to the realistic length of his UFC tenure going forward.
“I’m washed up…that means I’m cleaned up. I feel fresh”. —Tony  That was dope haha.
We know u basically hooked daiz up with that dub tony
Tony's mental health is out to lunch
They need to make a movie about Tony and his life man
Paddy sits to pee. Tony stands to shit.
Damn he lost muscle or something.
Tony sold ufc took his soul
kinda got lost like 90 percent of the time of what hes talkin about
I hope he smokes paddy
Tony is the type of guy to type smao instead of lmao
Poor guy… it’s really to the point of sadness now
Idc he’s got my prize picks
Tony will ALWAYS be my top 5 favorite.  The only man who will NOT tap on a full on armbar.
Its Tony time bitches .💪
Tony has pillow talk with Tony after he f&+_s himself... T4T
Y'all fucking casual can make fun of him all you want. Tony in his prime during the winning streak was a fucking scary dude. Sadly the fight with Khabib was cursed, it would be one of those classic fights. I didn't think he would beat Khabib though but definitely would give him one of the toughest close competitive fights. He will go down as one of my all time most favorite fighters. Respect brother.
Let’s go Tony. Show the world brother.
This guy is a monument to the sport. Simple as that. Such a different cat but so likeable... somehow 😅
Tony is going to expose Paddy the fatty
Tony the type of guy to track and hunt a bear while simultaneously reading a topographical paper map.
Blades and shades baby
Oh no.  He sounds rattled as fuck
Please fucking win Tony. I don’t hate paddy but fuck it would be so sad too watch him beat Tony. Prime Tony would fucking kill him
Another embarrassing moment for him
Tony the type of guy to film his interviewers as they film him.
Tony is the type of guy to make me think this tony is the tony we all needed in that cage with Justin.
Paddycakes rofl
This guy aged 50 years in the past 24 months
His eyes look different!!!
Bro 10:43 this guy is hilarious, imagine standing up and yelling 😂😂😂😂, Tony gonna get the W ❤
He talks like he's having a stroke.
Tony is old
Dude said the exact same things last fight against lil bobby
The backwards chair flip is pattened by Tony 😂
damn something is wrong with Tony...😢
He needs  to go to sleep one more time
Next chapter. Chuck norris vs tony
Tony Ferguson is the type of guy to rob a bank wearing a Tony Ferguson mask.
MY BOY NEEDS TO RETIRE BEEN IN FIGHT GAME LONG TIME. NEEDS WORRY ABOUT THE MIND AND
Tony the only one who be treating Khabib like Voldemort
Tony is looking more like my high school janitor each and every day 😂
He ain’t the same Tony man……
Ferguson is the worst talker.. so much crap.. he is a stupid guy.
Tony’s conferences are the best! Like come on! Unpredictable 😂😮❤
if tony loses this fight plzz retire.
I am so scared for paddy.
Tony, the type of guy to join the French Foreign Legion ,surrenders his fir  Passport for 5 years, Just so we can come to the press conference And tell everybody how bad ass he is in french.
Tony is the type of guy to give context of texts messages with no context of text messages then say DAMN really loud for no reason.
So fake, do better Tony your a joke
Tony has Kanye west vibes at press conferences
Sunglasses, as crazy as ever. little bit stupid
yea let the man finish. Ask him a question then cut him off, Rude!!!
Win or lose Tony is still my boy
he is a bit odd
I’ve got Paddy via late 1st rd finish tko/submission.  Not a fan of drunk drivers that plow into people’s vehicles.
🤞
I think Tony is an amazing fighter and I can’t wait to see him compete but damn… khabib lives rent free in that man’s head.
Tony time is over    ....
Tony is gonna lose
El Cucuy Fan for life ❤ I hope he gets the win and stop this losing streak which he doesn't deserve 🔥🔥🔥🔥
That I’m washed up one of Tony’s best lines
I love Tony, but he literally keep saying the same shit over and over. Last 3-4 pre fight interviews are same exact delusion 😭
Tying is buying his own hype.
legendary fighter
Tony the type of guy who needed to throw up
So weird
tony is the type of guy to lose a bunch then train with david goggins, and then smash up paddy pimblett and send him back to the uk crying,,,
Tony Ferguson is a type of guy to fight in the cage with shades on.
I hope tony knocks paddy the fanny pimple g@y hair out!!!
Tony’s the type of guy to give his presence to his kids for Christmas
Has Tony always been this messed up 😮 Bless his broken head

Tony is the type of guy who got kicked really good in the face !
Tony I’m so glad you trained with David! A new road is coming Brother!
Tony is always gonna be my favorite fighter, nobody else like him man.
Dudes d*ck yelling at reporter talking smack on patty bout blocking him on social media when he did it to him cornball
tony the type of guy to give the same kind of interviewing saying "he's back" but then loses devastatingly in the fight. I see paddy submitting him in the first minute of the fight.
Tony if you’re reading this. Please win bro. Please please
Mfer said a ketchup sandwich😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
‘Hold on brother I’m talking’ 😂😂😂
Seems like more cte has been gained
Tony looks good gonna be a  good fight
This audio is clean 🥴

I'm mexican but I'm with Paddy, Tony is an arrigant and a stupid guy
Ally ooop
I know paddy is shithouse , but I just can’t see tony beating anyone at this stage
Diego Sanchez vibes?
Only time tony shows up is at the presser  these dayzz😂
Tony isn’t doing anything..Retire man. It’s gotten too sad at this point.
I feel like Tony's going to turn back the clock ⏰ on Saturday night.Blades and shades baby
Why has his mood and energy improved so greatly? He's been unbearable to watch the past few fights. He is great energy now!
Pleasseee Tony get it done !
Whos gonna carry the boats tony.....who's going to carry the logs
You got the entire mma community behind you T! Lets go!
Just when u think uve seen or heard textbook idiot, Tony Ferguson comes in and gives it all new meaning
Authenticity at it's best. Hope he can hit that way, and I would love to see Mr Donald Trump
Isnt this the same shit he said the last 6 times
I really want him to win this fight. He deserve it.
Tony will be in Jail within 5 years after retirement. 😢
I really hope his ligaments are healed for speed.
How many times are we gonna have to here tony say how he is finally really all the way in it again? Instead of just saying look, i need money and i love doing it win or lose!
Tony should get into acting
Fighting at 40 is damn impressive!
THE REAL ONES LOVE YOU TONY💪💪💪 WE CARE FOR YOU IN AMD OUT THE CAGE.... GLAD TO HEAR YOUR WORDS, GLAD TO KNOW YOU ACTED ON THEM.... GO KUTT THIS BEETLE BUM 🫵🦾🦾🦾 #BladesAndShades
🙏🏾✌🏾🐜
Damn, Tony looks old. I am hoping this legend can get a W.
Too obvious 😂
Is he high?
Hopefully he convinced himself...wow.
SIXTY!! 👊
Dude is a has been a douchbag thats going to get knocked out again
Tony!!! Just win!!! I am a super fan! Just win!!!
This is what u call CTE
The CTE has reached its final form. It’s at the point now that if he gets washed by Patty he’s going to be in a mental institution within 3 months.
Tony gonna let paddy retire him cause he can’t give up the fight game smh Khabib was right
I love Tony, win or lose I hope this is it for him. I hope he finds some peace in retirement with his family and loved ones.
Tony isn't the type to give a f*ck, f*ck gives him.
Tony vs Jim Miller or Clay Guida would be an all time great send off for two legends.
Tony interviews the interviewer
uh i think Tony recently learned the word Alley-oop
Tony is a hero
Tony is the type of guy whose first thing that would come to mind is a ketchup sandwich
CTE Ferguson
Tony the type of guy to ask a question then say “hold up I’m talking” when they reply
damn bro is this post fight presser? why he look busted up lmao
Who else liked the video at 5:40
We need Tony on Rogan
It’s gonna be so funny when patty finishes him
This dudes getting knocked out yet again… 😢
Tonys been done since Justin made him walk around shaking his damn head trying to figure out where he was 😂😂😂
Honestly I'm past listening to Tony's bs. Great fighter and will probably win this fight over a sub par fighter in Fatty Pimblett. Just no longer gonna watch anything related to Ferg. Ugh.
This comment section has to be the craziest cope I’ve ever seen
Tonys the type of guy to write inspirational IG posts and journal about it.
Tony Ferguson is the type of guy that goes into the room with friends then leaves with no friends but then he is the type of guy.......
Come on Tony 🤞🤞🤞  one last one brother
"Theres not one other person on earth that could have endured the training I just went through mentally and physically" that's absolutely false but a scary thought coming from Tony. Man must've been going ham
If he starches Paddy I wouldn’t be surprised   El Cucuy
Great interview Champ! Such an interesting fighter.... Cant wait to see the new version of Tony!
Don't talk the talk...
If he some how loses to pimblett he needs to retire forsure
Tony can never just answer a question
Tony 100% broke with goggins. Going to the bathroom to catch his breath. Goggins probably failed him and let Tony earn his way back. A story two men will only know.
Tony is out of his mind
we coud say khabib and tony didnt fight because of a pair of glasses😐
We love Cucuy… let’s goooooo Tony. You can win this. He doesn’t deserve to be in there with you
That man shouldn’t be sanctioned for fights
If you look at the people Tony has lost to, Paddy would lose to all of them too, so I don't see why people think Paddy is gonna walk through Tony, this is Tony's easiest fight in years
Tony is the type of guy to lose a fight to Paddy Pimblett and still try to keep fighting.
The only time Tony takes off his shades is to stare directly at the sun.
Tony just getting started, guys! 👍
Insane likable people are very dangerous
Tony is the type of guy to tell himself, who told you to talk?
It's crazy how fast it looks like he's aged in just a few years.  Dude has had to have gone through a lifetime of stress and difficulty in that time.
legend ❤
Same shit every time a camera hits him.  I'm  different this time but I'm focused now. I appreciate his fortitude bit tired of hearing the broken record
Dude is not a doctor!
Bro no one cares about hell week lol David Higgins  is a stick figure I would throw that dude around like a teenager sex toy 🧸
He seems in a good spot, I mean that
Has anyone ever actually ate a ketchup sandwich?...it's sucks...😆👍💯
Welcome to red phase in basic, Tony
The past 4 fights Tony has said he’s a different fighter prior to losing
With all his CTE I could totally see Tony going Chris Benoit on his family!
He is done
Let's go Tony!
The people who continually have to reassure you they're mentally stable are the ones who are the most unstable
Tony Fergusons the type of guy to call for a rematch with a pandemic.
Noo “in your wayyy”. Get the W and retire pleaseeee ❤️ belt op is gone
Let it be tony to never back down and to go down fighting literally. Man’s is the captain, he’s last and going down with the ship.
Love Tony.  His previous was amazing to watch and experience.  I hope he gets the win.
He's lost his mind.
Tony is that weirdo who sits on chairs backwards, always has been.
It's painful to listen to Tony for 25 minutes. He's a skinny Tito Ortiz.
Tony wins Sat, and it wont be close.
Yeah make memes of Tony all you want.. but he said some deep shiet
Tony is the type of guy to like his own comment
Fucking love you Tony!
I don’t care if he wins or loses I support Tony 110% he’s given us memorable fights and a great career this don’t tarnish anything
Idk but this press conference made me feel sad
I dont care what anyone else says tony is just top class WIN WIN WIN
Night night Tony the shadow realm is waiting.....
Tony Ferguson is the type of guy who'd want to see questions in text msgs but responds verbally to them in press conference😂😂 Tony Ferguson is the type of guy who'd train David goggins after hiring him to train him😂😂
just give tony a mic, the press conference runs itself
He is gonna get beat up unfortunately, and i only say unfortunately is bkuz paddy gets it, hes a schlub that wont take a real fight lol. Its ok Since they will bang fists all day
Lets go Tony!!! Want him to pull this off so much.
This dude is nuts
tony the type of guy to study geology to improve his ground game
Let’s go Tony!!!
He looks lean and ready to go
C'mon Tony you got this!!!!!
Where did his ground game go? He was so good at it, and all of a sudden.. nowhere to be seen and got submitted by Bobby. That was the last thing I was expecting to happen!
Chuck Norris can’t even hold Tony Fergusons jockstrap 😂
tony has gone crazy
Tony the kinda guy to always sound like he’s all figured it out on media days
Tony is the type of guy to have the most watched 'media day' interview out of this card's fighters because of all the cringe. Mind you, this card has Covington.
Tony is the type of guy too lose 6 fights in a row on purpose just so he can  fight a easy fight and defeat Patty the fatty
Tony is the type of guy whose favorite Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle is Raphael, but he will tell you it’s Michelangelo.
I can't believe he still surprises me after all these years, the puke bag leitmotiv made me crack up
Chief air coach
Tony looks old as fuk
Even tho he’s on a losing streak he’s got a chance. His losses weren’t to scrubs. Justin, Charles, Benny, Chandler, Diaz, and Green. That’s a murderers row and he did em all in a row regardless. May the best man win 🙌🏼
“It took a full fu…. pandemic for me to loose “ Tony Goggins
Tony by TKO/Doctor stoppage round 4/5.
The problem I have with Tony, if you see any of his past fights for some reason he tries to jab the legs 😮 of opponents like that will do anything, instead of jabbing their face or their body.
I love Tony. #CSO
Come ON TONYYYYY
Tony the type of guy to choke out Santa Claus.
Sad. He's third- person putting the warrior side of him to rest.
Let’s go CSO 🕶️🇺🇸🏆🇲🇽
His interview his terms
CSO!!!
tony is the best
It’s so relaxing listening to Tony at these press conferences as he is so delusional and he doesn’t even know it.
7:57  Hold on brother I'm talking
7 min. Shout out to lando!!! Come back and fight??
Tony is the type of guy to counsel  therapy   himself and answer his  own questions.
Classic line.
Tony’s the type of guy to regenerate himself, come back stronger than ever, hit his prime, win the belt at age 45, go on a 12 fight belt defence streak and retire at 50. 😃
Tony seems like he’s in a good head space I just hope he’s been sharpening his tools and they’re just as good as his head space seems. Good luck Tony I’ll be rooting for you
Used to love Tony. Now he just comes off as a total asshole...
Dudes mental state has just taken a shit these last 5-7 years 😂 here comes another L and another “reinvention”
“I’m not gonna say hold on brother”  18:40
so many quotable moments hilarious interview
Tony the type of guy to wear his wedding ring on his thumb.
Anyone else not eat breakfast or just me.
This is the Tony we need!  He’s the underdog in this fight but I feel that with him taking it seriously more than ever he’s got the win in the bag! Let’s go Tony! #TeamFerguson
Tonys the champ, win or loss
Blades n Shades 🕶️😎
"I turn other kids daddies faces into ketchup sandwiches" ---Tony telling his son a bedtime story
Is he deliberately trying to lose his fans?
Tony Ferguson is the type of guy to alley oop himself the words alley oop to use in a press conference.
🔪🕶
My breakfast
Be the man tony
Blades and shades
Somebody give Tony expert hydration advice so he can workout in peace
EL CUCUY WILL RISE, A TRUE LEGEND ALWAYS CARRIES THE BOATS
Tony you the man!
What the hell is he saying?nobody knows
I feel like Tony’s the type of guy that shits on the toilet backwards..
Tony is the type of guy who believes he could beat Khabib even when Tony is not in his prime.. God damn PPL he is yet to hit his prime in his own words 😢
Please do - you’re one of the greatest fighters ever - respect
Wow tony is less than a shadow of his former self
The happiest we’ve seen Ferg in a long time . He seems very relaxed.
The more tony talks..the more i dont know what he is saying...
Tony’s 3rd prime is coming and he’s gonna show the whole world why he is The Boat.
Tony the type of guy to start using alleyoop as his only verb
How can you not love Tony? 😊
She knows??she asked me if i can handle it......  She clearly is worried about u dude...man he is done
Damn for the first time I’m going to root for Tony
This is going to be crazy in the CTE documentary
Let’s gooooo CSO!!
Where's your forearm Tony?
Wow tony is a silly silly man...maybe quite concust...
Needed some crazy tony in my life. been a while. Fucking love it!
Tony reviews his old days like a grandpa. He should admit that Tony Time is yesterday and hanging gloves is the present. peace and love.
Tony is not only back I think he legit is gonna go on a crazy streak like glover did and he might even get title shot.❤❤
Lol tony must be the first fighter to do hell week for a training camp
Tony the type of guy to be a paranoid schizophrenic
Tony swears so much that he litterally says nothing..he sounds ignorant and confused..he clearly has nothing left to give...i. Scared for him .sorry tony...your burying yourself
Anyone else find it weird that he keeps hyping the fact that he would put off his sets and finish them the next day?
Tony’s last fight
BKFC is looking like a great option for this man!
Tony was in a good mood til he wasn't
Will get knocked out by Mike Perry in August 2024.
"Chief Goggins" 3:05 😂
Tony left his parents house at age 11 and told his father "your the man of the house now "
Sorry Tony but a man who’s birthday is only 3 days after yours has a few more years actively competing. Jaromír Jágr 51 years old and still playing
Tony is the type of guy to make the cop roll his window down for him
Tony’s the kind of guy to make his child eat ketchup sandwiches.
When your job stops being fun to you, it's time to move on. Bye bye Tony. This is probably your last fight in the UFC
I miss the good ol days lol this is what I think during a Tony press conference now lol
The type of guy to lose a bunch of fights...
“Hold on I’m talking brotha” Tony to his kid saying his first word
LET'S GO TONY, MEDIA AND FIGHTERS HAVE WRITTEN YOU OFF BUT THE FANS ARE WITH YOU!
Tony will retire without a win 🤷‍♂️ the guy talks so much shit without any skills (at least compared to other top 10 ufc fighters)
Love you tony. Win or lose you're still the boogyman. You're drive, motive, and love of the game will never be forgotten.
I felt like we just watched Tony’s therapy session
Tony is not the type of guy anymore.😂
Tony the type of guy to make you say cheese for a video 😂
Tony looks younger and like his old self
Man you been here forever. Respect with a chin up.
11:21 fuckin love this guy 😂😂 20:20 what a gangster, cold line ❄️.
I hope Tony pulls this off.
Tony w or L u the man lol
I’m convinced Tony doesn’t know what an Alley Oop is
Tony is the type of Guy to ask the reporter a question and then stop him and say," hey I'm talking"
Tony is the type of guy to tell Tony, excuse me brother I am talking
Tony is a legend!
Tony's the man. Always tell the truth. Always gives his all. You can learn a lot about life from this man.
Tony is the kind of guy to get destroyed by Jalin Turner's son.
It seems like he’s fr changed hope it shows in the cage
Tonys the type of guy to take an absolute beating from J G and not take easy way out and fight until he literally could not fight on heart of a lion he has.  👊👍👍
Im going to laugh uncontrollably after tony losses 5 in a row 😂😂
Paddy is gonna f up Tony badly
Tony is the type of guy to visit the future an tell himself to grow up
Tony is a animal but he is not good anymore, he dosent have a chanse, too old, same fighting style which simply dosent work
paddy pimblet is an overrrated f... i cant see tony losin against him.
Why do his L’s sound off..?? I just pray Tony would retire 😢
Hes deffo been told to throw this fight.. see ir a millon miles off... Ufc fixed
Please Tony, you were great but that fight with Nate Diaz should have been your last. Don't do this. I don't care if you win, don't do this.
Legend
Tony is desperate to believe his own words but he washed
The sad thing, is you can tell Tony put on no muscle at all. And that could very well be from improper recovery. Goggins should have just trained the man. Not killed him with a hell week. LOLLLL. And I love both Tony and Goggins, but recovery is huge for being a fighter.
Tony talking makes my IQ lower. Cage walls?
Tono is doing every other thing but elevating and Updating he's skills adding more tools and perfecting he's skills.    He was good back then buck MMA keeps evolving.   Fighters keep evolving and the ones that don't goes through what Tony's going through.
Only fight worth the money on this card! Should be a fight night card
Tony gives everyone a weird vibe when he does press. He's the type of delusional crazy that thinks he can go get a title now.
This guy is a legend that risked it all no matter what happens ell cucuy will always be remembered as a savage bad mofo
old tony is back 😂
“Keep your balls between your legs & don’t drop’em like a little bitch!” Is the most Tony Ferguson thing he could say 😂
I hope tony floors him. Or toporia floors paddy
I’d be more humble if I got beat as much as he does lmao
IT'S TONY TIME
I’m an old head now .. but Tony reminds me of my dad when I was a kid. You walked on pins and needles because he was uneffing predictable one second smiling and joking and the next second full of rage and pissed off. He was a good man but not a nice man.
Boys,, imagine he goes on another 12 win streak.
Tony Will rise to another level if he beats paddy
Paddy will see tony isnt a quitter. Nor will he tap. Sometimes i wish he would but he is the physical embodiment of what a warrior consists of
Cant wait to see goggins in ufc gear!
3 hrs of working out is ignorant. Nothing smart about it.
Tony the type of tony to tony tony
Tony nothings wrong with you Father Time is undefeated that’s all
I feel this a step down for Tony. Think he does too. He drew the short stick in the punchers chance against his last fights. He has skill but ptsd from an oops can destroy peoples mind. You never know.
Last chance Tony. If Paddy stops you it is time to retire.
Tony type off Guy tot speak into thé speaker and make the sound come out off thé microfone
He called paddy a lil bitch😂 My NIGGA TONY FERGUSON 😂 A REAL ONE
Quality interview by Tony both asking and answering himself questions 🔪’z &😎’z
20s in and Tony’s already lost
Good thing he cleaned his sunglasses so he could see everyone
You just don't know where his conversations could go....I forgot the original questions from time to time.
Cowboy and Pettis lookin like they fell off a plane. Fuckin love it.
Cutting off the reporter 😂😂 Tony, just stfu and retire after Saturday you poor bastard 😂😂
The hate for Paddy isn’t warranted. The love for Tony definitely is. This on paper is a heck of a fight. Tony looked great against Chandler till he got turned into a chicken nugget.
He's on the edge of a mental cliff
Tony Time!!
Ian Garry: Dis man told his son that he was gonna make paddy's face a "KETCHUP SANDWICH". THATS FOOKIN CHILD ABOOSE!
Tony is the type of guy to play Mortal kombat and Fatality HIMSELF.
Never miss A Tony fight...
Most cringe I have ever seen !!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Tony is the type of guy to say something is classified, then explain in detail the thing he was asked about.
Tough to watch that and not like Tony. If built different was a person. That’s Tony. Never forget when he’d say, “ITS TONY TIME, BITCHES!”
Tony the type of guy to get CTE just to show it’s easy 😂
All jokes aside, Tony has been going through a lot of mental stress. He needs support and not silly comments left by clowns. Look at this man, he looks lost and his mind turned into a dark place where escape seems impossible. He needs support, understanding, love, compassion,and I’m sure he will recover. Mental illnesses is no joke, so please leave your silly comments to yourself and show some respect for this hardworking man, who refuses to give up.
“It’s classified” 🤣🤣🤣
Tony sounds soo bitter
Paddy might K.O Furguson
Tony is the kind of guy that should not fight anyone anymore
tony the type of guy to be that type of guy
Tony Ferguson has said the same thing every interview during his six fight losing streak, He is legitimately insane
Tony the kind of guy to say alley oop 3 times in an interview for no reason
i love tony 99.9%... the 0.1% missing is him trying to take credit for people wearing suits and sunglasses. C'mon bro just stop already
Ready to see the Boogeyman perform
Please please please Tony end on a win it would make my year.
This is so unfair for paddy lol
Mac Life always with the high quality audio and videos!
I hope Tony gets his butt whipped and will finally retire. People are sick of him
👑👑👑👑
A new win streak starts this Saturday!
Tony's the type of guy to say it was a great camp after spending it with David fucking Goggins.
Sounds like Tony is selling his autobiography! Is this his going away speech?
I have loved Tony throughout his entire career. Even during this skid... But I hope he loses taking as little damage as possible. Then he may actually hang up the gloves. He wants to go back to school and do other things. He's almost 40. A win over Pimblett might just give himself an excuse to continue fighting. No hate to Tony and I don't like Paddy.
I smelled a Tony Ferguson fart once
If you listen closely you can hear the UFC stock dropping as Tony talks. It’s a bad luck for the company him rambling like a war veteran grandfather
I’ve seen and heard this Tony the past 6 fights… “I’m a new fighter. I’m ready this time.” This time just feels a bit different. Goggins training him. Allowing Tony to callous his mind through physical pain and exhaustion. Tony may have found something through this camp.
What is he talking about?
Tony is the type of guy to "Hit his prime" after going on a 6 fight losing streak.
Tony is finished.
Previous fight had his face mangled was beat almost unconscious.  Keep dreaming tony.
Tony looking awesome!
Tony looking awesome!
Guarantee he wins.
Khabib ended this man's career without even fighting him bruh
tony wins this i believe in him 🦾
Lose lose for both guys
This wrinkled old grey man is not himself. And he will retire after this. I miss tone but it's over buddy and paddy the baddy is gonna have a hay day
Let's go Tony!!! Comeback incoming! 💪
This sounds delusional, but Tony has literally turned guys faces to ketchup sandwiches before.
Win or lose hes my hero forever
How many times we gonna hear this. Accept you’ve declined and retire tony. Your mental health was fucked before being battered for the last few years. Grow up and retire tony. You achieved a lot. Be a real man for your family and retire
Tony the type of guy to shadowbox the cage when Bruce Buffer is announcing him
Hope Tony gets the win
It took a pandemic for me to lose 😂 Tony is a one off most underappreciated fighter goin should of been bigger star and champion. He was the best for 4 yrs. Til father time and injuries. Looked up his record and take away his competitive fight loss to Johnson he would of gone on 16 streak in ufc and undefeated in 9 yrs exciting style. That's crazy.
I think it’s the chair. Turn it around you ll win
The 805 loves u cucuy !
Don't we get everyone together for a live press conference? Am I the only one who feels cheated?
And he made these same exact speeches last fight does he not realize this? He needs someone who can get through to him and let him know it’s ok he’s not young anymore. It happens to the best of them.
Please Tony, pull this off #CSO 🙏🐐💯💪
This is how an interview goes with someone struggling with mental health issues. His mind is a mess and he thinks he’s lucid and sharp. It’s delusional.
Tony ferguson the type of guy to take performance dehancing drugs
I genuinely can see him feel the pressure here
I cant wait to see Tony "Goggins Spec" FERGUSON.... I personally think Paddy is going to get smashed and don't see anywhere that he is better than Tony...
Hahahahah "They looked like they fell off a plane" 😂14:03
I respect the hustle but his toughness won't safe him this weekend. Definately signs of CTE. He should quit after this one.
Please people even if he win…its enough
Blessings toney
Please win Tony!!!!!
Tony’s fuckin funny lol
Win lose or draw. PLEASE TONY DONT QUIT. U R THE REASON I HAVENT QUIT MY JOB  THX TONY.
I guess Tony`s gonna win this one .
Tony is the type of guy to have a million of unwanted weaklings comment on alll his clips.
To many punches to the head and this is what happens. Brain dead has no idea what the hell he is even saying.
Let’s go Toney
Please Tony we need you to win this champ 🙏🏽
Paddy cakes 😂
Tony is the kind of guy to talk about his failures and still come out looking like a fucking badass that motivates people!! Love his interviews!! Fucking beast-mode!!
You cant lose to a fat bowl cut sorcerer
Let's go Tony CSO!!!!!
We FUCKIN ❤️ love u tony!!!
Tony, win or lose, will always be champion 🏆.
"that's classified." Then he answers it...such a joke.
Bro please win this one 🙏
Henry Cejudo is cringey…. But he means to be….. Tony is so cringey and believes it
Tony isnt same, its in the way he speaks now and body language.
Tony. Come on Bro. Will the real Tony Ferguson please stand up...
Gonna be sad night when he gets koed. Gonna have to retire for sure and realize his prime is way gone. Talk only get himself so far.
tony rules!  madman on his own mission
Sweet baby jesus, let Tony win 🛐
Bro this felt like a fever dream therapy session
Tony is the type of guy to block someone and call paddi sensitive haha
Tony the type of guy to stand in front of the mirror and say: “I don’t like the way you’re looking at me.”
Just imagine him going through another 12 fight win streak
Man tony talks so much but never says anything.. haha
My breakfast!  Jesus cte christ!!  I'll check back in on Tony in 35 years.  And I know what I'll see. Poor dood
Tony is the type of guy to throw a knee using his elbow
Cheif  goggins
man, i hope he wins. really think he will also!
we've already seen tony turn into a 1000yr old man from a head kick so maybe he'll pull it off
Dude seems punch drunk just talking to talk. This needs to be his last fight
Champ Chit only,, El Cucuy 🏆
he`s already tired...will be his light fight...
Tony the type of guy to bear hunt with a boot knife for training camp.
Isn’t he fucking awesome
he's lost... those are the words of a person that's in deep denial denial. He may win but he hasn't come to the realization that his best days are physically behind him.... that is a reality that he hasn't come two terms with.
I said el cucuy in the mirror 3 times then turned around and Tony Ferguson appeared and ankle picked me
This guy is so fried and salty lol
Dude so many talk shit, you are a fighter at the highest level dont let them bother you.
I feel tony smokes paddy the fatty
Tony called paddy kid same like his plan when fight kevin lee, hes going to play mental war with paddy😀
Always expects more attention than he gets.  Love Tony for sure,but dam he's awkward as eff
He looks good, some meat on his face!
Tony is the type of guy who clearly displays severe symptoms of CTE.
My man has mental illness. Not to be disrespectful but I’m in that business and this man I hope is getting therapy.
I’m scared for him.
Tony is like the ufcs version of Joe Biden the way he just rambles on about nonsense.....Brain damage vs age damage...
Yea paddy by k.o
Tony I love you but you gonna have to show me bro you been talking and talking it’s been a while let’s see if you still got it and it pains me to be this way bc I love you but damn dude you’ve just let us down and I don’t blame you I hope you can do what you gotta do get us a win even if it’s just one more I love ya man
Tony roasting Khabib is so funny
Tony is lookin thin. I hope he's not having some serious health issues.
Tony the type of guy to sit and read the whole terms and agreements and decline
I’d love to believe Tony but he’s said this the last 5 fights..
Training with goggins was a mistake.  Tony didnt help with endurance our "toughness", he needed work on his actual fight game.
This is so sad
You know Tony is so delusional nobody was wearing suits until Conor came on the scene and then Tony tried to catch up
He's mentally ill, I hope he doesn't kill himself in the octagon.
Tony looking good
Massive for paddy, Tony’s final time to show up. Interesting fight !
✝️✝️✝️❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
0:14 lmfaoo how can you hate this dude. hes freaking hilarious!
Tony got this
paddy’s gonna smoke tony
lets get a better audio engineer, this is pathetic stuff guys...
He was koo when he started but now he's a doosh
This guy's gonna take a nap in the first 3 minutes of the 1st round.  Time for retirement.   Each time he talks and becomes more delusional the greater the fall he's had.
Tony is the type of guy to say his in a happy mood, then say F U!
The one thing Tony has going is that paddy blocks punches with his face. He is very hittable and the last thing to go is a punchers power and Tony could ko him for sure
Tony enjoys the name Norman
Wow this is sad
Tony has never been ahead of his own thought.  Not even once.
Tony is the type of guy to take a 6 fight loosing streak on purpose due to boredom after Khabib dodged him
We got that "Hold on brother, I'm talking", quip.
This will be one for the cringe reel- Tony is not only done as a relevant fighter but he’s showing what a trashy character he is. I remember he first showed what a garbage human he is when he trashed a fellow fighter for not seeing his kid who’d just gone through a brutal divorce. SCUM BAG
Next month he will be in the PFL
Hmm I don’t think paddy was talking shit, pretty sure he likes u and finds u a legend
Loving Tony's new attitude let's go CSO ✝️✝️✝️🏅🏅🏅🏆🏆🏆
Paddy will humble him so bad.
Seeing Tony in a good mood, smiling and having playful chit chat with the media put a big smile on my face.
That hairline is cooked
Tony gonna get a surprise ko this weekend
The CTE is strong with this one.  Good luck Tony!
Tony the type of G to play himself in chess
Why tf did Tony sit down and plop back up like that
You don’t read people well at all if you think this is looking good for Tony.
6 straight pre fight media days I starting to buy in on tony coming back and winning,  not buying in this time, 6 straight fights , he goes on about changes in camp new coaches and living healthier  and blah blah blah, then goes out and gets dominated, not falling for it again paddy by finish .
You really don't know what kind of Tony Ferguson you're gonna get at a media day.
All right, this is getting kinda, you know.
FIVE FIGHTS AND A TITLE BABY cso!!!!
CHAMP SH** ONLY M*****CKERS ✝️✝️✝️🏅🏅🏅🏆🏆🏆
I'm not sure how many losses Tony has in a row now but if he doesn't win this fight I hope he just retires he had a good career but that Justin fight broke him.
I wish Tony could still fight as well as he talks shit, we heard this kind of talk what 6 fights in a row .. I believed him many times before but he's burned us too many times.
Come on Tony, lets go pleeeaaasse
Tony Ferguson the type of guy who wore suits before JFK
That was hard to follow, punchdrunk
Im gonna miss tony story time😢
Tony time has gone but the glorious moment El Cucuy gave us are unmatchable ..
Tony walks in and you can hear a rat pissing on cotton. The Mittin's with you BoogieMan.
It’s remarkable how all of Tony’s interviews after the Charles fight have been him saying the same exact things
people are holding onto the past soo hard, tony seems like a bit of a prick now. Bitch move blocking paddy too, i saw the vid...paddy wasn't having a go he just found it amusing and this little bitch is getting pissy bout it.
Tony the type of guy to bring a camera man to study film on the press
Tony the type of guy that won't answer a question cause is classified but continues to give the answer anyway
Tony is the type of guy to hire David goggins to train him
Tony’s the type of guy to let Goggins adopt him after the fight
Tony is the type of person to get ko standing by Justin Gaethje to prove that humans can take more than coronavirus. It’s him that saves us from Covid.
Tony! Show him who he's locked in there with!
I'm not here to have fun. - Tony  I'm having fun. - Also Tony 😂😂😂  Hope he wins!
Win or Lose, El Cucuy will be one of my favorite fighters. He made me feel excited for all the events that he was part of. Thank you Tony. You’re the best in my book. Cucuy 💪
Tony has said the same shit the last few fights at a press conference and still gets knocked out or submitted.  Retire FFS
tony in the best shape ever , lets go !
I love this Tony makes me excited
When Tony answer questions he’s just reciting pre written quotes from his autobiography
As always Tony is batshit crazy, dude is one bad day away from being in jail.
Bruh what the f does he be talking about????
Tony, I hope you win this fight. Win or lose, hope this is your last.
Seems like the goggins effect rubbed off on his thoughts, atleast! Hopefully he pulls this one off!!
I hope Tony will continue to have press conferences after he retires.
Tony the type of guy to delete a text from his wife and respond during a UFC press conference! CSO! LET’S GO TONY ONE LAST HOORAH!!
Tony’s the type of guy to say “I’m not gonna even say his name” and then say gaethjes name😂 11:33

A lil sprinkle of CTE schizophrenic manic depression mental strength mental weakness and oh yea probably angel dust boom you got this guy
Tf is all this 😂 every press conference
Holy CRAP Tony is completely delusional WOW
man... tony looks really old... hope he gets the last w
Not long ago, this was the guy we thought might beat Khabib. Now, he’s up against Paddy, and there’s uncertainty about whether he can pull it off.
He’s going for a title run I can see it in his eyes
Tony will be at BKFC or Bellator NEXT year .
Tony is finished but still happy to watch him fight
Tony the type of guy to drink an energy drink to go to sleep
Tony the type of guy 2 make goggins quit
Tony is the type of guy to beat tf outta paddy the fatty 💯
Tony's scared. He had a good run. We all get old.
Bipolar dissorder is a hell of drug
He literally repeated the same things over and over that he’s said before each of his previous losses. Not playing anymore, I’ve visualized how it’s gonna go, I’m better than I’ve ever been, its not the same me, I’m not here to have fun, I’m having fun, it different this time around, etc etc etc blah blah blah blah.
CTE?
Odd guy
Tony the type of guy to fight with sunglasses on
I’m not even afraid to fight Tony now a days
paddy 4 the win
Let’s go El Cucuy! 🤘🏽
Cringe
Tony the type of guy to tell his kids hes gonna make another man’s face a ketchup sandwich
The media is so nervous as to which Tony will show up😂😂😂
El Cucuy made it to the press conference, but where is El Cucky? 😂😂
This has to be Tony's last fight win or lose I think. I'm sure he will lose again tho. So sad man r.i.p. to the old Tony.
Tony means business.
by the end of all of his answers i always forget what the question was😂😂
Let’s gooooo boogie man!!!!!
If Tony Ferguson can’t win this fight,…..then there’s no future in MMA for him.  I honestly hope that he wins  …….and then retires
el cucuy .. hes gonna be the lone gunslinger cleaning up the town then riding out .. but we know who he is ..
Dude blames everyone and everything for his failures. He’s gonna get strangled. Hope Im wrong. Can’t stand paddy lol
wife "tony babe.. you ain't smiling anymore.." tony "FUCCK... SHITT.."
HUGE Tony Fan! It’s a total lack of common sense, human decency and frankly MEAN on Dana’s part to allow this man to ever fight again in the UFC!          Patty is going to absolutely Destroy Tony, Period.  Let’s hope it’s quick and not another Gaethje slaughter.
tony just needs to stfu and retire. hoping paddy beats him up
I am not a Tony Fan, but I really am starting to BELIEVE in him. WIN or LOSE....he will come out a better person!!
Whats a ketchup sandwich never heard of that.Tony definitely has cte
This dudes been hit in the head to many times he’s lost it completely he’s gonna end up on the news here shortly looney bin if anyone was paying attention they would’ve locked his ass up in the middle of this interview
Tony just can’t get rid of khabib 😂😂
Tony is the type of guy that won’t say his name then says his name
Dude is rude and weird. Worse than normal. Hope he doesn’t hurt anyone when he has mental breakdowns later in life
Tony wants to be a doctor….medical doctor?
Tony will win this fight, I mark my words!
Tony should start a senior league ufc
17:10 Guy really said he's well known for quotes like "Who's gonna carry the LOGS" 😂 Wow. It's boats, ya doinker.
Tony is A tYpe of Guys that will fight the mirror for making look bad in the morning
He seems better.  Let's go Tony
Looks happy at least
Weirdo 🤡
I'm gonna be so sad if Tony doesn't win this fight
Tony the type of guy who gets emotional and then say he didn’t get emotional
Tony can freaking win this fight, Man. Im all in on Team Tony. Good luck, brother.
Let me tell you, if Tony doesn’t do this purposefully he’s definitely got some screws rattled 😕 he’s always been a weirder guy but it’s getting worse. I hope he wins this one and gets out soon cause a legend doesn’t need to go out like he’s been
Ferguson is going to pop the pimplette.
Damn it feels and sounds like sth from a movie, his answers were so raw and honest
When is Tony going to drop the cool guy routine and just be himself for once?
Tony's got this
He is so dang hard to listen to. Absolutely annoying
"Im gonna make his face a ketchup sandwich i say to my kid"  Tony Ferg  One of one
Imma Paddy fan and love Tonys fight ethic, and I'm seriously am worried for Paddy, i dont feel paddy can become World Champ. But Tonies got one last Great performance in him, and i feel like this is that fight. Good luck to both.
They looked like they fell off a plane 🤣😂
Tony is gonna KO paddy lol
Idk why I have a gut feeling Tony is going to pull of a Bobby green against Grant Dawson type win I cannot wait I wonder if I’ll be right?
This mother fer is rdy to goto war and i think his head is in the right space. Lfg tferg
Ferguson gots more excuses then a drunk cheating wife
Dudes a legend lmao. They’re not my teammates their my students
I love and respect Tony, but man if he gets KOed it’d be fuckin hilarious especially after all this hell week training.
Mental health is big issue. I can’t imagine walking away from this type of audience and stage while making some serious $$.  That shadow complex is deep with my boy Tony  Good luck and the best to you after this ride is over
I fuckin love seeing Tony in a good mood.
Join BKFC
The biggest walking contradiction ever. Lmfao  So angry. So confused. It's sad and yet somehow inspiring.   I hope he finds peace after fighting... He's fun to listen to but also frustrating AF.
Tony, the type of guy to win the belt and put it around Dana's waist saying, "Good luck, kid"
Win or loss this guy has been not only the most entertaining fighter to step in the cage but damn he is honestly the most real guy to ever step in, he may be abit loco but we love Tony and his whole career
To be fair he does sound like the old Tony...last interviews we was sounding weird
Did Tony just tell the world David Goggins gave him ptsd?
As crazy as he sounds, this is the most focused we’ve seen him in a long time.
Tony would turn the chair around before sitting 😂
Very nice to speak at your own funeral
Huge fan of Tony!   But,  he’s not making any sense.  Dark days ahead, I hope he smashes Paddy
Tony for the win !!🏅
Blades & Shades -CSO 🏆
Anyone translate Tony's interview yet?
Tony is the type to go on a title run after 6 loses in a row
Close your eyes and imagine Tonys audiobook for his biography in his own words.
he is so toxic..
Old man in ufc years is going to get beat down.
Tony via whatever! Paddy hype is over after this 😂
Tony the type of guy it takes a global pandemic
Tony is the type of guy to retire from fighting and enlist with a BUD/s contract.
Goggins better throw the gloves on and redeem Tony if he loses
Paddy the Baddy is gonna win easy
ty sir
It's Tony time bitches 🎉🎉
Please do your your talking in the ring this time Tony . Sick of hearing the same BS every pre fight press conference to see you get humiliated in the ring . We need you to win this one, not tell us how great and different you are this time before the fight. Send Paddy to the ghost club
Tony , we all salute you for putting all of you into this business. Whether this be the last fight or not. You’re one of the greatest to ever do it. Much love brother 🫡
Fan of both Tony and Paddy, but I hope El Cucuy can turn the clock back for this ONE fight, bust Paddy up, and retire on a high note.
Tony is the type of guy who types his own password with his eyes closed to respect his own privacy
Please give the fans what we won’t tony! And that’s a bloody face paddy
Dear MMA Gods, please grant this great warrior one last big victory. Amen, Love The MMA Community.
Tony's brain just isn't braining anymore. Shit is sad man. If he loses I'm seriously worried for him.
Tony is the remainder at the end of the human equation. Greater than the sum of his parts. Glad we live in the same timeline. Hope he wins this one.
WHO GOING TO CARRY THE BOATS AND LOGS TONY
Tony is the  type of guy to sit down when peeing
Tony is the type of guy that joins bare knuckle boxing for a good time.
Tony gonna get this dub
Tony is the type a guy to field questions and answer questions from last year.
blades and shades baby!
GTA 7 protagonist
Coach Goggins 2-0 after this weekend. Let’s go Tone!!
Tony is nervous. Focus on his right arm
Tony done for
Tony doesn’t need to be tougher.
I’d put money that he screams at his toothbrush in the morning to get himself pumped up
Vegeta Hairline
Tony the type of guy to say he's in a good mood then give a angry interview
Gotta win this Tony!
lots of talk we've heard before and extra pageantry.   I hope Tony can deliver, but I'm doubtful
I love the intensity of this man! Admire his courage!
Tony please don't get KO'd or submitted in the 1st round. And be careful about using "ketchup sandwich" and "my kid" in the same sentence... Cuck Ian might be eavesdropping
Cage walls cracks me up
Tony’s getting a hairline like Usman
Truly lovely man
This interview was deep. Tony, im rooting for you to win. Humble that kid Paddy.
Tony goggins bouta come out gunz blazin😂🤌🏾
Betting the house on paddy
Like seriously when was Tony's last win? N how many losses straight has he had since his last win?
Tony the type of guy to weld without a face shield
Tony is broken from gathje to the knock out from chandler, and now he'll week, unfortunately same Tony. Same results
After listening to this interview i believe Tony will get KOed. He is disillusioned about his career.
Tony is the type of a guy to wear sunglasses during thunderstorm 😎
You need your retire Tony your not entertaining your finished just like your pal Conner
Poor Tony, too much brain damage
Win or lose this has to be the last one brotha. You gave us plenty nothing more to prove to us or yourself.
Hes gonna beat paddy
How many times is Tony gonna get his ass kicked n lose, before he's had enough?
I hope Tony wins ! Hes my guy that im backing. Tony can win too.
Cte is real
He has fully lost it. I've been a Tony fan and he has repeated the same lines again and again.
War Tony. Idc how many times he loses.
lmfaooo b**** 5:19 i don't have to post it for you
Paddy blocks with his face so that will happen
Ladies and gentlemen...cte
i’m ngl he seems so unwell bruh so desperate to prove himself even tho he’s proved enough before this skid
Hey the description says UFC 294 which was volk vs islam, the next card is 296.
I barely understand his rambles
Tony is the type of guy to elbow you and then thank you for changing his elbows bumb life.
Paddy is about to smash him with all due respect to the Legend.
broooo...he's turning grey.
Pak tua .....pensiun dong
Wow he's already lost, he doesn't believe the stuff he's saying 😞
Your not gonna do nothing tony. You’re going to get walked. You’re just a stepping stone for the younger talent. I’m glad to see your ego settled a bit. You’re old and slow. You can’t get anymore mentally strong than what you are tho!
Cheif Goggins 🫡 stay hard💪
Man contradicts himself in real time. Buddy is lost in the head it’s a shame
Oh god Tony’s gonna lose 😞
The guy is delusional. Says one thing then says the opposite. He's gonna lose and definitely not retire. But let go from ufc. Wasn't totally his fault but he had his chance at greatness. His prime years got screwed over
Tony Ferguson was born in a log cabin, that he built!
As a fellow British citizen as paddy, I hope u lay him out tony 👊👊
Hes done
Finally the real answer of the why we got hit by the pandemic by a foreigner 😂💪🏾 scared of Tony makes sense now LFG!!!tony!
Baba yaga
My Breakfast!!!!!
I want  to go back to school to be a Doctor- Tony Ferguson
Tony is the type of guy to say "Tony is the type of guy" when answering questions
Go tony!
Tony Ferguson is the type of guy to drink rat poison to test his immune system
come on tony everyone wants to see you winning this one
I love tony but he’s all talk at this point. The body can’t do what the mind wants.
I love Tony always have.  When he said the hay is in the barn brother that really hit me hard. Nobody appreciates that expression anymore. I had a tough day today but Tony using that expression made me shed a tear. Amen brother good luck, stay hard
5:49 Tony is the type of guy to tell you something something is classified and later reveal the information
I would love to hear what a psychologist would have to say about his interviews. I love Tony, but he has multiple screws loose. More than most fighters.
Win or lose he NEEDS to retire.
Not smiling during training camp is what was wrong eh 🙃
Every body is quite because they don’t know what you might do
Tony is the type of guy to get a retirement text from his wife and then decide to spend a week with Goggins.
10:48 he should consider acting post mma career  off topic though he sounds great when speaking, a lot more coherent than most may expect
Everybody’s quiet in the beginning bc they don’t know which Tony is showing up.
This is sad
“Chief” I hope that mindset helps him.  He must’ve been lacking mad confidence. And from what I’ve seen of goggins him being basically a drill instructor. Break him down to build him up. If paddy ends up on his back he’s going to bleed all over the mat.
Welcome to the freak show....
Not a Tony fan but pulling for him to destroy Paddy and get a W.
Tony is my hero..
What song did he walk out to?
Tony is the type of guy to have the best winning streak on UFC and the worst also. CSO
Hes retiring.....thats why hes happy
Welcome back Tony 🎉
Good to see Tony happy
Tony going to sleep lmfao
"Like everybody else, fuck you" - Tony
A very tito esque level of cringe
Tony looks dehydrated. Emotionally stressed.  Spacey with his words.  Overworked himself with cardio imo.   But I hope he wins.
Man imagine old Tony shows up this time. 😂 Paddy will get annihilated. Would be pretty excited for all the Tony fans to see a healthy and sharp Tony show up Saturday.
Retirement! will be the best after this fight straight up.
Tony is the type of guy to not f- around and take the k.o
Dude is sensitive as fuck I called him Tony Fungerson acted like it was funny then blocked me 😂
Gonna lose this fight as bad as his hairline.
Tony is the type of guy to wear a helmet & pads after the football match...
"I am faster and Stronger then ever before !!!" ok... He is done
Toe toe sounds to b back heavily focused and in the moment
El cucuy gonna look vintage paddys gonna get smoked
I really like Tony and I don't want to put negative energy out there for him but I just can't understand the crazy gameplan switch from "I need to sharpen up and move my head and tighten up defense so I'm not taking punishment all the time so I can dish out my own" all the way to breaking his hardware down with Goggins. Exhausting the body. Fitness was never Tony's problem nor was mental fortitude.
He’s so dramatic man
Tony in a good mood . This could be something special …
I mean the guy has accomplished great things. There is no doubt about that. That being said........if he loses this fight the UFC needs to let him go. Open some dojo's and pass your knowledge on to others. Tony's mind still wants to compete but his body is broken. He has not been the same since that Justin fight! I still believe Tony has something left in the tank but unless he finds a way to unleash that this Saturday and get a victory then he needs to lay down the gloves and move onto the next chapter of his life which should not consist of him fighting anymore. Cheers to you Tony. Nothing but respect for you brother.
I wanna bet on tony but for some reason I feel the ufc if goes to dec will give it to paddy
Man what does a guy like Tony do after retirement, I just can't picture him fitting in anywhere?
No, you’re going to get embarrassed again because you’re too stubborn and plain dumb to see you’re finished.
“It’s not funny I’m not playing anymore” Brother has literally said this exact line in the past three press conferences in a row.
Love the way he represents Michigan 🙌🏼
Love that guy. Legend
He’s delusional and gonna get clapped lol🤑
Tony seems ramped up man this could be interesting
I really really hope he wins
Tony is going to go out there and lose again. Why are people acting as if Paddy cant fight and Tony has a realistic shot? You can love Tony all you want but don't lie to yourself and pretend Paddy doesn't win this fight. The Nate Diaz fight, hello anyone remember that????
Tony a walking legend hope he gets this win and think he will easy haha
Tony is fucking good at convincing me that he’s done fucking around after every loss. Let’s hope this time he means it… I guess? 😢
I honestly love Tony but i really feel like paddy gets it done. Hes got alot of haters to hush. This is gonna be one of the hardest fights ive ever had to watch to be honest.
Tony the type of guy to prerecorded his speech at his own funeral
El Cucoy is INSANE.
such a weirdo
Tony the type of guy to use his elbows to make beef patty out of Paddy.
Tony is the type of guy that forgot what day is birthday is.
Tony is the type of guy to think he can still be champ-
Just get the job done Tony 👍
Tony is too dumb to retire.   If anyone has brain damage … it’s Tony.
Paddy said he's not the kinda of guy to get knocked out...the MMA community hopes and prays that Tony is still the type of guy to knock that scouser out.
Pls Tony pls win
Tony the type of guy to tell us to shut the fuck up ... when nobody is talking
win or lose team tony as always..og of the game
El Cucuy is BACK
Im sold
There would be nothing more glorious to watch than watching Tony Ferguson turn Pimbletts face into a used ketchup packet
MFers gonna win
Get it Tony!
God this guy is not well. This will be his end.
Tony has just come into his CTE prime 😂
paddy gonna pimp slap this clown
i still have no idea why he has me blocked on IG
This guy is delusional, rude, mean spirited, poor sportsmanship idk I wanna cheer for him cuz I dislike paddy but man, he makes it hard as hell
Tony is the type of guy to tell everyone except his wife and kids to fack off 😅
His mindset is very different. We will see
Tony The type of guy to prove that he has nothing to prove
Tony please win this fight  Then Retire
Nobody EVER said training with Gogans was EASY....  EVERYONE said it was the wrong way to use your time and energy 😂
Tony is the type of guy to be the type of guy who’s the type of guy
Tony the type of guy to speak like he's in a kung fu movie after awhile
At this point Tony Furgeson should try to break the UFC record for biggest loss streak
This dude is unhinged lol
“Prime Tony One Last Time.”
20:38 that was such a good question especially for Tony.
5 Fights And A Championship. Blades And Shades Baby. CSO    ...I still have hope goddamnit
Tony is the type of man who doesn't age because he told his birthday to retire.
Hope he wins because if not we are seeing Tony go through a mid life crisis
Punch drunk
Tony is gonna knock Paddy out. Have a feeling. Could be wrong
Tony is the kind of guy who makes  popsicles out of ketchup
Old tony is back let’s see if his skill is still where it was
Man I hope he retires it's hard to watch he's super cringe paddy should get the win hopefully
Tony "hold on brother I'm talking" Ferguson 😭😭 lol
Chief Goggins 😤🔥
Unfortunately Tony is getting knocked out this weekend

👖🦋💥🏆🇺🇸 $nap down city 🇺🇸🏆💥🦈👔
he took that video at the start so he can remember his last media day. love you Tony
He a little bit crasy, we have to help him
I can tell its his last fight. Thanks for the memories Tony
Love you Tony but, please retire after this loss <3
Tony loves the term alleyoop doesn't he
Come on Tony, get this W for the sake of the whole MMA community... Were all backing you
He’s so convincing man
tony is going to smoke this fool. easy money
Once Tony took those shades off, he's looking oldddddddd
His head still spinning so hard from past knockouts that he sat down with the chair turned towards the wall, I'm impressed he wasn't staring at the wall
Managing distance = not nice (hopefully)
I feel like Paddy will probably win, but damnit Tony i want you to win....win then ride off into the sunset you glorious bastard
Oh dear Tony Fergie getting Smoked by paddy the baddy, fergie cuts more corners  than Donald Trump. 😅 R.I.P old Timer
I can't handle another tony loss
tony is the type of guy to become a licensed therapist just so he can fight other people's demons
😎 itsa champ thing'
He seriously seems diffrent  in a better way
In the words of Mariah Carey “All i want for Christmas, is Tony to win this fight”
Ketchup sandwich??? Never had one of those lol. I stopped watching ufc after the budlight deal. Good luck
Lmao OK Tony good luck with that.
The delusion is strong in this one
Tony Ferguson will use United States of Smash to finish Paddy Pimblett.
I'd give anything for a reporter to ask Tony to clarify things when he contridics himself or has the complete wrong emotional disposition for for a response. Just politely insist on clarity when he makes no sense. Please God. Give this to me.
I really wish Tony would retire, if he loses this fight I hope Dana does the right thing. Tony is starting to remind me of Diego Sanchez, just too many blows to the head.
tony looking old, this is the end, the fighter hes fighting, the losses in a row, the urge to get fake david goggins, if you really pay attention you can tell when he fought pettis it was the beginning of the end. its over, its been over. cool fighter, cool character, but its over training with david goggins dont magically make you superman, david goggins would get his arse whooped with ease, it means nothing overall to have a certain mental condition , your fighting that comes with the territory.
Tony wins 100%
Tonys the type of guy to talk for an hour and not make any sense. Cte is his biggest fight now
i hope this is the last fight .. dude is not looking healthy
Honestly Tony winning this fight would be the best Christmas present for me
CTE is real
Respect 👏👌
Alleyoop* word of the day n week
tony is looking very confident i hope he knocked tf out of Paddy Pimblett
For the sake of tony, i hope he loses. He needs to retire.
It’s tony timee bitchess
He is mentally weak..sorry Tony always loved watching you fight until your last fight...paddy gonna fuck you up ..
Tony the type of guy to eat his own sandwich
“Make my wish come trueeee… all I want for christmas, is Tony to win this fight”
slightly worried for Paddy with the spirit Tony has this week
Tony needs to win this weekend, and then the ufc can give him an easy matchup for UFC 300. Then he should retire
He’s so boring 🥱
Tony is one of the most overrated fighters on the roster
I’ll be so pumped if Tony finishes Paddy, yeah it’s likely going to be Paddy by Decision but if Tony can fight like he did round 1 against Chandler he may get him out of there.
Team Tony
Depressing
i have this strange bad feeling about Tony... and it really makes me sad...my gut tells me we gonna see this dude in police news sooner or later once he finishes his ufc run....I really hope iIm wrong
It's tony time bitches😂
Tony basically the type of guy to interview the journalists
Tony’s coming out throwing bows.El cucuy is back
Another lame lose…boring fight coming in HOT
The fact that Tony hasn’t even hit his prime is insane.
Bruh you got me just by the caption lol
what a freak.
Paddy: I'm Dana's cash cow. smh  Please Tony deliver Paddy to the shadow realm. The party has just begun: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTKshxKVxN0
Thank you Tony for always giving is your all and a beautiful show ♥️ we love you 💪
I'm not fucking crying you're fucking crying :'(
Тоny💯💯💯💯💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪👊👊👊👊👊👌
I don’t think David taught Tony mental toughness about not giving up but he taught him that Tony isn’t the baddest man in the room and he can improve. Tony was used to being a cardio machine and he learned he could be better.
sadly the lolcow of ufc
It took less than 2 minutes for Tony to kick into El Cucuy mode
Vamos Tony 💪 ❤ a destruir al tonto ese.
Lmaooooo!!!!....Another fukin loss is coming his wayyyy!....WTF wrong with the UFC not cutting him yetttt
Tony the type of guy to one day sit on a chair the correct way
Bro really said ally oop 3 times  in 10 minutes. Guess he learned a new word
lol Tony - " that's classified .. Chief Goggins " he's joining Uncle Sam when he retires .
This is the definition of delusional. Ive seen this before its really sad. He may win saturday unlikely but so what he obviously doesnt have it anymore and hes such an asshole he has zero friends in the mma community that care about him and they use him like a dog. Theres so many contridictions in this interview. If you look at his 6 losses almost all his opponents lost their next fight or 2 it shows the levels and how easy it is to fall off. Brutal Sport. Someone help thos guy
Ask dude a question, excuse me im talking lol. Guys crazy af.
Tony the type to sit in the chair backwards and he’s the type to not have fun while having fun
Tony is gonna lose so bad he’s fuken losing it cray cray 😂😂
The very best Tony comment I've ever seen *Tony is the type of guy to betray himself to condition his own trust*💀💀💀💀💀😂😂😂😂😂
Damn I think Tony is losin it a bit. Hope he whoops paddy and can leave on a W
Tony saying its "Classified" but then giving every reason why he got Goggins in 😂
HOW can ANYONE on earth be in a relationship with a person who is THIS socially flawed? Can you imagine? I can't for either a woman or just a friend. I can't imagine having to hear him talk but NOT be able to sit back and laugh. As a joke, he is AMAZING. But IMAGINE having to take him seriously? 😂😂😂😂😮😮😮😮. And also, Khabib NEEEEEVER thinks about you Tony 😂. He thinks Khabib even really remembers him? Soooooooo crazy
Tony’s the type of guy who changes the time on his phone if he doesn’t like the current time
Sad part is I believe him 😂
Tony will KO fatty
Tony’s the type of guy to tell the ref to protect himself at all times.
Man I love Tony but wow. Did he just say he wants to be a Doctor?
Damn, looks like Tony has physically aged a lot in a short amount of time…
Look up the definition of Manic..it is literally the definition of tony ferguson....scary
I know we all love Tony, but what we are watching here is called mental illness folks.
I hope 🙏 he does well  in this upcoming fight.
🥹🥹🥹
🪦😞
Tony is such a fucking mess. Win or lose, the guy is terribly uncomfortable in his own skin and it’s blatantly obvious. He is unbelievably socially awkward because he tries to play this confident character when he is anything but. All in all, he is way too long in the tooth and it’s time for his old and brittle body to cal it quits.
Tony’s the type of guy to introduce Bruce Buffer
Tony is the man! Dont nobody forget that.
This is his last fight. Tony will retire after this.
Fuck that El Cucuy for life 😭🫡
Tell sunglasses to get a boat, cause there's a flood coming 😂
Tony’s the type of guy to keep cutting weight after weigh in’s
the reversed chair 😢 i love it
the reversed chair 😢 i love it
the reversed chair 😢 i love it
the reversed chair 😢 i love it
Tony’s the type of guy to rub Vaseline on the cut man in between rounds
🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
RESPECT TONY YOUR A CHAMP
the reversed chair 😢 i love it
He should have begged Justin to give him his soul back cause the results won’t change unless that happens
The realization of Tony admitting it's almost over. When he said it took a pandemic to take me out...admitting it's been over since. Then the reminiscing of what he did to guys in his old fights......😢
the reversed chair 😢 i love it
How can we watch the video Tony recorded if we blocked 95% of the people on his socials 😂
I’m pulling for Paddy just because I want  Paddy to be what he’s been hyped up to because it makes everything more entertaining and does nothing except bury a potential up and comer if Tony wins.
We love Tony so much and forever. Idc how many times he’s lost. Tony will forever be my fav fighter
Hope he gets a quick win and fights on 300 Lets hope tony gets his tito vs bader moment.
only Tony understands Tony..
Tony sounds convincing enough that he gasses us up every fight only to let us down. I respect everything he’s done in the sport and for the sport, but he’s done. Let’s keep it real
*Paddy Pimblett wins:* "He won to a 40 year old who hasn't won a fight in 4 years"  *Paddy Pimblett loses:* "He lost to a 40 year old who hasn't won a fight in 4 years"
the reversed chair 😢 i love it
One last time lets see the real boogeyman ragdoll Paddy perfect finish of the year
Tony only needs too do a spinning elbow and he’ll win literally coulda won his last couple of fights with spinning elbow but didn’t throw em miss the jab on purpose then SPIN
Damm tony respect 💯🙏
Retire.
Tony is just reaching his prime
I think toby has lost his marbles. Can you imagine being his next door neighbour.
Tony type of guy that lost 7 straight fight but still think he his the champ😮
He’s gonna have a taste of Real Shit 💩
I hope Tony’s finally getting a tune up fight after every challenge back to back has been top contenders for the last 4 years. Let’s go Tony!
Let's fucking go tony
Tony is fighting mental deacons.  He's twitchy in basic conversations.  Unfortunately you'll see that twitch come out in a scary way if he's cracked good.  I'd hate to see him glitch in this fight.  Sad story.
Sooooooo.... We're all betting Tony Right!
Everyone quiets because no one cares about Tony. Patty is gonna retire him.
He's still got some mental issues. I still think Justin ruined Tony and he'll never be the same again
Tonys wife is a real ride or die 💯 thank goodness shes with tony
Nice Tony is scary 😂
This guy is 100% nuts. His hair has turned gray. Poor cucuy will go out with an L...
And he put himself through all that hell just to lose anyways. He's done lost in his mind. He doesn't belong in there any longer he just refuses to accept his own fate.
Is it just me or has he been hit enough already ???? He sounds nutz to me . And not in a good way .
Just retire, please
i cant help but think he ate mushrooms before this  🤣🤣
I know people like Tony where they are their worst enemy.  He is destroying himself to make a company more money. UFC needs to retire him and set his family up for life
When Mike tyson fell.....it wasn't because he didn't have it anymore.....it was a mental thing......he to is right now......what these guys do?....they're humans to......combat fatigue 💯
ddue makes literally zero sense.
The most delusional fighter of this era. Should have retired 5 years ago. How this wife bashing flog has any fans baffles me. Whats crazy is when he won the Ultimate fighter i was a fan, until he got too big for his own shoes. The fans he has now all seem to have 1 thing in common. They talk shit like him
Tony is the type of guy who has turned into Nate Diaz with the I don’t give a fuck mentality.😂😂😂
Kick his ass Tony !
I love the guy but it is always the same comments of "Tony looks really healthy this fight week" and "This is winnable, he is going to smoke (insert fighter)". Paddy is a submission specialist, and Tonys ground game has looked really shocking these last few fights, I just don't think he will be able to compete on the ground especially bc his TDD is no where near as good as in his prime and Paddy is a massive lightweight.   That being said if Tony wins I will no doubt be hospitalised for how plastered imma get in celebration.
I hope he smashes Paddy. He's a hype job.   If haircut 100 leaves his chin up in the air like he's done in every other fight, he's fkd.
Better be serious about winning Tony,cuz if you lose this one it's time to flush your career down the toilet and retire. I could go either way on this fight,but I'm rooting for The Boogie Man.
Tony is the type of guy that actually "carries the boats"
Tony is the type of guy to break up with his soul mate to condition his feelings.
At 20:36, that was the sound of Paddy boarding the plane back home.
17:28 goggins laughing maniacally lmfao
I just want him to win so bad.
Who knows how this fight will play out but Goggins is the truth, though. Listen to his audiobook. He's all about overcoming yourself and lives it.
Everyone's quiet because they are embarrassed and scared for Tony. At the same time I'd love to see Tony win.
No you're not dude get real tf?
We know what Tony does....there was a mental problem that I believe has been addressed 💯
Cannot wait for tony to crush this overhyped tomato can
Legend. The dont call it a comeback
Why remove shavkat’s interview?
Just don't die in there, man😂
Prime El Cucey was the greatest lightweight on the planet, and I dont care what anyone says, you had to be there, he gave people career altering beatings
I remember seeing Tony and Goggins for the first time and I genuinely thought he was training with Royce Gracie 🤣
He’s in a phenomenal head space 🙌 Tons of growth training with Goggins. Let’s go Tony 🔥🙏
7:57 don't mind me, just keeping this bookmarked.
Tony is gonna smash Paddy if it comes to a fist fight. If it goes to the ground Tony will lose.. my bet is Paddy will win via submission or on points! Although I'd love to see Paddy lose.
20:20 😂😂😂😂
We love you toney please do this !
Tony is the type of guy that shows up at a press conference thee end.
Throwing up…. That was withdraw he had to clean up DRUGS…
Thats right Tony. Lets do this!
Tony the type of guy to go on a 12 fight winning and losing streak just to show how consistent he is
Lets go Tony!
Tony is the type of guy who would walk into the octagon with his shades on
Paddy is fukd. Hes never seen a grizzled Boogeyman like this.
Tony Ferguson is the type of guy to go on a 6 fight skid just to lower his ranking just to chin fatty the paddy 😂
Did Ian Gary not go today?
I hope Tony wins. Having said that, I think he won't.
Absolutely        👇🏻
Bro we need this W Tony !! Lfg
Dear Santa, I want to thank you for selflessly having to file chapter 9 bankruptcy buying all the shit my kids want this year,,but if its not too much to ask..All I want for xmas is paddy ass up face down El cucuy victorius!!! Plz,... just give me this one thing!!!
Let’s go El Cucuy!!! Turn Paddy into a pancake
Tony is gonna talk all this shit and going there and get his ass handed to him
I think I might cry if this is Tony’s last fight and he manages to pull it off 😭
Mommas boy Khabib ducked this dude.
Tony looks a little bit concerned, I think that is why he is speaking like a tough guy who trays to scare his opponent. 😄
Tony is the type of guy to do an interview by himself in a dark room and yell “Hold on brother I’m talking” to no one.
Lots of signs of CTE
I will always love el cucuy, thanks for everything champ 😢
I hope you all realize how important this is. This will be the Last of the best Tony pressers ever. (Also I really hope I am wrong) lol
how u lose to bobby lmao
Tony actually sounds mentally locked in. Some can say his hell week training with goggins was no use but mentally just from the way he talks rn, he seems present and locked in for the task at hand. I have nothing against patty, but im rootin for tony this fight
Bro tony is gone holy cow
C,mon tony you need this one bro you got this!!!!!!!
I pray he goes out on a win. But if he wins, he'll talk that title run stuff and end up going through the meat grinder at least once more. Dana will give him another fight if he wins i think, but his next loss is his last fight. If he loses i hope he doesn't take any major damage. Dudes given enough. Old school Tony one last time 🙏
Tony the type of guy to ask .. what are things in gremins called?
Jesus Christ bro, he is to beat up for this. How can Dana have the heart to keep on booking him
I like watching Ferguson talk, but don`t like watching him get beaten up in almost every mach in last few years.
He sounds like he's doing better mentally, I'm really happy about that. IDK how well his training with David Goggins is going to translate into a fight, but it seems like it's done alot for his mental
Only TONY is the type of guy to get David Goggins to train him for a fight and this seems like a joke but it’s real
Tony the type of guy to become a doctor and perform circumcisions with he’s elbows
If Tony can’t beat paddy, then he’s definitely done.
Damn if he loss to paddy thats gonna be embarrassing.
He is bitter like every other man this age that isn’t where they want to be. I say this from experience. You know you have more to give and want more for yourself and family. Unfortunately age has no mercy . Yes, he is bitter and angry and unfortunately it is not marketable. Hopefully he gets a win and can offer that because outside the octagon he isn’t making any friends.
iiiiiittt’sssss TONY TIME!!!!!!
I love Tony, but Khabib would’ve killed this dude.
Tony your the goat 🫡
Tony is the type of guy to answer a question with an entirely irrelevant story about some confrontation he had.  Lol.  I love the guy, I just find it funny.
Is it just me or Tony looks hella weak….. what miles do to fighters who don’t know when to stop…..
Good luck my man been watching you since day one. Thank you for all the great memories!
I hope Tony gets the win
Tony has become so slow , Bobby Green pieced him up on the feet and was also much stronger on the ground . Paddy prbly worse than Bobby but i think he"ll also be much stronger than Tony . Tony has also started to turn away from punches , i think Paddy is better all around . Faster , stronger and a fresh chin
Calling Dr Hyde to brain surgery 😮😮😮😅😮😮😅just shut up I'm Dr Hyde to fix your brain ...😅😅😅😅
I am not crying
Whats the point of having this guy in a press everytime is the same hes a ahole i know you dont have to make friends but why make enemies for no reason. The fact is hes not all there no more and someone in hes family should save him before he gets mentally worst
It’s classified and then proceeded to explain 😂
is tony off his schizo meds again? this guy's a creep
Someone remind Tony he's training for a MMA fight and not a motivational speech contest
Let’s go Tony!!!👊👊👊
I see Tony is still as weird as ever.
EL CUCUI 💯 LETS FUCKIN GOOO TONY!!! 805 MFER'S 805
what’s with Mac life always having awful audio quality 😭
That’s bad fight talk that
SIX FIGHTS AND A TITLE BABY(i'm delusional)
Living Legend Tony Ferguson.
I'm not gonna lie he looks better. Healthier...I'm worried for paddy.
Pls Tony pls
CAAAAANNNTTT WAIT to see this joke finally get retired. So tired of his delusion. Furking 🤡🤡🤡. “Ima be real” 🤮🤮🤮
If Tony loses it’s time… Ima fan.. but if he loses and he feels the best he has ever felt. It’s time to chill and enjoy life
Tony❤
Tony is a fuckin legend. I hope he beats paddy. It’s not like the ufc is going to release paddy. He’s got plenty of time left.
I don’t understand why Tony has so much animosity towards paddy he’s been nothing but respectful towards him
Tony got everyone calling goggins Chief... 😂
I know Tony is past his prime, but this fight is winnable.  Win or loss thank you Tony for a wonderful career and one of the most legendary win streaks in ufc history.
If tony loses he should retire and train under goggins full time for ultramarathons.
“Float my balloon anymore higher than it needed to be, it needed to get to where it need it was” - Tony Ferguson 2023
Tony is my nine year old sons favourite fighter, his heart and his darce choke are his favourite just got him an autographed glove for Christmas he’s gonna love it
Tony’s UFC debut was 13 years ago.
I swear Tony better handle business here. Paddy is the anti Ferguson. Let's go Tony! 💪🏼👌🏼
Everyone telling Tony he's still can do this and pushing him to compete is a clown of the highest order and cares not for him personally but rather how they can benefit from him to continue fighting. Crazy crazy crazy
Fony is back being deluded
Tony os so cringe
This is his last press conference
What a G, love Tony man
Tony Ferguson has so much brain damage I feel bad for his family.
God damn it Tony let's fucking go you need this shit. Tea bag that motherfucker.
Tony #Methferguson
Blades and shades baby 🗡️🕶️
Tony is gonna smash paddy.
Tony is carrying the boat
Still utterly dilusional.
Sitting on his chair the wrong way round is such the Tony Fergerson thing to do
Tony is Humble tahts crazy !
Imagine Tony and Biden in one room talking.
He’s getting retired
Whats up with the stroke at 6:00 - 6:05?
The backwards chair every time lmfao
Tony saying he'd fight with his sunglasses on if he could, INSTANTLY brought back memories of Khabib saying "Hey, hey sunglasses" Good times. 😂
Tony no matter what happends you will always be my favorite fighter in the lightweight division and all the real tony fans will stand behind you win or loose
Tony type guy to reach his prime at 50 years old 😂😂😂😂
Imagine you’re about to have surgery and you’re doctor walks out, it’s tony ferg lol
Sadly this is a lose/lose for Tony. I'd love to see him win and retire but knowing him he'd try and continue fighting after a win 😢.
Not gonna lie, the moment he started talking about Khabib again and how he ducked him irritated me
"What gets you up in the morning?" "My Breakfast"  Same Tony
So delusion 😢😢😢 sad clown Tony so confidant  he's ready to cry 😢😢😢😢 but he feels great😅😅😅paddy not my fave but ge must retire  Tony the toothless tiger😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
I’m scared for paddy . Tony might beat the shit out of him
naaaaaaaah time to catch that 6th L in a row.
This guy needs to be in a sanatory, not fighting in. Cage! Y’all let this guy down, he’s fucken koo koo
Tony has that “dont give a fuck” Diaz vibe.
tony for the win
Win or loose hope Tony puts on a good show and has a good retirement
Tony is secretly training to be an international hitman after his fighting career
That smile what a champ
Tony makes little sense
It would be nuts if Tony had one more crazy run in him. Could you imagine Tony butchers Paddy and the blood flips the switch on to Boogeyman mode.  I was Team Tony from the beginning of his UFC career and I’m Team Tony until his last fight. Tony is admired from his fan base. I hope he knows it
I love Tony's fighting style, but he is full blown insane... he really needs some mental help.  Hopefully after this next fight, he will retire and get some help.
The only interview I was waiting for
It’s Tony time boys….
Only time I’m ever rooting for paddy
Tony don’t even believe himself lol
Tony the type of guy to say he's not here to have fun, tell an interviewer to stop talking when he's talking, and then say he's having fun.
let go tony
Keep going el cuckoo...keep going. Dont stop. Keep going. Let your body stop on its own.
Such a legend. LFG
Tony needs to retire.
Enjoy it Bc this is your last pre fight interview
Paddy has absolutely nothing to gain fighting tony but he has EVERYTHING TO LOOSE.... I pray tony wrecks him
New mythical fighter unlocked 🔓   Chief goggins trained Tony
I think Tony is going to make Paddy revaluate his career path 😂
Cage walls and ketchup sandwiches
Better not underestimate Tony mans a hitter!!!
Did Tony really just say he wants to be a doctor?
One of the best.  True legend.  I believe in his prime. He was best P4P
Tony the type of guy to ask a guy a question, then tell him to stop talking 😂
You now he lost the last fights but i think they where moneyfights.. chandler,justin,beniel, oliviera, bobby green... and all in a short time and getting ko'd and STILL positive not complaning amazing humanbeing tony.."YOU WILL GET THE WIN TONY" show it to him 😉
Man, this sounds like he's trying to convince himself he's Tony again. Best of luck, sir.
Checked the betting odds to find Tony to be the outsider! Shocked Tony will win better returns for me
tony has such cop energy
Tony is the Man 👊
Bro Tony is definitely gonna turn back the clock.. No way in hell he is gonna let Fatty Patty win..NO WAY I BELIEVE IN YOU 💨💨💨🐐
Yikes
What the f*k......🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hoping Tony wins and ends his career off with a bang 🙏🙏🙏
Man Tony looks like he is shaking...i hope he wins, then i hope he retires. Wish him the best
10:48 🩸
Poor guy .. life is in shambles....just retire and raise those kids man you look crazy sound crazy it actually  looks bad on ufc for letting you fight clearly unstable.. the guy wants to were sunglasses while he fights he ruined his career over sunglasses.. doesn't realize how bad he looks .. he used to b good now he's a washed up bum .. just stop guy please it's embarrassing
Wow Tony is kind of looking like young Tony. He looks different
Did the mic make a difference??
How do u read that headline and not watch
Tony the type of guy to not realize he’s the butt of the joke.
Ok Tony dont let the door hold u back on the way out. Dont like Paddy but U acting like U dont give a fuk shows that u really give a fuk and are scared to lose to a comedy show
Tony will always be  my  favorite fighter And I'll always root for him 😎
It's obvious the media see Tony as a joke now. And he brings it on himself.
Delusional
We need Tony to have a nice cushy desk job after he retires  He deserves some Dana white privileged lol we love you Tony!!!
Looking forward to this fight!
Damn this is one of the most motivational dudes out there
really hope he wins this one, and just retire on a win against a hated fighter.  its very unlikely sadly but one can hope.
ketchup sandwitch huh... ... thats a good one ngl🤣
Tony is so obviously mentally insane
Him and Goggins is the best multiverse event
Tony Ferguson, the most annoying fighter in UFC history
Tony the type of guy to turn his chair around and stay standing
Tony is the type of guy to fight with shades on if he could 😎
The most delusional person in the world, currently.
Tony Time Bitches WOOOOO
Tony the type of guy to be on a losing streak and win one fight to retire and say he’s the best fighter in mma 😂😂😂 what a clown.
Always the same talk, always Khabib. He's stuck in the past, he'll end up bad, he has Chris Benoit vibes.
T. Ferg gonna panty ram Paddy the fatty.
Tony is the type of guy to tell himself hold on brother
Please Universe🙏🙏🙏
I wish he'd stop saying chief, so weird lol
He is a character ,good luck .dr. Ferguson x
Not a fan 😱 sorry but I’m not. Fuk fatty too. Can’t wait to watch though 🔥
I got Tony and Wonderboy. Get at me.
Any Time I See Tony, I Give Hime My Entire Attention And All My Support! THANK YOU EL CUCUY.  LETS BEAT THAT PIGLET
Yall... this is almost sad. Tony needs to win. Crush paddy cakes bud.
Tony the type of guy to give Goggins motivational talks in-between rounds
CSO
Goggins rook away Tony's humanity
Beautiful words from a unique man
Tony’s the type of guy to turn Paddy fat in the middle of the ring. 💪🏻
Win or lose tony ferguson is the man.... El Cucey lets do this 💪
We hope Tony is right. Lets go Tony! 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Imagine Dr. Tony operating on patients with vicious precise elbows. I'd trust him with my life.
The Tony era was one of the best of all time in the UFC. Great memories.
Big Khabib fan. I want Tonny to win before he announces retirement
PLEASE TONY ONE LAST TIME
Thank you Tony for all your amazing work I think your a legend of the sport. Best of luck Saturday 😊
Tony's the type of guy to start talking without knowing what he's going to say.
I wish I could take him serious.  How times have changed 😂😂
Tony is back. This is everything I want to hear. KICK HIS A$$
Will support tony till the end of time dude is awesome.
Tony looks really really good..... nice!
I feel sad for this guy man ...This is like that once badass uncle who you have doing all the crazy shit ....
Tony may make the whole MMA community happier than ever with this particular W.
He gave that W to Nate cause he tapped so damn quickly
Tony's the type of guy who's going to get the shit beat out of him again.
*Tony Life Is Depression When He Isn’t Fighting. Have Y’all Not Hear The 911 Calls? This Dude Needs To Be In A Mental Hospital*
Are you here for business or are you here for having fun? I don’t understand. Are you taking it serious or are you having fun? You said both things I don’t understand what he says. He’s a weirdo
I dont think paddy is gonna handle the amount of pain tony gonna dish out
Colby’s fighting for the title and Tony may be fighting for his job…
You can just tell most fighters deal with some type of mental illness. Very few healthy people get into this line of work
El Cucuy ❤
Jumped on youtube to watch the last Sunday sermon speech from Dr M.L.K, stayed for tony ferguson
In his last fight, Tony was looking real good until the eye poke. That eye poke messed up his momentum or something
Hope he wins and then quits.
YOU GOT THIS TONY WE ARE ALL SUPPORTING YOU
Tony is a joke. He’s not better then he was not the same him that’s true worst
Tony is the toughest man born of a woman. Just ask Tony.
This isn't comfortable. Toney is unhinged. We all feel uncomfortable for a reason. You're lying to yourself if you think otherwise.
So remember that football player that killed a few people. Even tho he had everything and millions.  So he's brain was so messed up from brain trauma.  Tany might have some serious brain trauma. Listen to is past few fight interviews. Hope is he's okay and just crazy and not brain shrinkish
I think even after this Tony needs to go
Your a legend Tony 🔥
He desperately need a win here
Tony, you are being serious this entire press conference. You WANT to be heard. STOP playing yourself dude. You WANT to show out. So shut up with the lying. I hope you win, but you are terrible at this talking trait
Lol they are quiet cuz they can't believe you are alive. .. no hate. . Love me some boogie man. Finally a fight you can win. Just don't do any of that turning your back shit.
Sick interview. El cucuy is the man
I know we're all being collectively delusional and loving Ferguson, but his personality is baaaaaaad. He's extremely unlikeable and he doesn't show a very healthy mind/attitude. Will always love him as a fighter but wow, I'd hate to hang out with him while he's like this.
Tony sucks now🙄
Regardless of it all thank you for all the memories Tony
Dream scenario:  Tony and paddy meet in the octagon, back and forth first round,  then Tony turns it up hotter than the coals of hell in round 2 and 3 and dices paddys face up with hellbows and constant pressure. He finishes the "sorcerer" as cody Gbrant says, lol He lays his gloves in the middle of the octagon and leaves victorious with a performance of the night bonus. He can do it man lets go
Tony looks like he eats ketchup sandwiches
Tonys the type of guy who says he doesnt do the social media/youtube stuff and then  later monologues about cutting and editing his instagram stories.
🫶
this title on the video is exactly how i want to see tony
LFG TONE!
We love ya Tony! ❤
lol forever his wigs and crowds lol 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂
Colby also trains really hard. He trains with Camron Haynes and he is cut from the same cloth as Goggins. Camron is who David trains with a lot. I think it would be fair to say Colby is another fight that would train with David. I know one thing David does to start training people. After that 3 hour work out Tony was talking about he then runs 4 miles. Then he wakes them up 4 hours later. Makes them run 4 miles every 4 hours for 48 hours.😂 While still doing work outs and all the other mental stuff. He just does that to get them dead ass tired like they do in BUDS. Then when you have nothing left in the tank he will start to test your will and not your strength.
Does anyone know the name of that watch on Tony ?
Please Tony, give a great weigh in scream. You do much better in the Octagon when you do.
Does anyone know what kind of watch that is ? I’d gladly appreciate it .
There,there, grandpa, it’s time to take your  meds!
Babayaga
Even khabib rooting for tony!!! Hope he can finish Owen Hart on Saturday
“You guys are always so quiet” “everyone say what’s up”   Smh, I feel bad man. No one really cares that he’s there, but no one has the nuts to tell him that.   Tony, keep your head up and get into coaching bro, stop doing this to yourself, you’ve done your thing 💪🏼
Tony is the type of guy to wake up his kids at 12 o’clock to tell them it’s past their bedtime.
This guy will always be an asshole lmaooo he's about to take his 7th loss to a bum
Paddy is going to die
paddy is in trouble, tony is in killing mode
Tony’s about to knock Paddy out
Bro...Tony. your social media, sucks. You have the power to UP your image. We are NOT gonna watch regardless. We watch when it's good content
After he wins, he’ll knock out Islam, he’s just entering his prime
Its Tony that type of guy ? 😂
LETS FUCKIN GO TONY! ITS ABOUT THEM BOATS AND LOGS MOTHERFUCKER!!!!!
Champ shit only
People’s champion
Long run. No more CTE. Thank you for all of the years of bangers. Paddy is gonna get that dub tho
This is a win win for me cause i dont like tony or paddy
He sounded the same lady time. What a nut
I'd rather he loses this one and retires than win it only to lose the next one. I cant do it anymore
This first round is going to be nerve racking to say the least were either going to witnessed a great comeback or a great downfall 👀
Thank you for every single fight! Win lose or draw. Every fight was special and you are one of my favorite fighters! 💪🔥
Tony is back.... For another ass kicking!
Let's go toney fucking boogie mans back!
Best of luck El Cucuy. Win lose or draw. You are one of the best ever.
tony ferguson the type of guy to say he’s not here to have fun then tell everyone he’s having fun
Few athletes are this universally loved. We hope you can feel the positivity and adoration Tony
Tony rambling on like this got me worried about him..... He always goes on a tangent in his interviews but this was different..........
I love Tony!
It's up to you now Tony to prove once and for all, tjat scouser can be knocked out 😂
Tony is the type of guy to fill in his footsteps in the snow so that nobody follows him to the dojo
Lmfao this dude is a clown.
Tony Ferguson should have his on Podcast or something. He has really good charisma and personality..... He doesn't need to fight anymore
Tony is really mentally unwell. Seriously needs psychiatric help 😢😢
LoL if this is his retirement fight hopefully he goes out with a banger ... And hopefully Goggins over training him doesn't bite him in the ass.
Mr Morgan where you at.  Hope all is well.
Tony got subbed by Bobby Green.  Stop.
Does he talk about these machines he has built for the UFC, high school wrestling and football in this one?
Mr Morgan where you at.  Hope all is well.
I was crushed in 2018 when the cursed fight was cancelled, crushed when Tony lost to Justin, but I’ll support the boogeyman thru and thru
Tonys done, we can all see it
I'll put my money on paddy if I lose I'll still be happy that tonny wins so it's a win win for me 😂
el cucuy will win..i was a fan of paddy but hes fuckin delusional he really thinks he won the fight against gordon lol!
If Tony doesn't get the W, he definitely should retire.
Calling men boys is never ok smh
Tony “says alley-oop 12 times” Ferguson
CSO 🇺🇸🇲🇽
When paddy looses to the guy who got taken out for 6 months by an extension cord is gonna be funny AF.
Tony the type of guy in class, that everybody is quiet after he gets done speaking. Because it's cringe. And nobody takes serious
Negative fight iq
Tony be lookin like a 50 yo retoired skaytborda
CSO CSO CSO
If only he got the Khabib fight one of those times>
CSO
tonys a bit#h. he wants respect but dont want to respect others!!!
Man i’m gonna miss Tony
Tony the type of guy to record the recorders
TONY!!!!!!!!
My first time Experiencing tony Fergeson was the press conference interview for the Anthony Pettis fight when he came back from his injury and I was like what the fuck who is this guy he is pissed. I love the dude win or lose
Media gotta have more energy for my boy tony bruh if it was strickland theyd all be wetting their pants ready to be ridiculed by him
I have feeling Goggins has installed the winning mind set back in Tony
👺 🎤 : Hold up brother I’m talking!
Tony is the type of guy to tell people it’s classified and then explain the details and clarification. Legend - blades and shades
Tony don't want it to be over. But, he knows this is it. But what else do he do after fighting?
CSO
Please retire bro. Tony gets mad at comments like this but as a lifelong fan of his, watching him these last couple of years has been very difficult knowing he's only contributing to more damage and lower quality of life for his future. He did his thing he's a legend, geridet off in the sunset man what are you doing
2nd interview he’s brought up the lando venatta win he got half a decade ago😂😂😂. I hope Tony gets destroyed, he’s a piece of crap
Shades and blades baby
Tony is a legend but he's looking old af with a big loss streak (all against killers but still), it will be very interesting to see how he performs against Paddy.
Tony is losing it.Sad to see that.  Thank you for the wonderful fights
“Hold on brotha I’m talkin” Never gets old. Huge fan of Tony, rooting for him to school Paddy the Fatty. 💯⚔️⚔️👊🏾
Hold on brotha I'm talking haha
Tony is bout to get beat up by paddy
Tony gonna carry the boats and the logs 😤👊🏻
please win tony !
Ive got 56k on tony winning first round via flying reverse gogoplata
Let's hope that the version of Tony that fought RDA and Barboza shows up even for 30 seconds. Wouldn't mind him getting a DQ win either... Anyway; Greek tragedy.
Paddy is almost laughably inept but nevertheless this fight has really sad ending written all over itself.  Tony has that aura that Mike Tyson had back when Tyson fought the likes of Danny Williams and Kevin McBride.  Looks like the same guy.  Sounds like the same guy.  Acts like the same guy.  Isn't the same guy.
I'm not here to have fun, someone's getting cut. Shut the f*ck up I'm having fun, I'm not serious. -Tony
LET'S GO CHAMP!! CHAMPSHITONLY!!
This man has serious mental issues, his wife and kids are in major danger, it’s another Chris Benoit in the making. Pray for that man’s family.
Tony Ketchup Sandwich Ferguson
He nuts man
Ok so paddy takes alot of shots...BIG TIME.. but i wouldnt want to face him on his average night in the ring
Good to see T in good spirits. Bro is looking & sounding good. He needs to gas Paddy out, be patient for a couple of rounds & then summon pre Justin El Cucuy to finish him - go out on a high note.
It’s Tony time
Me da una tristeza cuando lo veo con esa actitud sabiendo que está acabado
Tony is awesome but most likely his last fight , can’t see how he wins.
Let’s go paddy
all it takes is for me to see a Tony media day interview to know he's gonna go out there try his best and lose. Sucks to see but he should of got that Title fight so long ago and so much has happened since then that its just a big bummer. He's going out the BJ Penn route and it shouldn't be that way.
Wish Tony the best in his life, but I'm done listening to the narcissism. It's tired now.
Tony is the type of guy to record people recording him
Respect Tony support you until the end. Thanks for inspiration no matter what happens you were a legit champion undisputed or not causals think IC isn’t a real belt when it literally is it’s just not undisputed. Also the circumstances around him getting and losing it were both out of his control. One of the best 155lb fighters in history in his prime top 5-6 lightweight ever.
Tony said the same exact shit 6 straight media days😂
Hey Tony, Do those ears get ESPN? Lol 😆
The last thing Tony should be doing is talking about turning people into a meme
12 fight winning streak to a 7 fight losing streak. Absolutely brutal
Tony’s trash talk is top 5 worst in UFC history. Tied with Tito Ortiz😂
Comon Tony do it for Houdini
7:57 “hold on brother, I’m talking” 😂😂 classic
Came in happy, started in pissed. Tony, I wish you good health this weekend.
Sooo Tony goes though Goggins (Chief) just to get Stopped vs Paddy by the ref 😭😭😭 Please let him Fight
So crazy, I never liked him until he went off the cliff. Now, I'm ready to sacrifice Paddy just to see Tony with a glimmer of hope again...
Damn tony got the fucked up romero eye thing going on
Tony the type of guy to loose just so the losers don't feel lonely
Team Tony, coming from the UK. Paddy needs to be humbled
No matter what happens, Blades and Shades forever… 🔪 😎
Tony will rain elbows on this mushmouth
let's go Tony//beat  ah pot of gold out of that laddie
Tony is the type of guy to interview himself at his own press conference
I hope this isnt his last one.
You're the man Tony 🙌
My favorite UFC fighter period but damn my boy is not lookin the same hope he puts on a show and calls it a career
Pretty sure Paddy gonna turn his face into mush
Good luck tonny ❤❤❤❤
It's Tony Time,   bitches
Tony gonna get finished brutally what a shame
Come on El Cucuy when this one for the people!🫵
one last ride 🤞🏽
Everyone is silent because you’re done bro… they don’t want to see you get murdered the way you did last 2-3 fights. So sad he’s still here
He seems in good spirits this time around, hoping he gets the W
You have to have been real broke to even know about ketchup sandwiches
He should have not said this “I’m gonna turn his face into a ketchup sandwich”☠☠
Tony's the type of guy to main event a PPV in the middle of the card.
That intro warms all the hearts of the loyal El Cucuy fans.
Cte vs annoying sorcier
Tony eats his cerial with a fork
"chief Goggins" 🤣
Tony Ferguson is out here proving that age is just a number.  Mind over matter.  If you don't mind it don't matter.  Still believe Tony can make another championship run and reclaim that gold.  Nobody has more heart than this man.  CSO! EL Cucuy ARMY STAND UP!
Come on Tony
Tony Ferguson is the type of guy  to make me be THIS D@MN EARLY !
If this is the last ride Tony, thank you boogeyman
CSO
