Its a skit
The classic king sacrifice
In the game of chess you can never let your adversary see your pieces
Fun fact: This is called Fool's Mate
what happen
FAKE.  they made it for the views and attention
"I lose in chess" is what a I read           :)
losing on the menu screen
LMAOOOO HIS FACE
4 moves were played
0:17 the exact moment she realized she won, lmao.
😅😅😅😅😅
you never open by sides lalalala
0:23 🤨
Judging her reaction, she initially thought he was joking and losing on purpose. XD
The funniest part is how the music cuts off when he gets fools mated (shoutout to Airship Fortress)
Bro blundered his life
Wait… Are you sure she is not grandmaster
That was avocado
I did this once 😅 My dad immediately showed me what happened while playing against him and warned me against making that mistake again
This man's talent is being the stupidest person in the room while radiating the most convincing level of confidence. He sounds like he knows what he's doing, and you BELIEVE him, and then he does this.
The old fools mate
The face she puts after winning is absolutely diabolical 😭😭😭
Im trying to best the 3200 bot
This was the first clip I ever saw of Schlatt
Fools mate
I learned more in 10 minutes than hours of Googling
Does anyone know the music name in the video?
He somehow did perfect fool's mate 😂

schlatt never move your f pawn
Bro got fool’s mated 💀
Mood instantly lifted. Thank you for this
I can t stop smiling watching this
Isn’t this called the Fool’s Mate? Or am I thinking of something else?
This is the Fool’s Mate btw, because Schlatt was a fool
I didn t expect to love this as much as I do
This gave me chills… in the best way
Pure talent. No words
This checkmate shows how little he knows about chess since is literally called “fools mate”
Never leave your wing man
Well darling it is a basic kids starter level end.hapoemedctonalk of us !!
Lol
Staged
Out of all possible opening moves, Schlatt picked the only wrong one. 😅
This is staged. It's called fool's mate, and it's so specific and terrible that you have to be actively trying to pull it off.
He already knew the two-move checkmate.  He was just hitting up on her.
Wait what? What happened?
Alex must have forgotten about the two move mate she had on Schlatt.
fake video
Just looking at that checkmate makes me feel anxious and uncomfortable
And he wrote ''I love chess'' on a board at the background 😂
Tenan aku sumpah ketokan gulu ta lakoni
the fuck is a schlatt
Lmao 🤣
My man speedran losing chess with the classic Fool's Mate.  You basically kicked open the door to your king's house with g4, then you unlocked it and rolled out the red carpet with f3. The queen just had to walk in.  Next time, just bring the horse out to f3. It's the bouncer that stops the queen at the door. EZ clap.
foolmate
This is also known as the “fools mate“ 😅😅
I search the longest chess game in history and this is what pops out
Shocked, befuddled, one might even say... confounded 😂
Btw that's called a Fool's Mate
It’s staged 💔🥀
She was doing the most basic and predictable strat too
Máte problém….   Dojedete na to….  Myslite si, ze s vama neco hraju….   Budete si to tak dlouho myslet, ze ani nemrknete a budete v pici…
out of the trillions of chess moves he could have possibly played he chose the worst one 💀
Worst opening move I've seen... He was basically asking for it!
“I’m not overthinking it.” “No, I think you’re underthinking it.”
Lol everybody and their mom knows the 2 move checkmate
that was furry.
fake
Fool's mate?
“AND HE SACRIFICES HIS KINGGGG”
Am I the only one who thinks this is faked? Like Schlit just asked Botez what the most clippable opening is and she told him
He got schlatt on
This a called the fool's mate which happened in one method
I have done this. For all the pieces to move first 😂😂😂 To be honest, at that time, i never thought that was possible. My mind was blown.
Schlott ive been tracking you for 1 year
Fools mate!🤣
scripted
Bro frozed in disbelief. 0:22
I would not be surprised if he knew this and did it for content
This is prearranged for the sake of getting views. Don't assume people are stupid. Play a real game of chess instead.
Jshlatt is so incredible that he discovered the only way to actually lose in 2 moves 😂
Гроб не щадит никого
This is proof that even idiots can make it big like schlatt
Andrea would’ve played the London against Schlatt
what was the plan supposed to be?
Emotional Damage
How is that even possible
wPg4 bPe5 wPf3 bQh4 mate
What was the plan there?
"Gonna get my bishop out" Proceeds to close off his bishop
I don’t think this will help, but that is literally the worst move. You can possibly ever make in a game of chess. You cannot make it easier for your opponent than that.
The real King's Gambit
Foolmate
I love the look on her face when she realized he just dickpunched himself
Listen. I'm not the greatest Chess player ever, I only know the rules and maybe a handful of strategies, and I still have to ask; How, on what world, do you fuck that up??
I love the "Schlatt?" at the end as if she doesn't know how forcefully she crushed his soul.
She in fact did not see such terrible move coming  *exposes his king** *experiences multiple emotions at once when he loses right after*
He wanted more time to shitpost.
Scripted things go so smooth 😂
According the Fritz and Chesster volume 2, this is called Fools Mate!
This seemed staged.
ahh the ooooooolddddd foool's mateeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
It's the long pause and _"Schlatt?"_ at the end that send me *every single time* 🤣
"Schlatt?.."
This is why I play Roblox.
😦.
Fastest checkmate in the West
schess
0:17 the face she made 😭😭 "man u sure??"
Never play g4 and f3 it's stupid
Schlatt really just pulled a Fool's Mate. XD
Don't tell me it is not staged. Every schoolkid knows: you mustn't move the F Pawn in the first half of the game BECAUSE OF THIS exactly.
Bro fell for fools mate
This is what taught me how to pull this off. Thanks big guy.
Schlatt getting checked in seconds is insane
You're not a genius or a good author. Choose one of them. 😅
As someone who does not know this move I actually don't understand what happened at all and none of the comments are helping, everyone is literally just piggybacking off each other with a funny on how she didn't see it coming and not actually contributing to the thread
playing chess is awesome
playing chess is awesome
fools mate, hell yeah
I learn chess, and after learning the basic, they teach you one of the moves you SHOULDN'T do: which is this one.
Fools Mate is wild
schlatt.exe has stopped responding
fake as fuck
How?
The Schlatt opening
the "schlatt?" at the end of the video makes it perfect
LMAO
Man knew that if he would sacrifice his king he won't lose...  And he went for thaat tactic. GENIUS....
"Is now a bad time to mention i don't know how to play chess?"
This is the same as playing Russian roulette with a full loaded magnum, and only you are at the table
She really didn't see it coming fr
Ah yes, the Fool's Gambit...
World's first Fools mate
I mean, she didnt see it coming
Bro got hit with the fool's mate
Moving the king's window pawn.... interesting strategy.
There's no way this is real...
even martin knows this mate
I do open challenge to you if you difiest me I will pay you 500 if I win you want to pay 500 deal 🤝
Fool's Mate 🤦‍♂️
grob opening: schlatt variation
Still as a statue 😭
OI SCHLATT. i watched all ur yt shorts today. can you please give me some more?
……… 😂
> get the bishop out > next move blocks in the bishop
I remember in middle school this kid was really into chess and said he was really good so I was like let me show ya something 🥲 👹Me seeking revenge on anyone from losing 95% of the time against my father. He was homeless living in a tiny camper and during the summer we would play chess and shoot guns 😎 I beat that kid 2 times moving the center pawn up don't understand why he didn't remember the 1st time and the 3rd time I just used my knights 😂
To the redditor who brought me here, if you seriously believe this is real, you're a fool.
His reaction is peak
Checkmate!
the amount of people that think this is legitimate...
He plays the worst opening move and immediately Blunders in the so called Fools mate
I love how she sold the basic chess line. He should have paused the second she said that.
the silence was loud
Same moves i suffered the same checkmate
Xqc moment
nah he set himself up for that, there was no reason to touch that second pawn
But seriously what was he going for here
Fools mate there
Thats called the fools gambit lol
Nonironically this is called "the *fool's* mate"
This was scripted, but fun.
Scripted
Fool's mate
"Gotta develop my bishop"  *Blocks the bishop completely*
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why does this have so many views?
I LOST LIKE THIS AND I BET LIKE 10 $ ON IT LMAOO
he lost so fast he has to turn this video into a short
Fun fact: this particular checkmate setup is called a "Fools game" or something along those lines. I have fallen victim to this too, despite liking and playing chess  (Also you can loose this way with one move too)
Indian bee like
Fools checks
As someone who has no understanding of chess, how on earth did she win? You have to either get your king and/or queen to the other side, or get the other players king and/or queen out right? Or was it just her king… checkmating his own pawns?  In simple terms folks.
my dad did that, but he was black, and lost in one move!
True kings gambit
His face at the end!!! 🤣🤣🤣 That is the look of a man rethinking his life decisions!
And he sacrifices THE KING
isnt this that shligger?
Schlaggot is a moron so him even attempting to play chess is hilarious
King Gambit
💀 I'm just gonna play simple chess 💀
Rule Nr. 17  You can't lose if you have already lost.
They call it the fool’s mate because if you play it, you are a fool, sorry big man.
Schlatt can't play, he lost 2 towers 💀
“i’m a moron youtube viewer and i can’t tell when something is fake because i believe everything i see. and i voted for kamala”
Checkmate Speedrun Any%
THAT EVIL ASS SMIRK WHEN SHE SAW A MATE IN 1
bro is dumbfounded that he set himself up for the fool's mate
Literally me
For the people calling him stupid, you all know it was a bit right?
Kino
I am keeping myself from laughing to keep schlatts dignity just a little bit.
I love the look on her face as she leans in to the monitor like “is this guy really that dumb”
The expression on her face was perfect. Like… “are you serious?”
“she’s not gonna see this one coming” well neither did schlatt see whats coming
Bro got humiliated 😂😂😂
Everyone has been talking about how to win with the least moves possible, but what about losing
The gremlin pose she pulls. I love her and relate to her simultaneously
that “Schlatt?” at the end lmao
Dang this looked so real 3 years ago, time erodes mountains huh.
fool’s mate is wild
If I remember correctly, this is called a "Fool's Mate." I've never seen it done in a real match, but it's always fun to hear about
Uh, you can still castle?
this is the fast game ever i seen 😂😂
It's funny seeing everyone commenting here as if Jschlatt obviously didn't do this on purpose.
brilliant play by Schlatt in terms of creating content and viral clip. Well played.
"shes not going to see this coming" Pulls a fool's mate Yeah bud, i don't think anyone would see such a idiot move coming
I feel like he did this on purpose for the clip
Fake
Half of me wants to say he did it on purpose.
I'm gonna do what is NOT called a pro-gamer move.
I had a friend who lost in 2 moves, he is so bad
Am I the only one here who thinks this is completely staged…
And that ladies and gentlemen is what you call a "Fool's mate"
ahaha classic gayshatt
how the she won the  game ?!?! she didn't slay the white king ...
Bro got the fools mate
Imagine opening a piece that literally will hinder you from developing your important pieces. I'm a 600 elo chess player and I even have the guts to say Schlatt is a real egghead (sarcasm).
the throbbing mate in all its glory
Fools Mate baby.  It’s an important milestone.
this is so funny . her lean before she checkmates him is 😭😭😭😭
Billions of movements and he choose literally the one he looses in 2 moves😂😂
Se corrió rápido
I just found out this clip is staged. My life is in complete shambles right now
The silence is sooooo loud ong
Thomas Daniel Jones Melissa Thompson Michael
Fake game.
“It can’t be that easy…”  “…It’s that easy.”
“Schlatt?”
He's face 😂
This is so fake
No way this is not scripted 😅
It's called fool's mate for a reason
This is the “fool’s mate” right
lesson learned: dont end up in schlatts position
This is a peak comedy
kukich
For those who don't know what happened, type in fool's mate in Google.
Don't worry, schlat. Everyone fell for it at one time.
Staged, ain't no way it's not.
Losing at chess is so cringe
Fool's Mate
Is this real?
😂😂😂
i remember my teacher told me that NEVER MOVE THE F PAWN
"She's not gonna see this one coming," He was so confident and instantly got checkmated
I somehow underestimated his stupidity. And I mean that in a good way
when u search in youtube 'how to play chess fast' the youtube recommends this video on top Great job youtube
fake, staged
Im not a chess expert, so exactly what happened here?
dude, thats like one of the oldest of tricks.... i knew this when i was little........
This is one of the most obviously staged things I've ever seen. What are the odds Schlatt plays the literal quickest checkmate possible. Clip farming.
scripted
Alternative title: Fool gets fool's mated
I would also lose it to her in 2 moves
I would also lose it in 2 moves
The foolsmate
schlatt
Kings Gambit right here
You are right she did not see that coming 😅😅
that pawn was part of the prince's faction and he helped him assasinate the king
What is this opening called?
Something about the sideburn dude from Texas play chess and spontaneously lose make me happy.
She got him with the continental ballistic missile strike
I have absolutely zero clue what just happened or why that’s a win, but that face Schlatt made is priceless lol
Ain't no way bro lost to Andrea Botez 💀
not scripted at all............
All true.  She didn't see it coming.  He didn't either, but you know.
Schlatt stopped smiling so fast 😭😭😭
"There is only 1/14,000,604 way loose the game in 2 steps"  This guy: yes
I did that to my elder brother, he was annoying me after i taught him chess and i had a headache.. I said to him that if i beat him, he would never insist when i decline. And he agreed. I didn't even know this move had a special name or something, it was just natural.. Easiest bet of my life.
See coming what? He's a clown and did it on purpose
clip farming fs
how the hell did he do this.🪨
I am so surprised to see there's no comment like "Men of culture we gather again." 'Cause I think he did it on purpose. The purpose -  well that needs no explaining
xqc vs moist type shit
i know nothing about chess, could somebody explain what just happened like im 5?
jschlatt sacrafices... THE KING!!!
Bro fell for the fools mate💀💀💀
This has to be fake he quite literally made the only move that makes it possible to lose in two moves out of 1327 openings
There are nearly 10 million variations in chess after 3 moves. Schlatt probably did it randomly and found the fastest checkmate in chess.
J-schlatt just wanted the achievement.
This was clearly planned lol
There isn't actually a secret plan, right? Besides presenting a two move checkmate
She saw it coming bro
😱
Bro found a second way to disappoint a woman in 10 seconds.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
"Get the bishop out" Bishop: Dude i'm TRAPPED
This is what he gets after playing the Barnes opening
how is that even possible
The best part is, she was gonna try and do the “check mate in four moves” strat… and ended up doing it in 2
Light Yagami vs Columbo in a nutshell
What a king sacrifice. Beautiful beyond compare
If the queens were replaced by amazons then fools mate would never exist. In other words if the queen could also move like a knight then fools mate would never be possible.
Funny
You are a different species my friend
Bro loet to a fools mate
Fun but definitely "not fake". Lol
Lmaoooooo
I have watched this an ungodly amount of times, and I still don't understand. She put the queen next to his pawn. That's not even a checkmate. Is there a special rule I just don't know?
We need a moment of silence 🗿
I love this
"schlambit" made a devious misplay
me with the grenade taped to a boomerang: "they'll never see this coming" (so I can't throw very well but the aerodynamic shape of the boomerang means that even if I suck I'll be able to hit my target)
This guys is called 'schlatt' for a reason
Bro got fools mated 💀
heheheh, shes not going to see this one coming gets mated in 2 moves
who let bro cook
This borders on my favorite video of all time
And he sacrificed THE KING
so he more stoopid than xqc
This is the chess drake was playing 😂
Moving the G2 pawn is an immediate first cue for the shortest checkmate 😭
Is it bad i have accidentally done this before
It's called the Fool's Mate for a reason...
HE DID THE GROB.  OF COURSE HE WAS GONNA EAT SHIT EVEN IF HE DIDN'T GET FOOL'S MATED
This is so staged. Really wish I would have avoided this clickbait. I’m disappointed with myself. 😣
Is this tutorial?
He was right she didn't saw it coming
She was totally going for the 4 move finish and when he opened himself for the 2 move finish she just said, "mmk, let's do that instead."
the “Schlatt…” at the end is comedy gold
no one’s gonna say that this was probably planned?
Someone please explain this hannabal from Carthage move or I'm gonna spend three years watching this to figure it out
You can't be serious. Clearly his first game
To be honest... WHO wouldnot see that. I ABSOLUTLY understand her expresion
BGM source please
"I'm just going to play simple chess ... Nothing to see here"  I think she said that to put Schlatt's guard down. Remember, she is a competitive pro.
Scripted as fuck
Rule 1 of playing Chess. Never leave an opening to your King
Me whenever I try to play Chess:
Only way this is done is intentionally.
His second move in the dumbest move I've ever seen. Did he think that was the queen instead of the king? If this isn't staged, I don't understand his thinking on that move.
The moment I saw the Queen's opening, I knew...
Haha her eyes moving over was the cherry on top lmfao 😂
That silence at the end was so bad it somehow closed my YouTube app.
I probably would have lost the same. How did that even work? The piece moved so many spaces
"she's never gonna see this coming" **commits suicide**
Nahh you see how fast his face changed😂  Be like: 😈😧😨🤨
His face was amazing
I got hit this exact same move during my chess early days 💀
LMFAO @  people in the comments thinking this isn't staged.
I love the little moment of silence where she looks closer into the screen like "is this actually happening?"
0:15 “She’s not gonna see this one coming.”  0:22 *Schlatt.exe has stopped working*
her smile is so fking devious 😭
I'm laughing so hard, I'm wheezing!!!🤣🤣
Chess version of a far away headshot
That is the only way in the whole game of chess to lose in 2 moves and schlatt did it😂
Fake
O_O That's a good move.
THAT'S POSSIBLE?!
I’ve successfully managed to win this way twice. Felt freakin awesome
Well he is a moron 😂
This has happened to me lol
There are more possible games of chess then there are atoms in the observable universe, and you played the worst one.
dude somehow lost in 14 seconds
I love how she's like "he can't be serious..."
Even if he didn't blunder Fool's Mate, that's just a terrible opening. The right bishop and knight are trapped, the king is exposed, and the opponent easily takes control of the center.
fake
:3
would have been funny if it wasnt obviously scripted
Staged, unfunny
a irreparable blunder
Schlatt is a genius - knowing about the Scholar’s mate and turning it into content
Lmao
This man managed to get mated in less moves than scholar's mate. I'm impreseed
Good show for clowns by two clowns
The Schlatt System
You can see the confusion on her face, only to follow it up with a Gargamel
😂😂😂😂😂
Never let them know your next move
This is the moment I became a Botez fan ahahah
L skit
I like how he chuckles at her look of disbelief cuz he thinks he's like outsmarted her lol
Her face! 😂😂
I guess I'm a pleb, goy, working class asshole, but in what universe can the king just glide around the board like a bishop? I'm very confused.
I’m so confused how does chess work
I didn't know fools mate could actually happen irl 😂💀
This is literally the only way to lose in 2 moves and he did it
Сколько раз я это пересматриваю И только понял что наш слоняра, Шлатт, попытался ЗАДВИНУТЬ
What was his plan?
That's kigs gambit. After queen takes white king, white queen takes black. And we all know queen is more powerful than king. He's a genius
She didn't see it coming. She was a little confused when he made his second move
the look on his face after he realized he shcrewed up
I refuse to believe he didn't do this on purpose, he sacrificed his dignity for a funny moment, a true hero
Yeah, i bet she didnt see THAT coming
Alert with those Psychos guy's the guy had issues for touched men's and the girl love to be naked and promoting her hustle online 😏
Alert with those phych
Who's on the fucking hell this randoms people are on my site 😅😂😂😂
This is scripted
Schlong had a flashback of the events of '99 after this checkmate
Im pretty sure the worst first move is G4
Its called Idiots Mate in my lanuage
He didn't lose braincells they just quit
HOW
When i was learning to play chess I decided to challenge my older brother. He destroyed me with this move. I swore off chess for life. XD
her reaction when he does it lol
Ive won in 3 moves before... any real chess player knows exactly the play Im talking about... but never 2 lmfao
When its checkmate in less than 5 moves, it's called "Fool's  mate."
Not staged at all
THROBBING
Bro said he was good after playing the grob (the worst opening tho people say f3 is ) and then litter,y losing the game in the fastest way
Wow, there's no way to lose faster, you are right man, she wasn't gonna see that one coming 😄
Knowing what bs schlatt pulls, it's on purpose... and it's hilarious.
She looked so confused, she literally did not see it coming 😂
Impressive speed run tactic if the goal is to lose
I will never understand this game
How did he manage to do the one move that can get him checkmated the fastest and still think he was pulling a fast one
The great Bobby Fischer put out a "How to play Chess" book back in the 1980s.  Along with the various instructions on the mechanics of the game, there were examples of moves that he made against opponents during his many tournaments, and one of them was exactly this. His opponent opened up his King just like Schlatt did, and Bobby won the round in two moves.  Ever since reading that book, I have waited nearly 40 years to have an opponent open up their King like that, and no one, to my great disappointment, ever did.  To see this, now, was amazing!
You guys don't get it. Dude is playing 4D chess here. It's the best way to get pity sex from a hot girl
He had to have done that on purpose there's no way
"She's not gonna see THIS one coming! I PLAY POT OF GREED, WHICH ALLOWS ME TO DRAW THREE CARDS FROM MY DECK"
He still hit that so who’s the real loser here?
Botez gambit Vs Botez variation
He definitely did this on purpose. There is only one possible way to lose in two moves. He definitely looked up beforehand what the fastest way to lose was.
dude, that's literally the fastest way to checkmate someone
Not funny.
Can someone explain what happened?
I really don’t get it…
Yes, that is something we’ve all encountered before when learning.   It’s called the Fool’s Mate.
I could pull this move off, no diff.
I have legitimately lost a game of chess in this way. It impressed my chess teacher.
bro cmon you gullible people
Nobody gives a shit if it's fake, people. It's funny, it's entertaining, and that's all that matters.
He won. Because she couldn’t guess this one coming.
I dont wanna brag but i saw that coming she literally femoved the pawn that stopped the queen from movin 😂
“Schlatt?”
Pssssst, it's cause they set it up ahead of time.
Fake
She def didnt see your loss coming.
The legendary girl from Charlie vs xQc
Real vs fake   fake:  huh?
What song is
Well shit
Woooooooooooooow 😮 My head hurts now lolol wth
JSchlatt.exe has stopped working please refer to you’re jschlatt rebooting manual for instructions
Either this is fake or you're an idiot.
This clip never gets old
google en assdumb
*B*  *R*   *U*    *H*
No idea what happened but this was entertaining
I don't know chess so idk how he lost.
Totally organic and definitely not scripted right...
Anyone else think he looks like the newer version of Captain Price from MW?
Can someone explain how she won?
a
why does this instant check? theres so many pieces in the way, stupid game game sux
Obvious fake. Nobody can be that stupid.
Alex literally leaned in and thought to herself: "He really did the fool's mate on stream.."
"Chess is my passion" (tm)
Her face saids really that’s it
His other head was doing the thinking
Scripted
Idk how chess works. What exactly did happen here?
Can someone please explain how this is possible because I don’t know chess.
I love the look she gave after he made his second move, she’s like “Now is the time.” 😂
probably staged like most youtubers
I feel like he half-remembered the Sicilian defense, except only black can play that, and it’s queen’s bishop pawn that’s supposed to move first.
That look she gave at the end was disturbing yet a big turn-on! 😀
wait what happened how did blud lose i do NOT know stuff about chess
0:18 she’s really like “ain’t no way”
God I hate how streamers force fake entertainment
I have seen "adult movies" with better actors 😂
Okay, what just happened?  I've never played chess, so I have _no idea_ what the rules are (apart from how the goal is to kill your opponent's king). How did she instantly win by killing one of his pawns? I mean, none of her pieces were anywhere near his king. So, did Schlatt somehow checkmate _himself,_ or something?
Humbled
I remember an Asian kid doing this shit to me in 3rd grade chess club. I felt stupid af.
Womp womp
crazy how he lost to a FIDE master that hikaru defeated while he was blindfolded 💀 difference in abilities is astonishing
Fake as hell
Me: “Hey dad, wanna game of chess?” Dad: “Ok but make it quick” Me: 0:18
0:23 LOL
0:17 Botez: "Did you really just mate yourself in two moves?"
Wow this is actually great tip.
Dumb ahh boy
"Hehehe"  *1 second later*  ":o"
His entire life ended. You can see his body no longer houses a soul.
Just the way all life leaves his eyes with this happens. You can see him dying inside.
i love how the first time i watched this i didnt even know who schlatt wass lmao
I had an old coworker who loved chess. Like he did casual tournaments. He got me with this. Funniest chess game ever.
Biggest mistery in this world is what move would Big Guy play next if he didn't got checkmate in 2.
me the entire video: NO DON'T DO F3, DON'T DO F3   schlatt:   *f3*
It is called the "Checkmate of Idiot". This is the fastest way to won in Chess.
He left himself wide-open
Anyone not playing chess right now just L bozo. You lost in 0 moves
which music is this
haha
I asked my friends to use the Schlatt gambit and it worked!
Your trash bro
Please don't accept the digit@l currency or the Artifici@l intelligence (ai) system that is coming, it is against GOD. who have ears let him hear.
JESUS  is coming soon and JESUS is the only way to salvation accept JESUS as your LORD and SAVIOR today.!
Don't take the v@čcine trust in the LORD ALMIGHTY and if you already taken it please pray to GOD about it because it is a deception.!.!.
In Norway this is often referred to as "Clown-checkmate", since you almost have to try in order to lose that fast!
Jschlatt's luck always involves him being technically right but in the most inconvenient way possible
Scripted asf
You may laugh but these are literally the beginnings of chess learning
Funny thing is I’ve done this to myself on accident lol
"....Schlatt?"
Obviously fake.
It sounds like he was trying to pull a fast one on her (maybe the four move checkmate?) but messed it up so he opened himself up for a fast one
It is staged
Schlart never fails to fill us with his meaty content
Definitely staged for content
“Get the bishop out”  *proceeds to block in the bishop*
hahahahahahahaha
reading these comments while not knowing crap about chess is enlightening
So that's the four move checkmate.
This was the ultimate "bruh" moment.
Did his ass really just get fools mated
Hes like calculating and overthinking it and THE LOOK ON HIS FACE when he realises Truly a masterpiece.
the enemy will not know what i am doing if i also do not know what i am doing - sun tzu
"yeah just watch" >Chooses the Grob
He's right. No one can see his 3rd move 😂
hi, i don't know how to play chess but i want to understand what happebed here, can someone explain what do you have to do to win?
He got so humiliated
And the Big Guy still got his 10%.
It was about the surprise, not the victory. She didn’t see that one coming.
I mean... Shlatt ain't wrong, that was probably the LAST thing she expected.
I love how not staged this is
How.
That board in the background is going to be destroyed
bro thought women were still in the 1700s update
Her face 😂😂😂 omfg how is it possible to make THESE EXACT 2 MOVES OUT OF THOUSANDS
Literally the worst possible opening in chess, lmao
Scripted
i feel like he had to have done this on purpose schlatt is a fucking content genius
He was right, she didn't see it coming 💀💀
I'm still wondering whethering if this is a bit or not
He is right.She didn't expect it.
A shame of Grob's opening
No way bro didn't know about the fool's mate
Did you just update the thumbnail?
The way that she immediately turned into Jim Carrey 😭
Him being able to pull out the sole worst move ever actually proves that he is smart (or he is really stupid which is probably the right answer)
LOLLLLLLLL
Use eyes before mouth next time...
No FUCKING WAY 😂 THIS IS BASICALLY HOW I'VE STARTED EVERY CHESS GAME?? 😅
How the fuck does chess work
I actually did this in a real match against my friend. I was embarrassed as hell lmao.
“I’m putting my pawn in the center, just simple chess” is such an easy way to dismiss one of the most dangerous first moves lol (Queen can move, bishop can move, and king can move all with that one pawn being first out)
I dont know anything about chess so I'm really curious on how this ended in two turns.
once i was defeated by the same chess play too XD!
Thats cheating
The comedic element in this video is overdosed
I lost a chess game like that. When I was six.
24 mil banger
tbf, she didn’t expect schlatt to fuck up in 2 moves 😂
The fool's mate received its name because it can occur only if White commits an extraordinary blunder.   1. f3 e6 2. g4?? Qh4#  The fool's mate can be achieved in two moves only by Black, giving checkmate on the second move with the queen. Black can be mated in an analogous way, although this requires an additional move, with White's queen delivering checkmate on the third move. Even among rank beginners, this checkmate rarely occurs in practice.  The mate is an illustration of the kingside weakness shared by both players along the f- and g-files during the opening phase of the game. A player may also suffer an early checkmate if the f- and g-pawns are advanced prematurely and the kingside is not properly defended, as shown in historical miniature games recorded in chess literature.
should have use plane to 4d,4e
Wow a fools mate
This is foolsmate and it's literally the fastest way to get checkmated
Bro really gave himself the fools mate L… ah… hope y’all didn’t have a bet on because she gets a bonus 😂
This is the exact same reaction you get when you prematurely ejaculate with a woman 😂
For his crimes of committing fools mate in chess, Schlatt has been sentenced to execution
I guess he's gonna erase the board behind him
NAWWW LOL
Hey, don't get me wrong - I enjoyed this too. It's hilarious. However...  24 million views!!!??? This might just be the the highest viewed chess video. Not a video about Fischer. Not Kasparov. Not Magnus. IMHO: This shows where the human race is at (me included). In the dumpster. I hope aliens are studying this. :)  BTW: More proof... I just noticed there is a YouTube about a horse farting on dogs and then running away. It has 45 million views.
this is called the Fool's Checkmate, making the worst 2 moves possible and lose instantly
There is a reason this is called Fool's Mate.
“She’s not gonna see this one coming”  I mean, he wasn’t wrong
Despite how obviously fake this is, it’s still funny
It’s ok. I can’t chess either. Been caught almost the exact same way
mate in 2 reverse
That was a real bold strategy by Jschlatt, sacking his King to ensure the Queen would be baited out. It's a shame it was countered so harshly by Botez' "checkmate" tactic. Next time I recommend the Bongcloud to counter that counter
He is a genius He won the game, by loosing it 🗿🗿
“Schlatt?”
Guarantee he somberly took down that “I love chess” sign while crying after the video ended.
so he threw for content right, like cmon getting two moved mated is like first day of chess club
He is truly a fool.
Simp and unreal woman cant play good chess
Schlatte: "She's not gonna see this coming 😏"   Bro i guess something opposite happened 💀
I have never won a chess game by checkmate ever. Yet even I wouldnt do something that dumb.
HE LITERALLY EXPOSED THE KING
Bro sacrificed his King to develop his Bishop, what a legend.
Its called a fool's mate.
He went from 😀 to 😐 real fast 😂
As someone who can't understand chess no matter how much I research, aren't you always supposed to but the pawns in the middle in the front?? It's called like, a kingsman formation or something like that.
Padre
As a former-chess player, I didn't even know that was possible
How fake you want this to be   YeH lets dis shit
😂😂😂😂
yeah no this is staged, dude´s acting is terrible
bro is flabbergasted
I think i see s CHEAT of im paranoid ( probably the second one)
He definitely knew what foolsmate was and did this deliberately as a joke, but it’s still pretty funny
Juja gringo
Atleast she still didint know what was coming
What was his plan?
She truly did not see that coming 😂
White pawn g4
Kalo gw malu tuh 😂
Google en passant
I don't watch Schlatt but that's such a Schlatt thing to do
HER FACE AT THE END LMAOOOO
And he sacrifices… THE GAAAAAAME!!!
Its fine i lost a Match same Chest Game Not same person though
chess death speedrun
I always thought Fool's mate was just a hypothetical situation, I didn't think anyone actually played that badly.
Sclit got rammed
". . .Schlatt?"
the disbelief on her face🤣🤣
His reaction seeing black won is the south reaction when the Civil war ended
World record for the shortest chess game
she definitely didn’t see that coming
I remember learning this move in elementary and doing it a shit ton, made so many people hate me 💀
Thats embarrasing, everyone and theyr grandma knows to evade death in two moves
"...schlatt?"
I had to pause to see what her winning move would be, I was like "I don't see it, I don't see it… Oh. There it is. I see it." 😂
What site is this that i see streamers playing on?
That also happened to me once
That's not two moves, that's four moves
Literally the worst move he could have done.
I lost the same way to a guy in highschool who was above average good in chess😂😂
She's not gonna see this one coming"  -famous last words
As a chess player in real life, I see how much of a disgrace he has become (and how dumb that move is), bruh!♟️☠️😨😱😤
Most intelligent NY'er
Schlatt always finishes in just 2 moves
Am I the only one genuinely confused on how this works
smh obvious strategic disadvantage in not following up with the bongcloud:tm:
This has got to be staged.
He could have played the London, quenn gambit, Vienna, fried liver, or any opening, but I can't believe he played g4 and f3
Watch this, Lis. You can actually pinpoint the second when his heart rips in half. 0:22
Bro disconnected💀
Shlatt''s face when he realises he f'ed up
He's now gonna erase that "I love chess :)" on the whiteboard.
Seeing I love chess on the white board killed me
The way her mic is, nooo
Schlatt can't play chess because he doesn't 2 towers (I know this is very late but who cares.)
That last "Schlatt" was to confirm whether he was still alive.
"Jschlatt" sacrificed THE KIIIINNNNGGGGG!!!! to develop the bishop, truly the move of all time coming from a real master. Tuouchè
That big "i love chess" in the background doesn't make sense anymore.
Bro I suck ass at chess and I still wouldn't have thought of making these moves like damn schlatt
and to think that people still think this is real 🤣
“Schlatt?” Legends say he still hasn’t answered.
Dude, you fell for the oldest trick in the book... I am disappointed in you!!!
In second grade I joined the Chess club because I actually enjoyed chess. My friend did this to me and I never came back. Barely played chess since then. Lmao
🤣
I won a game of chess against my friend in the exact same way once, and the funny thing is, that I had only played chess once in my life before, while he played it regularly with his family. We both had a laughing fit as he searched for like five minutes for something, anything, he could do, before he had to accept the checkmate. We both had a great time over all. xD
😦
The Get fucked mate
ah yes the classic schlatt gambit
Unreal how many commenters think this was organic and not set up.
I literally saw this exact checkmate in a book, and this has to be the silliest way to loose a chess game ever.
Most intelligent streamer:
She’s so cute! I love the look she gives him when she realizes how easy this was.
the beauty of the fools mate  it is called that way cause white has to play like a complete moron but it is a perfect example for what can happen when you in the beginning just move randome peasants
Don't get it wrong guys, he sacrificed his king so the other can survive
not knowing a single thing about chess makes this funnier to me
I have absolutely no clue what just happened
I learned this checkmate from my uncle when I was 4 years old.  I watched a game between him and my brother who was 6 years old at the time.
Everyone's talking about how he got a fool's mate, but I'm think of his bright idea of announcing his plan with his bishop. One thing you must never do in Chess is announce to your opponent what you're going to do with your chess pieces. How to get played 101.
I was once Vice President of the chess club   Then I became president when the President did a Fool’s Mate…in front of the school…in a talent show   We were planning on doing a speed run a five minute game…as means to promote the club.   It was less than 5 seconds.   We spent more time setting it up than playing.    He was so embarrassed he stepped down and nearly dropped out of school entirely.   It brought in members as I became a school celebrity for a bit as students wanted to learn how I beat him in 2 moves.
2 years later and this is still a historic moment
The Queen's Gambit (2020)
Makes sense that the Yankees fan loses
Bombastic side eye
The dumbest guy on the earth 😂😂
I can see the emotional damage in his eyes 💀 ☠
Schlatt?
I CAN'T RIGHT NOW HE WAS SO CONFIDENT
These were the patient's final moments before catatonia seized him.
Smells scripty
The fact that Schlatt staged it ruins it a little for me. But well, at least it went viral!
0:23 LOL that side glance :D she be like "Oh no will he cry?"
i love how cocky he is then just "😐"
i just got an ad about preventing the misuse of firearms within one's home and it was so sad
Damn son. Just, DAMN.
This is literally the fastest way to lose and he somehow did it
What was his strategy? Even if she didn't mate him, that's a terrible move because it blocks all his pieces
Well that makes XQC look like a chess genius.
This should have been a short.
Fun fact: according to stockfish that’s the worst opening. If there’s no check mate he can just go Kf2
yeah, the Queen looks like the King piece. I've been struggling with that ever since I began playing virtual chess.
his ego got rekt so hard no magic or superpower could ever repair it
There are more chess moves than years since the big bang and he chose the single two worst ones
“Schlatt”
there was one second of hesitation. She literally couldn't believe that he played himself that fast.
To this day I wonder if he did this on purpose for the meme or of he just fucked up unintentionally.
Schlatt.exe has been broken
Lol. This is also how went my first chess game ever (I was also the one that lost btw) !!! 😂
He lost but he was probably right. I'd guess she wouldn't have seen that coming.
😆 That’s so humiliating. Perfect silence. 😝
Did he call a pawn a bishop
clearly scripted.
This video unitonically saved me from ever making this move and embarrassing the crap out of myself
It takes skill to lose quicker than by the scholars mate. What a legend.
daym... that means my older 14year old can beat u at chess
I lost to an 11 year old Cambodian boy in three moves. This guy did it in two. Thank God I don't feel like a loser anymore.
the look on her face is so goddamn funny, its just the perfect fuckin reaction lmao. just pure raw w a t
Indeed she did not see that coming
Yes
Staged
It was at this moment that he knew he f!!ked up
The "schlat" in the end gets me...😂
As someone who doesn't play chess can someone explain 🧐
i wasn't even aware this was possible LMAO
XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
The moment he realize chess is brutal.
……….Schlatt?
Haha.
This is like a caricature of the general difference between men and women.  Man: Overconfidence despite limited ability. Woman: Humility despite ability.
Ohhh for real ????
Schlatt.exe stoped  responding
Yea this is a 100% staged
He so smart, he could be Ferrari's chief strategist
Thanks YouTube recommendations
She indeed did not saw that coming
The "I LOVE CHESS :)" in the background is the icing on the cake
"Its too soon ... we didnt even reach a climax"
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
That’s rough
This never gets old 😂
I know its 2 years but can i make an edit?
I don't believe that this is an accident. That face is just really good acting.
Men ☕
She had no idea that was gonna be checkmate
With the way schlatt exclaimed g4 im assuming he probably planned for a fools mate
Ain't no way it's real
The "...Schlatt?" at the end kills me every time 😅
Get fools mated
Am I stupid? Isn't he still allowed to move his knight to remove the queen? Or the swap move with his rook?
“Schlatt” really didnt see this coming
".............Schlatt?"
Scripted video obviously 😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂
staged
The I love the I love chess :) in the back 😂
That's how long he lasted in bed😂
Do you love chess now? 🧐
woaa
There are tens of thousands possible combinations for the first two moves and he managed to do the worst possible one
He loses faster than me.. ♟️♟️
lmao
Ha!
Imagine being as cocky as Schlatt and then promptly being beaten in 2 moves😂
Top 10 Anime Betrayals
Just fake
She did indeed, not saw that one coming
*confusion*
I was trying to remember and explain this mate to someone. It took me forever to move that second pawn the wrong way. I just kept discounting that move as not playable. Then I remembered it was a fools mate sort of thing. That white had to be a moron for it to work.
out of like 8 billion possible moves he chose the two worst ones
Schlatt’s face is priceless.
I love how the music stopped
The way he smirk before completing the fool's mate...the guy literally did it for content
You just did “The fool’s mate”.
Brutality. Botez wins. Flawless victory
Sometimes you're so busy thinking 8 moves ahead that you forget about moves one and two.
Sometimes you're so busy thinking 8 moves ahead that you forget about moves one and two.
This is why in chess they teach you openings lol. People have been playing this game a long time.
The Mario kart music tho
0:17 *the amount of pain I felt is immense*
He really did this I never knew this was even possible till now wow That just “she’s not gonna see this coming” “Loses the game”
The fact that this has an official name too, it's called Fool's Mate
knowing the big guy, and I do, I'm like 90, 80 percent sure he did that on purpose
Funny but he obviously knows what he did
Just keeping it on the last frame makes it funnier
As someone who's been playing chess in his free time, I saw his mistake coming from a mile away 😂
Castling??
Faked
Move the F pawn is the best way to lose
LOLOLOLOL😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is too perfect, it had to be planned.
Regardless of whether there was a diagonal opening exposing the king, that move was utter dogshit anyway. Idk what tf he was trying to do
This is so satisfying to watch!!! There’s a reason you don’t underestimate someone and make a move like that! It’s predictable and leaves your king right open!!! Never leave your King open! Always have defense
It’s been ages but I played a game one time where I one in I believe 3 or 4 moves, I can’t recall if I even moved a pawn but I just walked a knight right up to a spot they left for him to checkmate
This is the shortest possible mate, and it is called "the mate of the fool" 😂😂
Their reactions at the end are PRICELESS😂😂😂 and has anyone noticed the board in his background says I Love Chess :) 😂😂😂
Seeing schlatt go from the most smug man to... wtf just happened... is so funny to me
Y’all we have been clickbaited. The thumbnail says that the video is 28 seconds long and it is only 27.
what the freak did i just witnessed?
And I thought I was bad at chess.
LOL😂 самая быстрая игра в шахматы 😂
You can see him bluescreen
The Fool's Mate.  Anybody that learns chess will either learn the hard way or be taught why you dont make this mistake.  His face lmao
I love when he says “she’s not gonna see this one coming” cause technically he’s right, she wasn’t expecting him to perform a fools mate 2 moves in.
Why does this guy sound like jschlatt
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAA SCHLATT YOU LOOOOOOSERRRRR
Schlatt.exe ha dejado de funcionar
actually throws the game with a fools mate
LMAO
Jschlatt.exe has stopped working
Legend says he's still shocked to this day
😂 🗿 Rematch.
0:22 bro was flabbergasted
I'm quite positive he knew what he did for content. Doesn't seem like Botez knew he was throwing the game though, any good chess player would see that checkmate.
Hybris, J. Hybris
This method had been deemed nearly impossible to pull off, because it requires that the players need to be nearly in cahoots.
God, the hubris. It's like watching markiplier.
Imagine getting foolsmate. Could never be me.
you suck i lost in one
“She’s not going to see this coming”  No one would ever see putting a gun against your own head as a legitimate move
I don't get it.
There’s no way he’s not trolling
Bro i have like 135 elo, even i know dis 💀💀💀
The silence was so loud lmAO
American ego in a nutshell
That is fucking queen chess piece not King. King could only move one tile for 8 way a time. Just lose queen don't mean lose
Im not a chess conissure (idek how to spell that word bro-) so can someone explain how and why this happened
Are there tips to help you understand chess more? Because I don't understand any of it.
he looks absolutely traumatized
This had to be rehearsed!
wow 2 moves
How she won? How chess work?
I knew I was trash at chess but DAMN SON!
Reeeeeeeeeeeee
Dude literally failed chess 101 lol
He FORGOT defense the king.
He lost to a female LMAO
The whiteboard in the background that says "I love chess :)"
His soul left his body due to the defeat.
The writing in the back makes it 10 times funnier
(??) f3 is a blunder [⬛ -M1] You can't stop checkmate now.  ( ! ) Qh4# is a great move Always feels nice to win!
And that was the quickest chess game I've ever seen, the chess gods face palm in disappointment
I mean she certainly didn’t see that coming.
Wow chess doesn't make any sense how is this fun
It's literally called the “fool's mate”.
kai hatch
Out of all the openings he could've played he not only chose one that makes you lose in two moves but even if she didn't do that, that gives him very little control over the center which is the opposite of what you want to do in an opening.  And I'm a beginner.
"If you look closely you can see the exact moment when his heart snaps in half!"
the last schlatt was so good dd😂😂
how many have made this mistake
I’m stupid when it comes to chess. Can anyone explain to me how she won? I’m really curious to know
fool's mate. fitting name.
Should've googled en passent.
Bamboozled
That look! I do *not* want to mess with her anytime soon 😅
honestly its way too scripted
This had to be a bit
The fact that he moved exactly those pawns that are needed to move for a 2 move checkmate.
Bro was questioning his existence in life the moment he lost.
Lol
Famous lats words
Never thought id see A fool’s mate in 4k
Mmm mmm, that's good scripting. Who starts with "she's not going to see this one coming??" And makes all those faces
Well he's right. I don't think she saw that coming.
the ultimate blunder
The sudden music stop and both of them looking at the camera in complete silence is what sells me this moment.
2 GOD DAMN MOVES
fools mate.
I hate players that open with the kings pawn. So easy to avoid it after getting used to it. But why people like to play aggressively and then resign when they lose their queen. Just pathetic how people cant keep that aggressive vibe after losing their queen.
He probably did this on purpose, you have to be asking for it
bro if you play that opening than you're definitely an expert at it how tf can't you see that or never get trough it multiple times
If you don’t understand what this is, this is known as the fools mate. You gotta be 15 different levels of stupid to do this.
Im curious what was he planning because this clearly wasn't it
Trash
Technically she didn't see that coming.
Even slhctat didn't see it coming
The silence in the end AHAHHHAHA
lol
Bro rating is so high
Love it! Schlatt...?
Fools mate
Remember never do this opening or it would get you instantly its g4 and f4
Barnes
My observation:  He knows Nothing About Chess  I mean how  How he was gonna get his bishop Out by Pawn F3??  It was planned 🤣😂
He traded his king with her queen, why is everyone calling him dumb? Y'all CLEARLY don't know how chess works, smh.
Staged? Maybe?
simp
FOOL’S MATE!!
Well, she didn’t see that coming
schlatt: I'm going to do what's called a pro gamer move Alex: Congratulations, you just played yourself
he’s ass at chess
And he sacrifices, THE GAME
its gotta be intentional
Atleast now I know how not to lose chess in 2 moves
no wonder he's 400
Obviously scripted
Alex's face moved down just as the eval bar dropped to her favour
This is so Anya Taylor joy queens gambit
Fools gambit lol
He sacrifices THE KING
One of the first lessons you can learn in this game is this exact move, and he still blew it
Ok but wtf was his plan, what was she not gonna see coming
That is the exact same as how Alphard won a game of chess in 2 moves
legit plays the 'Fool's Mate'  him :0
Fools mate
Botez Gambit: King Variation
People claim they dont fall for ads but think stuff like this is real
Ah yes the king sacrifices to develop bishop, truly a classic
Didn't say he was gonna develop his bishop then blocked his bishop?
Couldn't beat a woman that's some true skill issue in 2020s history
fool's mate? no, schlatt's mate
I once installed one of those online chess apps and started my first game. Knew nothing of chess, still don't. Obliviously moved my pawns the way Schlatt did it and lost in 2 moves on my first try. Immediately uninstalled and never played chess again
La realización en su cara y como para de reír me mata KeK
You see schlatt used a variation of the josniffy gambit
I don’t understand how did she win if she didnt touch any of his pieces (i dont know anything about chess btw)
Would you rather have unlimited Schlatt but no chess games, or chess games, unlimited chess games, and no chess games?
As real as the action in a WWE ring!  Bad booking. Bad.
imagine actually getting fools mated
Xqc gambit
lolz!!!!!!!!!
It was a scripted game.
:0
I beat you at chess on a chess app that gave me an Ai with your moves
Her reaction tho! 😂😂😂
A booming Stal played in his head as he lost.
A well rehearsed Queens Gambit. Almost didn't look staged.
This is 4 moves
The funny thing about this clip is that Alex Botez got played so hard by losing on purpose
LOL
she definitely did not see that coming
Petition to rename this to "Checkschlate"
the mad lad played the only two moves, to get him checkmated
Obviously staged
"she's not gonna see this fucking coming" yeah, she really didn't see that coming at all
I don’t understand chess what happened
Plays knight's pawn "g4 get the bishop out" Plays pawn f3 blocking both the knight and bishop's exit "she's not gonna see this coming" Loses.
and he sacrifices... THE KING!!!!!!!!!
Bro literally opened the castle door
I mean, he was right. She did not see that fucking coming.
The end was perfect "Schlatt?"
She didn't see it coming.....
I love how it took her a second to make that move because she was trying to process if it was possible for it to be this easy
His reaction tho- 😂
i'm new to playing chess, anyone explain how is this checkmate?
It's rather impressive that he managed to lose in 2 moves.
I had no idea what fools mate was and I won against Martin in 2 moves
Bro created the new King's Gambit chess pro move
Surely this is fake. He could not have just done the most infamous chess move that everyone knows not to do.
staged ash lol
Why does this keep getting recommended over and over 💀
0:15 Neither would you!!!!!
That Schlatt at the end made me burst out laughing
the fact people react to this as if it isn’t staged… he says “i’m going to develop my bishop” but doesn’t know that white moves first? and out of all the moves he picks the fastest way to possibly get checkmated
Scripted
*Absolutely flabbergasted*   *L, Mald, Cope, Continue to shiver.*
Fools mate
staged
FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKE
You see he was just testing her skills by seeing if she knew about the Fool's Mate.
Alternate title: Don't be a simp
This had to be scripted
Bro got fools mated
Bruh i think he was trying to do fools mate but he played as the wrong colour
Foolsmate. My older brother used it on me when I was 5. I was so confused and interested at the same time
its faKe
Even he didn't see it coming
This is actually porn level acting
i would kill her if i lost like you.
this is called "the fools mate" and is the fastest possible mate in the game
Schlagt gambit
Nobody:  Absolutely nobody:  Me two seconds after I say “No more mister nice guy”
lad 💀
Schlatt? 😂
and he sacrificed the KINGG
fakest game ever
He sacrificed THE KINGGGGGGGGG!!!
That my friends, is what we call a Fool’s Mate
It was scripted, no idiot could do such a Idiotic move
You know what they say " Happiness is temporary".🤣😂
Gotta be scripted or something
😮damn
He knew what he was doing, right? It had to be for the bit. There is no world in which that second move makes sense in any regard. Knight f3 is the move he shoulda made here.
staged af but k, ppl are dumb to believe this.
the worst opening and trade ever in schlatt's chess career
Bro fell for the fools mate
I know this . I've played the queen like this exact position.  It has made me won 2 times.
scripted AF
has to be satire
Legend has it that Schlatt is still staring at the screen to this day.
Ha
Schlatt being overconfident for moving g4 and 2nd move f3.
This had to have been a bit, there's no way he's this silly
This has 23M views, I think he can consider this a win
Staged but still funny
what a brave and elegant king sacrifice
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
There’s a reason why it’s called a fools mate.
Either he is just super new to chess and shouldn't be challenging anyone, or he did this on purpose, either way. Waste of a watch.
this is called “fool’s mate” if anyone didn’t know
Bro what’s the song
bro falls for the fools mate
out of 10^80 possibilities of movement in chess there is only one and only one way you can lose in 2 ways and this is that lol
Lol I just remember doing this to my friend back then
The first move, I knew what was gonna happen.
Bro really got foolsmated
She definitley did not see this coming
The Fool’s Mate
is there a full vod of this?
And he sacrified, THE KING!!!!
Schlatt the goat at chess
And he sacrificed... THE KIIIIIIIINGGGGGGGG
That lads is what we call the schlatt gambit
Wow. Just wow.
Well I guess I know how to counter this instantly💀
Lol get fool mated
She did not in fact see that coming
What a way to get mated.
F2 leaves an opening for the queen to move diagonally and checkmate the king.
me who doesnt know how to play
Okay this must be staged. I don't believe anyone would play those moves
He was so confident as well, only to lose his confidence to the world’s fastest checkmate
How did he somehow manage to open up the quickest checkmate in chess without even knowing it
GothamChess  "He sacrificed HIS DIGNITY!"
🤣masterpiece
What a nice guy, throwing the game like that.
This game was staged
I like the girl.
I was to smart to figure out how to checkamte in two moves
GM in no time
i play chess and i just died at this
no way he didn't do that on purpose
Fools
What exactly was his plan there?
Question: was this staged?
0:17 Botez being like: "Did he *REALLY* do that? Well I definitely wasn't expecting it."
He died guys he died
SOMEBODY WRITE THIS DOWN WE NEED TO KNOW HOW THE 2 MOVE CHECKMATE WORKS!
And then he sacrificed… THE KIIIIIING
bros is flabbergasted
fake
The basic 2 moves checkmate
even 3 yo me wouldnt have lost by a fool's mate
Fools mate. Just like my first game. Lol
Of the twenty possible first moves in chess, author and grandmaster Edmar Mednis argues that 1.f3 is the worst. Grandmaster Benjamin Finegold teaches "Never play f3". In his text on openings, Paul van der Sterren considered 1. f3 beneath mention by name:  "Then there are those moves with which White really tries to shoot himself in the foot, like 1. f3 or 1. g4. Out of loyalty to those unfortunates who have occasionally indulged in these strange moves in their youth, I shall not even give you the names of these 'openings'."  — van der Sterren, on 1. f3
now this is called the schlatt gambit also known as the big guy opening
I still come back to this video somehow... golden moment
Nice throw for content. He probably googled how to loose quickly in chess.
It is actually mate in 3 moves because you can still block the queen with your knight. Obviously useless because Queen can simply take the knight but still 😀
bro got fools mated
I don't at all like the look she gives Schlatt at 0:24
The end “… schlatt..?
and he sacrifices THE KING
Mom:Go out Me: NOOO MOM im 8 now i can play home Mom: But you no 8 Me: then me is 99 Mom: OMGGGGGG  PLS LIKE
Fools mate 😂
She never saw that one coming.
This game is fixed, everyone knows botez doesn’t have a queen
It was that moment that he knew he fucked up
what a violation...
He sacrificed the KIIIIIIIIIING
She definitely didnt see that coming.
i didnt know it was possible to blunder your king
And he sacrificed THE KIIIING
Lmao fool's mate
She definitely didn't expect that
Foolsmate
upon rewatching it the way he delivered the pawn with such confidence even  though it was just an innocuous pawn move makes me think he new that it was gonna be mate the next move
His confidence there really went schplatt
fake
scripted
If yall can't see this is fake.... god help ya.  And if you can, then why is it funny? Just a stinker all around.
I feel like this was intentional lol, he probably looked up what the worst possible move is for jokes on the stream.
Simp
My man had 20 possible moves on both his first and second move and still lost.
No shot he wasn’t doing that on purpose
And he sacrifices… THE KING!!!!
simp loses to the slave lover, nice.
Never played chess, have no idea what the fuck just happened, still laughed hard at watching the joy fade out of Schlatt's face as I realized he had written "I love chess" on his whiteboard.
schlatt gambit: accepted.
Thats the ONLY checkmate in 2 moves(that i know of) and he did that😭💀
E
I mean, judging by her expression, I do think he was right, she did not see hanging mate in 1 coming lol
I love how she is just like "schlatt"
Civilized Music stopped
"She's not gonna see it
Bro just lost to the fools mate.
I remember playing my first game blindfolded and my opponent did this. I didn't deserve to win. Actually I did how bad do you have to ve to play this
To the people who don't play chess, basically schlatt did the stupidest move in existence
bro just opened a gate for her
This has to be staged lmfao
a bit, clearly
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👌👌
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
to be fair none of us saw that coming
He was right, she didn't see it coming
I mean he was absolutely correct, she did not see that coming.
the "schlatt?" at the end really completes this
I'm a stickler for never bringing my queen out early, so I've missed that move over the board like 3 times.
This has to be deliberate (?) I have never seen anyone loses in a Fool's mate for real. The moves white need to play to allow it to happen aren't even natural.
why cant i turn my rook into a queen
bro is so obviously faked
Bro did a lose chess speedrun💀
i mean he was right, she didn't see that coming
Bruh, you need to watch some yt tutorials.  That was so dumb.
I am willing to bet that this was staged.
He was correct though since she didnt see it coming
This maybe a fool's mate but the big man was no fool,he was only trying to develop a bishop,truly a master of chess he is
THE SCHLATT GAMBIT
"g4, get the bishop out" *proceeds to put a pawn on f3, blocking the bishop's diagonal*
Wew
schlatt: get the bishop out   Also schlatt: gets mated + blocks his bishop from developing
bro tryna fianchettoed a bishop and lost
bro got fools mate
I mean Alexandra definitely did NOT see that coming that Schlatt would lose a chess game in 2 moves.
G4, get the bishop out 😂
Given the look she did at 0:17, she really didn't expect it. She even got closer to get a better look to be sure she was seeing it right
I love how no one payed attention or mentioned in the comments how he said he was devolping his bishop and then blocked off it's only moving spots with pawns
He was right.  She didn’t see that coming
That was the single dumbest move you could make
Well she didn’t see that coming alright
Schlatt at the ending😂
fools mate this is sad
Been over a year, still my favorite clip of Schlatt ever
f3 is literally the worst move, like THE worst move possible from the 20 starter moves available.
Hahahaha schlatt is super traaash
early king sacrifice very aggressive and underrated strat
if people actually believe he is this dumb, they are the dumb ones.
*watching glass onion* *they open the puzzle box* me: AYO IT'S THE SCHLATT MOVE
My best friend basically did this to me
so rigged
Yup… You’re right… Even you man…
botez gambit works every time
I wonder what his plan even was
he said that he would kill me, because your tourtorial did not work
he only said it dose't matter
you so bad, because Arnold did not win
What was the move there? Makes no sense, just some scripted comedy.
Wow
Early King Sacrifice. The Real King's Gambit
"...Schlatt?"  I keep coming back to this clip. Its hilarious XD
insert outstanding move meme here
bro got fool mated 😔
she, indeed, saw it coming
how did my man get fools checkmated?! Those 2 moves are an automatic no go when your opponent goes e5
Never seen that in real life! (played chess for 40 years).
There is literally only one possible way to lose chess in 2 moves and he somehow did it
The two pawns that dumbass moved exposed the weakest points in chess
Fool’s Mated
fuck chess
nice, fools mate
That’s what happened to me once
I bet one of you reading this comment doesn’t know the rules of chess
ah fools mate
lol
He didnt lose his king, he just tactically sacrificed his king in order to open up the bishop.
"I love chess" 💀
I have no idea how this game works.
L
what a simp 😩
my opponent did this in a chess tournament lol
Would have avoided that if he placed the first pawn only 1 up.
A
Till this day he is still processing what just happened.
0:22
Schlatt: I go first? Bro is literally playing white💀
This is the same woman that saw Charlie and xQc play chess right?
=O
Fool’s Mate
Great move, Let's see if he wins.
big brain time
no way he doesn't know about two move checkmate
his reaction tho ☠️
He open the F pawn early so the queen went to  the diagonal. Making checkmate
Amazing king sacrifice! A true artist
Schlatt: *moves the pawn neart o the king  Her: You've just made a big mistake moving that pawn
That "Schlatt?" At the end is so brutal
It was a speedrun
Quanon: Trump is playing 4D-Chess. Trump playing 4D-Chess:
"schlatt?"
The "Schlatt" in the end always gets me 🤣🤣🤣
Me 2 ngl
She made it so obvious too idk why she would say it like that lol just don't say anything if you're gonna pretend it's a basic move
Möchtest du gewinnen in Schach, dann opfere den König denn er ist schwach.
This was my first impression of schlatt
For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. - John 3:16 from the Bible 💕💕
gg well played
He should've deployed the Rook early.
i thought schlatt purposely lose
The"I love chess" sign in the background: My Time Has Come
Fake but funny
Fake
Real life Martin
Can someone please explain to me how he lost in just 2 moves
Her looking to the right sent me 🤣
OMG he made the 2 worst possible moves
Well she didnt see that one coming lmao
The "I love chess :)" in the background 😭
Definitely staged, but still funny
The most epic king sacrifice in chess history. Not even Alpha Zero would’ve thought of playing it.
I think she saw that one coming
Why is the queen and king icon not the ones I thought they are and maybe that’s why he lost?
Man ☕
He used the famous tactical KING SACRIFICE…
._.
What was his play though lol
He was right She didn’t see it coming
Absolutely a Chad move to waste as little time as possible on chess.
Legendary video
Best moment ever
The "you have to be fucking shitting me" stare is perfect
speedrunning chess
"Never let anyone know your next move, not even yourself."           ~ Master Oogway idk
Schlatt didnt read "21 errors of noob in chess", dont play grob until you read this book.
I mean he's not wrong
I m not a chess player, can someone explain what happened? I always thought you win chess by getting rid of the queen or something
Listen man, there's a reason this particular kind of predicament is called "Fool's Mate"
"She's not gonna see this one coming."  Well he wasn't wrong
I think about this video all the time
Funny thing is that I did this exact thing to my friend (I won)
This is one of the chess games of all time.
This is glorious. I've played Crystal Dolphin over this several times.
Why the hell would someone start the game by exposing the king with no benefit for other pieces to move?
Yeah I was never very good at chess
Anyone with a brain can see that this is scripted
Last words before he lost "she's not going to see this coming" that has to be the best Last Words anyone's ever said
How do you recover from that
Anyone else returning here because in the Harley Quinn series, as soon as Ivy asked the fastest way to lose chess knew exactly what Nightwing was going to say because of this clip?
Hes doing an any% run
Yo that's gotta suck
can we just appreciate that he's using airship fortress from mario kart ds
Now i remember that like 10 years ago i did that same two moves and i survive                  I'm glad i was playing with someone new lol
LLLLL RIP BOZO
i like how the MOMENT he moves the pawn she stops smiling lmfao
Can someone explained what happened? I dont play and im kinda confused 😅
We knew he was going to lose, but not THAT badly 😅
That concerned "schlatt?" At the end is what got me
She broke Charlie's record
Schlatt ? - 😮
„Get the bishop out!“ In all seriousness, you can’t do SHIT with that bishop. You just put in into a corner it’s never getting out of.
4 moves*
Is this the fastest way to lose?
hi big guy
the man was too stunned to speak
I've never seen someone actully fall for fools mate
🤣🤣🤣
New gambit: schlatt gambit.  Not like botez gambit where u sac queen, u sac king
Man has a IQ so high it went to the other side and became negative
Schlatt's Gambit 1. g4, e5 2. f4  An outstanding chess opening that allows the white to sacrifice their king for a bishop development (Modified Grob's opening).  There's 2 variations of the opening: Schlatt's Gambit: Accepted 1. g4, e5 2. f4, Qh4# (Botez vs Schaltt game, 1-0). Schlatt's Gambit: Declined Second black move is not Qh4#
"Eventually, Schlatt stopped thinking."
Is she a pro, or is he just dumb?
That was the cheese equivalent of kicking a guy in the balls because he had his legs wide open.
I love how if you googled Fool's mate, and on wikipedia, the image they represented is exactly what schlatt did
It's the "I love Chess :)" in the background for me lol
I cannot believe that in some comments many people believe this is real. Guys, it's scripted. Nevertheless, it's funny hahaha
God my heart broke for him, I'd do the same stupid shit-
i'm trying to understand his plan... and... i'm just not seeing it
I can't her eye rolls 😂🤣🤣
I actually think schlatt did this on purpose for content
The true kings gambit
Meanwhile schlatt, Hi my name is wil e coyote, IQ 207 SUPER GENIUS
bruh
What wasn’t she going to see coming? Like what was he setting up?
.....it legit Broke him
King sacrifice
That was the quickest game of chess ever.
f3 + g4
Game lasted about as much as he would've lasted in bed with her: 20 seconds 🤣🤣
You guys made that up. kkkk
I am a beginner so do not fall for this trap
Obviously scripted I never saw anyone playing this move😑
Omg absolutely shit on
And that's why it's called the Fool's Mate
Part me feel like this is a setup.
Fool's Mate!
Is this actully real
:)/:(
Schlatt looks like he just lost a bet thats about to get him pegged.
just the way everything stopped and went silent killed me💀
Schlatt should stick to the Dream SMP villain role.
Who is this "Schlatt" Big guy keeps talking about?
Love the Mario Kart DS Airship track music
Who's she?
Who is she tho
yeah fool's mate
A chess master in the making.
I have a new girl crush 🥰
Managed to play the single worst opening in all of chess
Wait, he played g4 to get the Bishop out... Wouldn't the next logical move have been something like fianchettoing with Bg2? In fact, even if playing f3 didn't land him in a Fool's Mate, that move completely trapped his light squared bishop...
“get the bishop out” *blocks the bishop in the next move*
Ummm... did she actually win tho? I mean he's in check but she didn't like actually win tho, u could put the knight there, and if she tries taking it, the king will take out the queen
What a fool... Literally, you need to be a fool to fail for the Fool's mate.
Man gave up a fools mate to get his bishop out😂
Amazing
Does he not know foolsmate??
The fact that there is a whole lesson on this game on that website kills me
Does this not count as stalemate?
I remember playing a chess match with a friend. We both were beginners than. My friend made the same mistake and I won in 2 moves
Lol
There is no way he lost to the OLDEST WIN IN THE BOOK LMFAO
Bro it was in 21 seconds lol
my fav vid of 2021
The sheer disbelief in his eyes whenever he lost is freaking awesome. he looks so depressed now
Today I understand why this is called Fool's Mate.😅
I showed my dad this it’s really funny
look at that evil eyes at the end
Schlatt went flatt
How does that work
What's hilarious is I saw this clip before I even knew who Schlatt was XD. Coming back to it now it's even funnier
his chess skills are amazing
Big Guy got beaten by a Girl. Time to find a new sport. Schlatt LMFAO.... this is pure comedy.
Hey this is a tutorial on how to lose chess in 2 moves
I just had to process and I still can't so  how did she win?...    Edit. Nvm figured it out. He left his King wide open
That move is called fools mate and is the fastest way to lose
Okay that was cute 😏
Priceless
I did this to someone ^^
I hope yall dont belive this is real
ꟻ in the chat
Bruhh
finally found this video
As a chess veteran and a 1700 player this is painful to watch.
Did he do that as a joke and was acting? If so, it's very good acting.
I’m one of those people that know nothing about chess so I’m just as confused as schlatt here lol
This seems so fake
his face though
That concerned "Schlatt?" at the very end adds so much to it
No pieces were even captured in this checkmate. NO. PIECES. That's how humiliating that is.
Please rotate the table :)))
Schlatt:"She'll never see this coming." Alexandra: * Grinch Face intensifies  *
😂
I want to know what happened next
R/PeopleFuckingDying
Staged. Still fun
"She's not gonna see this one coming." I would sure love to know just what it is that he had in mind!
Can someone explain what happen there how he lose?
Staged, fake, and gay. Zero credibility.
I can't believe someone actually played this when i was playing recently even though it's not in 2 moves
Her “what the fuck?” Expression killed me. 0:16
Big Guy may have lost in chess, but he sure as hell still hasn’t lost in the continuing onslaught of those pesky women trying to report him for his incident back in 1999
to finally see the fool's mate happen naturally is amazing
Man, what a fool
Scripted
99.99% sure he did it on purpose
It's called a fool's mate. Literally taught to you before you learn any openings
Fat L
@tania
He should’ve known by her pointy chin, that she would outsmart him.
It was soo ezzzzzz
>:)
I like how this is “jschlatts” most popular video ever
He literally played the fool's mate
Bruh
The look on "schlatt's" face is priceless
On his second move, he could of made a total of 20 different moves that would not be as stupid as the one he just made.
ONE MILLION LEST GOOO
What was he going for?
This was staged, this process is called “the fool’s mate”
well he’s right they didn’t see it coming
Dude this happened to my friend he lost in 2 moves too XDDDDD
Everyone's saying it's staged, i thought someone in his chat was telling him what to do trolling him by saying it was gonna be a really great play when in reality he's just getting him to lose lol.
2 move checkmate
some would call him, the best chess player ever
how to lose chess in 1 move “shutting down pc…”
when you underestimated your oppnent so much and you lost instantly is the worst feeling you can ever feel.
How is that not fake
She never saw it coming
Schlatt wrote down on the board: I LOVE CHESS  Then learned Fool's Mate while challenging a WFM.
It’s like getting a 0 on a test. He knew.
this was totally planned
Why the hell is this 22m views lmao
Her expression was so hilarious!!!!
fake
22M views of pure laughter from every single one
F3 and F4 is the worst move ever in openings
i dont know how to play chess why did she win from that move
Totally not scripted
Okay so a lot of people in replies are talking about how this was or wasn’t staged. It was definitely done on purpose, but this is a clip from one of his videos from months before this was uploaded. It wasn’t done to be made into a clip to get views, rather being a funny part of the video. Also, knowing Schlatt, he did the moves without her knowing he would, and you can even see the surprise in her face when he does it, so it wasn’t scripted, just him intentionally doing the worst possible moves.   If you want to see the original video just go to the description, and the clip this is from is at the very end.
What is that look she gave, Evil🖤
schlatt had to do this on purpose right the fools mate is so outlandishly hard to do on accident
จบเลย 55555555
Jesus fcking Christ 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Reall footage of the "1999" event where "Schlatt" was finally stopped and taken into custody
This always makes me laugh 😂
When she said "I'm just gonna play simple chess"  He should've tried to fix his terrible mistake
What is the name of the background music?
She killed Schlatt
that was sad
I I like how he is trying to process what just happened
When I first saw this Schlatt, I thought he was the guy from the Jurassic Park movie LMAO.
This "Schlatt" guy is trash at chess, but Big Guy on the other hand, man is a Grandmaster
The moment of silence
Would love to see chat reaction 😀
How would he react if someone made this a meme
Interesting.
I’ve been trying to do this for an hour and I still can’t manage to lose a chess game in 2 moves
I didnt understand chess when first watching this but now after learning i can see and think its fucking hilarious
ok
999K
this channel almost 1 Million Subscriber oh my god
Sometimes, there is a reason someone will not see something coming…  And that’s because it’s the stupidest move in the book and they will immediately punish you for it.
damn hes such a noob
It's even funnier when the teqnuiche is called "FOOLS mate"
Oh that's a good one
I'm so confused about what he was trying to do here.
I think I know what he was trying to do, preventing her pawn from moving forward without dying.  It's a pity that it also happens to be like the single worst move possible.
What was schlatt thinking?
Well apparently I searched the shortest chess match and it was just 4 moves...
What happened
I don't play chess so how did Schlatt lose?
Not even a child would play that move its called fools mate its the only way to loose in 2 moves its fake or he is the biggest idiot on earth take your pick
Click bait garbage...yet at 22M views might have to do that myself!
Sclatte: *ima put some dirt in her eye* Her: *you didn’t see that coming*
This is the most checkmate style you get in chess when i saw it I understood what will happen
Thats defenitly chris from mr beast channel
Everyone made this mistake at least once
I can’t believe I seen this video before I knew who Jay Schlott was and I thought Jshlatt was Magnus the champion of chess
Jesus is coming back for his people please repent and make sure you’re one of them. God loves us so much doesn’t matter how many mistakes you’ve made or what mistakes you’ve made God will forgive you. He’s waiting on you❤️
Her face at 0:17 😂
"TWICE THE PRIDE, DOUBLE THE FALL."
I don’t understand how he lost here
LMFAOOOOO
wait thats the same thing that i won 2 moves!
that is such a rookie mistake 🤡
staged.
Even doctor strange couldn’t see that coming bro
This video was literally the biggest fucking waste of my time today thank you YouTube for making me watch this
Should have moved the bishop
Seems scripted
Shlatt... Who names their kid a shit dropping into a toilet bowl...
i see this video in my recommendation even though i already watch it months ago,it's still good HAHAHA
You're supposed to protect the King at all costs, terrible move.
speed running a loss in Chess
50k No Videos
This felt intentional for content, but still funny and well done.
I was a state champion in high school, I don't play anymore but even I knew fresh starting out you didn't do that, lol.
Oof the first one is a blunder actually
The Mario music 🤣
Bravo
I was teaching chess to a friend of mine and in a test match he pulled this move on me. I had to use every single atom on my body to not slap him
Savage checkmate
She definately didn't see than surrender coming
The series of moves that Schlatt did is called "Fools Gambit", it is a real series of moves in chess competitions.
Pro tip. Don't move the pawns in front of your rook.
It was a donkeys mate
My guy fell for the oldest trick in the book
This isn't real is it? Is it so obvious that's the pt. or is this meant to be taken seriously? I really can't tell bc if you sit down to a chess board more than twice you know about fool's mate and scholar's mate. Bc who doesn't want to know how to win the quickest. Surely this guy has played more than 2 games?
XDDD
It’s rare that someone will make two moves needed for the fools mate, but when it happens, it’s a glorious moment
I'm shit at chess but as soon as I saw the thumbnail I just thought "oh no".
Who is she
Ah yes. Totally not intentional.
I did this exact same thing a week ago. I was embarrassed and impressed at how fast I lost
L
She won without harming a single enemy
Probably got the queen and king mixed up. At least I did. And then I was like oooooh whoops.
I Love Chess
Brain disconnected, please reboot
This legit was planned
This is actually what happened to me once
Repent for your sins God loves you. God has a very bright future for you. Have a Great/Blessed day or night. Amen God Bless.
*How?!*
Gg
I love that it is not staged
😂😂
I think she already saw how this guy will lose. But it was too fast though.
Damn I need to try this
XD YOU FOOL
she said, "gg ez"
i'm dying lol
Couldnt he take out her queen with his pawn ?
Noob
Scripted content is so boring and unfunny.
this is clearly fake
I believe he quit after this
Essa vitória é mais demérito do derrotado que um mérito do vencedor: O manjado mate relâmpago😂
That one right there's a violation personally i wouldn't have it.
A bot did this to me once 💀
🤣
There are only 20 possible 1st moves Pawn 1 space forward                                      8 moves (1 ea) Pawn 2 spaces forward                                   8 moves (1 ea.) King or Queens Knight to outside of board   2 moves (1 ea.) King or Queens Knight to inside of board.     2 moves (1 ea.) I'm not using chess notion as not everyone either plays or even understands how chess is played.  Not that I'm m implying anything, it's just how it is.
:)))))
Where's the rest? I want to see the aftermath so bad
Yeah
This is why overthinking is good with chess
I don’t understand, how did he lose
She's not gonna see this one coming
0:16 she was already like “this fool 💀”
The Best Part is the Bowsers Castle Mario Kart Music thats playing throughout this episode
"She's not gonna see this coming" THINK AGAIN SONNYJIM
this is so obviously staged it hurts
Hes officially worse than xqc
More rehearsed bull$hit for idiots. Great.
So fake
Lol sounded like chat told him to move his f pawn
Scripted... Still funny tho.
epic
I move all of my pawns to attack head on in the first turn amd immediately take out the opponents entire chess army. They never expect it and I've never lost a game
Everyone knows the two move checkmate. Obviously staged .
that look on her face tho
🤣
Love the Airship Fortress music in the background 😆👌
staged
How’d she win she didn’t take the king
Is this a troll?
Fake
i would ask her for dinner after that
This is so scripted
Weeeeelp
Is this game on drugs he can swap his queen with his king 🤦 he didn't even lose
Who is that two idiots?
Good show for clowns by two clowns
I’ve did that before.
This has to be a setup
No this dude intentionally chose the two worst moves. This is a well known trap in Chess.
Austin Powers: "Fook Mi, that was fast."
My brother taught me how to play chess when I was 5 and this was exactly how the game went.
How did you do this? Like this is so ridiculously bad. How do you ever get beaten like that?
This is so fake
EMOTIONAL DAMAGE!!!
I use this every time just to scare people
My favorite part about playing chess is watching them make an incredibly stupid move like that.  The look on her face says it all.  I always think "Really? THAT'S your move?"  I usually just sit there and grin until they figure it out.
7 mean... this was clearly done on purpose for a video/funny clip  Cause either you know how to lose in 2 moves against a good player   Or you would never make those moves if you were just playing as a beginner because an alert would have been like "nope can’t do that"  I mean... it’s content   Easy click bait   It worked on me   But still  Im just so tired of everything being so obviously scripted   Can we just press record and try to just make a organic moment happen that’s hilarious and will mean that you don’t need scripts for having fun and being funny
Scripted
Brain.exe has stopped working.
Checkmate the queen got restricted
I'll remember that one for next time I want to be done with chess quickly
“I love chess, but chess does not love me”
The video almost immediately cuts.
maquinista???
I did this to my brother once 🤣 I'm no pro, I was like 8.
That's really stupid
I don’t know what’s more impressive. I guess the fact most viewers think this wasn’t a setup…
I almost feel like this was scripted.  Good try tho👍
I hate to be the guy that says this was staged but… this was staged
This fake crap is annoying.
Not sure I've ever seen a two move mate before lmao
Huge rookie mistake.
Fake and cringe
My humour os broken💀💀
Well that was about as funny as stepping on a lego brick barefooted.
Yikes. This is the worst possible way you could lose at chess. Sucks for you, dude.
Staged af
Wait King can do that????
I think you did the "I'm playing chess while everyone else is playing checkers" thing backwards.
S move 1: "g4, get the Bishop out." A move 1: over-explains e5. S move 2: proceeds to block said bishop with f3. "She's not going to see it coming." (See what coming? You've blocked basically all development.) A move 2: Qh4# with an admirably puzzled expression.  I'm going with 100% scripted by both players, but an entertaining video nonetheless.
Oh
His king and queen were still alive... he was never in checkmate anyay
Genuinely shocked at the number of commenters who don't realise this was staged.
Fake, staged... almost funny
"you were supposed to protect the king not sacrifice the king" - myself
This is fucking staged.
Dude that was staged, there is no way a good chess player can lose so dumbly
Scripted
Rookie mistake
Less she-males, more real women.
I'm sorry I'm looking at his position at 0:17... "She's not going to see this one coming?" "She's not going to see what coming? What can you do in that position!" What was his strategy.
That Pikachu face 😯
Yes just playing simple chess SHE’S JUST FLEXING ON US
When you make fake content to be funny. Original YouTube community was the best. Then Fortnite came out and shirt attention spans
I still dont understand what happened
Lol, I did the exact movement when I was 10 years old against the computer, same result jajajajjaj
bro u didnt lose just move your pawn two steps forward and you kill the queen in her spot.
You people Actually use strats in chess? I just played it like a scantron. Whichever one i havent moved/filled in a while i move.
.........that's not even a rookie mistake that's just......sad af
I learned this move the hard way and  I was like "what"
Wait why did he lose I don’t understand
Schlatt.exe stop working
Take THIS! Suicide move
Now that she kicked his butt, and he said, "She's not gonna see this coming.", I'm curious what he was planning.
Fools mate
Big oooooof
I actually beat my friend in the same way but he was freshly, heavily concussed. True story.
Ive seen this happen with digital chess more than a few times but only ever on flat boards. Almost like the player mixes up the king and the queen.
the opening of a man whos never played chess before
CLEARLY Staged.
He he he ha
Definitely set up, or 1 in a million chance of happening, this is the fastest way to checkmate in Chess. Very unlikely that he would play exactly those pawns in that order without knowing
it would've been hilarious if she said, "oops, you just got schlatt on" 😂
I am an intelectual and know nothing about chess. Is there a simple explanation why the game ended in two moves? if not no worries 👍
How did she win???
This is probably the first time I’ve seen an actual surprised Pikachu face IRL. LoL 😆
Clickbait much. Any chess player wouldn’t have done that move.
Y'know, there's something oddly satisfying about people that are cocky getting burned so bad at what they were boasting about.
Straight up fake, schlatt is bad at acting lol
No way that was coordinated. No wayyyyy
This is called Fool's mate for a reason.
She would probably have defeated me in one move, I literally can't understand chess, tried when I was in high school. And that seems to be true with every other game or sport that requires individual team role important, like this player only can do this and not that if is blocked in certain area of the field by this other player. This is why I was frustratingly bad at sports, the one and only that I was actually good at was prisonball which is fairly straightforward. You hit someone, they go behind you in a separated area and vice versa, someone from that area hits you, they "get free" and back at the normal side while you go to the prison in the other team's side and the same thing. But that's the hard limit for me to warp my head into game mechanics. Anything more complicated than that just gets completely ignored by my brain even if I try hard to understand. Which is weird because once I solved one of those Einstein's riddle things, which mind you said it was the most difficult conditional puzzle ever created, in less that fifteen minutes. It was something about 20 houses that should be arranged according to color that decided who lived next to who.
You all do know this is scripted right?   Doesn’t make it less funny but like... this is something you learn as soon as you start playing chess
She not only destroy him, but also his yet to be born offspring.
Once in school I had a friend who one day came strutting and boasting to everyone how he's an insane chess player. I was a noob player myself back then but anyways challenged him and defeated him exactly this way. I destroyed that guys career that day.🤣🤣
Got pwnd!
I might find a new game if I were you
& this is the full explanation of how the Yankees are doing since their last championship in 2009.
Ugh. So fake. Theres literally no logic to his moves at all other than to set up the fool's checkmate. His bishop has nowhere to go.
This is like losing a fight by running into your opponent's fist at top speed.
That's called fool's mate
I'm still trying to figure out what move he was trying to make after exposing his king.
S: Gets the bishop out A: Gets the queen out S: Exposes the king A: Goes for the kill
GG Ez
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Obviously staged
Completely NOT a pre-rehearsed set-up, in a shallow attempt to garner additional YouTube views and hence gain more revenue from ads.  Oh no.  This was 100% genuine.   No cheating, no agreement to do a little video that they can do together and share the revenue streams.  It's incredibly difficult to lose in 2 moves - it takes some very, very specific moves that offer nothing whatsoever for white.  You insult your subscribers, and anybody else who views this complete nonsense.
*surprised Pikachu face*
😦
fake ass staged video
I'm all over YouTube comment section to collect support for my channel to break YouTube algorithm.
I feel bad for the guy, such confidence, such dissappointment.
« I love chess :) » *I’m gonna put some dirt in your eyes*
fake
She needs to teach me the sauce 🥴
Is there a full video?
He knew what he was doing
Lmaooo her face at 0:18 fucking priceless
Yeah, didn't even think about the consequence of that two moves
fake
Chess is one of those games were I never bothered trying to learn cause everyone was just way better than me
so funny XD
Oof
At least I was 12 when I got fool's mated. And playing for a couple of years... Okay, what we see here is only marginally worse. I'm still going to need jurisdictional info on this guy, to petition to put him in a conservatorship, just so I can feel less bad about getting fool's mated in the Reagan era.
Sry but lol that was the worst play I've ever seen what are you DOIN schlatt? That face on her tho when she knew was priceless.
This is every chess game I ever played. That's why I stopped playing chess.
The part at 0:28 made sense
I'm a bit confused, it looks like her King is her Queen? I always thought the King was the one with the spiky crown no?
faek and gae
She kinda says "Slapped* 😂😂😂
Thats litteraly the chess's mistake
LMAO
i dont mind losing to pretty girl.. that is call gentleman.. 😍
Moral Lesson: Do not leave the King wide open! I repeat! WIDE OPEN!
Who?
It's funny that alot of comments are saying this is faked. I'm sure they have never even played chess. Infact, i'm willing to bet that none of them even knew how to lose in two moves. I'm willing to double or nothing and say that they didn't even expect the queen to deliver mate even when seeing the thumbnail. To put all this in another perspective, imagine a brand new boxer going up against Mike Tyson, and everyone saying the newbie threw the match because he got knocked out at round one. It's that silly. Gosh.
Did he just do this on purpose ?...
He did that on purpose, basement dwellers here really didn't catch that lol
There are litterally more moves in chess than there are known atoms in the universe and this man chose 8 possible set ups to lose a game in just the first 2 moves out of 72,000
I did this       Except I won
0:15: 🙂 0:16: 🤨
"She's not going to see this coming." That's what he said.
Schlatt move on that girl, bro.
Been there done that haha
M8, pawns aren't as powerful as you think they are...
Check pastor
Ooof.
Fake
Why is no one here talking about how fake it is???
Apparently, he's still sitting there with that expression today! 😂😂
I play the game against the computer and I had lost only twice. That was a Dumb move.
Could someone who knows about chess explain why this is a checkmate? I'm genuinely curious as to how this is a checkmate.
Scripted 😇
And I thought fool’s mate in three moves was the quickest way to lose.
I want to believe this is scripted No one is that dumb
he was trying to play the sicillian defense as white XD
Damn, I know she's a girl but at that moment she emanated big dick energy
WAIT A MINUTE! Can't you swap a rook's position with the king as long as they're both unmoved?
🤔sus
I never even realized that was possible.
I can absolutely guarantee that I would lose in only ONE move. I've never understood one single thing about chess, despite having a brother who mastered the game at the age of ten....nor do I have one whit of interest in learning it, even though I'm now nearly 70.
Fake
fake
He should have made the classic opening but guess what he chose the one that loses in 2 moves
Bro I did this to one of my friends, I was begging him to play against me in the last few minutes of class. The last thing I said before the game started was "it will be a quick game, I promise" and I promptly made it the quickest game I've ever played 😅
he knew what he was doing
Looks like big_guy lost the game
This is basically how you can lose in two moves. Scripted.
I think I'm more focused on the boo- aight that's enough
XD
The inventor of chess really did give the queen a sniper rifle though. How’s the queen supposedly going to charge right through an entire army and instakill the king
Classic counter opening to bring shame in one's life
Bro, i could've beat Schlatt with those moves of his, i stopped the video as soon as he touched the second pawn and was like "he lost".
This was way more funny than it needed to be 😂
Olmamış puanım -4/10
This is so fake
Someone did this to me as a kid and I have never forget it
This usually never happens. Its the first time I swear. 😂😂😂
*"schlatt?"*
I absolutely have no idea how she won can someone please explain to me?
Can someone please explain what happened in basketball terms
I like how she saw it comming
Maybe this is fake? I mean they could have agreed to play that way.
Fake
He exposed his king in step 2. While she had her Queen open and ready to go in step one.
00:20 It was at this moment he knew he fucked up
You can feel the burning inside
This looks so premeditated and fake Its like watching AEW
Now thats a queen of chess right there, beating the king in 2 moves
He looked like mtashed in thumbnail bruh
again Minecrafters suck
this is so fake and unfunny
That’s called fools gambit
Ngl she looks like a dude
cant believe she actually pulled it off
Its a trick  2 step checkmate
"She's not gonna see this coming" *Loses less than 5 seconds*
scripted AF, not even fun to watch.
He says up just gonna bring my bishop out then literally makes a move that blocks the bishop LOL
STAGED
Well to be fair. He did exposed his King.  The goal here is to checkmate the King. He 's still trapped, yet exposed a 'one' wayfor it to move. That's why she won.
That blue yeti positioning hurts my soul
fake as hell the only 2 moves you can make as white to be mated on blacks second move.
Staged
you know this was a setup obviously.
This is staged, whats wrong with people? Are yoj that clueless ?
I don’t think this counts cuz pawns are blocking king’s way
0:24 no one talking about this devious ass smirk 😂😂😂
This is very real not a skit totally natural absolutely not a bit at all
WHAT WAS HE EVEN TRYING TO DO
0:18 The face she makes when she realises how bad this move was: "wait what, did he really just do that?" It gets me each time.
ez
He was so much self-confident I still can't believe he actually lost.
"Daffy, we're playing chess."
omg i just laughed so hard
This was staged
Jesus loves you .
xD
Stagged much? Lol
Can somebody tell me what she wasnt gonna see coming? Literally i dont understand why he did that move
LMAOOOO wish I knew wtf happened lol
Fake but funny😄
Schlatt.exe has stopped working
Bra the game forgot about castling it was so stunned 😂
schlatt.exe is not responding
This video is: ✔ Life changing ✔ Informative ✔ Inspiring ✔ Heartwarming ✔ Useful ✔calming ✔Enjoyable  ✔ Other
The most scripted thing I’ve seen in my entire life…
fake
She saw it coming
It genuinely and completely amazes me but at the same time saddens me that almost no one seems to realize that this is fake, it's a skit, it's not real just like 90% of anything on the internet, especially on twitch. What has our world actually come to
Ah the good old foolsmate gets them every time
r/watchpeopledieinside
0:18 she is staring at him like Wait is he actually serious and then makes the final burn of calling his name in confusion
Gotta love a streamer who knowingly sacrifices his pride by throwing a game for content.
I mean this was clearly a joke on schlatts part right nobody actually plays those moves thinking they are good
schlatt season
MDR les echecs y'en a qui sont echecs pas encore mat la france n'a pas di son dernier mot
The girl be like:what tf did i just do
Fake
"imma do what's called a pro gamer move"  the pro gamer move:
And thus he encouraged many people to pick up chess.
the fakest
This is how marriage works.
It's fake
That's why its better not to act better than the other 😂😂
G4 is an absolutely abhorrent move, this is because of schlatts main claim to why this is so good "Get the bishop out" he says while blocking in his bishop so he can't go to H3, he then further hinders his game by playing F3 Meaning not only can you not move to H3 anymore, F3 prevents G2 as well
Staged but funny
Obviously he did that on purpose 😂
Lost in two moves in chess which I foresaw this move because of the queen move set easy checkmate by a girl of all people   *emotional damage*.
Everyone is acting like Schlatt didn’t know exactly what he was doing lol
love seeing douche bags taken out...
This takes the saying "Do not underestimate anybody" to a new level.
I have never seen this opening, and honestly, it is the stupidest one I have ever seen. I’m telling you, not even a 50 Elo rated person would do that. They would just probably play D4 and stuff like that.
STRATEGIES - There's always a better one.
Losing a game of chess in 2 moves, otherwise known as “Fool’s mate”. It can only be achieved by black. The chances of this happening is insane.
I remember my Uncle doing this to me
Damm that is pretty genius
The way her eyes squint and head tilts forward at 0:16 shows how surprised she is
what about rocard or what its called, change king with a  towers place
XD
I remember the Hikaru AI destroying Samay with the same move
man's soul left his body
Props to people who play chess. My brains don't work like that.
I was like “how is that checkmate?” But I was mixing up the king and queen. Silly me.
Best video of entire YouTube
„She’s not gonna see this coming.“  Well, I really think he’s right, she definitely didn’t see that coming.
This was staged, but still funny
What a silly opening, obviously staged
He's a great actor gotta say
That was a nice script eh?
😧
everything about this is perfect
969k subs lol
Staged.
Staged
Did he let Alexandra win btw?
bro when she said “schlatt” i laughed so hard
I want to fix her blue yeti placement
Fake
As someone who play chess that is the worst thing to do and notoriously the move that makes you lose due to check mate
I'm so confused how did she win? he still had his king...
I love that move
No way anyone is that dumb tho
I lost the same way in my chess club in high school. Im like wtf??? I stop going to the chess club
Anti-strategy
Staged ofc. It's called the fool's mate
This had to be purposeful. No one just accidentally gets fools mated. Right?
That was so fake. Lol
i dont get it, how do u play chess in my head its like a roleplaying checker game😌
“my opponent can’t predict my next move if i can’t even predict my next move…”
Schlatt was too focused on impressing her that he died.
The obvious fakeness of this is painful
I dont think people understand that he thought the king was the queen and the opposite, she did what he thought he was doing xD
Definitely not staged...
Looks fake.
Staged
Scripted.
I still wanna know what his game plan was lol
not staged at all... cough cough
I wonder what the strategy was?
This felt horribly fake
She humbled him really quick lmfao
"Schlatt are you ok?"
Not the Gambit 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Everyone knows that move!
STAAAAAAGEDDDDDDDD AHHHHHHHH
his game was pretty much this..  protect the king!..  yessir!…  .. proceeds to open the front door straight to the king..
funny but obviously fake. a woman would never win in real life
this seems a little staged to me
schpit on
Reminded me of Charlie’s 1000 iq play against xqz
400  score
That was legit
Not staged at all, great content
He had to have done this on purpose.
This is how I feel whenever I play chess
Seems obviously fake
why would he do that? I call fake. Unless he's a very special boi.
There’s no way in hell Schlatt lost a chess game in 2 moves, get real.
I love how you all believe that he didn't do this on purpose. lmao
I remember her from when Charlie White won his historic victory
why shlatt
Must be fake. I  don't play chess and I consider myself a stupid person but still knows 90% of the moves, and I would never move them like that cuz it's obvious what she could do then.
Jschlatt fell victim to the Fool’s Mate…
This is the face of a ruined man
?
you know this was planned but here we are, 20+ million views.
I'm out of context? Is this a genuine joke that he makes on himself or did he just loose at the most typical and noob tactical move which only beginers fall into? By the way, I don't know the name in english, but here we call this "el jaque mate pastor" and it's an easy way to defeat a rival at the very beggining of the game whose level of knowledge is literally 0. Please, I demand answers.
Calling it staged
O my god 🤣🤣😆😆
Schlatt went Splatt
I don't think in all her years of playing chess she met a person who chose the two worst starting moves.
Literally every anime character that tries to prove something XD
that's the fastest chess victory
Why would she "not see it coming"? If the girl didn't know the fool's mate, what was the guy's plan?
“Nothing to see here” so that was a lie 😂
Was literally the most scripted thing I've ever seen
she: sorry i miss clicked
Fools move
So my strategy has already gone viral
This was in my recommended and now I’ve seen this guy and I share the same YouTube name 😅
So fake bro. Could’ve at least learnt a thing or two from when XQC got beat in 3 moves.
Looks scripted
dead
You delta male
So many viewers, why ?
G4 get the bishop out.. then doesn’t get the bishop out. 😑
He got owned  Look at his face
Wait... you can lose in 2 moves in this game?
Um, you don't play chess, do you?
“Schlatt” did that on purpose, those moves are the first ones in any chess club or class you learn not to do.
Schlatt even had a board in the background saying "I LOVE CHESS".
I was gonna comment "me who doesn't know chess: " but now I'll use this to say I know how to play before going up against someone and lose on purpose, thanks schlatt!
Bull s hit  totally staged
I'm curious to know what he was planning
I haven't played chess, so I might need a quick explanation as to what this means.
This is obviously fake. Or a comedy skit IDK. But all you commentors seem to think its not staged?
This is literally the least ammount of moves a chess game can have.
Beauty with brain❤️
Ah the ole queen on her color two move.
I mean the man literally walked *straight* into it. I was in chess club everyone knew you only did that when you *wanted* to die.
He has to be trolling
this is pretty obviously faked.
Giving me the infamous XQC vs Charlie vibe.
fun part if the script
*EMOTIONAL DAMAGE*
"Hehe she's not gonna see this coming" then proceeds to play a sequence of moves no beginner plays. Also what even was she not gonna see coming from that opening? These throws for content really irritate when you realize he was just like yeah, this will catch my viewers by surprise and then they'll share it everywhere, I'm so smart.
She did not see this fokin coming for sure.
I do not know who you are.  I do not know who she is.  I don't watch chess of any kind.  I randomly got recommended this and I am not disappointed.
It's called "Madman's Checkmate" for a reason (? Jsjsj
Fake and arranged. Anyone who's ever played a single game of chess...wait, 20m fkin views?🤨 People are dumb and deserve what they get.
When I was young I was at a chess tournament and somehow pulled this off on an opponent. The look on his face when I said "checkmate:.
I was in Chess Club once in school and I actually won a Game exactly like that.  The kid well not a Kid he was like 15 or 14.  I beat Him in 2 moves and he was like Can I get a Redo?  I was like No Redos unless you want to have a Rematch.
I did this to a friend once. Was the last time he let that happen.
She looked closely liked she couldn’t believe her eye sockets
Wow, I had no clue women could even play chess, let alone beat a man.       (kidding)
Does nobody else see "I love chess" in the background? Lol
what is he even tryna do?
E P I C  F A I L !  ♟
Bullshit
racist 0 vs girl 1
I am confusion
she didn't have to do him like that
He knew exactly what he was doing
Literally called fool's mate.
wait i’m so confused i never fully played chess
This has to be staged
“Schlatt?”     Top 100 one liners after the kill
"Schlatt?" XDD
how is this a checkmate
He made the biggest rookie mistake ever this exact same thing happened to me in the library when I was 12 real sh*t 🤣🤣
Idk whats it in english but in german that would be a Schäferschach
Clearly staged.
n00b
Is that move even allowed!?
I can’t imagine this not being staged.
Schlatt?
"She's not gonna see this coming"  By her expression you could see she really didnt see it coming, that he'd reveal his king so hastily
and also he banned all dreamstans in 2 commands on twitch
Is this real?
And he loves chess!  Source: his whiteboard in the back...
It's called "Fool's mate" and it's the fastest checkmate.
He knew(?)
I remember being in the library as but a boy and watching the older men play chess. One of the guys wanted to leave but his friend convinced him one more game. The man who wanted to leave did this move and left. It was an incredible thing to see at that age. Everyone there was surprised and laughing at the other guy.
Checkmate
Not at all staged and definitely a real, intentional sequence of events.
all the confidence that was build up was shattered in vain
era longo manin xdd
Well he wasn’t wrong. She definitely didn’t expect him to make the worst possible move lol.
Dude I’ve done this a few times to people and it hilarious to see the look on their faces
Fake video....
Oh, the classic (shortest game).  His face was priceless.
The hope in his eye, Crushed in 2 moves
imagine getting fools mate
Ah yes, the infamous "You fucked up" maneuver.,
Maybe he got confused and mistook her Queen for her King?
Unpassive gaming
Remember the point of chess is *to think about the move your making* Dude just tossed out a couple pawns and got got
My sister and me used to play a lot of chess. And one fine day I used this move. That was shear fluke, since I didn't have any idea about the moves.
Staged.
No way big guy didn't pick fool's mate for the bit
“You can pinpoint the exact moment his heart rips in half.”
I refuse to believe that this isn't staged.
10 for the idea. 5 for the acting.
I love her: "Is this for real? Is he for real?" as she immediately realises what he did
Was that a world record speedrun?
WTF happen?
It's possible to lose in 1 move, by moving pond to d3, and moving black bishop to b4
The way all his emotion just disappears
We played some chess in class once and someone got 2 people in a row with this
Ahhh yes. The two move checkmate.
This is so content baiting like we are supposed to go: yEAh, wOw, He dIdN't SEe thAT OnE ComiNg... bruh that was do obvisouly on purpose.
This is the type of video I wish was scripted and wasn’t
Can someone explain to me what happened
heh she's not gonna see this one coming *loses the game*
women are often surprised how fast its over with him
Context? Is this purposely moved or by his own strategy?
this is easy.
Clearly acted
...schlatt?
20 million views!!! Cha Ching We're the ones that have been checkmated by this trap.
Obviously done on purpose
You can just see him die inside
What sells it is her face at the end “Yes, that just happened and I myself am confused how quick that was...”
“Schlatt” wasn’t expecting that move
I have done this move once before completely on accident. I had no idea you could win a game this fast but I saw that queen move on my 2nd turn and went for it before I fully realized it would be checkmate.  I will probably never do that again, but it was awesome to be able to say I did it.
HA! GOTTIM
She got uno reverse card lol
how can you get checkmated in 2 in 2021
I read about this in a book and I've been waiting for it to be done literally anywhere else ever since
Should have typed "GG EZ".
My friend pranked me the same way and I was like damn
Schlatt: My board says I Love Chess. And I'm gonna beat you at it  Alex: *Amazing, every word of what you just said...was wrong*
idk i just hate this clip because this has to be scripted... right?
Seems fake
Losing that fast is impressive AF. Wish I had that kind of skill.
how to simp, step 1: lose on purpose by using a famous move that anyone whose ever read about chess knows about
Not staged at all.
I can never tell what's a bit and what's not with these people. Same with minx
How tf do you not win against a girl
I can't figure out why every comment is reacting like this isn't set up
Why is the background music Airship Fortress from Mario Kart DS
First xqc vs critikal... now this...
I want to see what his OG plan was
that had to be on purpose.. there's no way someone would make such a crucial mistake 🤣
Its actually very simple, you just have to either bait people, or get a noob to be played against.
What a bs vid. Fake
I think he ded
My grandpa would do this to me when I was 10. It was brutal and he made me work for my first win.
It's called fool's mate for a reason
Her face when he made that mood lmao
Claims to know chess and falls into one of the most basic gambits everyone learns to avoid on day 1 of learning the game.
Oh man, that moment when Alex's face just instantly shifts into "What the fuck???  Did he just?  Does he not realize...???" and just *holds* that disapproving look the entire time after that...It's incredible.  XD
has to be staged. theres literally no reason for him to make that move in a normal game
Not funny because it's fake but I'll let you pass and won't dislike the video
This is obviously staged, but it’s so funny that I don’t even care lol.
that look on her face was the epidemy of Get Fucked!!! lawl
I love how Airship Fortress is used in a video like this lmao
Could it be more scripted...
So are we going to ignore how she’s talking into a Blue Yeti mic from the top like that?
This move is pretty common if you're unaware of it.
Isnt that an illegal move? You cant put your king in harms way?
Can someone explain me what happened?
I did this to my friend once
Me vs my bff with puzzles in any game. He is Schlatt.
This has got to be a skit. There's no way it isn't. Very funny 😂
That, my friends, at the end there is the face of someone who's dead inside.
Get the bishop out? Hahahahahaha.
*BEAUTIFUL*
When you see any two "red letters" after a person's name you play E4 then some knight move. Anything else and you do this...
What exactly happened? Someone please tell me
I did this same move to my mate a couple weeks ago, he was so confused as to how it happened lol
Only beginners fall for that move.
I've lost in 3 moves... But 2?
That’s called a trick mate
*Sees title* Is this gonna be a fool's mate? *Guy gets Fool's mated* 😀
he looks like my teacher
Its like a 6'8 beast picking on a 4 year old
I refuse to believe that fool’s mates exist. They’re like dragons and the Tooth Fairy. They’re not real and they can’t hurt me.
This is rare genius
He was so confident
I'm confused... Non of this seemed real, but the comments are so sure of it. Has anyone ever vetted videos like this to check?
I love chess. Back on the board : but i cant play
"How to resolve any game! Follow these 2 easy steps!
Man that face she made. like "Did he actually do that?"!
who believes this
"Schlatt?"
I saw that one black pawn moving forward... I knew he was done for.
That is called fools mate.  It is the most hated and insulting move to ever use for 2 reasons.  1: You are a fool to fall into its trap. 2: Your opponent is such a fool that it is an insult to acknowledge your opponents existence as a human being for falling for such a worthless format of play.  There is only 1 way to perform that move and I performed it.  The bastard that was in charge of the chess club in middle school was the worst player I have ever scene.  We were both in 6th grade but I was at the skill level of near a grand master and loved beating the computer at chess constantly.  I kept beating adults easily without it even being a challenge.  This asshole lost on his first game when we went to state championship only because of me.  Only 3 of us passed the first game which was pretty fucking bad when you realize that there were 28 of us.  1 kid lost on his second game.  Then the 8th grader that was the only one that actually was a good player on our entire team but he was basically really bad compared to most players he made it to the 3rd game and he got knocked out of the state tournament in 1 hour and 15 minutes.  I made it to the last game and I had to pee like a fucking race horse at that time because I used the bathroom before I started and the championship started at 6am and my last game started at 2am.  That is correct I was playing chess for nearly an entire day.  I did not know where the bathrooms were and no one doing the competition told me a dam thing.  Seriously those kind of conventions need seriously work with organization.  My parents were actually getting worried and if cell phones were more common my mother would have called the cops hours before because they refused to allow parents to watch the competitions.  Basically I knew I was going to win in 3 turns and the kid was wasting his fucking time and mine but if I did not use the bathroom then I would piss my pants before my next turn would be over and so I begged to take a fucking break and they finally allowed it.  I get back and the fucking kid removed all the pieces and changed it to giving me only 1 pawn and a king and gave himself 13 kings and it was his turn so he then just move 1 piece and screamed he wins.  Dumbass cheated in the stupidest way unimaginable.  Then that asshole I found out tried pulling the same bullshit in the American championship last game and his father who was the same judge in the game I played against him turned out to be the same judge in that game as well.  The kid made it to the final game there without his father cheating for him so I know I would have beaten the American championship.  So I got back to my school and dealt with the original asshole from my school was not the kid I faced in the championship.  Well my team captain kept bragging about how he got us so much respect in the championship and how he won and how great and glorious he was and I called him on his lying bullshit and told them all the truth that he lost his first game in the tournament in 5 moves which was true he made the stupidest bullshit mistakes and he actually moved his king out before moving any other actual good pieces and he got his ass checkmated instantly .  So he started cussing at me and I cussed at him and then I said how about we play 1 game and if I win you step down and I become chess team leader because you are clearly unqualified.  He angerly agreed and then I fools mated his ass with the 2 move check mate and then he screamed he is kicking me out of the team because I am not a team player and how I am a moron and how he is god and a huge amount of stupid soar looser bullshit and demanded I am kicked off the team and I told him that he can not kick me off the team because it is the teacher who oversees the paper that has that authority which is 100% and the teacher basically told him the same thing that he agreed to step down and that I was the new captain.  I told her then that nah he can keep the job I quit.  There is really no challenge to it and if he is the state of the schools chess team the he can kill the schools team the way only a fool like him can do and it was an insult to even acknowledge him as a human being.  I then walked out of that club pissed off and angry at the entire stupid state of the games players.  He then came to me when I was in 7th grade and demanded that I go play for the team he demanded that I have to because I am still on the team and I owe him for how I acted towards him.  I laughed my ass off.  I over heard quite often because the chess team before I went to that school was actually more popular than all sports teams combined and the schools news letter was constantly talking about the chess club and well that schools chess club had what is called a golden age where they won dam near every game for decades and I mean their golden age lasted from 1948 when that school was first founded until 2000.  The golden age literally lasted until the year before I went their and was basically constantly being handed down in the same family as the chess team leader sense 1973.  That kids family was huge into chess and ever sense his fathers oldest brother went their when he was a kid that kids family basically kept handing down the reins in their family for nearly 30 years.  Well so I kept up with knowing what was happening because it was funny as hell because he ran that team so badly into the ground that in order to even qualify to enter the state championship we would need to win 27 of the remaining 27 games that could be played.  At very max because of how the rules work I would be able to only play 21 games.  Then 6 kids all in 6th grade who had no real training and only joined the club to goof off after school would have to win their games.  I knew it was basically impossible to actually get into the state championship so I said sure I will help you but I have a few conditions. 1: I become team leader.  2nd: You call me your God King Master.  3rd: You get on your hands and knees and beg me. 4: You become my servant without any talking back.  Naturally he refused which is what I was actually wanting and I said good luck then dumbass.  I laughed as I walked away with him screaming at me like the looser he was.  I read they never even made it to the championship.  What surprised me was 3 of the 6 students did win their games but the problem still remained they were a player down.  They did find someone to go into the game with them but then the person they got lost every single game they played.  The needed 27 wins they only got 3.  When I was in 8th grade so many people hated the chess club at that point because of him that the club got removed from the roster because well they needed at least 25 students and they had only 2.  The dumbass leader and 1 kid who thought he try to learn who literally cussed the leader out and quit after 3 days.  The club was removed from the school and the club completely disbanded.  The thing that ended that club was the family who forged the greatest of its golden age which is fitting when you think about it.  I looked into the school a few times and that club was never started again.  Chess is full of arrogant asshole and I was becoming 1 of them so I quit and went to actually have fun elsewhere.  I ended up going to play yugioh with a bunch of other kids and most of the players in the chess club went to the grassy area where we often would bring bedsheets and our notebooks and some kids brought pillows and we brought out pieces of wood and we played outdoor yugioh.  We had tons of fun.  I went from a pile of shit club to actually having fun loosing in Yugioh and winning a lot but it was fun and I actually lost quite a few times which made the game actually fun.
HAHAHA This is amazing👌🤣
HALLO EVERYONE WHO ARE STILL WATCHING THIS ON 2022😀 ✋ AND IT STILL LOVELY ❤️🔥😎
Yeah.. She saw it..
Lmao, that was totally staged for content! 😂
I am not a chessplayer myself, but when i went to a few classes the first thing that our teacher said was"Never open those two pawns on the sides of the king in the begining"
Can someone explain what happened? I am what you might call a dumbass when it comes to chess. Edit: Nevermind. I saw someone call it "Fool's mate", so I googled it.
May grandpa is a master chess and he teach me every day I remember 5:30 am he make breakfast then 6:00 am he will teach me all day so what the girl do is idk but I know that move
Yawn 🥱
When I saw the king stuck in that little hole I knew something was wrong
I know he did this shit on purpose 🤣
That's what always happens to me, I'm too focused on my strategy and I don't see the openings I give to my opponent, my brain is smol
Obviously staged lol
How is this possible?
Goin for that king sacrifice
This is as rare as a raw steak. Rather than going for the Botez gambit, Alexandria actually checkmates with the queen
Why would you do that?
Good thing this was digital because if this happened IRL 1999 would repeat again..
Whether it was staged or not, it was still really funny to me
That's called a "fool's mate". Fitting.
Her look when she wins is priceless...
The definition of "I am a genius!" "Oh no!"
Fools mate is a good setup for a meme I guess
Everybody talks about the moment his soul left his body...   ... but I just love the moment Alex realizes this man ended his own career with that second move.
20 millions views 1 day. 20 million people saw Schlatt's lowest point in his life.
I managed to lose like this as black in one of my first games ever...
Why tf does she look like female version of Professor Akali?
This wasn't just a defeat. This was the greatest mortal moral annihilation of all time - every fiber of his body was destroyed, reducing him to a husk as his mind caved in on itself contemplating the massive defeat, while his pride lay in shambles of its former glory, deflating an ego fast enough to break the sound barrier.
When a good thing goes baddest
lol the mario kart music
porn level acting
But what did he wanted to try
Woah, it was fast
this felt scripted
Since its this guy I have a feeling this is scripted or he knew that he was going to lose to get a clip out of it
As someon who doesn't know how to play chess and just moves peices to participatein something.......how did he lose? 💀
Aight this is in my recommendations and I have no idea what just happened? I don't play chess lol, can someone please explain?
Haha so funny. Well acted too. Hilarious. I wish I could see the downvotes.
Schlatt?
This has to be fake/intended, no way someone's this stupid
she was about to do the 3 moves win tho...
Wow, great video. You can barely tell that they worked this out before hand.
The funny thing is that this video has more views than the actual video.
WOW THATS SO FAST 😍
Simping
FOOLS MATE
Lmao so staged. You don't intentionally play into the fastest possible checkmate. That play is -the fastest- way to lose... it's the worst possible move combination in chess lol
He thought of every possibility like Dr strange except that one
dislike it's 4 moves
Yikes...
He went through all 5 stages of grief in that moment he lost
"I love chess" in the background.
I beat the best chess player in my county (no tournaments just playing with a friend) and she turns and ends over a stalemate I had her checkmate and she classes as a draw 🙈
Well schlats an idiot so it really isn't that hard!..
Unfortunately in no universe would someone new or veteran to chess play those moves when trying to win earnestly.
Well that went well XD XD XD
Much to learn you have...
She saw it coming man looked up 30 min before the stream how to lose at chess
She a grand master so…
fake
He either did it on purpose, has no idea how to play or is incredibly stupid.
Don't look botez pretty face, especially her eyes and smile. You will lost focus and make a wrong way.
We could all see this coming when he said ‘I go first?’ while playing the white pieces
Hi I'm a broccoli
wait, it's actually possible to lose in 2 moves?
I don’t often do this, but why in Jesus Christ’s name would YouTube ever recommend something as dumb as a clickbait chess video. Algorithm works in mysterious ways I guess
Oh yeah, that wasn’t staged at all!
the side eye she gives IS SO FUCKING FUNNY
This looks badly acted
staged
This has to be staged.  Nobody with a mild experience of chess could possibly make the two most obvious worse moves with that much confidence. I say it's fake.
The queen gambit in real life...
That was for sure intentional
The look of disbelief she made after the 2nd move.  "Did this guy really just do something that stupid"
Who are they? Lol
her face journey is the best thing. he moves the pawn and she looks shocked, then disappointed, then incredulous. amazing.
A year damn
Correct me if I’m wrong but I thought you cannot put yourself into check?
I don't get it, what happened?
"she's not gonna see this coming" yeah, you will lose so quickly she wont get a single clue as to what it is
How has nobody realized that he called the pawn a bishop???
rigged
Mission failed
I've had this done to me, and done this to someone once.
He didn't even lose to "fool mate" it was even simpler than that.
Is this a joke?
😂 I was laughing for an hour straight!
Bait your opponent into a Berger move, looks cooler. And it's only 3 moves more.
Baka mitai
deserved
Why is this woman wearing obscene amounts of makeup while alone at home? Does she not know God made her fine just the way she is?
I watched this without sound, but I even felt that awkward silence
Idk why still break  down laughing every time I see this
This has to be scripted, right?
He deserves it 😙
That was the equivalent of an anime unsheath and resheathing
Only someone who knows how to play chess can make the worst move. Nice try. Staged.
Literally me trying to play chess.
Big guy-U guys really thought i lost unintentionally??lol
Today marks 1 year of the vid
the fact that he chose the worst moves possible damn that's some ill luck there
My dad used to do that to me every time we played chess. I had to learn specifically to counter that move  (except that he combined the queen with the bishop and would take the pawn just to the bishop side of the king). It's aggravating as hell.  Still hilarious though when its not me.
First time watching this video, A coincidence that I watched it on January 28, but it's 2022.
That be called Foolsmate.
Why is the internet full of fake vids? At least this one was short.
“I LOVE CHESS”
I didn't even know it was possible to lose chess this quickly
Anyone that doesnt see how incredibly staged this was either doesn't understand chess, or is just plain slow.
Yeah cause this wasn’t a stagger game.
One of the hardest ways to lose in chess is this it's called 'fools mate'
The only thing in chess more humiliating is losing to somebody who used the bong cloud opening
This is scripted clearly, anyone who knows the basics of chess knows this is the fastest possible way to lose a game.
This cracks me up
Noob
Im wondering what he thought that "she wouldn't see coming"?
This happened to me once. I laughed so loud because I couldn't believe it was over so fast. But live and learn, now I know how to not start the game
She used your move but with the queen.
Double the pride, double the fall.
Omae Wa mu Shindefu
this actually happened to me once and i was in a tournament and i was fighting for my school 💀
Looks like he didn't see that one coming.
My brain:What just happened?
Fun fact: this Checkmate is called the Fool's Mate
Peinlich selbst der Drachen Lord spielt besser, tatsächlich sogar.
It's 1 year later and some say he's she's still calling for Schlatt
Staged stuff is staged.
I didn't understand that cuz u don't play chest PLEASE explain to me
Who is the girl? She is so pretty🥺🥺
Beginners after learning "Playing the game": ITS RIGHT THERE, ITS A CHECKMATE
For any confused people who don't know anything about chess, the king can attack on a diagonal and kill the queen.. Thus, fool's mate.
Bruh
This is gona make it in a "people dying inside" compilation.
I love how disappointed she looks when defeating him.
Insert the audio "Emotional Damageeee"
The confused/disappointed look on her face lmaoo
He was right, she actually didn't see it coming 😂
I swear this happened to me lmao just random moves then somehow I lost quickly than intended
And from what i saw this is the shortest game in chess like this is the shortest way to lose
Guy had all possibilities of 9 quntellion moves but chose the two to get mated.
I have so many questions
well, if this is not staged then this is the first time that I have watched the fool's mate in a real match.
Never play F3.
Out of all the history of worst choices, he had to choose the worst one.
Jchlat didn know The king and queen are the oopsite
You've heard of the King's Gambit.  I now present to you the, the King's Folly.
Nerf queen imo
was this legit or staged to create content/a meme?
That was EPIC!!😂😂
His face tho
This is obviously fake and he made the moves just to make this video
The computer does that to me all the time
painfully scripted
I wonder how much money he lost from ads by not making this 30 seconds.
20 000
I don't know how to play chess so this shot makes zero sense to me lol
can someone explain to me how she won im dont understand
Staged af. Don’t recommend channel
There are more possible games of chess than there are atoms in the universe, and you happened to pick the one with maximum embarrassment 👏👏👏
i dont play chess, so how did she win?
Totally not staged or anything
Same happened with me in a chess club when I was at 6th grade , i newly learned chess and was very confident that I can defeat anyone but as soon i challenged a 4th grader he defeated me in just 2 moves my confidence was shattered in million pieces 😂
"She has no idea what coming" last words before disaster
My laughter sounded like a A-10 Warhog firing for a minutes,Jesus how and why did he do that
2 years of chess club was totally worth learning how to do shit like this
This is why I (rage) quit chess!
That is the most stupidest shit i have ever seen...
The first pawn was deeply disturbing, the second one had me screaming.
I love the way she's just looking at him like "are you kidding?"
F
HE DEAD!!!
0:21 It was at this moment that he knew... _he ****ed up._
Nerd
Once I made that against a grandmaster bot and I lost in the same exact fashion.
100% not staged!
let's say it's lose from turn 1 because not e2-e4......
this is definently staged
how to crush a man's ego in 2 seconds
I once beat a friend who had won chess tournaments once just because he moved the wrong pawn like that.
1 year later. True art.
I love the look she gives him right before she decimates him lmao she's like "Are you dumb?"
She's not gonna see this coming >:) *evil laugh noises* Alex moves the queen *Confusion, smile slowly disappears till the disappoint come*
So staged lmao
Fake
*"You never can tell if your telling the truth or not..."*
Some would say this mistake was a "one in seven point fine trillion chance"...
"Get the bishop out"  Proceeds to block his bishop
Bro got fools mate
must be fake/scripted
fuck chess, being an army officer in strategy is most funny
that was staged lol
this is scripted.......you all get that right? at least on his part.
fake
Quedo 🤡
Not hating but this was definitely on purpose and probably not even meant for to believe it was real... But was still funneh
Any% time to lose a chess game
She could easly win over Magnus Carlsen
Wait, what happened? I don't play chess or know anything about it.
Its always easy to tell when something is scripted
I did this exact thing one time by accident
She baited him so hard with the old "I'm just gonna play simple chess" routine.
Note: Me and my friends were all the smart kids.  I went to school with people who were godlike at chess, those same people were my friends. They still played chess with me even though I was average and they would always beat me. They'd just play with me to relax because they didn't have to think hard. I just enjoyed playing the game and then feeling bamboozled when they won. I just enjoyed the moment even though I didn't stand a chance.  But what is funny, is that I also could have been a chess god, but I'm just not passionate in the game to spend a lot of time on it.
I know what he was trying to do, but I feel like every player dreams of this situation. You saw the girls face — she looked like she was waiting for this her whole life. No way someone wouldn’t notice
She evil af😂
Who is she😂
I pulled this off only once lmao, it was against the worst guy on our chess team in middle school but when you have the opportunity for a two move, you can't pass it up, not even for mercy.
Is anyone stupid enough to think this isn't a setup?
Yup, knew it
0:08 "I'm just gonna play simple chess, I'm just putting my pawn at the center of the board *nothing to see here* ." She was terrible at bluffing her big brain play. He should've noticed she's trying to hide something but was too busy thinking about his own play.
That is the kind of moment I’d refer to as: “BAM, WHAT?”
Clearly, Pogtopia should've just challenged Schlatt to chess if they wanted to win.
I’m not asking for likes. F that. If you’re a fan of “Schlatt” show out in the replies.
Sometimes when I face someone new to the game I use the castle trick
fake & staged
The Schlatt mate
Me watching this video without having a single clue of what's going on
That is called a Scholar's Mate because it is the fastest possible checkmate in Chess. Most people who lose to a Scholar's Mate do it on purpose! ... The vast majority of people, anyway. Dear god this guy is either extremely unlucky, stupid, or a great actor
And that is whats comonly called as a "fools mate"  cause lets face it you kinda have to be a fool to be mated like this
The way the music abruptly stops
*jschlatt*                              soldier you died, by a wahmen 🤣
Dang, he broke my record!
I'm not good in chess... but damn, even I was able to see the big mistake in that move.
I did this to my sister
Que Hacker
I don’t know shit about chess but all I know if the king dies u win how did she win?
0:22 got that Queens Gambit look going there.
This is obviously scripted
LMFAO this is exactly what happened when in played chess for the first time with my aunt
I know this
Did he,… forget which one was a king and a queen…? I don’t see any moves that he could do that would validate whatever the fuck that was other than that
HER FACE WHEN SHE'S ABOUT TO MAKE THE MOVE LOLOLOLOL
his straight face right after he loses hahah
That was the most fake thing ever
"not gonna see this commin" The hell was he going for?
Why the music is AIRSHIP FORTRESS from MARIO KART DS?!
Man talked too much
yeah that happened to me like about two times ;-;
No I can fly
Wow, Schlatt, you lost in two moves. That takes an awful amount of skills.
Didn't know it was possible but I stand corrected
wow 2 moves
This is staged right?
Not staged at all
🏆 Here's your quickest losing game in Chest trophy.
nice move
The silence after she wins 🤣🤣🤣🤣 0:21
“I don’t think we should see each other anymore”
Can someone explain how he lost?
Imagine getting destroyed by a woman and it only took her one move..
I think this is the video that gave him 900k subs.
I keep loosing in chess with only a few moves too... ._.
as someone who has no knowledge of chess at all, HOW on EARTH did he manage to do this?
I genuinely can’t tell if he learned these moves from somewhere for the bit or he is genuinely so bad at chess that he managed to ingenuously come up with the fastest way to lose.
It's almost as if it was scripted
I'm loving it
This is like the opposite of Cr1tikal winning in two moves
The editing in this video is beautiful.
Staged
This is staged people
This checkmate is called "Fool's mate".
Staged
Literaly rhe fastest chess fame i have ever seen. 2 MOVES LONG LOL
Lol the old fools mate.
Fake
Somebody tell him its called fools mate and hes posting it
Staged
I didn't even know a chess game could possibly end in two moves 😂 despite knowing the rules for like 15 years....
It’s staged.
It is all according to his plan... You see chess is a strategy and a mind game combined He purposely lured her queen into killing his king so all of the pieces got motivated by revenge and win the battle by draw It's all mind game all along.
G4 worst possible move
what you see: Shlatt.exe does not respond. what's going on inside Shlatt's head: ABANDON THE SHIP! *EXPLOSION* SHE'S GOING DOWN! JIMMY, WE HAVE TO GO! JIMMY? OH GOD, JIMMY!!! *COUGHS UP BLŌOD*
Is it real or was this staged?
He was right, she probably didn’t see that one coming.
I love that when he makes his second move you can see her face instantly change like she’s thinking “wait did he really just do that?”
He knew, right?  He said "g4, get the bishop out," which is at least a sound idea, and indicates that he knows enough chess to know what "g4" means.  Surely he also knew how to get mated in 2 moves.  I couldn't see any other ideas behind f3.
Pretty sure schlatt did this on purpose..
I believe this is around a 1 in 9000 chance of schlatt making moves in which he does in turn 2.
I mean, he challenged a chess champion, what was the expected outcome?
I would lose to Alex in 1 move 😍
Its not a chess mate because u can block the quoen
She definitelly did not expect that
he moved the f-pawn. its called that coz if u open that up, primarily early game, you're dead meat. control the 4 centre squares first and make sure to castle your king too
Schlatt now is the world record holder for the fastest defeat in chess, the last one was xqc
Amateur
Gee, it's almost as if it was staged in order to make a viral video for views!
Lmao
this happened to me in real life competetive chess
She fooled you into making that wrong move to expose the King
Fake
Same happened to me i lost in 2 moves
Staged, but still very funny.
Out of 47 septillion positions, he *chose* to be mated in 2.
If this wasn't on purpose, I've gotta know what his "plan" was.
His face at the end: 😦 Her face:👿
L
Lmao I’ve done that too many times to others lol
He was like: “ A shit, I got bamboozled but that wasn’t bad ngl”
0:20 LMAO Dude did not see that Coming!
Rule Number 1: Never Underestimate Your Enemy, Let Them Estimate You And Destroy Them.
2 moves the most easiest but rarest move to make
0:23 lmao I think she broke him. He simply can’t comprehend it
what was he trying to do? the second pawn move defeats the purpose of trying to get the bishop out.
LMFAO 🤣
Lol says "shes not gonna see this coming" on his second move as he moves his pawn forward...definitely knew he was putting himself in a fools mate lol ain't no way somebody think they're catching someone off guard by moving a pawn at the very beginning of the game lmao
Can’t believe that people still fall for the Fools Mate.  Like Schlatt knew who he was playing against, right?
Fools checkmate moment
Lol
What I'm surprised more isn't how she did that, but how Schlat choose that move, like there's a bunch of moves you can choose, why that! 😂😂
I don’t know chess rules too much, how did he lose?
I found out about this play like a year ago and i tried it to my mom and she fell for it😆😂
I thought it wasn’t possible to lose in two moves. I was proven wrong.
King gambit
HAHAAHAHHAHAHHAHA GET RECKED
fools checkmate or am i getting that wrong
Can someone explain oh this is a Checkmate for me
That’s impressive.
When the tactic requires the opponent to be a pro but the opponent only has enough braincells to play regular chess
Fools-mate
Can someone explain what happened? I know very little about how to play chess.
Me playing against a easy bot be like
woah
His 'I love chess' on the background makes it ironic
“She’s not going to see this one coming”
this was 99.999999% staged
TOO EASY
Ah the game I always wanted to happen but never in my lifetime did.
0:19
Fools mate
Scholared
I've always found "Fools mate" a little harsh as a name for this checkmate.  B4 has a small amount of logic to it, let's the bishop out and can attack the black knight whenever it moves to F6. F3 is less logical but does protect the B pawn.  Now the 3 move checkmate... THAT should be Fool's Mate.  1) E4,  E5.  2) QH5,   KE7.  3)QxE5 checkmate.   KE7 is stupid on so many levels.
I guarantee this was staged. The slight overacting was the real teller.
His face really says “what the flip just happened”
Well he was right, I don't think ANYONE expected that
O U T S T A N D I N G  M O V E
I mean you gotta give it to him that is some serious losing
Nice simping bro.
“Fool’s mate”
why did he lose
How did she sin if you know then Write an comment.(btw like this comment) Click here 👍🏻
"she's not going to see this one coming" Famous last words
I think he’s simping for her to play that bad
I already knew this movement and even so I failed in the same way, I couldn't believe it XD
Bruh i gotta learn this move
why does this video have 20,000,000 views?!
I think Schlatt mixed up the queen and the king.
Lmao
Literally that why girls hate *"no school"* so we boys just losing now
Boom bam bop bada bop bomp POW   How it actually went: *bomp POW!*
Foolsmate
What the actual fuck just happened?
This guy looks like Chris from mrbeast in the thumbnail
I thought you needed to capture the king to win
You can pinpoint the exact moment when the light leaves Schlatt’s eyes
Clearly did not pay attention to the board
Fool's Mate she wins
bruhh this is definitely scripted because i'm pretty sure schlatt is above avg iq
Covid becomes vaccine resilient world: 0:20
she fucking killed his confidence
When Schaltt hits the fan
Schlatt .exe has stoped responding
as a person who plays chess, i saw his mistake because this is the sort of tunnel-visioned move i would make
What is the background music pls ?
her face says it all "is he for real? Aight, checkmate this"
His face of dissapoinment
Wait I don’t get how he lost
How did she win
schlatt be like: wtf that wasn't suppose to happen
BRUH
life is a chess game to schlatt.... meant to be lost to a women in two moves
The face, you know it from the face, absolute funny, moments like that are the best.
"Im going to play simple chess"
Schlatt hung mate faster than Alexandra Botez could hang her queen. Impressive.
LOL!
😐
Could make a grown man cry
Fool's Mate
That final “Schlatt” completes this video
the look she gives just before moving the queen piece is so great. it was like she had no idea if schlatt did that move on purpose or not
I like how he said he moved the first piece to get the bishop out but moving the second piece immediately trapped the bishop even if she didn't put him in checkmate
She never saw it coming... Probably because it never happened
my friend did this to me before... however i blocked myself with that f-pawn😭
“She’s not gonna see this coming” Botez 🤨
That is just brutal
Kings are supposed to both be on white, therefore it’s set up wrong, therefore technically it’s cheating, so he didn’t really lose.  Edit: ok sorry I’ve done some research because I was super confused and there are different variants of chess, which would include at least one where this is true, which would be the one I’ve always known and my relatives have known. My grandfather has a chess set where the box has it set up this way in the picture on it, (it’s a quality set as well), hence the confusion.
For those of you who don't know, this is the infamous and only way you can lose in 2 moves. If you've played chess for a while, you probably already know, this is nicknamed "Fools Mate"
Such a noob! LOL!
I wonder what the aftermath was
4 moves but ok
Typical Shlatt
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
My face was just like schlatts at the end. That was both shocking and hilarious 😂
Nothing to see here... she was baiting him
I wish I knew how to play chess so I could understand this.
It's called Fool's Mate for a reason..
He wasn't wrong when he said "she's not gonna see his shit coming"
Schlatt.exe has stopped working
Love ya
"it's not a mistake",✨IT'S A MASTERPIECE✨
Schlatt reaction 🤣
I even saw that checkmate lol
Lol
Schlat’s too smart to not know what the fools mate is.
Schlatt.exe has stopped responding
Schlatt: she's not gonna see this one coming 😄 Alex: *checkmates* Schlatt: *surprised pikachu*
Who here's in 2022
EVERY TIME XDDD THE FACE XDDDDDDDDD
Her teaching style is impressing.
I would know this would reach 20 million view :0
Lmao this is so staged
Ahh, scholars mate
It's almost like he did this on purpose???
*schlatt plays f3* "you fell for it, fool!"
As someone who’s played chess for over 5 years this actually hurts my soul
Lol
Yay
Good job you lost
POV: I'm playing chess against anybody
doe he have the world record ?
had it happen to me to chief
This would probably make more sense if chess made sense to me
I like how he is laughing she ain’t gonna see it coming and she does confused face like wtf u doin haha
Ive had that happen to me irl :,<
Damn, the depression on schlatt’s face was priceless
Jshlat brain is to smol
There's no way he did that on purpose 😂
ur myum
Reminds me of the queens gambit, it’s a great Netflix series
LMAO I REMEMBER MY TEACHER TAUGHT ME THIS MOVE
Man good fool’s mated
tfw you get Fool's Mated
I've actually seen this happen irl. lol. It's much funnier in person.
This is why I can never get into chess. What the fu-
o mae wa mou shinderu
checkmate.
EEEÈEEEEE
I love/hate/wish I never saw this comment section.
Remember, never choose randomly in Chess. Because by some divine intervention, you'll somehow always choose the worst-possible move.
"Lol"
Fun fact: This is the fastest way to win in chess, it’s called the fools mate.
😧 😏
like when someone boast about endurance and only lasts 10 seconds
"Schlatt" was pretty confident, "he" looked so stupid in the end lol!!!
this "schlatt" guy is absolutely hilarious please get him on the channel some more "big guy".
Plot twist: he did that on purpose so he didn't have to play a boring nerd game like chess. What a chad
i think this is called "foolsmate"
Canada
How did she win I don't know much but its interesting...no I'm not a boomer
I kid you not. I had a game against a 12yo. This is exactly what happened. I was not happy...
this schlatt guy is funny he should have a youtube channel
I have no fucking clue what’s going on and I don’t know how he lost
Schlatt: Shes not gonna see this Also Schlatt: gives an open lane to checkmate himsel
Erase that I Love Chess rn
the look of realisation of what he just did is what gets me here
Damn
Bro my friend was flexing that he is good in chess just cause he knows the rules and he challenged me to a game so I used this same move HIS FACE AFTER THAT WAS THE EXACT SAME
"She's not gonna see this one coming. Heh heh…" Famous last words.
Did worse than xqc lol
🤣🤣
Surprise pickachu face is nothing infront of this
Probably the only time that a chess match orientation can happen more than once bc literally 4 moves happened
Foking staged shieat
big guy? more like. small guy hahahaha
This was the first Schlatt video I ever watched..
this is more funny now that i understand chess
ok big guy
Fun fact : This checkmate is called foolsmate
Can’t believe “Schlatt” would let some “broad” win at “chess”. Who does “she” think “she” is dealing “with”?
The disappointment,embarrassment,stupidity,sadness,clueless in his face at the end I cant😆✋
fools gambit
I’m confused what happened
I think she saw that one coming
How did he lose I dont play chess
HOW DID YOU FALL FOR THE FOOLS MATE
What is the background song ?
Man's a legend Otherwise!
Thats a dude do you see that jaw line
😹
Oh he was so confident-
Damn, "schlatt" really got schooled
One of the famous schlatt clips that will never be forgotten:
Rip “big guy”
"schlatt" had to have planned this right?
“Schlatt?”
Just noticed he's rated 400 which means the only reason he got fools mated is because he's down bad for alexandra
I can't believe that 'schlatt' would fall for such tricks, this isn't the real "schlatt".
when you die to the fools mate
His face fuckin DROPPED
Truth is the game was rigged from the start
Omg never brag about your chess skill ever again
The silence at the end got me
"shat" big dude ,,,.  frfrfrfr
"Schlatt" loses a chess game in 2 moves
Was this staged?
I don’t play chess what even just happened
Joe
I can’t believe “schlatt” would lost like this must be a different guy
he literally did the worst move ever why is he surprised
His masculinity was challenged here.😂
19 million fucking views
This is the best thing ever 😂  the look both of them gave!
I thought "Schlatt" was good at "chess", shaking my "head".
Schlatt stop working.exe
To be fair, those models were confusing, so I would see where he is coming from thinking that was a queen
can someone please explain what happened i’m so confused
Big guy would of won this match up
Who the fuck is this ''Schlatt'' big guy keep referring to?
“Directed by Robert B. Weide…”
Let’s start referring to ‘Schlatt’ in air quotes. This funny
Behind him ,, i love chess,,     Hahahahahaha But lost in 2 moves
0:17 the killing expression 🔥🔥🔥
Fools mate. Scrub
The *ODACITY* she had too do that, CRAZY!
Im surprised botez didnt hang her queen in those 2 moves
Hahaha.. good work ghurl
The clip is so good that it feels like it's fake lmao
it's scripted, fools mate
stage but funny
This has to be intentional right? There is literally no worse opening
Her face when she wins omg 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
She pulled the F4 checkmate to, the most common way to checkmate in 2 moves. I’m dead haha.
This is what you do when tanking in rank
This popped up in my recs and I don't know who either of these people are but even without that I can appreciate watching someone's soul leave their body like that.
I remember doing that but in middle school and I just move my queen straight
She’s never gonna see this coming
Who is schlatt playing against?
he thinks too far ahead that he didn't even see what's coming to him
Literally couldn’t have made a worse first move XD
izzat legit? XD the one move you dont do......
Shlatt: *moves two pawns* Alex: so you have chosen death
Schaltt. exe has stopped working!!
Come on Yankees.
this sums me and my friend up-
I think it's wrong move.
Everytime I play chess I see if I can do this. Ever since a few years ago when I saw it.
the "schlatt" at the end xddd
His face at the end is priceless 😂😂😂😂😂
Botez just needs the thug life sunglasses spinning onto her face to complete this
😂😂😂
Staged
She Was Waiting For This Move From Life
“Okay, so how about i come over so you can teach me”  King’s Gambit. Lost the match but won the heart
*she still could not see that comming*
probably the fastest way to lose
Somebody explain to me how a king can move more than one space.
Man was trying so hard to make it look like a mistake but in reality he just wanted that attention . SMH .
You fell for it fool THUNDER CROSS SPLIT ATTACK
The king gambit where you sacrifice the king for views
Doi
When you are too much of a noob
She's not gonna see this fucking coming. Famous last word.
he didnt see that comin
She finished you almost as fast as my wife finishes me..      … At chess, I mean.
Even the cat that has been watching from the shadows was speechless 😂😂
There is no way this isn’t staged.
Schlatt was so in his intellect that he won like the French Generals outside the Ardennes.
Man got fools mated 😂😂😂
Was this intentional? Cause if not he just beat Xqc to losing in 6 moves.
staged
Classic move that always work at least one time
"She's not gonna see this one coming" Neither did you.
Schlatt : I didn't lose. I merely failed to win !
dammmmm
The "I Love Chess :)" in his background makes everything 10x funnier 😂
See her eyes when she realised?  Zoomed in like a hunter.
Lol Schlatt be like😳
This is staged.
Seriously. That's how you play chess 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Now that's a BRUH moment 🤣
He's in disbelief.
The moment of silence 😂😂
World record right now
I remember having a chess buddy every lunch at school with this guy and I believe we get pretty close at always beating each other though I think I was always one step ahead of him every few days. We were still young and learning and you could say we had almost equal knowledge and skills on chess.  Do know that we were only playing for fun and I moved my pieces to defend and attack as how they can move. Then one day he did this to me and I felt utterly defeated. Until now, I still didn’t recognize or remember about anything he did (didn’t know it was anything like a strategy or what) but thinking back, I suddenly wonder if he tried to learn more things of his own when he started teaching me about things I really didn’t know like the strategies he had or the thing called ‘en passant’ which I argued him with for 2 minutes or longer.   Good times
Gotta be staged 😂
It’s a good thing he didn’t bet his mutton chops on this match. Damn!
"scholarmate"
Nobody notices how he says "Get the bishop out" .......That is a pawn
I've watched this so many time... Yet it still gets me.
The moment that surpass xqc vs moist
"Life is like a game of chess."  Says the person who lost in 2 moves
Well you all may be teacher chess but when I was 9 I magically learnt chess I dont know how I got into this my whole family didn't know even whatis chess
Wait. He didn't do it on purpose???
Queens Gambit final scene
I love how the music stops at mate 😂
Wth was he trying to do anyway? Oo
I remember playing with my dad one time and he did this move on me. He told me that my mom, her mom, and my dads mom all hated chess because of this one move and they never played again
There are million ways to win but you choose 1 move to lose.
Fake....also gay.
Losing to someone by deliberately playing into the Fool's mate. I can only speculate why he would do that. Anyone have any ideas?
I'm genuinely confused. "She's not gonna see this one coming".... What coming? What was his plan?  His bishop and knight couldn't do anything worth mentioning. He 100% googled "quickest way to win in chess" and just threw it for views.
Fun fact: This is called a fool's mate that can only be played by the white side with 2 moves from each side
Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooopooooooh
Chess is tough to play but it’s still fun
This is how it feels to play chess
Wait couldn’t his pawn attack the queen sideways
I love that you can pinpoint the EXACT moment his whole sense of self shattered.
Even she's not entirely sure what happened
Says "gets the bishop out" while intentionally using the pawns to trap his own bishop
This is what happen if you get to cocky
The "I love chess" message on the whiteboard makes this much funnier.
XDDDD
iconic
"You outsmarted me, but I outsmarted your outsmarting"
I want the rest of his reaction... 😢
Romans 1:16-19 - "For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile. For in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed—a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: “The righteous will live by faith.” The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by their wickedness, since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them."
Who’s this schlatt dude big guy
Lmao, what a dork!
I’ve done this before…..
omg
Staged. They are surely better actors than chess players !
wt....
Either he lost intentionally or he’s an a-grade stupid
This is literally the first thing u learn in chess lmao.
He can't have played chess for years to fall for fools mate, a manoeuvre well named lol
I click on this video whenever I see it recommended, and this happens once a day at least
I would stop and quit playing chess after losing in 2 moves💀
I wonder if she'll say it in red next....        You know if you know
Him doing this is basically like those times in school, when we did some stupid shit and thought no one knows, but everyone knows, especially the teachers and janitors.
Is it just me but I really wanna do this too lol
What cute girl
Legends say that, to this day, he still has trouble sitting after this incident.
KSJSHAJAHSJAHSJAKAAJJAUHAHAUAJAJAJAJAJAKAKAJAJAJAHAKAKKAKAKAJS
This mate doesn't happen naturally. Clearly staged
"get my bishop out" continues to move pawn*
Hey, I don't know much about chess, so could someone explain to me why his pawn on the far right couldn't take her queen?
Hi
He says "get the bishop out" proceeds to block in his Bishop for no reason and cuts off any attack route he may have had while also crippling his defenses. Either he has never played a game of chess in his life and can't form a conscious thought, or he did it for the lols, you decide.
Putting those two pawns in those positions are basically suicide.
Lmao
Once play with me
Been so long since anyone lost on that move
Fuk this is how my ai opponent plays
Its 4am and i am laughing the shitt out of me
It was the "...Schlatt?" at the end for me.
Is this a Simp tutorial!
there's a reason this is called 'fool's mate'
I've had my far share of embarrassments with Chess, even losing to Emir *(2 5 0)* on hard difficulty for a while... *But This... This...*       *This is no bruh moment... this is an*                      *O O F* *Moment...*
How did he Lost?
never be full of yourself because you'll finish like Schlatt loses in two moves but I like his stream
I think the opening move didn't refer to any book move for white
"...schlatt..."
U a LITERAL FOOL (Fools mate)
her expression is what killed me
F
this is has to be fake lol
Well.. That was quick..
He beat her at the loss  any% speedrun. Better luck next time, Alexandra.
ok.. I suddenly laugh at this quick victory.. XD
I would literally die inside if I lost to a girl in something like this
His reaction is the same as Gerry beating his self in chess.
I want to see the rest of the video where they talk after!
Hey darkness my old friend...
It's like an Adin Ross video...."No Cap, Schlatt. She carry a queen on her side, 'git! Whole lotta chess shit!"
He asked if he could play first while having  the white pieces. Man couldn't get dumber than that.
I don't think anyone won here yet, because how would the king moving to a pawn end the game?, The game revolves around the king being surrounded which she let that happen to hers
6:05pm 27 sep 2021 sst ka paper diya term 1
Respect to the person that stole this vid didn’t put the girl in the thumbnail and still got this many views
lol
LMAO THE WAY HIS FACE FELL
cute
they are meant to be
He did that on purpose
Hahhaahaahha what a loser
LOL
Hes so bad at pretending holy shit its so obvious
Not good
schlatt is the smartest man alive
Am I blind or does this video have 18 MILLION views? Jesus, y'all passionate about Chess.
What hair dye she uses tho
that moment: 0:26
Same thing happened to me ;-;
GG
I call this: How to Schlatt.
In Russia this is called a "fools checkmate"
That is what i called Checkmate
Top 10 Greatest Anime Betrayals
LOLLLLL
Lol
The board behind him though 🙂
he knew what he was doing :D
I like how I knew exactly what was gonna happen, and I'm happy it happened exactly like that
How tf does this have 18m views
As someone who knows next to nothing about chess, how the hell did that happen?
What uh beast 😆
The probability of that happening makes me feel it was staged
Legends say he is still frozen.
bro I did this trick so many times and they call me the chest master (yes I purposely said chest because that’s what they call me)
LMAO
Could that be... Luigi's Mansion song from Mario kart DS?
Couldn’t he still swap his king for a rook, since he hasn’t moved either yet? Or is that not a thing lol
This is just like me, I have absolutely no strat when playing chess and just move anywhere.
First video I've seen of this guy. I assume "Schlatt" is the chick. Guy submits to being executed in two moves. Realize not only my mistake in guessing who's who, but also God's mistake in creating this fucking drooling stooge.
out of billions of moves he chose the FOOL’S MATE
His stup¡d ā§§
Ah yes, the Fool's Mate. One of the stupidest ways to lose in chess, and yet, there are very, VERY few of us who cannot say we've lost a game this way at some point in time.
poor dude had a full on mind game going on, he mind gamed himself to death
ha
amazing
I imagine the song " Couldn't succeed at what I'm doin' " And then schlatt's crying played in his head
Staged
Honestly impressive that he managed to lose a game of chess so quickly
"... Schlatt?"
Well at least he got mated quickly
wtf, his reaction was cute, lmao
S I L E N C E
I find this funny and don't even know how to play chess
"Heh, she's not gonna see this one coming." You're right Schlatt, no one did.
Lal
I remember watching when I had no idea who Schlatt was-
This is basically me playing chess against literally anyone, the only difference is I know I'm gonna lose
My guy sacrificed his king to make his pawns go forward this is all going as planned, what a sigma move
1. Never get involved in a land war in Asia. 2. Never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line. 3. This.
i mean win or lose, she definitely didn't see that coming
Wait this is basically me playing.
I haven't watched this guy so idk if he is really good at chess or not. But c'mon man u gotta think a step ahead as soon as I saw him move that one up I thought oh no
Schlatt, 400 score: "She's not gonna see this coming."  Alexandra, 2200 score: "I beg to differ"
still iconic to this day
Schlatt's ego went from 100 to 0 real quick.
Bruh, this dude fall for fools mate!
I’m in school and watching this
fun fact: this is called sheperdess technique
The fact that he has a Board behind him which reads " I love Chess :) " makes it even funnier
fun fact: she really didn't see this one coming
I don't think he loves chess after this one
XDDD
Lesson for today kids don’t be confident when playing chess
You can even see the reaction of the girl to the Second Pawn Move, like... "did you really make that mistake?"
Fools Mate. Catches everyone at least once.
0:21 that change of expression lol
oofs
Everyone knows he did purposefully.
Very halirous Indeed! One time some random guy almost beat me at chess but I didn't realize I won
Schlatts such a good actor
This big guy looks alot like Jschlatt
Schieße
Ok
How do people not realize this is staged
When he lost the crickets just sounded in my back yard
*"She is not gonna see this fucking coming"*  Said Schlatt moments before his demise
Schlatt: literally chooses the worst moves possible Also Schlatt:Visible Confusion
This is about how long I'd last with her too...
Dam He Sucks.
I don’t play chess can someone explain how she won 😭
The “I love chess” in the background makes this so much better.
Fake
And this is how he got the girl
I once got fool's mate against my chess master. I also felt like Schlatt.
Big guy
I hate her smile it like she kill 7 Millon people 0:23
Fun fact he lost
f
He didn't lose, he merely failed to win!
he looks so dead inside
Wah re schlatt🙏🙏😃
Humongous male
Schlatt went from >:) to :0 real fast
0:20 It was at this moment that he knew, he fucked up
“They say he can finish a game of chess faster than anyone
The first move determines if you win or lose.
His brain software crashed
big mistake for small guy...
How is this different from the scholars mate? Is it any faster?
I feel like it’s more impressive than anything lol
I'm not saying this was scripted but it was scripted. Still funny though.
Big guy loses
This hurt my eyes
Well i know this trick now his king has nowhere to go... My bad luck cant use it a single time😂😂
schlatt, your bad
I didn't know it was even possible to lose so fast
You didn't see that coming dude?!
This is how i feel going into a chess Game against somebody who doesn’t know how to play and them beating me in a couple of moves. :|
i think he did it on purpose imo
Poor Schlatt lost a game at least it wasnt a bet
legend says he's still processing what just happened
I suck at chess so much that I'd get mated on the first move for sure.
This has happened to me
Clearly scripted
Wtf just happened-
i love how after she wrecks him, she had the decency to reaffirm if he's still there
How do you get this many views on clips
I have absolutely no idea what just happened
big lose
Fun fact: this video has over double the views of than the highest viewed video on “jschlattlive” titled “schlatt’s cereal tier list”
Here's to all us chessclub nerds who were saying "your not really going to. . ."
I love this video so much
Iv watched this video before, but thats when I knew NOTHING of the dsmp. Now iv re-watched it, its 10x funnier 🤣
I did this to mom once she has not played me again since that game nearly 5 years ago now
Channeling inner northern Irish: "YEEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"
I think he mistook his king as his queen ahahhaha
Rect
I don't understand chess howed he lose
hehe he got the king and queen mixed up 😆   _kinda_ hard to blame him with those icons
(That had to be intentional, right?)
Ok but she's absolutely beautiful
Not so smart after all big guy
It’s so scripted I didn’t even laugh
Nothing secret Me: boi you can’t tell that it is a secret ( I don’t play chess btw ) and can’t you see that the checkmate thing is there and I don’t hate you
That's the oldest trick in the book. Lmao
when you didnt use your brain for 2 seconds
Can someone tell me how he lost?
.
And that's it for this week's episode of:  Watching people die inside.
What a silly opening he had there
crushed by a woman... what a shame
What was the intention? What was coming?
The way she leaned forward like “are you fucking serious?”
Fun fact, it's called the Fool's Mate
HIS FACE LMAO
This is what a newbie means
The music stopped, then I started crying😂😂
I’m a trying to start chess how did she checkmate that
The fact that you can see the confidence of schlatt just leave his eyes and hear his pride shatter into a million pieces while his confusion rises to a maximum at the same time in seconds- its just- just great- I love this, favorite schlatt moment right here
2 Saal pahale se Pata Hai aur abhi 13 Saal ka hu
Wow he literally fell for a fools mate
I ain't understanding, what the hell were you trying to do ?😂🤦🏽‍♂️
Schlatt.exe has stopped working.
Hi
What happened
This is the most fast checkmate i ever seen.  *SPEEDRUNNING CHEES.*
that's what he gets for hitting on her sister.
Top 10 itself betrayal in real life.
Fake.
So clearly scripted but still funny
Amateur
i tried this with my dad because hes never really beat me so to give him a chance i did this and he didnt make the right move to win, lol sadly but i did beat my cousin 3 times in a row with the same game, lol
I won that way once
My dumbass self read Cheese instead of chess-
Dang bro thats tough but vengeance for lmanburg!
my man went bananas after that
A better title would be "Schlatt only lasts 10 seconds with Alex Botez"
Schlatt
I love chess.  Last words written on the board
Broo i saw this awhile ago before i started watching Jschlatt. Seeing this now omg 💀💀
Oh noooooo, good game though  - the Big Bang theory
???
He actually lost on purpose. He is far to godly to lose unless on purpose
What??? 18 million views on a chess video and without Carlsen in it.
I like to think Jschlatt looked up how to instantly lose at chess to get this move, just to be a Gentlemen.
HAHAHAHa
J
Bruh he is dumb like thats obviously a bad move lol
holy shit this has 18 million views-
Though he lost, I still respect his overly confidence.
this video will never not be funny to me
This was rigged big guy never loses.
Feminists gonna use this vid as women supremacy
I never lost this fast. And I'm terrible.
It was for sure on purpose, there is no way that someone gets fool's mate accidential
I'm lost guys i can't tell if this was planned or not ? I mean my dude started with the worst opening i've ever seen
Haha! A fool got checkmate😂😂
Staged and fake, and therefore shit
This is at the moment he knew he fu**** up
this video is truely long
this is called a scholarmate
Dummy
No way this wasn’t intentional lol
Tractopelle
The silence cracked me up
...
PUHHAAHAHAH OH THAT WAS A GOOD ONE BIG MAN
At least he was right when he said "She never will see this coming" kekw
It’s funnier
I dare you to watch it a 2 speed
chess
🌼
rumors say 200 elo in the comments are still yelling ‘this is the scholar’s mate’
I am the worse chess player I know, and even I could see that coming.
Oh..
zump here
Shes just that good
He lost the battle but won the war of the algorithm by creating this meme and gaining exposure from it
I'm pretty sure he did it on purpose, he didn't have many chances against her so at least he took the revenue
lolololololololololololol
_'DID HE REALLY JUST LEAVE..?'_
Diabolical
LOL😂😂
Schlat?
For the longest time, I thought 3 moves was the fastest possible checkmate, I'm more retarded than him.
He forgot that bungee gum possesses the properties of both rubber and gum
She only won because Schlatt lost the match, that's not winning
XDXDXDXDXDXDXDXDXDXDXDXDXDXDXDXDXDXD
Seems like such a Schlatt thing to do.
thats just one of the most dumb moves and one of the most saddest chess game ever
What even happened? I'm not that into chess, how did he lose so quick? xd
The fact that he wrote “I love chess” on the board is so wholesome.
le hicieron el mate del tonto XDDDDDDDDDDD
Schlatt Matt
I do that play or try to do with extended moves
Huh
Wow he is so good he got clapped in two moves he does love chess:)
Howwww?
Im sorry, the first move was to get the Bishop out. The second move was to... trap the Bishop?
I always do that for my friend
Overconfidince really isnt pretty... learnt that plenty of times...
Sorry but he's a little bit stupid...
The pennywise look tho
He should curb his chess skills.
I think the best of this entire video is the board in the background that says "I love chess"
The meme is here
Lol
*Queen's gambit*
His smile and optimism: gone.
It was intentional
Everyone at 0:19 : _sweats_
Me who is a player of chess for over 2 years now: show me a strategy I don't know B).
He loser
I don’t think schlatt saw that coming
Serve you right
his face tho
Fun fact : nowadays telling funfact in comments is the trend
I completely forgot about hearing stories of losing in chess in merely two moves, until I saw this video.
:))))
Ha funny scripted
Why would he play Pg4 to get his bishop out instead of Pe4?
Yeah that's an actual chess move, Fools Mate I believe. I actually did win with this once against a friend at School, he was crushed! 😁
I thought the king could move only one space?
This was scripted for sure lol
This is your best video this year.
Whaaaaaaaaat
that one kid: i CAn dO 1t iN wOnE mooV
I pulled thag move in middle school
That was the most controversial move I have ever seen
eventually *schlatt* stopped thinking
😂
XD
THIS WAS AMAZING KAKAKAKAKAK
No
L
I bent in the middle just for laugh at this
lol
WHAT!? Epic history plays HOLY! Im speechless.
Ok who even plays like this 😂 you get many disadvantages when playing your pawns like that even if it wasnt a checkmate
His reaction lol
The way his smile just turned to a frown😂
Yo i did this once in high school at a tournament.
…Well the title did not lie.
Good plot.....  Who moves those two steps at the beginning ??!
Wait how did he lose? I thought the other person had to take out your king?
How to 2 shot a dude in chess
More fact pls explain this chess player expert
In all fairness... it was really funny LoL 😋
well that's got to hurt
LOL
Heh nerpah
Poor schlatte’s dream got destroyed before his eyes
“Hahah she will never see this coming” Top ten moments before disaster
She was looking at him like "Wait, you didn't just play exactly the classic chess that leaves you open to an instant checkmate, did you?" She wasn't even happy about it, just deeply confused. And he was EVEN MORE CONFUSED.
Lol
Schlat...
So does these 2 actually date
*insert el risitas laugh here*
I am almost certain he did this on purpose because that specific set of moves is called "fools mate" and it is literally outlined in a chess book I read when I was a kid as what not to do and is probably the most famous way to lose in two turns. The one time a real person did that to me and I won was when I was playing a literal child at chess camp. But while I am 90% sure this is fake, I do have 10% telling me it isn't because it's Schlatt and just because it's more fun to believe it was real
So scripted jeez
schlatt exe. has stopped working
lol
That was a kick to the balls. Overconfidence was his downfall.
Shlatt- she's not gonna see this coming *Oh how the turns have tabled*
this sounds extremely staged
Lol
This is so staged
EZ
i think he’s dead
0:23 LoL
How tf you get fool’s mate dude? You gotta be trash af. You lost the privilege to play chess after this.
Thats called "Foolsmate"
Mario Kart DS music nice  *Also the power of big brain*
He went from pushing his glasses up with one finger as they shine in the light  To  “Impossible, I’ve calculated every mood”
Curb your chess
she is not a gaming chair. she's hacking.
Wait but the king isn’t dead… how’s he lost
*contemplating life choices*
The *"I Love Chess :)"* at the back lol
did he mix up his queen with his king? or is he new to the game?
Did he smashed his keyboard after?
BRO HOW DO YOU GET FOOLS MATED
At least women are good at something, unlike comedy.
"She's not gonna see this fuking coming" I'm pretty sure no one saw that coming at all lol
Idk how chess works apparently
its good with the hikaru version, but when you do the same jokes too much it become dry fast
He literally did the fastest way to die in chess and had the audacity to say “she’s never gonna see this”
I thought queen's gambit was a more serious show, glad to see it's a comedy
i always wanted to learn how to play chess, but never could remember the moves of every chess piece ... thats why i honestly can say... I don;t get it xD Could someone explain to me what happend ?
How did he lose? His king don't get taken
*shes not gonna see this coming* *oh I know what's coming*
I always make that move
Women
Fool’s mate
"She's not going to see it coming." Last words of Schlatt. R.I.P
Speedruns be like:
That could be the world record of fastest checkmate.
I see the 2 move chest technique
The reaction of botez is were I lost it 😂
Why tho? Why did he move that second pawn like that? Only reason I can see is if he had a little brain fart and through his King was his Queen. Because moving the second pawn didn't free up any other pieces, it blocked his horse from going there, and opened a straight path to his King. And that's it.  Yes I know everyone makes mistakes, I am just confused about the logic behind this mistakes. Because unless you got the King and Queen symbol confused, there's just no reason to move that pawn.
Sure this is set up but bruh
What even happened?
that face of disappointment tho
Clearly set up
Checkmate
And here we see a grown man lose a game of chess in no less than two turns
This girl looks like female version of professor akali 🤣🤣
100000000000000000000000000 iq
Young people are so much fun.  They find things out that people have known forever, and then marvel at their discovery.  THAT is what is cute about the video :)
Big brain 🤯
This is quite easy to avoid ya know
I think it’s more impossible to lose how he did than to actually win the game 😂
0:23 that is the grin that you have after you brutally murder someone in only 2 moves
You know you're bad at chess when you lose in 2 moves  i know it's fool's mate
Fun fact: he did that on purpose as a joke.
schlatt: *gets destroyed in chess*    *airship fortress:*
Legend has is that he is still sat there looking at his screen
Can someone explain to me what the hell happened there
Don't be a simp bro
Fake and boring. Act better next time.
That's a certified BRUH moment
SIMP LOL
His face at the end tho
Xqc: finally, a worthy opponent
i don't understand chess, so i'm veeeeeery confused right now
Guinness world record lost in chess
the silence
I remember my dad trying to get me into chess when i was kid so he gave a book on chess strategies and this was the only one i memorized because i just wanted the game to be done as soon as possible
*"schlatt?"*
I DONT EVEN UNDERSTAND HOW HE LOST???1/2/
This is what you call a big brain move
That's a foolsmate bro.... Somewhat the fastest and easiest way to lose/win....😐
What?
He did it on purpose obviously, those 2 moves are the only way you can lose in 2 moves. There you go a viral video.
Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer.
Omae wa, mou shindeiru. *_NANI?!?!?_*
yes she didn't see that one coming xd
This is just the classic, besides the pawn-queen move
He didn’t lose he simply failed to win
I don’t think he’s likes chess anymore
So, this didn't really happen.
"Chess is my passion"
Lmao the fools mate can only occur like higher than dreams luck.......from 800-1000 elo players these mate is like a gift, a blessing from heaven and consider yourself the luckiest shit alive......shits literally the fastest,dumbest, and easiest mate possible in chess
This thing I don't understand by fool's mate is...why would you ever put your pawns in that position anyway?? It blocks in your knight, means you can't really ever castle short, and doesn't fight for the centre. Oh, and it means you can lose in 2 moves.
It's me 🤣🤣🤣
Someone explain why she wins this please? I'm confused
its foolmate unless your opponent has a brain the size of a peanut its never going to happen
bruh
and then that whiteboard went from "I love chess :)" to "Chess can go die in a fucking hole for all I care >:("
It's a really common move I do this alot to my brothers
so that's 2 move checkmate that I learned during 7th grade, where the teacher told me, no one would actually allow this unless they are showing you how 2 move checkmate works...
He def did it on purpose. This chances of this happening on accident are pretty much zero.
she cheat she moved more then one
Nah he’s just helping her speedrun chess
Fools mate
Jesus loves all. God bless all
Sorry I don't play chess how does this work?
He didn’t see it coming xD
Fake
remember how your chess teacher told you to not move the pawn at F
Jokes aside, we all knew it was scripted 😂   RIP for those who thought it was real
Schlatts face when he lost was the "face of guilt" But i respect that,ive been sh*t in chess for a long time,bragging to people that ill win,but lose,dont worry,schlatt is gonna be fine,hes gonna win this in the near future
I dont even know chess and i still appreciate this masterpiece
Lmao, I can’t get enough of her face  It’s like: uhh, wut, Schlatt? Wutwut
"Wait! That's OP! There better be nerfing next patch..."
When a good thing goes bad...
Schlat got flat
Me who plays chess: your a fool just like how you lost
This has to be a bit/stage. It seems so unnatural. Perhaps it's just the ending.
0:20 The reaction!!
After seeing this i was like 50 rupee kat overacting ka
His face went : 😃😀🙂😐
Ok, but. Can someone explain what the fuck he was trying to achieve here?
Embarrassing
I’m commenting on a lot of videos because am bored
This is so funny! His face was priceless.
"schlatt....            ..."
Is I'm the only one who going to die laughing at his reaction🤣🤣🤣
shes just insane at chess i guess
gake and fay
Legend has it, she still hasn't seen anything fucking coming.
Me every time I play with my dad
Wow, I love chess too!
"Well hes got me now.... OR DOES HE-"
Even an 100 ELO chess player is better than Schlatt !! 😂😂😂
Grob opening, not the best opening if you are a beginner... But being fool's mated is the worst !!  I love Botez's reply : Schlatt ???? 😂😂😂 0:26
She used the move called the scholars mate - the four move. Checkmate
Legend says there’s no more “I love chess” in the back
TWO MOVES HAHA
Fake af
I literally lost this way a bunch of times in the exact same spot.
Schlatt.exe has crashed
No way this is real
Well, she didnt saw it coming tho
L
Her face lmao
Well she didn’t see it coming alright
0:18 she already saw the opening LOOOOOOOOL
*"she's not gonna see this coming"* in fact she still hasnt
Hell no a fools mate  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Schlatt: She's not gonna see this coming Alexandra: Is your iq 2?
His face. I'm ded.
is he not blatantly trolling tho?
I did the same, except at life.
"...Schlatt?"
Aw it was staged wasn't it? 😢
„I love chess“ immediately changed to „Why does chess hate me“
This makes xQc's match against Cr1tikal look like Misha's match against Anatoly Karpov.
Its scripted obviously
0:18
Schlatt exe has stopped working
She was holding in a laugh at the end, I could just see it.
Looked staged
What happened i dont understand this
i think she planned the 3 moves
Was this a joke.
He did it on purpose to get views.   Big guy has got big brains too 😂
Tis is SOOOO real..... 17 mil on some hyped fake bullshit... amazing people.... nicely done...
This has more views than the actual video wtf
Fake. They did it for 17 million views.   They both won. Everyone watching lost, including myself.   Good job, guys!
I mean it's obviously scripted but this is still a legendary clip
put that freak in his place
Listen to the sound of his confidence crumbling
This beats xqc's speedrun of defeat
Nice Approach!
This is fake as hell
"She wont see this coming " It was at this moment she knew.... he fucked up
This guy does not how to play chess.....his starting move is ridiculous.....Get some lessons buddy and process the moves in  your mind before you make the move.
The evil little smile XDD
Is this scripted?
Well, now he doesn’t love chess….
Did he just say “g4, get the bishop out” 🤣
0:17 "Pictures Taken Moments From Disaster"
Him : “she’s not see this coming” Her : “see this coming”
Bait
Fun fact: it's actually an opening called Gyenis trick.
Sad
Scripted
0:19 got me thinking for 1 minute
I really love the look on her face. "I can't believe this idiot really did it"
Do do do do dooo doo doo what how
Well she didn't see it coming
Fake
It’s literally the only way to lose in two moves I think it’s the exact sequence
Did this actually happen? I cannot find the full clip
I KNOW YOU WILL NOT GIVE ACCESS TO ME A BIG FAMILY ON YOUTUBE BUT THERE IS SOMEONE WHO HELP NEW YOUTUBER AND GIVES FULL SUPPORT TO THESE YOUTUBERS
Imagine if after Schlatt said "She's not gonna see this coming", Alex takes the win, then says to him "I did not see that coming".  😂
Someone pulled this on me when I was a kid. :'(
Uh
Plot twist: he gave her the opportunity to win because he knew it would get more views if he lost in just two moves and therefore get them both more attention
yall realize this is staged right?
XD OMG
GOD MOVE RIGHT HERE!!!!!!!
Well he did not see that one coming.
Average laptop price: $600 Average ISP price: $60 His reaction: priceless
That's a rookie move...
I remember the fools mate being my very first win in chess EVER.
BABSHSHSH
Mal du berger
Fun fact that move is actually called “fool’s mate”
"Welcome to my chess board you shouldn't of waged war"        If you know you know ;)
I think thats the fastest possible way to lose
I would've watched it a million times and still laugh at it 😁🤣🤣🤣
I always use this
ah. why did I laugh
Quickest chess game in history I guess
This should be on the Daily Dose of Internet
I have won like that before
I KNOW IT
The first time this happened to me I was dumbfounded 😂
"she's not gonna see this coming" her : *you sure about that*
Out of all the 72,000 combinations o.O
This is how I won my first game (against the lowest level bot lol)
His face is the best. We're with you soldier.
Big brain time
He pulled the 2 worst possible moved to begin with
The title seems impossible but yet it happened so the impossible can be possible
"Shes not gonna see this coming"  Well...you're not wrong lol
Staged
17M views on a staged chess game. Impressive.
is he ok
am i dumb or cant a pawn special move to cross a peice to its side or is that only another pawn
Never should do this
Prea desteapta romanca ❤❤
Oof
They were right, he did lose a game of chess in only just 2 moves
You picked the worst possible opening moves, and you’re supposed to be good     Jschlatt are u ok
How has this been recommended to me like four times yet I keep clicking on it?!
I have no fucking idea how to play chess so I'm just as confused he is I'm traumatised by this experience I'm sewing for 69p
But but... The queen? What chess is this?  Edit: i rewind.. My bad
Wow i remember playing a game with a lvl 1 bot for about an hour and i lost
I don't even know how to play chess I've never played in my life before
Lmfao
Maybe he thought I was the queen.Imao Don't worry these things happen sometimes
Ahh yes foolsmate
lol is the only thing I can say.
Didn't even knew it was possible to win under 4 😂😂
the whiteboard didn’t last much longer after that
Maturity is when u realize that it was scripted     Dont scroll down      Told u not to     So u want to see     So see                        It could be real also i have no idea
LETS GOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
Lol
Wait can someone explain how he lost I'm rubbish at chess 😭
My dad is a chess teacher...  Watching them play hurts my soul.
He's so bad man I just learned a new strat
Man get rekt hard core
0:17 Alex in her head - "I wonder if he is doing this for content"
This man is the absolute genius of comedy that is hard to even tell if he genuinely didn't see it coming or if he did and did that intentionally
“She’s never gonna see this coming.”  You’re right, she wasn’t
She is incredible hot 🔥!
Wait... do people actually think this WASNT acting?
The sibling who thinks they are better than you:
The fact she didn’t even react was so funny
Chess doesnt seem that complicated
The fact that I don’t know how to play chess makes it funnier somehow.
ok so i googled it and i still have no idea how she won??? can any smart cookies explain how the Fools Mate works, bc im SO curious i just dont fucking get chess LMAO
FUN FACT : SHES ALEXANDRA BOTEZ A PROFESSIONAL CHESS PLAYER   EXTRA STUFF : SHE WAS ALSO IN ONE OF THE SKEPPY VIDEO
lmao
He big brained "himself"
Her instant “are you f*cking kidding me” expression is what kills me
Him : She's not gonna see this fkn coming Her : UNO REVERSE CARD
stay tuned 4 part 2 where we see his mind still processing
I cant tell if this man is a idiot or a complete genius
And this is the guy that ruled an entire country?????
lol
fake
I love schlatts face when she beats him
You could see the whole world crumble before him in the reflection of his eyes. All he had to live for, was gone
Airship fortress- Mariokart DS. That’s the song in the background
And then he committed a mass war crime…
'She's not gonna see this coming' I mean, she didn't see that coming
2 tap insta deleat
Dude I just started playing today and sometimes I think the king is the queen so I’m less careful with so I did this :(
I dont f ing understand chess, i hate it now im scared of it I had fears of many things from games like a reaper leviathan or a cloaker But this time its a f ing board with wooden toys
You chose the worst possible move not once but twice the only way to lose in 2 moves
I Believe that’s called fools mate and it almost never happens
Schlatt plays g4: "get the bishop out" The very next move: blocks the bishop
"heh heh he huh-" "Schlatt"
This is why I don’t understand chess one bit
This is the moment Walter white became heisenberg
Karma
It’s Alexandra botez what do you expect
i didn't even know it was possible to lose that quickly
*fools mate*
lol
I will never understand how chess players can win a game that fast
this was litterally in one of the lessons to get the fastest checkmate... and he set it up PERFECTLY for her...
17,000,000 views for being bad at chess.
that so funny your face was spechless lol
There’s no way schlatt didn’t know the “fool’s mate” move, he had to have conspired with her otherwise he wouldn’t have been beaten so quickly
Schlatt: _”she’s not gonna see is one coming >:)”_ **Fool’s mate** Schlatt: 😦 Alexandra: “...Schlatt?”
Fool's mate....
That board saying ' I love Chess ' in Schlatt's background is made for this video 😂
Jshlatt
Jokes on her, he got a viral video out of this
If he had only used his bishop he could have one
Htf? I dont get chess explain to me someone
Real talents are often overseen  - Sun Tzu, The Art of war
“Schlatt..?”
The sedate vision cephalometrically phone because pyjama intringuingly polish astride a slimy rest. nutritious, temporary wall
*"She's not gonna see this fucking coming"*  She indeed did not.
My guy was told not to move the f pawn on the first move…. So he chose the g pawn, then proceeded to move the f pawn Schlatt: It’s foolsmate but with _different_ steps!
in schlatts mind MISSION FAILED WILL GETEM NEXT TIME
she was hurt by seeing those moves, which took a few seconds to move instead of moving instantly
His face really said bruh
You should always start by the center then then knights, bishops, then castle now you have a dream sorry if I'm mean I play lichess level 2437
Silence speaks louder than speech
"Black won" _The Revenge_
Nice to see GM Jschlatt let WFM Alexandra Botez win.
"She's not gonna see it coming" Her: *Visible confusion*
thanks for the trick :D
gotta love the classic blunder XD
Can someone explain coz I don't know how to play chess
I saw this clip before I knew who schlatt was and it was funny then, but it's funnier now
he’s skilled
My take: he knew what would happen and did it for the content.
Her face after he played that second move though. “Wait… did he just… wh…”
You guys know schlatt did that on purpose
This has to be a bit
That Mario Kart music tho
Well he was right she did not see that coming ...
You can see her face in momentary confusion when he did that
Her look at 0:24 is terrifying
Lmao I knew that move was coming
I actually used this move when I played chess in my school 2 times in a row on 2 different people and the teacher told me to stop using it
Fun fact we all watched this like 3times
"Schlatt.exe stopped working"
I think that was intentional tbh
Legends still say that he's paralyzed till now
I ALWAYS USE THAT MOVE IN CHESS
“You didn’t see that coming.”
I love how i would play random mooves bc i dont know any tattics
3 moves
0:22 wow
Shes not gonna see this one coming...  Yea, your right. I bet she didnt
So bad :D
Bruh
The fact people believe this wasn’t stage is actually funny. This was for content guys 🙄
*Flashback to Dream SMP*
This is me, every time I play Chess...
hahahahahahahahahahahahhhhahahahahhahahhahahahahhahhhahahahahahahahhahahahha
Scripted af
The look she gave xD
How do you not see it's staged? 🙄
BRUH...................
This is why it didnt work out for them
HA! Oldest trick in the book. No wait.... Second oldest.
Ha! Kiddi check! Litteraly the fastest way to win is to use this on a begginer player. Most intermediate/pros will recognise this instantly.
Well he was right, she didn't see that coming
He fell for the oldest trick in the book
what a troll
People get over 1k likes on comments on this video so hi
Me learning how to checkmate a person in four moves WOW THIS IS CRAZY Schlatt:
If it was a moment's distraction, he would have worn an expression of regret immediately after f3. But he didn't realize it until she made the move. lel
My guy literally schlatt his pants after that!
He had that maniacal main antagonist laugh and then instantly switched up.
The tutorial about this says that it is literally almost impossible without it being a scripted
Bruh
Plot twist : this game was actually developed by the karma
I almost believe this was intentional
Him: *Plays pawn to f3*  Her: So you have chosen death.
This is literally the fastest way possible to lose in chess.
Ah Classic move
fun while it lasted
That happened to me too while playing with a bot, lol. Hilarious
Fake
scripted
Bad acting but aight
Before she moved, she had thought about if it was actually that easy.
Schlatt: *windows noises*
He big simp
Fake
*OUTSTANDING MOVE*
I’m like 80% sure he mixed up the king and the queen lol
Cheh
LMFAOOOOOOOOO
She saw it coming 😔
oh dear god
This is fool's mate and it only works once in a game through your opponent
dang, she used the 2 move checkmate :0
“She’s not gonna see this coming”  *famous last words*
This is  the face of dissapointment 0:22
its always get me
"She's never gonna see this one coming"  No, you making the biggest mistake possible in chess was not something anyone would have seen coming.
Now Schlatt is thinking: I'm not that guy :(
Nicely scripted
i dont think its as good as moist critikal's "throbbing" win, but still good
*she is not gonna see this coming* yup she really did not see that coming.
Worst chess opening.
Either he doesn't know a lot about chess, or this was staged on his end. His reactions are almost too accurate to be genuine.
The fact that the board in the back says I love chess makes this 100x funnier
ok idc much for chess but can someone explain to me how the king moved diagonally there? i thought it could only go for one space at a time? im so confused
ok idc much for chess but can someone explain to me how the king moved diagonally there? i thought it could only go for one space at a time? im so confused
You can move the pawn that's infront of the Rook and take her Queen out. If you move it three spaces ahead it can take her Queen. Well maybe I don't know all chess rules
The kings gambit
This is so staged it hurts
"...Schlatt?"
Schlatt's dreams went "Schlatt"
There are 20 possible first moves, and 400 possible second moves, so that means that out of 8000 possible combinations Schlatt chose the worst one
0:18 it was at this point he  *didn’t knew*  he was fucked
their expressions look like a disappointing f*ck
This is a trick I learned when I was a kid
Schlatt: She's not gonna see this coming😼  Her: *Uno reverse*
Schlatt.exe has stopped responding
My brother insists that this is a real clip like bro cmon it’s obvious
Does this actually work?
That first initial pawn to open the queen should've screamed at him. However schlatt is just... Well Schlatt
This shit fake af
"She's not gonna see this coming" -Famous last words before disaster
*I still remember pulling the same move she did on my dad when I was 8. /srs*
Good acting
Bruh I’m a literal nutsack and I play better.
This is clearly not planned😆
I love chess :) in ge background lol
"She's not gunna see this one coming."  I mean she probably didnt
Oh carp she is done checkmate on you right now and you see your face right now 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Her face says it all
no game. no life. If you know you know
Fastest possible way of losing than the fools mate is.....Resigning before playing the game
"The mark of a true comedian is not to make the room laugh, but to accept and embrace when the room laughs at you"  -Abraham Lincoln, probably
Bruh moment
this must have been staged
what exactly was his plan
I have a feeling that he did it on purpose to get views.
Please say "Sike"
Mr Kennedy, i dont think you'll need your bodyguard today.
ОTK
so fake it hurts my eyes
He sacrificed his king to develop his bishop..wow pure genius!
big guy
They're takin a piss, there's no way that this would happen to any human being
Literally only an idiot in chess can lose a game in 2 moves.
I mean technically she didn’t see it coming
It's funny, but it's definitely staged. Schlatt probably asked what the quickest way to lose was and proceded to do that. Dont get me wrong though, some of the best comedy bits are staged, and it's still funny imo
This never gets old
your vieos ar so good i lvoe you
If this is not on purpose I don't know what is.
Rumers say that he’s still thinking
Big brain time
Something about schlatts face with "I love chess :)" written on his whiteboard is genuinely heartbreaking for some reason. It's like a child that got bullied and will never enjoy his favorite thing ever again.
This is how fast I lose.  I’ve played chess for like…5 or 6 months, and I haven’t improved at all, I’m so freaking disappointed because I enjoy the game, but I loose every floopin ding dong time
Gotta say I love that Yankees hat he has on.
That face dude is priceless
after he said “she’s not gonna see this one coming” alex looked so confused implying she didn’t see that coming
Hey, big guy
What was his plan? Like he appearantly had an idea (albiet a bad one) with this setup.
"BIG GUY"
possibly dramatized...not a real game..
This is cool and all but Gru is the most powerful being in the universe, and here’s why: according to the height of a Minion (which is 3.5 feet on average) Gru is 4 minions tall, which means he is a godly size of 14 feet tall. Second if any of you remember the original Despicable Me, you Know there is a scene when Vector kidnaps the three girls and shoots a series of heat-seeking misses at Gru, he then dodge them all. According to the speed of an average ballistic missile (1900 mph) and the size of the missile according to his ankle size, Gru can perceive and move at such a speed that the missiles only move 9.5 miles per hour, 0.5% of their original speed. Plus after this Gru punches a shark and it is paralyzed meaning its spine is probably shattered, to remind you it would require a force greater than 3,000 newtons to fracture the spine. That’s equal to the impact created by a 500-pound car crashing into a wall at 30 miles per hour. I rest my case."
This is his most viewed video across all his channels.
Schlatt: she's not gonna see this coming Her: * uno reverse card *
That trick is soo easy and nobody sees it coming 😹😹😹
"Loses chess game"  Almost 17 Million views later....still "losing" a chess game.  Not one BotezLive video has gotten view counts close to that.
I love schlatt but, this is clearly fake
I've played chess since I was like, 5 and I still remember the first time someone used the fool's mate on me-
What even was the idea here? What did he think she wasn't gonna see coming? It's doing absolutely nothing. Even discounting the immediate mate, you block your bishop's prime diagonal, you take away the typical square your knight goes to, and it's in the way of your queen too. You're not even attacking e5 with f4 for a gambit of some description, you're not making any space for any other piece, and if you wanted to play e4, you could've done so right away. If Black had attacked with Nf6 you still could've defended the pawn. What the hell was the plan?
So bloody naive.
"I love chees"  Yes , I see how much
By the looks of her reaction, Schlatt was right, she did in fact not see this coming.
A classic reminder of the fact that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer
Oh so he doesn’t know what the king and queen prices look like
Famous last words “ she is not going to see this coming”
Keep coming to this video whyyyyy
"Shes not gonna see it coming"  Yeah she really didnt
holy sh... wow
she indeed did not see this coming
People thinking this isn’t staged for views LMAO
His face so defeated
This is clearly staged..?
Ale z prostym chłopakiem z bloków to przejebała x.x
I just wanted to thank you now I can’t use this on 16M people 🤬
He could have used his horse to block the queen
I thought it was impossible to move the kings or queens in chess!  Edit: this is what happens when you don’t read the rules of chess after 6 years of not even touching it
who is this big guy character... and why are they so obsessed with schlatt
He does know the king is like important n stuff right. Def fools mate on this bloke
The boy won the girl loset
LOL..
Schlatt Gambit > Botez Gambit
Little bit of a foolsmate.
She is not gonna see this coming  Her : *plays giorno theme*
It's a prank
He's streaming career is done the only things that's paying his bills now is he's day job xdd
Movie over before I came back with a bag of popcorn?
Big guy loses.
Chess Speedrun Any% Glitchless
ive been playing this video for the past hour✌️
It is quite impressive that he chose the worst possible move out of thousands of moves The probability is less than 0.1%
Schlatt?
So staged
lol loser
This is like summoning exodia at turn 1
I'd still do worse, I have absolutely no clue how chess works
Never move the F pawn🙄
He processing that loss like internet explorer 😂😂
Fun fact: people rage when they lose in chess
I am surprised at how many people do not know what a Fools Mate is
Jschatt: She’s going down!  Narrator: She was not going down
this is how men who think can beat every women in chess look like lmfao😭
The only way you lose by fool’s mate is if you try to. Schlatt broke that.
I losed 1 time like this epic
absolutely wrecked
this is fake and they had decided to do this beforehand !!!!
ah yes, the shlatt opening
No one is questioning the amount of views this has? 16 million in 5 months is crazy but I’m glad to see schlatt is doing pretty well
Flat!!!
I did this on accident in a chess club once
That sign there be like:I L O V E C H E S S
Complete set-up
Schlatt was going for the foolsmate but she whipped out the uno reverse
I feel bad for him, he loves chess
Note to self: save this for next time my cousin challenges me to a chess gamr so I can see if I get him with it...
Samay Raina's proud student :)
Kings gambit
Legend has it they’re both dating now
Can someone explain to me what happened (I don’t play chess)
I am not afraid to admit I’ve had this done to me twice before and I thought I could bait the bait
Oof
Her expression 😂
This is legit the first time seeing a foolsmate
I think he wants to embarrass her by not seeing the fools mate lol
That slapped
His face when he realize
All jokes aside, what was he trying to do? lol
Congratulations Schlatt, she did not, in fact, see that coming.
Big guy isn’t so big anymore
this is why ill never play chess, why did she win??
he loses so fast i wonder if he was doing intentionally
Ah yes, the "fool's mate" I remember a friend of mine winning literally 2 minutes after the game started and the opponent was dumbfounded.
He's a really horrible player.
HE FACE THOO😭
Is this intentional?
The confidence schaltt had is hilarious
He is a noob.    I loosed a game in 3 moves.
Most epic loss lol
Scripted
Who is behind him that looks like red eye 👤
YouTube algorithm recommends this to show us greatest chess player also known as jschlatt :)
Pain
this video has more views than any of jschlatt's other videos on jschlattlive
Feel Baka mitai bgm
This is scripted
.................................................     .                                                         schlatt?
No way he didnt know what he was doing
He knows full well
He totally did this on purpose
Everyone love Jesus
loses a chess game in 2 moves gets 16 million views lose the game win the war, bitch
His face went from :) to :( so quickly
im either guessing this was staged or Schlatt is that bad at chess
In all seriuosness, I really don't think she saw this coming.
Has to be scripted no way people got foolsmate
I think he was going for that tbh
Was this staged? He seems to of intentionally opened up his king since he said his goal was moving the bishop.
Thats the worst move he had to start off with.
Classic
Dat bitch is too smart, bring her sister
botez: oma wo mo shinderu  schlatt:nani????!?!?!  (girono's theme plays
fool’s game
Me who knows s*** about Chess.. yeah!!
Him: She wont see this comin Her: Right back at you big guy
"Schlatt."
I love cheese
Thank you computer for treating me humanely: not using queen hutier strategy to me
I didn’t think it was possible to act this bad
that was fastest 27 seconds of my life
This is called a "fools mate" And will work only if your opponent is a fool Hence, this guy is a fool
he never saw it coming, for her mind was too fast for eyes
I saw that coming from the moon and back
*And then, I’m going to use this strategy, the one the lady used, if I ever verse my friend in Chess.*
Fool's mate : g4 variation
Truly disgusting, that some “people” would do this horrible thing.
You guys do realize this is a fucking bit right? We know what a fucking fools mate is you aren’t some genius for knowing
i dont know the contex but it feels staged, but if not well damn I didnt even know this was possible, but its probably because I know shit about chess
Well, she indeed didn’t see this coming…
Such an anime scene
Skill issue
theres no way someone can be THAT dumb
Fool's mate lol
16 MILLION VIEWS
Wow 👏👏
Move the pawn on the rook to 2steps
This is loki me and my Dad playing chees
so fake
I know she's great at chess, but everything about this looks scripted and poorly acted.
Her: call an ambulance  Also her: but not for me.
What I want to know is what his plan was lol Like...that second move fiercely limited his bishop movement. He'd have to waste a turn moving one of the pawns, or let them be sacrificed, to move the bishop anywhere meaningful. He could have some weird plan with the knight, but like...I'm deeply curious what the intent was here lol
Fun fact: that's four moves
Come on, Schplatt. When you play chess, before you make a move, your first thought process is "How can this person use this against me?" and "Can I counter their next move effectively?" Now I'm no chess Grandmaster, but I can tell that that move was dumb.
"I LOVE CHESS :)"   hell yeah you are lol
After that "I love chess" in the background magically disappeared...
The way his face drops tho
Question. what was his strategy?
This shit look sooo fake bro you sure you didn’t plan this video looks like you did
Fun fact: your gonna comment fun fact
He lost with the fool's mate
This has to have been pre prepared, I refuse to believe schlatt could be legitimately this dumb.
*LMAO*
this will never not be funny
Why so many likes? Dude is clearly an idiot
me who has no clue how to play chess: *when-*
xqc 2: eletric bugaloo
Do people really think this isn't staged? 🤡😂
Plot twist:  Schlatt is actually a Chess genius and he played this on purpose so he can lose easily in a funny way, making him Both a chess genius and a Comedy genius
You could make a religion out of this
how did this get 16 million views
..
I'm shocked that everyone thinks this is real
Give it a minute, he’s buffering
It doesn't make sense. He could do a castling move with his king and rook
Big Guy has to be the best at shortening Schlatt clips to YouTube. What a big fan
I'm so confused like how the hell that girl moved king piece 4 squares Diagonal like, I thought that king piece can only be move 1 square only in any direction
So this is what Peter Hammill was talking about...
"she's not gonna see this coming"   Alex: *I'm gonna do what's called a pro-gamer move*
Schlatt: haha I'm good at chess Fool's mate: ima end this man who self esteem
Schlat exe not responding
She really didn’t see that one coming, but she saw a king’s grave coming
Wtf just happened
It's crazy how 90% of this comment section doesn't know it's a sketch.
when ppl think he lost on accident
This blew the fuck up
The only thing I know about chess is that the horse moves in an L, can anyone tell me what just happened?
Ah yes this totally not scripted match
Damn this got a lot of views sheeeeesh
lol
how
699k subs
cool
Big guy
" You'll never see it coming! You'll see that my mind is too fast for your eyes "
1k more likes and the likes and the subs will be the same
classic fools mate
I have unironically done this…no I’m not kidding.
I did this before too
He’s def gonna erase the sign in the background
There are over 72,000 combinations of moves in a chess game just in the first two turns alone, and Schlatt set up one of the only eight combinations to lose in 2 turns (since there are 8 ways to achieve the same or similar positions)
At least now I know I am better than someone in chess
The fact that this was the worst possible move in the history of chess is the funniest part.
choosing that fuckin one future out of millions where things go your way except he did the opposite
Is this edited?
He really went like ° o °
Damn... that is so messed up. I wish that i knew how to play chess
This is the second fastest chess in history, the fastest is when your opponent resign immediately when he see you
Bad
How, someone explain
plant guy
alright i don’t play chess but how did she win without taking the king?
WTFF is there even 2 moves chess !!!!!!!!
Used this on one of my friends, didn't know what hit him lol
why the fuck does this have 16 million views
When your most popular video is a clip from your subchannel
There is only one way to beat a person in two moves. Right here
Schlatt: *loading* Her: Schlatt?- Schlatt: *still loading*
RUMORS SAY IF I BEAT SCHLATT I GET PINNED THAT SHOULD BE EASY RIGHT
She didn’t see it coming. Neither did he.
The look on his face
I love where Schlatt insults her and he got destroyed in under 20 seconds
this is just absolutely amazing because of how high of a chance there is of this happening. like wow. moved the wrong pawns lmao
😂😂😂
I’m not a professional chess player but I know there is a type of chess game where you finish in under a minute. I’m pretty sure that just happened
how is this Jschlatt’s second most viewed video ever
I remember when I was in UIL chess
She just spedran him
How the fuck does chess even work
bruh how
Her expression after that fool's mate 😂
Idk anything about chess so what just happened
he’s evolving, just backwards.
I love how these clips have 3x more views than his main content lmao
This is a reply to every single comment I've seen:  Bruh imagine not realizing that this is staged
thanks big guy
someone has to put this in a try not to laugh
"...Schlatt?"
His face tho he got the processing face lol
Ah schiße!
The Robert B Weide theme should start playing
I have never played chess, someone explains to me how the girl won
Cue the TPiR Losing Horns.
Not scripted at all
Someone please explain to me how this works
KEKW
*suprised twerking*
Her eyes are so intense.
She's the best player i ever seen
3 moves
When u try ur best but u don't suCEEeeeEeEed ~
That “Schlatt?” at the end cracked me up
Khino
Who is watching this and thinking it is real or even entertaining? I’m sure they will remove this and the stupid train will advance, but come on people, is everyone tiktok’d during this pandemic?
It is the Grob Opening and white was supposed to play 2. Bg2. It Is actually my favorite..
Rosted
Idk how to play chess so I don't get it 😅
"I LOVE CHESS :)"
Fun Fact:  You watched this more than once
Please don't come for me .. I only have some knowledge due to my partner playing . How is this a checkmate. ?
Fools mate
0:22 _brain cells loading_
0:19 lol
He was so confident, and she absolutely crushed his dreams of winning that game. She just says "Schlatt?"
"I love chess :)"
Yes not scripted at all
My parents: “You should watch educational video’s and make a living”  Me: **Watches this**
OMG!! "she didnt see this coming" yeah sure, you didnt realize that you did it in the wrong side xD what a noob
1. Google "fastest way to lose in chess" 2. Make a video being overconfident on your chess skills and lose using those moves 3. ???? 4. Profit?
1. g4 is a book move     e5 is a book move 2. *f3 is a blunder*
never play f3...
he was right. When he moves the pawn you can see her going "WTF was that move" at 0:16. Then she moves her head slowly fowards trying to process if he really did what he just did, with a confused face.
Yk
Just no escape
This video is just sooo funny
Me
Fake.
*Mission fail*
I don't get it. WHat piece was checkmating it?
Le mat de l'idiot... il porte bien son nom XD
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wait, what?
What a fool.
when boys use 10% of their brain / when boys and girls play chess
Schlatt loses in 15 seconds of the first piece moving 🤣🤣🤣🤣
What??
huh im sitting here since five minutes trying to find out how she had won i have no idea of chess but pls help
Oldest trick in the book
I don't understand chess, but now I kinda realize why he lost quickly.
Schlatt’s expression is priceless
16 million views wtf
Obviously staged it for views
I don't play chest so
Why did she win the man could've eat he queen with the soldiers
My kid loves these videos.
even i'm not that dumb with chess
Sclatt could've continued if he was French    Because en persaunt
This is why people go into depression
Oh I remember when I participated in an inter-school chess tournament when one bloke won like this and his opponent just gave out the most audibe "HHHUUUHH???" of the whole day, I could literally hear it from across the hall that had like 10 fucking rows of tables for four.
😂😂😂
"She's not gonna see this coming"    Yeah, I don't think she did.
that's pretty funny. i feel like this was staged though. was it staged? its still funny if it was staged. :D
This is the best uno reverse card moment I have ever seen🤣
I have done that check mate 23 times it is easy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
lest talk do more loil XD
Come on I suck at chess and still I'd not fall for that.
Don't worry guys... He's just processing
I lost in 2-3 moves one time also... It was hilarious!
I just knew it, he would make a mistake.
the way she was looking 😭💀💀
It's  a setup. Pre-planned.
dewa kipas approved. 😅
His face at the end is *priceless*
The way his emotion moved
The way her face went all "bruh really?" When Schlatt did his move
😁 relatable When somebody's so hype just by learning some tricks
Maybe he got confused with the king and queen pieces. Happens to me quite often.
The fastest game of chess in the world
He got smacked!
He but I
lol
The truculent jute preliminarily bore because pisces hisologically fax times a earsplitting chinese. sturdy, lovely dressing
Don't be to confident
Schlatt: "She's not gonna see this coming"  Her:  *"He didn't see that coming"*
This is an obvious prank. It’s a fool’s mate and is the only way to lose this fast.
SCRIPTED INCOMING
🤣
KEKW
you made me laugh so hard that made me cry
I don’t get it
"She's not gonna see this one coming"  **UNO REVERSE CARD**
To be fair, i don't think she saw that coming
How are there people that gave this video a thumb down?
This guy must be literally trying to lose or just doesn’t know how to play. I knew better than to do that when I was 4 lol And that is the only way to lose in 2 moves.
Right people this is indeed called the FOOL'S MATE of just 2 moves...The second shortest way to checkmate someone is to checkmate them in only 3 moves... The third way to checkmate someone quickly, is called the Scholar's Mate and it's only 4 moves... During my high school years, a number of years ago, I was a self taught chess-master who had been lucky enough to meet and play some rated chess-masters whom I defeated much to their shock and surprise. Including one at my local YMCA who was the very first one I met and played. Now, I was only just going in to quietly watch games being played; with the sole intention of increasing my knowledge of the game. But, just moments after entering the YMCA Chess Club, a highly rated Chess Master ask me if I'd like to play a game with him. I accepted, telling him it would be an honour to do so, and a great opportunity to learn more about the game from him. Such was not the case, because I defeated that Chess Master to his utter and complete shock. To add insult to injury, the Director of the chess club immediately came over to our table, and told that highly rated Chess Master that if this had been a tournament Game.. he would have LOST HIS RATING to me! Neither the Director nor I were prepared for the reaction of that Chessmaster upon hearing those words... That Chessmaster quickly rose to his feet, and in a violent rage, knocked all the chess pieces and the chessboard right off the table and onto the floor... then he angrily stormed out of the Chess Club...By the way, if anyone wants to know, there's also a 7 move checkmate...To the guy who played and lost this game in such a pathetic manner; I suggest you read the following two chess books; (1.) An Invitation To Chess... and ...(2.) Masters Of The Board...
He moved the F2 pawn! Never move it unless absolutely necessary. One of the first lessons after the basics that I learned in chess. Lol and this is why...  Edit: This also applies to F8 for black. (F2 for white, F8 for black.)
“Schlatt?”
0:10
This is one of my favorite clips
POV: This was just randomly recommended to you
His pawn on H2 can kill the queen tho? I'm sure pawn's can move two spaces on their first move?. That was the rules at school and college anyway.
HAHAHAHAHA
only way to impress a girl :(
But I’m sure botez didn’t know that        You can 15% or more on geico insurance
He got jabaited MAN!
*R.I.P* "The 'I Love Chess' Whiteboard" 😢
Big guy wouldn't lose like this
lmao
i feel bad, but he was pretty much toxic to her lolol
Everyone knows this mo.... I ques he dosent... THEN WHY IS HE STREAMING CHESS... fkkin wow
Legend says he's been proccessing what happened for 100 years
0:23 love this look
Can I get a rule book for that cheese move? Hello???  OOOHHHHH I SEEEZ IT NOOOOW!!!! DAAAAMN whaaaaat the fuuuuuu dude
Pretty bad acting.
Emily Willis
Cool prank.
her face when he made that second move lmao.. that was priceless
I love this video
0:19 Harvard: Yoooooo.... u want in fam?
Schlatt: she's not gonna see this fucking coming  Her: *So you have chosen death*
I mean.. he totally open the way for the king XD
The infamous acoustic distally curve because kiss topologically return above a magical jump. defeated, delightful quotation
I'm not that great at chess, but that's how you perfectly expose your king for a checkmate, he nailed it😂
yeah this is completely fake
Inverted victory!
Can’t he switch the queen and king’s positions in a real game though?
I use this method to win though
"she's not gonna see what's f**king coming"
He was trying to do the same thing but he got his king and queen mixed up lmfao
you have to be a special kind of stupid to lose like that
Is it just me or does he look like Seth Macfarlane?
The compound failure this man felt was literally tangible
i dirnt know you could lose this fast
He made it even worse with the board in the back that says i love chess
I CAN'T STOP LAUGHING AT THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!
she is a bad actor bro..
Chess is no different than Tic Tac Toe.
I don’t even understand how he lost so fast
Schlatt: she doesn't see it coming    Her: FULL COUNTER
It's called fools mate
LMFAAAAOOOAOOAOOOOOAOOOO
How?
He could have just castled
I do not understand chess at all….I’m just going to stick to checkers-
when they learn tricks from YouTube.
its so obvious this is fake
Sike that's the wrong move
Ngl thats quite embarrasing
"She's not going to see this one coming"  Top 5 moments before disaster
*Dang son i was in 2nd grade when i lost the same way but now*      Im older. I still lose tho
Schlatt looks so much like shahveer jafri
He must’ve thought the king was the queen 🤣🤣🤣
the “schlatt” at the end 😂
I think that he thinks that chess ends when all the enemies pieces are gone
Brugh
2 move checkmate.
HAHAHAHA
It's like someone says "omaewa mo shindeiru" and then gets killed themselves.
So I watched queen's gambit for nothing?!
Ah yes, the famous 4 Turns Mate, as we call it here. Usually it's a sign of the game being staged or one of the players being incredibly stupid. Your foresight needs to be in the negative gor this to happen.
Woah way too easy botez way to easy
"I love chess" is written behind Schlatt 😂
I LAUGHED SO HARD, HE IS RIGHT
0:14 - She's not gonna see this one coming 🤭😈 0:21 *F***ing UNO REVERSE CARD*
"Like a Boss" music is missing
he once wrote «i love chess»
He just did an inverse big brain play
Instant regret moment 101913939288%
You never see it comingggggg.....
i mean... she really never got to see it coming
You gone simp
Thanks. Now I know that the easiest way to win chess is to move the queen so that it’s diagonally aligned with the other player’s king.
WAIT WTF😲😲😲
What
Ahahahahahahahaha WTF
*Schlatt is not responding*  [ Close Schlatt ] [ Wait for Schlatt's response ]
Lol
schlatt : "shes not gonna see this coming" alex : *come here i got you a coffin*
Schlatt: "She's not gonna see this Coming".  Her: *"He's not gonna see this coming"*
How's this possible?!
speedrun
As has already been noted, this is known as the "fool's mate."  Nobody falls for this.  You have to play into it.  The video is just acting.
😭😭😭 old memories comming I was first a noob in chess and I planned to join a tournament for the first time and I already told I am a noob it was a state rating tournament and I had no ratings and my first match went like this video.
Either he wasn't paying attention, let her win, or he forgot what the queen does. I can't think of any other reason.
Music is Airship Fortress on Mario Kart ds.
i bet 99% of the people commenting on this video don't play chess
this was very obviously set up to happen this way, planned before hand
Slatt
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
LMAOOOOO
cute that people believed this was legit. I've seen animals in movies with better acting skills. XD
Can’t you switch the rook with the king  Idiot
Curb your Chess game
pain beyond comprehension
Checkmate
Lol his reaction 😆😆🤟
When youve underestimated your anime enemy:
I was on my high school's chess team for three years, and litterally on my first day, they taught me this and how not to set myself up for it.
Can anyone explain,I don’t get it
who is she
after that they played the piano man
whattt whattt
he died inside
His next line is " how the f*uk you beat me in 2 moves?"
Eren attacking before the enemy transforms be like:
I'm sorry I don't play chess a lot do King teleport and what? His knig never died
waaaaaaaaat
Annihilated
This can be a meme template
Wow, she's gorgeous! I'd be willing to loose to such beauty!
Happened to me so often when playing against the computer.
Schlatt....
but she got check, not checkmate :/
She may be pretty, but deep down, she's got a venomous bite. O.o
😂😂😂😂😂
You never exposed the king😂😂😂
You could hear that RECORD SCRATCH
Wait a minute, even *I* know that’s a stupid move
New drinking game...read the comments and every time you see “she’s not gonna see this coming”...you drink 🍺
Smell arahi he
I'm honored to have this in my recommended.
That's called "Foolsmate"  It only works once per opponent so use it wisely
Recomendations... but still i remember my enemys reaction when i made same
:0
The phobic airplane crucially mug because bus trivially curve excluding a flashy minister. unwieldy, aspiring girdle
no fucking wayyyyyyy
fake and scripted not even funny
Wow, never thought it was possible
in Heaven there was God. God doesn’t have a Creator because He is the Creator, He created all. He has no time, no matter, He was always here. in Heaven there was also the devil. he was considered the “most beautiful angel” in Heaven. he wanted to be God, he wanted all the power. he was greedy and evil. God gave us all free will, even the devil. He made hell for the devil because he was evil and selfish, which is the total opposite of God. good is always going to be eternal because God is eternal, and God is Good, therefore Good will always be eternal because of God. the devil is evil, he is bad. the devil is a creation from God, the Creator. creations aren’t eternal, only through the way of the Father, and through the Father you have to get through Jesus. bad is not eternal because “bad” came from the devil which is a creation, he doesn’t hold the power God holds. we are so used to living in sin and being comfortable in our flesh that it’s now a life style. God sent His own Son, Jesus to die on the cross for us. Jesus spread the Gospel, He healed so many possessed people, blinds, even people near death. He fed the hungry, and the thirsty. Jesus is so loving towards us even though we don’t deserve it. He had thorns shoved into His skull, He was mocked, spit on, whipped across His body near death, and on top of that He carried a 300lb cross up a hill while He was near death, and tired, and had nails shoved into His wrists where the bone splits, and His feet. He doesn’t regret it and didn’t hesitate to do it because He loves us so much He was willing to suffer for us. Jesus loves you and wants you in His life, He wants to set you free from depression, drugs, abuse, anxiety, suicidal thoughts. He wants you as you are because you are enough for Him. He is so proud of you. Jesus loves YOU ❤️
no way he didnt do a fools mate on purpose
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Schlatt: She’s not Gonna See this one coming  Her: are you sure about that
you did that online in front of a camera?...dont try to learn chess on twitch mate
she's cute
Mate schlatt got clapped
This is scripted for sure
This is what happen when we overestimate ourselves 😂
Rekt...
“She’s not gonna see this one coming” he says, right before he didn’t see what she had coming for him.
Be careful with saying you will win before a match because there is always a chance you will lose
STUPID BOI
Hi hi 😁
Schlatt disconnected from the world..............
Schlatt?
wtf lolllll 🤣🤣🤣👌👌 she troll u lolollololloo
That face lmao
And that is why I hate chess
How did I not find this until now? Goddamn this is priceless.
"Talk shit get crit"
Biggest anime flexes
Suddenly don't feel bad about being bad at chess
"She's not gonna see this coming"  Well he wasn't wrong🤣🤣🤣
Noob player
Sad siory..
I saw it coming he made a rookie move
Black won
😂😂😂😂🔥 that move is 🔥🔥🔥
Never, I repeat NEVER, play pawn G4 first move.
The pumped vacuum latterly scold because encyclopedia bioinformatically arrange excluding a domineering brother. cooing, brave belgian
She's not going to see what's coming   The end of the chess match.
Why isn't this a YouTube short??😂
???
"She's not gonna see this coming" Neither did he I think
too soon to say that mate
Did he mistook his king for a queen or something?
Does anyone here have an elo rating?
As soon as I saw how long the video was, I knew it was fool’s mate.  My grandpa used to own us grandkids with it.
Her face when he did that second move, she's like "did you seriously just did that?"
Lowkey reminds me of one of my classmates beating me in chess with only 4 moves—
Actually he did not lose he could do a castling move which is king switching places with rook o but I don't know why the computer showed he lost
that instant silence is fcking hilarious 🤔😂🤣
I played a 2 player game with myself to test whether it works?!
Bruh
"she's not gonna see this one coming"  well i mean you werent wrong
Smartest guy be like: "Seriously 😑"
ive watched this 6 times now
Schlatt.exe has stopped working
wait is this 15million views
how to pronounce schlatt ? like "slut" ? right?
2:26 SHOT ON IPHONE BY LINDA. H
You look like shahveer jafry
chess op
hes so cracked
Every single comment is the exact same making some shitty joke while I'm trying to find someone explaining what happened
I am shocked at how it was just 2 turns
How did she win she just moved it
Whats the context for this? or is it scripted i honestly dont know
Fake. No plan “see it coming” with the second pawn move.
Are people insane or do they not realize that this was obviously staged
Background "I love chess :) ".
I did something similar to my brother 😂
As someone who's never played chess what the fuck happened
rigged, nobody is that stupid.
The look on her face is "Did he really fucking do that?"
Epic battle oh chess 🤣🤣🤣
My dad used this move on me and im just as shocked as he is
LoL
That's a fools mate, chapter 1 of chess.. how do you move pieces without knowing chapter 1
No joke thats just karma
I beat my brother doing just this last week
This was the move I did and I quit playing after that
Looks like she gave them a... last surprise.
8.3K+ dislike.
When you underestimate your opponent.
This is like a suicide move, why on the earth you move those two pawns
This is what happens when you roll a 1 in a logic check irl
Lmfao
As someone who has a multi talented father , I saw that coming and I can't stop laughing . Remember people, small mistake can be bigger .
I’m wondering if he just mistook his king for the queen piece..
Smothered mate lol.
Ufffff...
Fun fact: i almost did this to someone by accident
Clueless?
Seems fake
This happened to me once against the computer. Deleted the app immediately.
Top 5 saddest anime deaths:
is it possible to learn this power?
Cap
Dude... It looked like his whole world just collapsed in that one moment. The sheer disbelief and shock literally drained his heart and mind in a moments time that he can't say anything. That's no regular L.
This is scarily close to how i start matches, maybe i should change that XD
I never seen this and now I gotta think even more 😅
Did he ever recover from this?
This is called a 'fool's mate', and no one in their right mind would ever play this, even a complete novice is unlikely to do this even by accident. What a load of 'staged' bollocks this is
As someone who has played several games of chess, I just have to ask  HOW WAS THAT MOVE EVEN POSSIBLE
ive gotten recommended this 5 times already help
one of the methods that I often use
This is what we call a foolsmate
She's not gonna see this coming        She: ooomb_
“She’s not gonna see this coming” Her: So you have chosen... defeat!
Dat face of dat woman at da end...
Mario Kart DS Airship nice
I sorta understand chess, but I don't get how he lost. Can someone pls explain?
Came to the comments to get an explanation of how he lost  The comments: "She's not gonna see this coming"  I'm guessing the game glitched and forfeited for him?
2 min silence for those who thaught this is real....✌🏻😎
Challenge An "INDIAN" in Chess and see result urself...🙏🏻
Just seeing the life drain out of his face in an instant always gets me
Can someone explain why she won? Like she didn't do nothing but change position
Bruh I play chess and for me moving I queen at an angle like that is my start. It is the easiest way to win.

As soon as she played her turn I wheezed so hard

Years ago...I actually lost a game in exactly this fashion......lol
is this an actual thing? because aren't you supposed to get check first by catching the queen?
Why fake this though
"She is not gonna see this one coming" *Proceed to light my self on fire.
I have no fk clue what just happened. I feel like this was staged.
I don't know chess so can someone pls explain
I don’t get it how’s she win
fake scripted
Scripted
Moves his pawn to develop the bishop.  Immediately blocks bishop in and gives the game away.  All that potential.  Lol
i thought it was a real match.. but its staged what a let down
I mean, cmmon how dumb can you be to leave the king defenseless on the first move?
Accurate representation of when I was playing with a new chess set and I wasn't familiar with the way the king and queen looked yet
Hahhaa hún var að gera heimaskitsmát
😂😂😂😂
Fake
fake
Schlage was too busy getting ready to win.
Fake and gay
schlatt
Tbf she technically didn’t see it coming
Bruh
seems fake
I've had this exact thing happen to me and I also had the exact same reaction XD
Lmfao
the mieses opening is so predictable! how did you fall for that!?
What she did was she let the queen 👸 to the king and checkmated Schlatt. If I had such little time to process it then I would have the same reaction lol 😂
Nice 20sec script !
Am I the only one that confused the Symbols for King and Queen or did the Joke just fly over my head?
Wtf am I doing here? I’ve never played chess in my life.
I had to watch it twice to process what I saw OMG 😂😂😂
It was at that moment he knew, he fucked up.

this is horrible acting ngl
Ah yes foolsmate
0:14 the same thing I said to myself before lasting for a solid 7 seconds in bed with her.
Nice little staged match :)
gg gamers
She really didn't see it coming cause it never came
This must have been staged becouse i cant se any strategic benefit by starting with those 2 moves atall.  The Rock is blocked in, the bishop is blocked in, the knight is almost blocked in and u are ofc exposing the king. I call staged on this.  If there is any legit good chess players that know what the benefit here would be then prove me wrong.
I have no idea who these people are but he can't be this clueless, he must be doing it for the lolz
I think scripted 😅😅 when i was elementary i know that moves 😅
I won that way once XD
XD
Staged and cringe
lol this wasnt faked in the slightest
I also lost a game chess in 2 moves against my aunt
Fool's mate
lovely choice of music (mario kart DS, battleship)
fakers says its hate
Mmmm, that was a fixed match ....!!!
Life is a chess game
Schlatt's mind: what-
Here i thought Scholar's mate is the fastest
I can relate to this.
That’s Embarrassing
what? he could still won the game with the pawn on the right
Video was seen by G.R
i am wondering how this has more likes and views than the original video
her face when he moves it is like “seriously…”
You know... At this time, schlatt knows his a side character.
Wow
Top 10 things NOT to say 10. 9. 8. 7. 6. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1. She's not gonna see this one coming 😆
xd
Wait. You refer to yourself in the 3rd person? Isn't that like, really lame?
“Hehe, she’s not gonna see this one coming.”     “Oh.”
I guess kids can't tell how bad the acting is.
'she is not gonna see this coming' She : UNO Reverse Card!
Yup, she clearly did not expect that. Well done.
i hope he's processed everything that just happened... by "everything" i mean just 2 moves.
"She's not gonna see this one coming" He was right.
I should try this the next time I'll be playing chess
Am I the only one who thinks this looks like it was staged for the lulz?
Why stage it lol
there is no way this is real
Bruh. That is the fastest way to win / lose in the chess book =). And Schlatt had repeated it, just like that.
Me is here
Does anyone actually know how he lost. I hav no fucking idea what just happened
Omg I haven't laughed like that since George Carlin was alive
Tottaly not planned yea
Why does his hat have the dulo symbol on it
Wait, what happened?
Thats what she said.
!!!AMAZING!!!!!
Is it just me or does his name sound like what playboy carti uses for his adlibs👀🤣
Dang girl you beat him
I love her face when she realizes what he's done
Me when he moved g3: 👁️👄👁️ well thats a bad start
Not scripted at all.. everyone who plays chess knows this move and you won't ever start like that.
What was he trying to do I'm curious
0:23 Anime Villains when they enter 2nd Phase
"Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer."
What move was he planning to do though?
She’s not gunna see this fucking coming” - schlats last words-
Staged af
No one could've seen a 2-move checkmate coming
High IQ 🥵🥵
I don't get it, so he just confuse the King with the Queen or what?
This was intentional for the content.  Yawn. Thanks Algorithm, but no thanks.
scripted
She is cute!
And I thought I was shit at Chess (no disrespect towards Schlaat, BTW)
Loading..... analysing lose.... knowing that you are soooo stupid....... angre. ..........
Schlatt??
😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 in lafing to death
Narrator: "It was at that moment he knew, he fucked up."
You can tell by her face before schlatt lost she's like "really?"
He is actually dumb
Ah, yes! The Fool's Mate, destroyer of self esteem and self confidence.
Top 10 moments captured on camera before disaster struck
Mg dad literally  showed me this chess move as a kid. lmfao
You can actually look at his eyes without life after that one
Alex Botez winning is faster than my Internet Connection
There were thousands of different opening moves he could have made yet he chose the worst two possible,  impressive
The Face she made was.......😆😆
Man got small brain Allwas take your time don't rush in boi
I don't know much about Chess but couldn't his queen take her king?
I believe that, that is what's called a pro gammer move.
Schaltt: she's not gonna see this one coming 2 sec later Schaltt: 😐
I mean she really didn't see that coming so...
I don't know how chess works
That just crushed his ego to oblivion
He started with dumb move, you never leave your king open to kill.
Btw this is called fool's mate
Scripted
ever since this incident when I play chess I make sure to never make this mistake LMAO
Oh yes ,this is not a script. 😃
He was never heard from again..
Someone get the Delorian ready, because she punched him back into the stone age.
It's alright tho. You tried and it is called the two move mate, I've learnt about it recently as well. By moving your f and g pawns you opened a direct diagonal to the king and there were no escape squares. g3 would have worked because it would threaten the opponent queen and to protect your f pawn you could bring out your knight too. But losing is a learning opportunity. Nice try!
Shlatt: this is what I call A pro- Alexandra: *moves Queen* Shlatt: ...
Sooo obviously staged
I've been laughing for five minutes straight, watching this on repeat  And I don't think I'm stopping any time soon
ㅤ
The fools mate
Girl - i'm gonna end this mans whole career
I went into this thinking,"pfft you can't lose in two moves" and then this mans lost in two moves.
ez.. do the king sacrifice
I do like to lose to a woman in a game, because I wanna win "the game" if you know what I mean
ahhh yes fool's mate
Never start first 🤣
What a set up vid. I cant believe people this this is real.
If you go into a video call of chess you may be lucky enough to see an ancient artefact otherwise know as “Processing Schlatt”
You can actually hear the concern in her voice at the end, she knows that guy will never be the same again.
he's THAT stupid
What exactly was he trying to do here?
"She's not gonna see this coming." She: "Sore wa dou ka na?"  (Loud _Passionate Duelist_ plays in the background)
This is like kanoh vs kuroki Preinitiative vs Preinitiative 🤣😂😂
Well, stupid inovatative move mate.😁
Cue play my theme
I don't know, Rick.
How about that Left Hand Ace♠︎
Someone who knows chess that can explain how she won?
I'm pretty sure he did this on purpose for the views
I can look at their reactions for hours 😂
Schlatt?
Lol
I did the same mistake on random player 😂😂😂
F
I find it more humoring than it should be when he says get the bishop out, and then proceeds to not do that. The equivalent to that would be like suddenly in the middle of a battle, running into the barracks to get a gun, and then pulling out a knife and running at them.
only for likes .. even the worst dumbass in the world wouldnt do this move... this is only skit video for likes ..
She really does "Omae wa mo shinderu" in a chess game and Schlatt is just like "nani?!"
Oh this shit happened to me.
Bro, YOU had one job.
This meme should be in shot on iphone.
He was right. She didnt see the 2 move win that was coming.
All we need is giorno' theme in the background
*Call an ambulance, BUT not for me.*
He forgot to rage
i used same move defeat one buddy
Are you ever scrolling through the comments thinking “dang I should have commented that”
The girl couldn't believe it herself 😂
People really can't see this is setup or am I just losing faith in humanity
lol
well i have lost my first chess match in a tournament while i was 13 against a 30yr old man with this exact same 2 step move
It's a dumb move to move pawns like that...
*Schlatt exe has stopped working*
His brain was processing slower than a school chrome book with 2 tabs open
Tomlol :v
That move was so confusing that to this day, even she has no idea what happened
this is funny but gotta say it was a lot funnier when i didnt know the dudes name was schlatt
Curb your arrogance :D
This is scripted, no experienced chess player will not notice foolsmate.
Is it called Fool's mate?
"She's not gonna see this coming"  She: *OMAE WA MOU SHINDEOURU*
For those talking about castling, there were pieces between the rooks and king AND it can’t be done on check / checkmate. My soul left my body watching my mans get done like this, RIP bröther 😂
I guess his CONNECTION was LAG.. ☺️.. Better luck next time..
the "Schlatt." killed me
That is the fastest way you can loose in chess when playing white. 🤣
Schlatt is too good
“She’s not gonna see this coming”  Yeah, neither did you Schlatt.
I thought this move I invented when I’m 14
"She's not gonna see this one coming."  *Popular anime moments before disaster.*
Tip for chess: Always have at lesast a few pieces of your color surrouding the king so for example, a piece protecting your king, the piece will die from an oppenent's piece and then you can kill that opponent's piece with your king
She won because she moved one of her pieces (the queen) to a spot where she can kill the king
Bruh
The title is clickbait because clearly this wasn't a game, it was a massacre
Isn't obvious this is scripted. He moves the pieces that supposed to protect king in 2 turns.
Why isn't the title of video, She's not gonna see this coming
lmao
Schlatt?
Lol
Everyone : she is never see coming bla bla bla Me : who is she ?? She is so gorgeous 😂
Ok, this is one thing I prefer on chess over go and that’s this hilarious shit is possible
Am I missing something here. It would only be check because he could move his knight in 2 separate spots to protect his king. Def was not even close to being checkmate
The observant lute bacteriologically fill because field consecutively decorate a a useless suggestion. abaft, bizarre week
She shattered his pride in 2 moves
Classic checkmate👌
I did this sadly.
ROASTED
Jschlatt gets an existential crisis from chess.
This is so fake
No way this wasn’t scripted
and I thought Charlie's win against xQc was brutal
lmaoooooo i watched a part of nux's view on the tournament and they were talking about this game XD
Damn that’s uh very unfortunate
How I Met Your Mother

I lost to my cousin with this exact same scenario once. Super embarrassing.

Dear people; chess is one of the hardest games to master. If you think you're good...you're not. Unless you have a title next to your name when you play, just don't.

*Black Won by Checkmate*  Schlatt: *visible confusion*
Well scripted...
I like how in the background he has written I love chess
The utter disbelief in Schlatt's face is beautiful
that move is not possible btw

What move was that?
Sad cuz I have no idea what just happened
Better than queen's gambit

I play chess a lot and that's not a legitimate move
"You may have outsmarted me, but I outsmarted your outsmarting!"
Man got decimated and still can’t process his fuck up XD
I’m soo confused howwwww
her face lol
Great defensive game mate! LOL!
What’s that screaming I hear outside?
I love how she gets closer to the screen, as if she can't even believe what she just saw before her eyes. Lmaooo
her face at the end be like |:}

HUMILIATION.
How does checkmate even work

Is this the new meta....
My father did that with me once and I never did those two moves ever again
BRUH
Love the fools mate right there
Ohhh so this is where the girl from the queens gambit went
This is how I exactly lost my game 2 hours ago
That disappointment... I felt that✋😞
“She’s not gonna see this coming” he said
*evil laugh* She's not gonna see this fucking coming...
You have to be really bad to do that
The way she looks at Jschlatt like she knows he made thre worst possible move in chess
Why do i feel like I've just stumbled upon an ancient forbidden knowledge that no one should ever known?
I for one sure as hell didn't see that one coming. There's only so many ways to lose within 4 moves total.
That was disappointing he should of moved his horse
I’m horrible at that game, can someone explain
Hhahahahahaha bruhhhh
As soon as he exposed his king, i knew he lost already..
FAKEEEEE
PFF HAJAHSIDNOSNXNX
I swear this gave me whiplash
Well he was right, she didn't see it coming
It really went from "😆" to "😶" in seconds
Can someone who plays chess tell me how she won?
-0 iq
I love the look on her face after he makes his final move like: "did he seriously just do that?"
ah i know this trick, used to mess people up with it.
it was a calculated move but man am i bad at math
Their faces at the end🤣🤣🤣🤣
No way dude 😂😂😂😂😂
WTF 😂
Oh boy
Fool’s Checkmate!
YIKES 🥶
nice American army strat

She really didn't see it coming since she beat hs ass before it.
there were hundreds of plays and he chose the worst
I’m embarrassed for him
I've once lost pretty quickly in a chess match because I wasn't really paying attention but this is a whole new level of not paying attention
15 million views for this?? Seriously?     Yep, I know I clicked. Just dont ask me why.
This move is very common every one knows it so i m sorry but i will say scripted
He kalled a pawn a bishop   Me: realizing that I spelt called with a k
How is this guy so accurate at pretending to be me in chess?
I just noticed the whiteboard in the background that says “I LOVE CHESS :)”   Wonder if that’s still there
Was that a king or a queen🤔
I remember my friend beat me once with this move on a competition
0:19 It was at this moment he knew he had f**ked up
I no chess master, but I saw that coming a mile away. Wow
And that folks, is what’s called “instant karma”
Here’s what happened, when schlatt moved his first pawn up to G4, he opened up the space for the king to be checked, what Alex did was to open up a place for her queen to move and check the king. which meant moving her pawn up to E5. So then schlatt moved his second pawn up to F3,Alex moved the queen to H4, to then check the king. No other pawns on the board could block or kill Alex’s queen, and the king couldn’t move to a safe place, leading to schlatt being instantly checkmated, this is called Fool’s mate. Meaning if you fall this, you’re a fool

When a guy looks his crush the brain go off for several seconds. True story. XD
This is the first time I've seen someone speed run chess
I thought we were seeing chess livestream history when we saw Cr1tikal defeat XQC in an awe inspiring 6 moves with an absolutely beautiful Scholar's Mate, but this... this is on a whole other level. I would quit playing chess for the rest of my life if I lost this quickly and embarrassingly.
Dude?? 😅

Only if it wasn't staged
Checkmate
I have no idea why this was in my recommendations, but...    Seems like Schlatt, Shat his pants:D   :,Dimsosorry...
fools mate should be renamed to the “big guy outsmarting”
The flow of reality stopped when he realised what happened.
Tbh, I am at the wrong place cuz I don't get it. What!!! Happened?
He clearly confused the king with the queen
That mario kart ds music tho
Isn’t  this the music from Mario cart that was nostalgic 🥲
Schlatt?
ohh yeah scripted comedy is sooo good
Would have actually been funny if it wasn't setup.....
There is only one possible way to do this, so I think it is safe to say “OH BROTHER THIS GUY STINKS”
is this the guy who took over L'manburg?
For a moment there, he thought about his existance
Me knowing absolutely nothing bout chess but still hyped
When she said I'm just gonna play simple chess and moved the pawn into the center, I instantly looked at what opened up from the pawn not being there and I was just staring like. THE QUEEN IS READY TO DEPLOY, THERE IS NO ESCAPE

I don’t get it. How did the king move so many blocks? I thought only the queen can do that!
I think I've played this exact game of chess before, but I didn't even understand what happened. I hadn't even begun yet really and I had already lost.
I beat my dad in chess like this once lol. He sat down and was like ok lets make this quick and he was just moving them and he happened to move those two pieces and I was like checkmate and he just went, oh wait what. He was so confused.
That moment when you've been studying all week and finally get the math test, but you know nothing on it.
Oh my god....she fucking killed that man
I loved chess
What is the music pls ?
I have no clue what the fuck just happened

This got to be a joke, right...?  Nobody who calls themselves a decent chessplayer would ever do that. Never!
Damn i laughed my ass out 😂😂😂
I don’t know how to play chess but please someone tell me what does happen and how she won

Anyone know who she is??
That happend to me
It's called Foolsmate for a reason.
Schlatt shat after that.
Fun fact: The video got same amount of likes as his total subscribers
What happened
The thing that's so fake about this is how he acted and the fact that this was literally the only way someone could lose a game of chess that quick
Mans got himself in a foolsmate

It's alex botez, pls dont embarass us like this it's an honor to play with her
I need the full video!!! Or did he dissapear after this?
Didnt she get mated the same way in like 4 moves
Wow, even I didn't see that coming

I just realized i have the same hat as him 😂
Almost balance between subs and likes
there's a move i don't remember the name of, but i think you could swap the king with the last piece (i don't know what it's called)
The *i love chess* in the background wont be there for long
Thing is, what technically could he do
that one there was a violation, personally i wouldn't have it.
Now ..... I TOO LOVE CHESS 😂😂😂😂

This really looks set up!
audience : what happened schlatt ??  schlatt : that was'nt me , it was someone who looks exactly like me .
All scripted 🙄😂👏 how can someone be so stupid 😂 no offense 👍
the "I lOVE CHESS :-)" in the background makes it even funnier
Omg I know this trick I do this every time they move specific pawns xD
Can someone explain what happened? I dont play chess much
I disliked the video because I didn't like the girl.
Isn't it king faces opponents Queen and Queen faces opponents king
Is she even indian
His mind: processing...... What.... How...
😆 🤣 😂 😹 😆 🤣
She certainty didn’t see that one coming. Literally the 2 move checkmate nobody ever thinks people actually play that
The "Schlatt" in the end was so perfect.
“She’s not gonna see this coming”  We didn’t even see it coming
She not gonna aee this coming Its like a sword fight and she just brought a gun thinking it was a gun fight and shlatt took the gun and shot himself
Someone said that life is a chess game to Schlatt, AND so, just like in l’manburg, tearing down the walls AND killing Tubbo, made him lose.

Dam pretty good
My old chess teacher said he played against Donald Trump years ago he did the same thing
bruh
Hey
legend says he still is processing and raging what just happend
"She's not gonna see this commin"  Famous last words
This will go down in memory as the worst insult to the global chess community.
He must have wanted a rematch after that
Schlatt.exe has stopped working.
everything in this video just has pure comedical values, the timing and everything
Lol
Trying to be samay raina ???? 😂😂😂😂 u can't
Ever wondered why F pawn is called Poison Pawn?
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
dude got scholar’d
We call that there a Fool's Mate, because you'd have to be a fool or completely ignorant of the game to screw up that bad.
"Scripted"
Bro that's sad 🤣
First time i started playing chess when I was a kid, did that same move against my grandpa. That’s when I learnt you can lose, but you can also lose so fucking hard your family hopes their long lineage ends with you.
Fools mate strategy
There is only one possible way to lose at chess in 2 moves and he found it
I watched this say 10 times now HAHAHAHAHAHAHA Lol can't stop laughing.
I I didn't understand what happened
Wait sorry if I'm a noob but cant he just block it with a bishop or queen?
The dramatic weasel lovely flower because authority yearly spot off a noiseless bean. abashed, fancy nail
And that why is important to be careful when we open on the sides x)
You are correct.  She didnt see that coming at all. The sentence however, is a double edged sword.
You are right Schlatt, *nobody expected you to suicide in the game*
THE QUEEN MOVED AND HIS KING WAS BLOCKED IN MAN. checkmate.
This is what you call LOL
LOL!!!!!!! XD
I love the queens gambit
“She’s not gonna see this coming” Do I get top comment now
Talk about getting rekt goddamn
😂😂😂lol ho gya
That face expression at the end! :) My man lost his identity!
The only way this is true is he fooling him or testing him . Thats fools mate. Most common thing. It is very famous
Bobobobobobobo
I truly believe this was scripted
Ha noob
The smallest and the funniest game of chess ever!
"She's not gonna see this one coming."  Famous last words.
Definitely staged. These are the only moves this works with
Can anyone tell me how she instantly won like that? I would take her to court and cross examine this
“She’s not gonna see this one coming” _Impending Doom Approaches..._
Fake
Destroyed in seconds...
She was like: hemmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Staged af
Me who thought checkmate meant you had to surround the king completely:
I waved to a woman because I thought she waved at me. Apparently she waved to another person. So to get out of the awkward situation I kept my hand up and a taxi pulled over and drove me to the airport. I am now in Costa Rica starting a new life.
qouting a line by Agent Carter from Rush Hour ," You ain't gonna see it comming! You ain't gonna see it comming!"
her expressions 😍😂😂😂😂
That smile went straight real fast
Lol😆😂🤣 he got hit with fools mate
I believe that’s what we in the business refer to as a queens gambit
Faked video. This is a tactic used by experienced chess players against players that play and just have no idea what to do. It's a Fool's mate. Planned from the get go. Easily Googled and extremely easy to fake. The odds of it happening in a real game are astronomical. Even if you randomly move pieces, you'll almost never fall in this situation.
To be fair she didn't expect a move which would lose instantly.
" she's not gonna see this one coming..."   -Schlatt . 2021
So what happened was he made her win on purpose so he can prove that she is the better person at chess and possibly get something on the side for being a nice person that would be my excuse I mean truthful explanation.
We all talk about Schlatt processing. But who else thinks the lady is still wondering about why Schlatt decided to do that.
Not the first 2 move win I’ve seen.
mmmm
10 moments caught before distaster: "She's not gonna see this one coming"
hey at least they both didn’t see it coming
Hahaha, he did the Fool's Mate. It happens. ;)
Wha-       I dont play chess what just happened
Schlatt should've played the queen's gambit, which is d2, d4 then black has to play d7, d5 then play c2, c4 after that black/Alexandra has to decide whether to accept it or to decline it, which is e7, e5/Albin counter gambit
To be fair, her facial expression makes it clear that she did not, infact, see it coming
"She's not gonna see this one coming" Famous last words
Everybody knows this is scripted
insert suprised pikachu face here
I also did that move to my friends lol
This has to be fake right... I hope it’s fake...he can’t be that bad, I mean I’m not good at chess but I could see not to do that, that is literally a funnel to your king is what he made there, Like he was asking to lose.
Well considering the brief look of confusion as to how one human could be so stupid she very clearly didn’t see that coming
Who is she ??😅
Wow man this was the first ever chess move I learned
Achievement unlocked! *You Fool!* _Lose a game with a Fool’s Mate_
I didn't see all the comments coming about how she's not going to see this coming.
Man go back to Minecraft
Be carefuul work hard I am coming in future
Lemme explain what happened there was a video on chess triks in it was a really smort trick but there was a flaw which was addded intentionally it was fools play the play schlatt lost from to make the person who uses that trick loose so thats what happened lol
You got baited and outsmarted mate. Lol
He lost as soon as he agreed... And a loss is a loss.
Destroyed in seconds.
"...................Schlatt?"
I swear this is legit me when I am playing with my grandpa 😭😂
She looks like Fallon Carrington
The whimsical paint aerobically shave because geometry contrastingly wonder into a nifty operation. fluttering, adjoining bay
he need to train chess more :D I dont like playing chess-online anymore because most players will copy your movements into "Bot-game" and take the bot-reaktion as their own moves. So one side always plays against a bot
Outstanding move.
Soon as he moved that pawn... We all knew...
Schlatt was like  *brain exe has stopped responding*
Its a famous chess trap.
EMMA WATSON!!!!
How does that work?

The comments: "she's not going to see this one coming."                                                                                                       That is all have a good day.
Basic chess trap "fool's mate"
Him: "She's not gonna see this one coming"  Me: *You fell victim to one of the classic blunders!*
When you lose worse than XQC
100% intentional!
Looks like cheating to me.
wait i got ur hat >:)
"........schlatt?"
I dunno if this comment was already made but whatever. This dude really went from 😃 to 😦 in 1.2 seconds lmao
You can see his life drain from his face in the end
that is literally the fastest way to checkmate a person.
Umm this is a bs video not set correctly it is impossible to lose in 2 moves the fastest checkmate possible is 4 moves
The legendary "2 step" rookie
The moment you realize you're not the main character
There should be a TV show that's like 5 seasons long, 14 episodes a season, 30 mins and episode where he practises playing chess so that he can eventually be the champion and the final episode ends with that complete fail right there. Would be very funny but also very anger inducing to the people who watched without knowing the outcome
Talk about dumbness levels.
He got broken into million pieces😂
Scarred for life.
A fools mate
When you play too many tricks you will get tricked yourself
Shock mod on🤣😂
Hacker?
Now I know what to do when I want to win chess against my bf.
He fell for the poison pawn? This is such a rookie move that it had to have been on purpose
It was at this moment that he knew, he fucked up
i ain't gonna believe anyone who says this game wasn't staged.
See if chess was this exciting all the time I would watch
Is no one gonna talk about those crisp side burns
I lost like this once and the person offered an immediate rematch. Declined immediately.
Shes not gonna see this one coming   3 seconds later: *loses*
Who is she?
Any advanced chess players here? What was he actually trying to do?
she did, he came
horrible acting
“hehe she’s not gonna see this one coming”  *OMAE WA MOU SHINDEIRU!!*
Slatt
My guy really did fools mate
His not going to loose if he didnt move those pawns. Anyway who is going to pull those moves at first turn.
Scripted smh

0:25 silence
R.I.p😭🤣
She's so visibly confused I'm losing it lmaooooo xD
"Schlatt?—"  I'M LITERALLY SHEDDING TEARS
He probably put money on her to win. EZ cash
This has to be one of the greatest videos on the internet😂
Well, he was right about one thing. She certainly didn’t see that one coming.
I’m not surprised he is so bad
Quite obvious move there
Wasent expecting that
Why am I not surprised?
scripted...
Her face and the way she said “Schlatt” is such a curveball
Funny but seems staged
This is why I dont like chess
insta-kill
thats 27 seconds I'll never get back
Staged
His face in the end says it all
That reminds me of that video where they put two Chess AI against each other. A Chess AI from an old game and a Chess AI from a new game. The old AI won the game exactly the same way xD
Legend says he's still sitting trying to understand what the actual fuck happened
Well, she didn't saw it coming after all.
“Chess is no different than tic-tac-toe.” – Shiro (No Game No Life)
That's three moves mate, js lol
Is this a world record for fasted loss?
The “Schlatt?...” at the end is priceless
She cheated and hacked
he is a legend I impressed
I don't really see how she won cause I don't know chess so could someone tell me?
blue screen schlatt
Uh totally not fake...
Schlatt: *Brain still processing*
Me who knows nothing about chess therefore I don’t know what the heck just happened: “Pfft what a horrible move, what an easy win amirite?!?”
"She's not going to see this coming" Kind of like how if they were in a knife fight and if he promptly stabbed himself, she wouldn't see that coming
Well that was easy
this cant be real
She didnt won, He lost
I love how "I love chess" is written on his white board! 🤣
ich
😆 that was so... fake 😐
What opening was schlat going for
XD
Made my day, thanks.
lol good i hate schlatt
Perfect plan! 😎 Wait...  I'M THE PREY??😅  Happened to me too, but only the castle died because of my stupid move🤣
Yeah guys, its big brain time!
Yeah guys, its big brain time!

The Embarrassment
Fake af
I have no idea how to play chess, what happened?
As a guy this funny ash brah😭😭
Foolsmate!
oooh so thats why, i had the queen piece mistaken as the king i totally thought what she moved was the king so i thought, "wait, you could move that far?"
Well, she definitely did not see THIS coming.
She was just like "I'm gonna end this man whole career"
That's probably the world record for chess or it isn't?
How in the world did he fall for that? Well guess he lost lol.
lol
"she's not gonna see this coming" ironicly he was right 😅
XD
The phony setup with these phony comments liking it is cringey.
He make big mistake LLL
Is you are stupid? 😂😂😂
As a guy who lost a tournament in 5 moves i respect that
And that, in the chess world, is what we would like to call, "checkmate."
When you prepare for something for so long but it doesn’t go your way
King's Gambling
Queen's Gambit
Gru’s plan: First. I move my G pawn forward 2 spaces so that the bishop can move. I move my F pawn forward 1 space to try to attack the black pawn. The black queen makes me in checkmate-wait! What?
I lost in exactly this way against someone online once. I don't think I've played chess since
Hahahahhahahahaha
When a trash talker plays against a Albert Einstein is grade
I just wasted minutes of my life, dumb, this guy does not even know how to play chess.
He played the only moves that can make him lose in two move, there's no other ways it can happen.
Classic textbook example of what NOT to do.
Ah yes, fools mate.
Obviously scripted
Lol
This looks like a bit. Fake news
Come on dude XD I used to bully my sisters with that move when I was 10, how can you fall for that?
He just froze 💀
Fools mate
Who else is genuinely curious as to what he was trying to do tho
Very good
Oops
Lol this was me
He looks like Zayn from David's blog from the thumbnail
His face is priceless
"Outstanding move"
Minor mistake, it happens.
When you're so bad at chess that you don't even khow why his move was dumb
I've lost that exact same way.
How? I’m actually confused
I am here for her look
Nothing starts with the letter "N" and ends with the letter "G"

Objectively speaking, this seems really staged.

LOL!
Its because he raised a flag, you never say that or its an immediate death flag
I don't know if it has a name in English, but in Italian is the "matto dello scemo" literally "checkmate of the fool"
you coulda made 14 thousand dollars lel
Someone said that Shlatt is still thinking about that chess game
ah, the two move checkmate. my favorite move, but it does take luck to enact

Tje moment she placed the queen i almost died from laughing

Her baffled face though :)

Skill issue
Meanwhile his background says:  *I LOVE CHESS*
I just won a game of chess against my little school kid sister, and I am not so good at chess🧠
The look of defeat is always priceless 😂😂😂
You'll never see it coming
staged
fakes shit ever
Did... did Schlatt just get fool's mated?
bruh soo staged
I can see his brain going "what... huh? how? WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
Wasnt he like super sexist before she challenged him?
why did she win is this somekind of special chess?
I don't know Rick, it looks fake to me.
Well I lost in chess in one move, I moved my king first like an idiot and got checkmated immediately
She did a Queens Gambit quite clever I’d say, especially since Schlatt didn’t see it coming with the pawn in front of the king moved
"She's not gonna see this one coming" Well, he's not wrong...
Gud job
Can someone please explain what happened? I'm not too familiar with chess but I was under the impression your King had to be on the opposite side of the board
Bruh
I like her face when it’s literally like -_-
Wait how did she win I'm no chest expert but don't you have to knock the queen

Dude, this is why you don’t boast.
What da hell
Lol this is so set up. There is only one way to get fool's mate and that is it. Either set up or he just unlucky
Always protect the king. Boi
Famous words before disaster struck: "She is not gonna see this coming."

Litterally a suicide move
I donno Rick - it looks fake. but 14 mln views so whatever...

legend has it that he set the record for the amount of braincells lost in one second
Wait huh? How did she win
Me and a friend of mine managed to lose in the exact same way. XD
Well he's right. She didn't see that coming. And i can't blame her for that.
Dudes worse than XQC
Wait a min was that a hack? 🤔 or a time skip?
This screams scripted lol
This would've been better if it was real

That's Charlie level of outsmarting
Wait, what?
Lazy Mate
*schlatt?*
I always use that move👍👍😁
That’s the tactic I always did.
So, is this in everyone's recommended now?
men are not stupid !1!1!!1!1  men:
Why everyone in the commet section has Anime as there Dp?...
Is He Thought That Was the Queen or Somethin ?
What was he thinking of doing though :/
Did this to my friend we both don’t know how to play and he said no more chess
He exposed his king too early…
its called the fools mate. And for gosh sake respect chess
WHERE IS THE "produced by"
I love the whiteboard behind him saying 'I love chess', I don't think he still loves chess after this defeat
That's the dumbest mistake you will do. (As a chess player)
I can no one eats victory
XD 😂 What a freaking savage! 😆
Her side eye at the end brings everything together just so beautifully.
I don’t know how to play chess can someone explain to me how she won
3 yr old me vs my grandpa
fucking staged
Wjat is the name of tye game
Welp he got mated
The cleanest checkmate I have ever seen
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The clip is Faked but that doesn’t take away from how Comical it is
She’s probably like “thats a rookie mistake”
Famous last words: *whispers “Shes not gonna see this coming!”
That’s the fastest game of chess I have ever witnessed.
gg man
Plot twist: he's actually a simp
When your play is so masterful, both you and your opponent fail to see it coming
Couldn’t he have moved the pawn up twice
I believe that is what’s called a Fools Mate
Fools.
What happend?!?!?
You just gained a sub
Your still bad at that lol im a pro also im like a rookie rank right now so yeah pretty much i won a few ga,es not all thought not all
That’s me whenever I play Chess.
can someone teach me how to play chess 😩
im just as confused as Schlatt, what the heck happened? (i dont know how chess works so can someone give me a simple explanation of what Schlatt did wrong?)
i don’t understand chess so can someone explain this
"She's not gonna see this coming"  The calm before the storm
Lol
Lol
They both dint see that coming
wait how the front door did black wins?
what was he supposed to do?
Gotta love "unscripted moments"
Fun Fact: There is only one way to lose in two moves and my man played it😭😵
I speak for everyone who doesn't know chess.     I don't get it.
It really do be like that
This is an actual checkmate called “Fools mate”. That’s pretty much all you need to know
I didn’t even realize you can lose in two moves, nevertheless be stupid enough to do so
Why is this on everyone's recommendation page after 3 months
lol
This is the first time in my life I’ve ever actually seen anyone fall for the Fool’s Mate. I’m almost impressed.
Schlatt is -iq
Who  the  fuck dont  see this  setup you  dont  have  to know  it  just  open  ur  eyes  and  think  which  turns  are  possible. Has to be fake  no  one  is  so  bad  at chess  hahahah
Schlatt : heh shes not gonna see this coming Losses instantly  Schlatt : ._. Her :.....schlatt?
"She's not gonna see this coming"   No you
His face at the end though 😂
the way he said that 'shes not gonna see this comming ' that to  in shear confidence...O M G Y
😂😂 I've tried this move in mostly all my nerdy friends and most of the time it works but they already know what I'm gonna do so i need new ones
Schlatt was right when he said she's not gonna see it coming...   She didn't see it would end so quickly 😂
Who is the girl???
Mans literally got bodied I wouldve been embarrassed 😭🤚
I think this move is called FOOL'S MATE. Its very rare to see such checkmates.
😂😂😂 look at his face
Every Anime if the MC wasn't dumb
“Insert surprised pickachu face”

One word ( LOL)
BRUH THAT HAPPENS TO ME W MY COUSIN XD
I love the expressions in this clip, even if it's staged😂😂
The moment that his face changed is like ayo what the
This guy looks like shaveer jafry
Staged but still funny
Why did he do that move though?
He fell to the oldest trick in the book 😂😂😂
You cant kill me if I kill myself first
“She’s not gonna see this one coming” Schaltt, seconds before disaster
"She is not gonna see this coming."  I guess Schlatt was right, I mean she wasn't expecting to win so fast.
“....slatt?”
This is so set up its cringe
Please tell me this was a joke 😂
Gosh I feel you dude been through this so many times🤣
No no he didn't lost he is a gentleman, he let her win! What a KING!! 😗
His name "big guy" 💀
shlaat
I think the guy thought the king was actually queen 😂😂😂
I've fallen to a "few move matches" myself. My middle school reading teacher did that against me and for a moment I thought he was a god of chess.
I need an anime editing of this.
fool's mate 😂
I’m still confused what happened
I admit I'm dumb but this.. this is different kind of dumb.
Oof

Who is she?
I m waiting for 3rd move😭
I SAW IT COMINFG
She looks evil
Wow that's faster than a scholar's mate
exactly the opposite of the queen's gambit
lol
She's not gonna see this coming. But, S is silent
You can't lose that fast even intentionally!!
Moment of realization
This is far more tragic than xqc losing in 6 moves
please tell me that move is called Blitzkrieg!
She beat you
“Checkmate.” “I- wait... what?” “Checkmate.” “No I know what you said, just... how?” “BECAUSEICHECKEDYOURMATE”
I like how the videos ends with a word "jschlatt*
This Video is a TOTAL F**king JOKE! Noone would open up their King Side like that! Totally and utterly Ridiculous. Thinks he understands Chess? What a Clown!  Go watch "Queens Gambit" and learn how the real players play. Laughable! It's just Click Bait guys.
Cheater.
I can play better than shclatt
"She's not gonna see this coming"  Me: no, you're not seeing her queen coming.
This is deliberate. Clearly for content. Lame
HA
I love his expression
I legit thought it was chris from mr.beast crew.
I was laughing out so loud in the dinning room, and I was by myself meanwhile my family thought I was going crazy😂🤣🤣
Last call by her is so perfect
"she's not gonna see this comming"  Proceeds to make the objectively worst move in chess
"She's not gonna see this coming" I mean, technically she didn't see that coming like... At all
0:26 Bruhhhhhhhhhh
Dont watch this while eating or you will spit your food out!!!!!
Guy Got An Heart Attack
Play simple chess win simply
he he boi
0:16 manhunt music*  0:24 manhunt music stops*
I’m not a chess player, but how is that a winning move? Is it because her king now has a direct line to his queen?
SO TRASH
She looks BEYOND unimpressed
She's not gonna see this comming. 2s later: surprised pikachu face
poor schlatt but he is really bad for chess 😂😂😂
Who is she? Im a chessplay myself with over 2000 elo
This was staged btw
I really thought this was clickbait
Not even close baby
I wonder what Charlie's reaction
I bet he didn't see that coming
Classic Schlattsky...smh
My man has been frozen since 3 months
I still don't understand why he made this decision, or how the chick in The Queens Gambit didn't lose outright at multiple points. There were 4 times in the show where she made moves that aren't actually legal but no one pays attention to it.   Also, before I get dumbasses saying it's based on a real story AGAIN, for the last time, it's not.
Oh that's a fools mate
Pick up line: Ke2
He did it on purpose
Oh wow. I suck at chess and don't really like playing it (because I suck at chess), but even I can see how this one works.  What I struggle with is "she's not gonna see this coming". Obviously he miscalculated, but was he even _close_ to having something here?
I did this to a guy once. 2 seconds in and we’re sitting there waiting and the guy beside us goes “Are you guys done already? Jesus Christ I don’t wanna vs him next-“
okay...but this was staged AF.
The *I LOVE CHESS :)* at the back tho.
Oh yes the King’s Gambit. A very rare move only a few in the world are able to perform today.
Love the airship fortress theme in the back
If anyone is wondering, its called a fools mate :)
He put himself into that situation tbh
To a woman!
Hhahahahaha
''she's hacking!''
Absolutely terrible at chess. That should be easy to see. Scan the board and think. That was just too bad to not be scripted.
What happened?
teach me teach me im going to be your apprentice of chess
Ou shiet
How did she win I don’t get it
Scripted
Wait......can someone explain to me what just happened
This feels intentional
Fake
If you watch Evan McGaming's introduction of shlatt in rise of manburg, this is so ironic
Wasted in few seconds 😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Loserrrr🤣
Is this real
Um
her face when she realized what he did 😭
You never see it coming~
*YES YES YES YESSSS* ... *NO NO NO NOOOUUEOO*
"Shes not gonna see this coming"  Jshlatt!?@?@??@
What happenend
Me: **skinny dips at the pool**  Everyone at the Nuclear Power Plant: 0:22
I didn't process and understand the game can someone please explain it to me
i am in confusion on how she moved the king so far from it's original position.
He looks like kris from mrbeast
Her face is what kills me. She's like "Dude, really!?" 🤣🤣
Thats a rare checkmate because it barely happened
Can someone tell me which music is in the background pls ? I don’t remember its name 😫
Bro she is pro in both types of game
Quite an old trick either he did it for views or he is just not that good
What? What da ...
How did she win like that  I know nothing about chess
This was planned. No one sets up a 2 move checkmate accidently.
Ah yes. The "oh fuck" technique
LOL
He looks so sad
Oh I Know What He Is  He Is F*ucked, That's what he is
i love the "Schlatt?" at the end
The fuck?
I am here just to say ' outstanding move !'
Well damn LMAO
This is literally the first move taught to beginners to AVOID🤦🏻‍♂️...The two step mate
“She’s not gonna see this one coming” She didn’t see Schlatt giving away the easiest avoidable checkmate.
this killed me lol
Quick! Says It's a Prank!
Wow
*"Schlatt?"*
This was the only combination of moves that allows you to lose in 2 turns
The girls creepy look
Fake and ghey
Idk who this guy is but he reminds me of every cartoon villain who spews nonstop about their "flawless plan" and then regrets it two frames later.
How did she win?
can someone explain how he lost. im so confused
So Fool's Mate is real
*thinks hard* gets checkmated
God damn I actually knew how to play chess as a kid now I don’t remember
**teleports besides you**
World record, losing the game in few moves
Kind of feels a little fake, Blitzkrieg variations are usually easily to spot.
I still don't know what schlatt was trying to do with that move
Me who has no idea how tf chess works and why putting your king there with the other pieces where they were makes you win: 😕
Second season of Queen's Gambit is not looking that good.
Outstanding move
Her face is epic when he moves the second pawn 🤣
It confuses me that he was talking like he was about to use a tried and tested move but what he did is absolutely a surefire way to lose immediately
And I thought scholarsmate was fast.
Wait what happened?
I have no idea how chess works but I’m still impressed
I used to those things when I was 7 years old
Wow yankee with brim
Rookie mistake XD
Surprised I don’t see any comments about the airship fortress music from Mario kart ds in the background
The rabid parent karyologically snore because mercury naturalistically detect since a filthy nation. chemical, overt prison
The face she made at 0:24  Nsjfosoaabgafra😭💀💀💀😂
LMAO!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
he went from: 😁 to: 😧
Schlatt: she's never gonna see this coming Girl: wins Schlatt: *visible confusion*
Why the white one alway go first but not the black one?
Schlatt?
Either he sucks at chess or he’s a French Revolutionist
FAAAAAKE!!!!!!
OOOOOOOOOOH BURN SCHLATTYBOI HAHAHAHAHAAAA
I don’t get it tho
"you said you were going to beat me in chess" "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah just watch. Watch." -Famous last words
I don't know what the fuck just happened.
"She's not gonna see this coming" Famous last words.
"If the king doesn’t move, then his subjects won't follow" -Lelouch Vi Britannia
Playing against the computer in chess be like
I'm confused, how did she win?
Wtf happened lol
He took a bigger L than the dream scripted multiplayer
Lmfao
The guy wanted to lose since the beginning... but his face has no prize 🤣
Holy shit, it took me way too long to recognize that the BGM was from Mario Kart. That was killing me, I couldn't place it.
wait this is staged right? no way this guy legit walked into the fools mate.
This is some bobby fisher sh*t right here
How did she win
The one word she said at the end, knowing that the processing power would be too much in silence alone. That his mind will be too far gone. *"...Schlatt?"*
world record
Pros: Write that down! Write that down!
When she has a rating of 2207 and he himself has a rating of 400...
Lost on purpose though,
Definitely planned out
I once heard a story of a goat man who lost a board game to a human. Is this true?
What a SIMP move.
mans just got foolmate
Is he stupid lol
That's hilarious
This is a certified hood classic
Checkmate
“Shes not gonna see this one coming” task failed successfully
0:22 Schlatt.exe has stopped working
This is such a well known two move checkmate, this video was definitely staged.
Savage level 1000000000
lol
What a dumb move of him
You telling me he didn't see fool's mate...
"...Schlatt?"
Is this the defination of he f**ked up
Him: Man I got this this will be sooooo easy Her: mmhmm, yeah for sure, totally. Him: look at this awesome move I’m making she won’t suspect a thing Her: get wrecked scrub   BOTH OF THEIR FACIAL EXPRESSIONS THE ENTIRE TIME JUST SEND ME😂
That's actually the fastest way to lose in chess, there isn't a faster one, that's not pog
He said “get the bishop out.” Heh heh.
Shlatts face: >:} 1.5 seconds later: |:( ...
*confused unga bunga noises*
Fool              's mate
John.exe has broken
'I'm just gonna play simple chess'
The way his face started with a grin and turned into a shocked face is dead funny to me
Fuck, I think I processed what happened faster then schlatt--
She's just so hilariously unamused.
he tried to troll her
„She‘s not seeing this coming“ beautiful last words before disaster.
CLAPPED
Schlatt?
:0
Dude I blasted lol
"Curb your meme" outro should have been added.
im rewatching this video and my next ad is a "learn to play chess" ad LMAO
He looks so dead after LMAO
Schlatt should collab with big guy     Someone already made this joke I think
Anyone else think the white board said “I love Cheese” anyone?
Lmao
Who's schlatt?
Bruh queen and king should look different they both have crowns
I don't know what happened even
gg
I know nothing about chess. So can somebody who does tell me how she won?
New world record
Me: This gonna be easy Chess master in disguise: and I took that personal!
Schlatt?
Schlatt?
0:24     When the chaos demon kicks in
Wait so if I did what she did I would win every time?
This is me whenever I try to play chess.
“Flat”
this was clearly staged
Testing 123
I just love that mood drop after he realised he lost
"She's never gonna see this coming"  *"You fell for it, fool! Thunder Cross split Attack!"*
The fact that he could not have possibly done worse
That was too fast!
Such a funny moment ...     it would be if it wasn't staged.
The look of confusion and disgust on her face when Schlatt makes the last move was almost too good to be true.
How is that name in the title pronounced? My German is really bad.
The oldest move in the chess book
as soon as she moved i knew what he was gonna do lmaooo schlatt u poor thing
"Hey Shitass, wanna play chess?"
"Schlatt?"
That face is awesome at the end hahahaha
*insert acting at home joke*
This shit has to be fake right
Dude he really looks like shaveer jafry
this situation is literally the description of *"holy music stops"*
I actually won twice in this fashion. The first time I didn't even realize it right away.
I still don't understand what happened
EZ
He lost brain cells trying to understand what was happening lmao !!
I just started playing chess online and for some reason I understand why he lost
Theres a reason its called the "fools mate"
0:23 her face was like "did he just seriously do that?"😂
I play this
That’s Me after the Damage had been done
Is it just me or are all of you idiots that wasn’t a check mate first the king can only move one space at a time and second that put his queen in danger not his king. I don’t understand how this was a check mate
If he didnt move that move she could have defeated him by 4 moves
*”She’s not gonna see this coming”* Top 10 moments before disaster
Imma beat you in chess  2 moves later  NANI?
Stal intensifies
I don't understand Chess at all. What in the world kind of move was that?🤔🧐🥰 Must remember the pattern. Now I can be a chess master too. 🥴
This moment when you freeze but your brain dont know why 😄
THE POWERPLAY
whats the background song
I don’t even know what happened but that was cool
Deadass got a Fool's Mate, one of the rarest things you can get  Bruh
This is hilarius
What is her name Just asking fir a friend
aren't that fool's mate move?
Lmaooo
I need to do that, when my dad and I are playing chess the next time...
How does the king move that many spaces in one turn hello??
My man’s brain just went on airplane mode
Why was Michael Jackson terrible at chess? He couldn't decide if he was black or white.
LOl
how did she even get that checkmate anyways?
youll never see it cooomiiiiiiiiiing!! You'll see that my mind is, too fast for eeeeyeees!! that song of persona 5 would go so well with this clip
And that is a perfect example of the Fool's Mate.
no way this happened
Bro I was litterally laughing my ass off
Nooo, not fools checkmate... nooo
🤣🤣🤣
AHHAAHAHHAHAHAAHAAAHAHAHHHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHHHAHAAHHAAHHAHHAHHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHHAHAHAAAHAHHAHAHAHAAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHHAHAHAHA    LOOOOL GET REKT
What he didn't know is that she was the inventor of Chess.
Legends say he's still in confusion about what happened that day.
Next episode its gonna say i hate chess
Is this staged or real lmao its hilarious
Stop set up this things, i cant enjoy any of botez clips anymore, just awful
That’s why you always play a bot.
🤣🤣
He literally did the Fools Opening
He was right she didn't see this coming
And that's my boy was his last game ever
*Literally 20 seconds before* "You said you were going to bet me at chess-" "Yeah I know, watch!"
Classic. Queen is op if ur dumb
Someone draw a Think, Mark, Think version of this
Schlatt really lagged bad out there
He let her win because she's 🔥 So this guy therefore made the right moves 😂 😂 😂 😂
Damn same happened to me
that was halarious
that look at the end
you have the bad luck, bro
This is so staged that it's not only unfunny - it literally hurts.
Schlatt one second later: *unfortunately, schlatt stopped thinking*
✝️Im not trying to be a spammer or force my religion,✝️but we are in the end times right now✝️you see all over social media its a trend to worship the devil✝️and people think its a party in hell✝️,but its not you will be in unbearable pain for all of eternity✝️please before its to late turn to God build a relationship with him repent from your sins✝️ask God for forgiveness, and know that✝️Jesus loves you,he died for you accept him into your heart✝️and as your lord and savior✝️and you will have eternal life with him✝️Thank you for reading.✝️ Romans 10:9 that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved;
my empathy is with you as i got checkmate by my little bro in same way
Her beginning move was a classic (if he didn’t move that pawn she’d win in maybe 3 or 4 moves
Battler vs Beatrice be like
That was staged lol
This man is why someones should t play chees
She didnt see it coming but she got the dub
Did someone say "BLINDSIDED"
_He maybe bad at chess , but_ ,  _good at getting views_ *Keep the video short & title catchy*
Also if anyone starts saying they are just doing a random basic move or they start fiddling with or looking at pieces on a certain side of the board ...they are trying to cover up an important move ...check the whole board
He is honestly the worse chess player I've ever seen, this has to be a set up ... There is no way anyone would move those pawns at that stage of the game to expose the king like that ... It's not getting any dominating pieces out. Tbh in all my years ive never known about this move ...this has to be fake ...it just has to ... No way he's learnt how the pieces move and then done this...... No way ...just no way ..seriously ....
chest
That girl has the best expressions. Love that ❤️😂
fool's check
Schlatt is probably going to burn the sign in his background after this
What I don’t know what happened
I saw that coming...
I like the look of the girl after she won. She looks satisfied 😅😂
The past entrance inferiorly connect because column descriptively transport alongside a colorful boat. rural, curious community
She did see it
Her face when she saw his second move 🤣
lol
You should not play chess anymore!
Ma'am,I am sorry but,your husband died in the war,his last words was"she's not gonna see this coming
Obviously this was fixed. That was such a rookie move
Wait what im confused how
I’m not sure but I think schlatt did that on purpose for a joke
There is no way this wasn't a joke that is the one known fastest checkmate to all chess players
Am I missing something here? But, last time I checked the King can only move one space at a time and not diagonally. Unless she was moving the queen piece and I'm mixed up. Are they playing a different version of chess?
LOL
Ur such a dissapointment           (joke btw and i idk how to type dissapointment idk lol)
That was planned lol
DISTRUCTION 100
Is this dude a reposter for instant money or is he an official channel?
La sua facci alla fine
ah i knew he lost it when he moved his pawn to 3  like thats the old speedrun trick i used to do
Chess players seeing this *She did the oldest trick in the book*
Literally every girl outsmarting a guy ever
I think he did it on purpose
That was the fastest "😁 -> 😐" ever
amar opening is the worse especially on that variation
“She’s not gonna see it coming”  Schlatt 2021
Man why you open king defense
Oh no the confidence is cringe
Every chess player has gone through this at least once
I think I can beat jhslaat now
0:16 How *her* face transform.
Lol I also did the same with my cousin few years ago
Wow . He is just acting everyone understood.
This is what overconfidence leads to 😂
LMFAO  in my school back in like middle school ppl use this strategy alot
Rip
Fool, I can die in one move! *BY FLIPPING THE TABLE!!*
overconfidence is as deadly as arrogance
you guys know this is staged right?
Lmao
Surely he did that on purpose there’s no way someone can actually be that bad at chess
I don’t play chess. How did he lose?
Fun fact: They talked more than they played.
I have done that SO many times its not even funny.
Hey wha happen?
Nice vid
the exact same thing happened to me on my 1st chess tournament i joined, she was cute 😂
Definitely staged
Schalt-
He looks like chris from Mr beast.
fake
Bro u lost from miss universe don't be sad  😂🤩
That was a joke. Right?
She: "Omae wa mou shindeiru" He: "Na...             ......Ni?"
chess moment
You mean four moves
well i guess he wasnt wrong when he said she isnt gonna see it coming
LOL a face of shame 0:22
"shes not gonna see this coming"     *Hes not gonna see her coming*
Ähm i See hes very Good at this game
I love the desperate "schlatt?" at the end
He’s sexist and he got the result
Wait i still done see how she won that
That guy is a savant! ♟
fake poo
That is legitimately sad
Who is she?
Schlatt: OvO Everyone: —<– LoL
My guy, those are the 2 moves you should never do as white
im still kinda confused that how he lost
This is the chess board equivalent of getting bent over and ...
From the thumpnail i thought it was chris from mrbeast
More like: She'll definitely see this coming
I meant he was right with the "she's not gonna see this coming" Part, why? She didn't expected him to lose
She probably didn't see that coming.
He just got wrecked
My uncle did this to me when I was like 6-7 years old and still learning how to play chess.
0:17 just take a look at her face, she is like wtf this dude doing
Yeahh as if this wasn't scripted just to get some views
He was just being a nice guy...
In the game of chess, you can never let your adversary see your pieces.  -Zap Branigan
Wow😂
Is he stupid? or It was an intentional loss?
The I love Chess at the background may need to be changed...
At least he won the interior battle.
F
This is...this was staged right?
Doesn't the piece that checks the king have to be right next to the king to checkmate? Because that queen was nowhere near the king.
That girl is like : duh
I was speechless idk how to play the game but that is GG
So fun fact, I played a chess match against a GM and I barely qualify as a rookie. I lost the same way. It was a nice learning moment for me, though.
Why'd you open your defense with the king nowhere to run like that? 😭😂✌
"shes not going to see this coming". the Universe responded "you sure bud?"
Quits chess after this 🤣

this is like john sedwick saying "they couldnt hit an elephant at this distance" and then getting shot 2 seconds later
staged
Fool's mate lemao
Legends know this was planned😎
I think he confused the King for the Queen...
Funny part was she was going for 4-Move checkmate, but got something better 😂😂😂
relatable
Link to full videos plis
This was recorded on January 1st 1999.   Johnathan Schlatt was not the same after that moment.
the "she's not gonna see this one coming" is killing me because at that point even if she doesn't bring her queen out there's no moves on the board for him anyway
He be lagging irl
Schlatt.exe has stopped working
Human
Staged
L
Yes
😹😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Fool’s Mate.
Nerds at my school really said there are only 4-move check-mates.
0:26                              Schlatt
Just a woman being woman
0:23 "Who said I would be playing simple?"
Well... You win some, you lose some...
LOL
Why’d it end he could of castled
Staged as fuck yet people still buy it...
Lol HAHAHAHAHAHA
Chess losing speedrun
the rewatchability of this video is unbelievable
i love her face when she did that move like "yes right into my palm you go"
Can someone explain to me what happened? I never played chess or know what the rules are so I’m confused
After the video: deletes his board and writes "i hate chess"
GUH
This is so fake
The queen's Gambit
His reaction was absolute perfection 👌 Man I’m dying 🤣🤣🤣
Schlatt: They call me a madman
"Schlatt?" Schlatt: *suprised pikachu face*
0:22 wasted
That silence 😂😂😂
as soon as he moved the second pawn the queen was like *for free?*
Come on dude this is so staged
That was disgusting I can't stop laughing
My dude was literally the loading cat meme 😂
0:18 is the exact moment she knew hes a goner
fun fact: alex botez was going to only use four move to win
best
.......                            schlatt?
That's fool mate you basically just destroy your opponent's career after this.
Schlatt.exe has stopped working.
“She’s not gonna see this coming” *giggles*  Aaaaaaaand that’s Fools Mate.  Guess he was quite the “fool.”
Me in a nutshell but its school edition.
I did almost exactly this many years ago in middle school. It remains the only chess victory I have, and was the last chess game I ever played, lol. I am technically undefeated!
I'm so confused
I believe the term for what just happened is called Fool's Check.  Because unless it's intentional, only a fool would be hit by this.
"she's not gonna see this one coming" famous last words
His expression is too convincing
I'm confused but  got the spirit -shlatt and me
Wait but technically he won though cuz isn't it his turn. And he kills her?
I bet this is just all planned out, the man can’t be that stupid.
Outstanding move!
LOL
That's what he gets for not using the Tennison Gambit with an ICBM
Lol
It was all acting, meh '-'
his face doe
His reaction xD
Even I know not to move the end pawns out first, it's the quickest way to lose.  Another way to lose  is by not taking your time and moving quickly.
I dont know how to play sooooooo
the look on her face when he moved his second piece
As you see folks this is the reason I don’t play chess
“She’s not gonna see this one coming”  -top 10 videos before disasters
...Shlatt?
Uh...I don't know how chess works, can somebody please explain what the frick just happened?  XD
what confuzzels me is that is that what he was trying to plan -a 1200 rated player
The look he gave tho  It just went from, hahahah to instant w-what?😨
"I'm gonna beat you in chess" *Are u sure about that*
This is staged
Funny thing is 3 months ago xqc lost a chess game in 3 moves, this one kinda look staged. I mean ofcourse it is ...who am I kidding
...How bout we go back to checkers Schlatt.
Schlatt has joined me in the afterlife pogchamp
She fucking murdered him LMAOOO
I think this is fake
La bergerite aiguë ! Elle l'a choppé aussi XD
To be fair, i didn't see that coming
Incredible. In the span of just 27 seconds Jchlatt used all 5 of his brain cells for that clever play.
Game lasted longer than sex would have with her.
Hey man
This reminds me of 'UMINEKO NO NAKU KORO NI'😂
Lmfao
IMPOSSIBLE NO ONE CAN DEFLECT EMERALD SPLASH
Schlatt this is basic shit I can lose in one round without even trying.
I love how he says that she's not going to see it coming.
OK
I love chess :)
Can someone explain what happened here to someone who doesnt know shit about chess
0:26 me seeing my 6/5 year hardcore disapearing for no reason
0:26 me wondering how the fuck last boss killed me
0:23 teacher staring into my soul when im trying to act like im not on the lessom
This is me and my dad
Big Brain & Bruh moment
schlatt.exe has stopped working
"Schlatt?"
At that exact moment, his heart stopped beating
I have no idea how to play chess and I have no idea how she won but what I do know is that this is hilarious
This is one of those moments when you legitimately question your own intelligence
When I was in college we all watched one of the students run into this exact same scenario with one of the teachers after talking shit over a zoom call and it was the funniest shit
never seen someone this dumb
What website are they playing on?
The queens gambit, a very good move lol
i don't think i've seen someone actually fall for a fool's mate before
This video is as fake as "reality" shows.  *But so many of you think it's legit. lmao
Schlatt: she won't see this coming Also Schlatt: doesn't see _that_ coming
Well I mean she technically didn't c it coming for all the wrong reasons imao.
Lame
*confused screaming
The spicy desire conceptually miss because heaven resultspreviously scrape qua a awake sack. square, quixotic nerve
My man just got an Error 404
You cant lose at chess, if you have no king.
Unfortunately this is literally how guys are in chess against female players
Bro I recognise the music from a mariokart 7 level on my 3ds
"im gonna release my bishop" *locks it with the next move* me: oof this is acted shit
The way she- ahhhhh
Yeah, that's how it goes everytime I play against... everytime I play chess.
The teeny sunflower anatomically bounce because mother-in-law isely clear with a wretched withdrawal. talented, first airplane

An ally has been slain.
That's why i hate mobile chess apps, they warn the other of potential wins like this
"Schlatt?"
was dis scripted?
I never knew you could do that
Well, he got fools mated.

Ahh the good ol' "I'm not as smart as I thought" moments... I had one of those just today.
My sister has lost in 2 moves before too. It was the funniest thing ever and she refused to play with me again for months 😂
It was the fools mate. Simple but very effective
The elfin scale postauricularly cheer because balinese echographically stain down a flimsy decimal. crazy, delicious asia
Him:she's never gonna see this one coming The girl:I'm about to ruin this whole man's career
Me everytime i play chess
Wait how
Clearly all scripted but still pretty funny.
Looks like we found the true final boss of chess ♟
How did she beat him so fast?
I lost it when he said while smiling "shes not gon see this coming" Immediately into a surprised face 😃
That was a fast game...
Saw it coming all the way
i was laughin so hard i see schaltt face xd
How can you move the king like that the king can only move one space and a pawn and can only move forward and make a move diagnal or forward
Chocky milk makes the pain go away :)
Planned as F. Well done demonstrating the 2 move mate. :)
He could have castled
When you don’t play chess so you don’t know how Schlatt lose
Am I the only one who knows this move?
I changed my comment so you’ll never know how I got so many likes
This was clearly a skit
He could of took that out with his pawn
When you realize comment section is so hot.. You can't even add your comment.
On his whiteboard it says I love chess it should say  I am bad at chess.
Take your time with him, buddy is a Yankees Fan. Go Rays!
lmfao
There was nothing to be heard Only wheezes and laughs over that dumb move
You can pinpoint the moment his heart breaks in half
The way she just stares in disbelief trying to figure out if she's seeing everything correctly when he placed that pawn i can't-
The reaction of guys 🤣🤣🤣
You should stick to checkers, no actually tiddly winks.
Schlatt teaches us how to lose a chess game in 2 moves
Chess is a awesome game I played it a lot it’s fun
destroyed in seconds
Must’ve tried to impress her
This must've been staged
Xqc would be so proud
Wtf I thought he was chris from Mr beast😂
Fun fact!! If you are a noob like me, never put up any pawn other than the one above the king. Only if the opponent is just a few levels higher than you or same as you. If your opponent is a pro, then just pray you get lucky like this.
Literally every chess pro player when they see Schlatt make that 1 mistake: U donkey
Honestly wondering, what was Schlatt trying to do with that move?
ngl i thought this was clickbait
And this is what we call in my language a dumb check mate  (Yes it is true)
My dad plays the exact chess game literally every day XD
Legends say that he is still thinking about his defeat.
This happens when u take someone 2 lightly.
This is Naruto if he actually went full out on enemies ( *cough* DELTA) instead of stretching his fights with slow Taijutsu lmao
Schlatts : [Visible Confusion]
For anyone who doesn't know a lot about or lack knowledge about chess, this is the incredibly basic yet incredibly sadistic fool's mate used on either beginners or people who to think way to hard, it requires the person to finish the match in the fewer possible moves, this right here is the exact example of a fool's mate, doing a google search will show this exact scenario and he fell for it (lol) but you can't blame him
The heady snowplow globally bang because crime unsurprisingly reach notwithstanding a alert nitrogen. sloppy, scrawny quilt
Reminds me of my childhood when I beat my teacher with this move 😂😂😂
what she did is called fools mate in chess(seriously)
The moment he moved the first pawn…. His faith was sealed. Then on the second pawn, he acknowledged and wanted a fast death. She is Queen’s Gambit reincarnate. XD.
This is worse than xqc who loss in 6 games OMEGALUL Clap
Proto noob
Lol, even Alexandra was like *it's free real estate*
Omg his soul 😭😂
A better script than Bollywood films
i wouldve waited a while stalling until he realised
Is this real? XD
Man, to ever achieve 2 move checkmate was such a rare occassion lol
Professionals call it "the King's Gambit".
I wanna play against schlatt now XD
*Schlatt.*
“Schlatt?”
Her: "Schlatt?"  🗿😂
First tip for chess: Always control the Middle 4 squares
This guy is good
Jesus is coming
sus
Hes confidence went 100% to 0%
Btw in chess that called fools mate, losing to it is like losing to a totorial level in a video game,
did schlatt just inted?
Vishwanathan sir would have done in one step
I'm a little confused how moving her queen there let her win. Edit: I retract this statement. This makes perfect sense to me now.
I mean... she didn't see it coming  Frankly, neither did he

This man just compromised his entire future.
Shlat losser
Eww that's gotta hurt......
He was so positive until he got the uno reverse card
He must have quit chess and ripped the poster in the back before uploading the vid
the bgm gives so much nostalgia!❤🔥
Ahahahahahhahhhha noob.
Schlatt: She's not gonna see it coming Me after he gets mated: she certainly didn't
Ahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahaaha
this looks like a setup to me
Its called foolsmate that move doesnt come so often and it only works on black
Lmao
Lol
he looked absolutely dumbfounded
that's a checkmate he still has a chance to avoid it
It was all fun and games until Schlatt loses in 2 moves.
the way she says schlatt and schlatt stares is ... no words
His face at the end is priceless
the long pause LOL see and all these Beta males say Women cant be gamers she just rekt his ass lol
"Those who believe and get baptized will be welcomed who don't will get away" Mark 16,16
Lol
F
He be distracted
Alright I am gonna ask the question, how did he lose? (Explain with detail please)
That face he got after losing is priceless
I got to say, she definately did not see that comin'
_Life be like:_
"Now the old king is dead, long live the queen!"
Hes just buffering give him a couple minutes
Losing to girl
Deym
Know that trick
Alternate title: How to win a chess match in two steps
I will try to explain this in the way i could understand it (what i say may not be correct): Schlatt was trying to go for the 4 move checkmate but Alex predicted it and did some kind of 4 move checkmate counter and won in 2 moves. I am not 100% sure but this is what i think happened
schlatt i'm sorry dude
Watching schlatt get destroyed = amazing
Top 10 shocking death in anime history
Knowing that I would probably do what schlatt did doesn't make me any more confident about the amount of braincells I have
he could've still put his Queen before the king right?
sure no acting , 100% true and they was not speak about it before . sure
what if he got a world record XD
me listening to "approach" from jojo in the background: outstanding move..
Schlatt is the one who didn't see that coming
That happend to me
i am Random Person
That *must've* been staged! That is literally the only way to checkmate someone in two moves!
Hahahahahaha lol
I have also win in 2 moves 👍👍😎😎
Rofl
How ????
You can see in his face that his IQ is getting drained trying  to understand what happened
:)
İs it the new world record
Just for this damn video imma try and read a whole book about chess no joke. By “a whole book” I mean a YouTube video explaining how to win chess and how to play it. Cuz I have no idea what the f*ck I’m doing
Her face literally screams "bruh"
i love people who don't know chess
Easy win.
Lol
Is he dumb? Why did he do that? Don’t just compare someone to an ai and think before you move that’s how chess works it takes strategy now his king don’t have an escape patch🤦‍♀️
Ahh I remember in middle school in the competition where I got completely dominated by that move
how did he lose doe
LOL
LoL 💀
Wait..ish possible?
And this is why i will never play chess on stream

His face went from Imma mop the floor with ya to how the fk is that even possible
cant you get out of that? like if you haven’t moved certain pieces you can switch your king with your rook or something
Legend says, he's still processing
Men...
This is so embarrassing to watch
404 EROR
The tacit occupation continuously ruin because cent spontaneously delay of a highfalutin ikebana. plastic, probable hedge
This is like Persona 5 because she definitely didn't see that coming
Bruh wth happened 🤣😂
That is literally like the only sequence of moves that can end in you losing in two moves but I don’t think she even realized what happened
I don't play chess, how tf did she do that? XD
Damn
"You fail" *booing in the background*
Ok now I’m confused. How tf does chess even work?
Last words: *laughs*
Well, to be fair, she actually didn't see it coming.
The face when he realized he lost was golden
Me before watching this: you can't win chess two moves in! Me after watching this: oh.
The way his face went 😦 That’s what I call instant karma 😂
Someone explain plz I know nothing about it
Schlatts face when he got checkmated was so funny
I've literally seen this happen to 1000's of people OK only 2 but its cool I can recognise chess games right?
Lol what a dunce move. Good on her!
The face of judgement
Lol
Fastest game of chess ever?
It was at this moment that he knew he fucked up 0:22
She won't see this fucking coming. A few seconds later... She saw it fucking coming.
fool's mate
Can someone please explain to me how she won?
"Schlatt?"
Lololol
I like her facial expression lol
This would be way better if this was in anime
Fool’s mate indeed.
Didn't even know you could lose in two moves
Schlatt.exe has stopped responding
Dang schlatt is good
"Shes never going to see this coming."  Well, she didn't. She didnt expect him to hand over the game
He was actually right...She....did not see that coming....
He still plays chess better than me...
bruh
Hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhujhjhjbhjbjbjjbhhhhhhhhhhhhhh hihiihiihihihhuhuhuhuuhhihjjjjuohu
i love the other persons expression as soon as schlatt makes the worst move ever
Lol
First of all, 2 moves is the fastest game possible. You can’t end a game in a single move. Second of all, I’m pretty sure he basically did it in the only way you can. You have to start by moving the first white pawn moved into the spot he moved it to, because if he either didn’t move it or moved it one space less it would be able to block the queen (by either already being there or being able to be moved there next move). The only other possible fastest games are if the 1st black pawn had been moved only 1 space forward, or the 2nd white pawn moved had been moved 2 spaces forward (or obviously both of these extra scenarios happening at once).
This has got to be like the world record for losing in chess.
"... Shlatt?" *silence*
this is so staged. But it worked for him, 12M views
“Schlatt?”  Always gets me
Candy Crush 2 moves left be like:
There’s no way he didn’t look up how to loose chess in two moves that’s the best part
He literally fell for the oldest trick in the book...
i commend schlatt for intentionally losing a game of chess and making it that fucking funny
Fool's Mate
*sad twerking*
Ve biz buna aptal matı diyoruz.
U arent supposed to move that second to last piece first or the second one
Epic Fail
So people actually fall for the fools mate?
This is called a fools mate.
I know how he feels
He fell for Fools Mate, nice.
Wait I thought you loose if your king dies   EDIT: Bruh I’m stupid
Lol. he was thinking (wtf just happen)😂😂😂👍👍👍
I haven't played chess in years, someone please explain what just happened
LMFAO
I wonder what he was trying to do lol
0:24 when your crush say she love you too
Schlatt : 👁️👄👁️ Her : ➖〰️➖
👁👄👁
Classic
I think thats the only way you can lose in 2 turns, I also think thats the fastest way you can lose
XQC got nothing on this guy.
u have to be really stupid to lose like that
Just the title  is enough to make me laugh🤣
My gosh....his reaction like what just fcking happened 😲
She's also smart
i wish i understood what was going on so i could laugh a little harder
Pov: You never learnt chess and don't know what happened
I've made this mistake before, and my dad is a master, winning awards in college, so he made me PAY.
0:20 *(Last Surprise starts playing)*
*Wow, this guy's worse than my dad*
The king can't move out of the trail lol
I thought i was very bad at chess Then i saw this guy😄
how did she even win?
I think it was an foul play
I mean she technically didn't see it coming
I mean he was right she didn’t see that coming
You once my cousing wone a game of chess in 5 moves now THIS IS ON ANNOTHER LEVEL
This is way too dumb to lose.. 😂😂
Chotto matte
lol so funny
Now I finally know how to win in chess!
I knew he was gonna lose when I saw his first move ...
HAHAHAHHAHAAHHAHAAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA
we didnt even reach the climax
“She’s not gonna see this coming”  Well, he’s not wrong
Schlatt?
watch, watch, watch
Keep
He just wanted to do a funny bit, and knew how to lose the quickiest to make it even funnier. This just proves he is a genius at chess.
Finally, a worthy rival to xqc
Once I saw she opened the queen I knew she gonna pull the 3 move checkmate
This is literally in school.. the one student who doesn't review and the other one who study allnight and who doesn't study gets the highest score, LOL.
She definitely didn't see that one coming.
Rookie move XD
fools mate
He lost the game in the quickest way possible its basically impossible to do that unironically
definitely faked it
at the speed of light
World record bitch.
"heh heh heh, She'll never see this coming."  moves pawn to F3 *youre right she didnt see this coming*
Botez was clearly cheating, they didn't show it in the video but that is a 100% accuracy game.  (This is a joke and is not intended to be taken seriously)
"Plot twist: she's the ai on Chess"
its almost like planned... right?
I'm gonna bet 100 dollara that schlatt actually did this on purpose
kim ty jesteś rudy
0:22 it was at this moment he knew, he f*ked up!
I don't know how chess works at all but wow schlatt really fucked that one up huh
Hahahaa
You watched this more than ones.
Wait what. I don't know how to play chess so can someone tell me how did she win?
Two man move I know the counter
oh
🤦‍♂️
Taking "Let her win" to the next level
Scripted as fuck jesus at least try to hide it.
Wow, I didn’t think the Fool’s Mate would ever happen
How are all of these from schaltts perspective he hasn’t streamed on twitch in over a year where does he stream?
Believe in Jesus Christ and you will be saved, John 3:16, KJV...
Bad
Jesus Christ, even I, a complete chess noob, have known that 2-moves win strat since I was 10.
He said he will beat her 😂
I love how he moved G4 to get his bishop out and the very next move he did was to completely block his bishop.
He was correct: She did not see that coming.
Fools mate lol
12M views holy shit
***stupid schlatt***
*dumb schlatt*
As a wise cop once said, "Sometimes, in order to win at chess, you need to sacrifice your king"
LMBO
Well that escalated quickly
I barely understand the rules of chess but even I could see that one coming
Internet is forever
Waiting for the  "oNLy lEgeNdS kNoW tHE NaMe WAs cHAngED"
*the fact that he has "i love chess :)" in the background and still loses in the easiest way possible is depressing*
You should really go back to watching Howcast even they have more knowledge
Ah yes, the Schlatt opening.
When you love chess but chess don't love you.
His face went from '😆' to '😦' instantly. 😂
Kings sacrifice to develop bishop 😂🙌
Damn. definitely did not happen to me (sarcasm)  We called it 4 moves.
what the fuck just happend?
Bruh I saw that move coming a mile away
Pov:You clicked this thinking it was Sapnap
Fun fact: That is the fastest ways to lose in chess
I do this to my brother all the time and he still falls for it
is that a win or lose?
schlatt is racist <3
"she's not gonna see this coming"  I don't think you did either, Schlatt
One day. His brain stopped working.
Gente el jujalag ingles 😲
Lol, that face tho
Bruh I didn't even know it was possible to get checkmated in 2 moves XD If I intentionally wanted to lose, I'd always lose by 3 moves.
so I'm guessing he confused king and queen
This is why i play tic tac toe
‘Schlatt?’
0:15 I safe you 12 seconds 😂
andrea would of set the house on fire 🔥
I love how I was able to pull the fool’s mate off after watching this video    But I hate how shortly after, I got checkmated with the queen and bishop move, t w i c e b y t w o d i f f e r e n t p e o p l e (I learned how to counter and prevent it though)
schlatt: @-@ The Girl: ■-■
Thomas had never seen such bullshit
*Outstanding Move*
Did this man really just blunder fools mate?
Fool’s mate lol
Hey this tops the Charlie xqc match lmao
And this is LITERALLY the fastest checkmate move they teach you to avoid, look at her face, she knows
Am I right
this guy looks like Chris from mr.beast
Haha, I think he willingly moved that way, cuz  no one opened the game like that ever 😂😂😂
Man he F****D out
Schlatt?
LMAO
scripted
"She'll never see this coming" *proceeds to immediately lose*
In chess that’s called the fools mate, no joke
When a side character acts like a main character..ಥ‿ಥ
She is beautiful ❤️
ohhhhhhh my god
Lol that's a fools checkmate
Never thought I would see a Fool's Mate
After She won the chess against Big Guy Big Guy: *My life is meaningless...*
I love how his expression just changes in a split second
"schlatt..."
lol
Makes me laugh all the time :DDD
thE KiNg sAcrIfCe
I love how he wrote I love chess :) on the board and got destroyed in 2 moves
It was staged
His face
She hustled you really well.
Bru!
OOF
Literally gave her the Napoleon on a silver platter...
He still questions his whole existence up until now.
Shlatt.exe has stopped responding.  Would you like to reboot?
That was scripted
Top ten moments before disaster:
おまわもしんでる
"She's not gonna see this one coming"  That means two things 😏
If you look closely, you can see his brain rage quiting
lol
Thats A world record folks to lose a game of chess and have instant regret!! GIVE IT UP FOR JSCHLATT!!
Love his face from 😁🤔 to 😦
Him: ahehehehe she's not gonna see this  Her: checkmate  Him: 😦
Lol
Happened to me once
this is the most    "get shit on you are ass"  moment ever
That smug face gives so much aura
This 27  second taught me many things than i could have ever learnt this fkin 17 years.
Obv fake
Almost as gay as fake
The way Alex moves her head forward like “is this mf for real” right before she wins is priceless
This is the moment when Schalatt rage quits at chess
I did this before seeing this video
That girls is pretty 😍
processing...
:(
He's still processing..leave him alone
So what will be the next "interesting" game that "everyone" will watch? Tic Tac Toe?
The fact that he said he wanted to develop his bishop but then immediately blocks it in cracks me up nearly as much as him losing.
Schlatt...?
0:14 she’s not going to see this one coming Her: Literally uno reverses him Him: processing error 01
He legit just went from 😃 to 😦
World Record!
There’s no way this wasn’t planned
Nice :)
If my memory correct, i remember this guy running a country
Schlatt
Real pros sacrifices their king to win
Me: knowing well the fried liver attack requires minimum of 4 moves to checkmate The Title: *"...in 2 moves...."* Me: *What*
Ever heard of Scholar's mate?  Now that should be named Scholar's Suicide
King sacrifice to take the queen, what a guy
it's like his face was   what!? Shit
Don't lose to a woman.
"schlatt..?"
My IQ dropped by 20 pts after seeing this move, I'll have learn all the openings over again.
RIP 😂.
She did not in fact see that coming
This is staged though, right?
He spoke to soon
"Sometimes, in order to win at chess, you have to sacrifice your king." -Jake Peralta
He definitely did that for the content
Wait wtf, that should be the king. Messed up shit
Not to be rude but this is the funniest shit I’ve ever seen Plus I love how she looked at it for a sec like “did he actually just-“
Now onwards, this mate will be known as "Schlatt's mate"
Ben Finegold viewers are crying in physical pain
"She's not gonna see this coming"  The mission successfully failed
"shes not gonna see this coming"  the problem is you aren't either
A beautiful king sacrifice from Schlatt!
0:22 his face just screams “d..uhh..II..hmm”
He say that he love chess. Well,say that again.
LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
THIS IS THE FUNNIEST SHIT IVE EVER SEEN IN A WHILE
I know this tactic but it only works if the opponent places his pawns in certain ways
I don't know anything about chess, can someone explain for non-chess players?
This has like the slightest tinge of misogyny in it
lol on you
ok im a beginner at chess entirely and it took me a whole day to figure out how she won easily, so to anyone who doesn’t know abt chess heres what happened:  schlatt moved his other pawn to leave his king exposed, so botez moved her queen to that spot, resulting an instant win bc there was no other pieces schlatt could use to cover his king. if you aren’t aware, the queen can move at all directions, including diagonaly. fools mate basically.
"Windows had stopped working"
I love schlatt because he's smart enough to do stuff like this. This was very intentional and also very funny.
And they live happily ever after..  Imagine making a woman lose 😂
Idk, I find it hard to believe this is real.
thats a fool's mate
I also won by this many many times and I have only 600 rating😅
“The Dream SMP was all just a game of chess for power and the people and nations were the pawns to Schlatt.”                          — EvanMCGaming
Honestly I didn't even realize that it's possible to checkmate in 2 moves
Pure silence and humiliation at the end. Brilliant 😂😂
That's *'Im gonna end this man's whole career'* in real life right there.
"King Sacrifice" BOLD MOVE
He even laughs at her expressions after playing second move😂
And they say breakup hurts
She's so beautiful 😍
CURB YOUR CHESS OPENING
The sudden change of emotions was so quick
Fool's mate.
He like: hehehehehe-👁👄👁
😆
She really did not expect that
What app is this
Did this once but was on the winning end. Accidentally of course. A kid wanted me to teach him to play chess so I helped him. His opponent moved a piece, then I told him to move a piece, then when it was out turn again I had realized we had already won
lol
In Germany we call that Narrenmatt
Her: "Wait, what?" Him: "Wait, what?"
LMAO 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The smiley face in the background makes me feel even more sad for him tbh
"Shes not gonna see this coming," Shlatt said.
Lol thought it was real..
Wait how did he lose?
Is there some trend on playing chess?
So he got himself in a fools mate and if u got that, then u should stop playing chess.
Got to love the classic fools mate
XD
Me playing with my dog be like
King sac to develop the bishop. Beautiful game.
I beated my mother in chess the same way he got beaten lmao
Schlatt.exe has stopped responding
Schaltt.exe stopped working
Ok I really want to know what he was trying to do.
0:23 that damn eyeroll
The fact that he got ended in two turns shows he at least has some knowledge of chess or else it would have gone for a bit longer
LOL😂😂😂
does anyone know the song?
A obviously staged fools mate.
LOL that happened to me
chess speedrun
He has the guts to be beaten
........................schlatt
The look on his face is so funny
My life in two moves
I legitimately did this to my brother twice.
Shortest match ever played.
In the thumbnail you are looking like shaveer jafari
Rip Jschlatt’s King
👍👍👍
Roses are red violets are blue As long as my channel existsThat's good for you
He is not good enough to play chess. He doesnt do predictions.
Fooled on
"She's not gonna see it coming"  *Gets instant checkmate*
I've had that done to me, but to be fair I was just starting to learn chess and had no real idea what I was doing...
rip chess
Alternative title: How to lose chess in just 2 moves
Dident even now that was possible
I play chess temporarily once every few months, and EVEN I never develop the 4 pawns at the corner. You'll always endanger the King or queen by doing so.
His face is priceless
That's funny
Pro player
I like it how he laughs at first, only to lose at the end. oh the irony.
Is...is this legit, there's no way, it has to be scripted
Every pro uses that trick
I beat my cousins with the same trick everytime
That's 100% acting
omg is he ded?
staged
*can somebody explain to me- what the hell just happened* LMFAO
I thought it was BobbyPlays by the thumbnail lol
I didn't know it was possible to lose chess in 2 moves.
Dope..never understood sht, but pretty cool
He was actually trying to speeding chess and he made the fastest checkmate you can do.
I’m sorry, there is no way in a million years that he did that without knowing what would happen.
This is folls math
I think he did that on purpose honestly lol, he just copied what XQC did against penquinoz
I don't see how you didn't see the obvious line of doom
Fake and gay.
I get the joke but how did she put the king there so quickly , plus it doesn't even count as checkmate , is it just me or are there other things I don't know it chess.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
To this day he's still questioning what happened.
Classic Scholar's Mate
lol
lol super funny
This moment he realized he is a side character
All the people (admittedly including me) who don’t know anything about chess and don’t know why that means he lost but are still just laughing about his reaction
Damn
She is not gonna see this coming   But she is coming for see you
0:20 it was at this moment Jason knew it
wow... you'd think he would not be so cocky if i never played chess before
0:16 [Insert baka mitai here]
12m I'm so proud of big guy
F
Damn. She really had to Bobby fisher him like that . . . 👌
He's got spirit.
"I Love Chess :)"
I have literally tried fool's mate on every chess player in my college , it's difficult to do this but it's just so satisfying.
It was at this moment he knew he ****** up...
Fastest chess game ever
am i the only one whos watching thiss video for that  cute girl
I can't stop laughing.
Music is airship fortress, from Mario kart ds
this is more staged than wwe. lame.
The way his face just falls 😭
Can someone explain to me what  the fuck happened
The "I love chess" in schlatt's background puts an icing on the cake.
Fools mate lol
0:19 It was at this moment he knew, he f***d up
Eyy yoo broo you ok.? The smile just quickly fades I cant stop laughing
Boxed like a fish
I learned that checkmate when i was like 5, and even back then i though "who would do something that stupid? simply imposible"  humanity always surprises me
Can someone explain how this works? Why did he lose?
lol that face tho...priceless
he kinda looked like chris from mr beast just more of a broad face
Staged. Funny how you all believed it
she checkmated him within 2 moves  the guy: *pikachu face*
her face
EVERYTHING IS A FILM!! SHIT!!
This is called the fool's mate. You need to count on your opponent being extremely stupid for it to work.
He did not see that one coming.
F
My tiny brain cant comprehend
Thank you AlexandraBotez, very cool!
"The regret on his face"
He did not notice Alex with MFM title and 2200 ELO, that's an heavenly 1800 ELO diff
When I first saw this is was like: oh no he's about to make a rookie mistake...
0:24 "Schlatt..." ... Schlatt is not available at the moment, please leave your message after the tone
shouldn't she buy him a drink before mating that hard. guess it's the cultural difference
This is the same person that trolled badboyhalo lmao
When you realize you actually can't play chess.
this is pog
the girl 300 iq
HAH
FOOLSMATE!
I must not understand the game well enough because I have no idea what happened XD
I feel like Schlatt got his king and queen mixed up. He thought his king was his queen and he could put her in "king" in check.
"Outstanding Move!"
He just lost his soul to the devil
Her face went:  Umm?
Look at his face at the end😂😂
i dont understand chess but this is funny
Ese es el mate del tonto (literalmente de llama así en español)
4 idiot
Imfao...this was the moment he knew,that he...
Absolutely violated this man. There’s no recovering from that one.
Shlatt..?
Ahh yes, the "Fool's Mate". An actual name of a move
Dude was like: FUUUUUUUUUU-
We didn’t even reach a climax!
I wonder what he was planning to do when he said "She's not gonna se this coming"?
That's all deliberate moves... Fools are not one who defeated but who watches this game if u don't realise it.
Ayo that girl is familiar
Unknown to schlatt his real enemy was Hobo Jesus and the famous hunger games actor
The shortest chess game in world's history. 😂
Schlatt looks like Chris older
The fools mate isn't someone play to try win but it's played to intentionally loss
.ㅤ.  ㅤ-
ive done this checkmate before in 2019 when i was playing chess , i took so many screenshots and showed them to my friends who also play chess
The expression of their faces 😂
It was at this moment he knew he fucked up
I remember my dad beating me in chess the same way I got so confused
That face says did that just happen
I believe this is called “fools mate”
I like her reaction ❤️
Fun fact : that woman on top was from India that's why
Legends tell that he is still wondering why he got rekt in 2 moves
is that dakblake
LOOKS LIKE MR BEAST'S CHRIS OMG
F2 square... why move that pawn.. smh
Almost as bad as xQc. 6 moves pepelaugh
😂😂
I can lose faster that means im better
Happiness  is just temporary
Well he was right. She didn’t see that coming
Didn't even know 2 was possible
He has not lost
Alexandra really likes to win while pretending to do nothing lol.
Alternate title: Girl wins chess match in two moves.
Mario kart 7 Flying boat race.
noob
it is fake. I am telling this by this sentence. ' she is not gonna see this comming'. The way he developed his pieces makes nothing to come anyway.
I don't actually get this video.... surely that was staged ... right ? Because if not ... dude must be a first time player of the game ...
I would say that this is likely set up, but I did once lose to a computer this way.
I don’t understand chess now
Wow that's actually a fool's mate...
Lmao got destroyed
U can teleport as a King?
Schlatt be like : Speedrun defeat WR any% glitchless
“She’s not gonna see this one” Me, a basic under 800 rated casual player who noticed. So quick question, what is this guys rank I’ve never heard of him?
Man, he was a fool, mate.
Gayschlatt
whats that chess website?
f
I don't get it how does this work
I DID THAT TOO MY DAD LOL
xD
How did he win the elections in dream smp.
Rape trauma and hypnosis is not love
I know he actually lost because he likes to beat on girls...
You must be so dumb to move that pawn
What’s the music in this?
She is clever
Who is the winner
I LOVE CHESS :)
Schlatt.exe stopped working
lmaoooo
Pwned.
I'm not proud to say that this has happened to me
Her face at the end is the look of superiority
This is why I prefer checkers
To be fair, I dont think she saw that coming at all
2 moves checkmate
Imagine being that good at chess.
Schlatt. E.X.E stopped working.
*Cue Last Surprise*
good thing it was schlatt playing instead of big guy
HE LITERALLY INVENTED THE SHORTEST CHECKMATE EVER.
BINOD
Get big brain on
Her eyes at the end tho💀
Schlatt?
She played him like a damn fiddle.
Their face expression makes it so funny
LMAOOOO
chess any% spspeedrun
What even happened
😹😹😹😹😹😹😹
we have been tricked backstabbed and quite possibly bamboozled
He planned that 100%
The way his laugh stopped
me sees the title also me: if this is real schlatt is so bad at chess. me after seing video: uhmmm what just happend.
How can someone play themself so badly.
When you lose to the first thing you learn in chess
Oh I came here thinking it was Samay Raina's chess stream😂... I was gravely mistaken... I enjoyed seeing him loose so it's ok ig.
this is all set up
if "WTF" had a face 0:23
Ghhhhhhhh

Best king sacrifice ever
WHAT THE...!!! 😲😱🤯
Top 10 people who died inside

This is staged lmaoooo
LMFAOOOOO
0:16 Her face "Wtf this guy's an amateur"
*realization moment*
Help I didn't get it
He's a bit confused, but he's got the spirit
My brother did that to me when we were little and I got so pissed
"Imagine a king who fights his own battles"
“Sometimes my genius... it’s almost frightening”
pls tell me this was staged
I wonder if this was scripted.
Nice
Schlatt caught lacking
I have to ask. What even was his plan with moving that pawn there? It doesn't benefit any of his other pieces, what strategy would work out from him moving that specific pawn there? Well clearly it was going to be a deadly one given by that smug as hell look on his face and evil laugh he was doing while moving that pawn. But also one he clearly didn't think through.
And they make fun of xqc cause he lost in 6 moves.
Oof
11 million views
I mean I’m no chess guy but bro 😂
Waiting for the kind brother who support me
That reaction tho
Technically she couldn’t have seen THAT coming.
wait what... this has 11m views? I think this is the biggest chess video ever now lol
I won as black with that same play once! Mostly by accident! The set up appeared and I couldn't believe it was possible to win in two moves. before that I thought scholars mate was the fastest way to win.
"I am failure" - Schlatt
I think this Two friends conspired to each Other just To gain 11,000,000 views, sorry I wouldn`t buy that unless you can beat me in two steps chess game...I mean your girl friend..... To beat me in two steps....
Free tips control the center....hahaha
Chess failed successfully!
this is the smallest chess game in the world
I have done this exact thing as well. He is sadly not alone.
"She's not gonna see this one coming" well...atleast he stood by his word
I didn't know it was possible
I always try this on my opponent the few times I play chess, but they never follow my plan.
Dude got Uno Reversed  "Bet she wont see this coming"
The classic 2 moves game
The utter disappointment on my guy 😂
When you play chess in so many dimensions your brain collapses into a black hole
i’m so upset i thought this was neat mike
My very first chess match in a school competition, Idk I was probably 8 or something like that, I beat my opponent with the exact same 2 moves. Except after I did it, both of us were like Schlatt at 0:27 xD
"Schaltt?"
what a simp, he lost for her instead of grabbing a crowbar and showing who's the Boss here
Yeah that's called foolsmate
Slatt
Life comes at you fast.
“She’s not gonna this fucking coming”
His face is just pure(●´⌓`●)
If life is a game of chess he lost
Hungarian opening... e5... Losing Gambit: Accepted
This should have a big LOL 🤣🤣🤣
It never gets old watching people fall for that same two-move checkmate.
what was the move he is thinking by doing this?
hashuahashuahashua Loser
FOOLS MATE I CAN'T BELIEVE IT  ITS SO RARE
Lmao
Well, she definitely didn't see that 2nd move coming
*OUTSTANDING MOVE*
Bot EZ
The guy be like  Lets start , shall we.... The girl  Its over ...duh...
When you realize that the guy who claimed he's only played video games on and off has no thumb prints...
Wow, why did he did the worst move in chess, that is how you get checkmate in 2 moves. Well maybe he is a newbie, hope he practiced next time
That was beautiful
0:20 ive never seen an emotion go from happiness to sadness so quickly in my entire life
Can anyone explain?
whyd i click on the thumbnail thinking thats ali a
He’s just like 👁👄👁
I'm confused as to how she won, please help
Did he say he was trying to get his bishop out...and then blocked in his bishop with his first (only) two moves?
Literally feels scripted but I dont wanna believe it is
All I said watching this was "you absolute moron, you played yourself."
What a tal move.
I'm going to be real with u I laughed my ass off after watching that
checkmate's the warning one, right?
xqcL
To be fair, she did not see that coming
Look at that face🤣🤣
He wouldn't have lost if he had some chicken fries
My dude just blocked his knight and bishop, also expose his own king without any intention, lmao those 2 are the worst moves possible
scripted I know
"She's not going to see this coming" I mean hes not wrong
Bruh i lose every single game
why what
Don't Forget This is Indian Origin Game
The true expression of ‘What the fuck’
Hey ,atleast she was surprised
He's a bit confused but he's got a gun.
WTF HAHAHA
I think fools mate is the only way to achieve mate in 2. Unless someone plays astronomically stupidly
Uhhhhhhhhhhhh, I don't think chess works that way but it's a win for her nonetheless
Ooooooooo So kind man... He let the girl win just to make her 😁😁😁😁
Fun Fact :- Every Legendary Video is of less than 1 min.😂😂
This is quality context at four am.
Everyone's talking about his face. But I love her face at 0:23 !!!
I like the part when he loses
I saw the smirk right before she did it.
Staged
Who's he plying against
good im glad he lost
Mario kart ds airship fortress
big guy is confused as fuck  he be like schlatt- Wait a Minute ...................... What daaaa fuqqqqqqq  F in the chat please (respect for the ignorance)
Must have been on purpose for content.
That's what my friend did to me
Wait how did he lose?
LMFAO HIS EGO BROKE
when you do something and don't know what that something was
That was amazing 🤣
he starts to believe
Staged, but funny I guess
I’ve done this to my dad before
lol i love how his face just drops from 100 to zero excitement in less than a second
He went from 😀 to 😐 in like 2 seconds
I mean she never saw that coming
LMAO THE "schlatt?" AT THE END
POG
Me trying to be bossy in chess  2 seconds later   ' ok I regret it'
What was his plan? I've never seen a defeat like this :´D
Who thought he is zane hijazi in the thumbnail?
K-O!
"I'm just gonna play simple chess" *Defeats the enemy in one move later*
Superb lady
Imagine if everyone who watched this video subcribed.
Played too bold kings gambit
That's literally the oldest trick in the book. How does he fall for that? 💀
he is like - wtf  and she's like - thug life 😂😂😂
bruhhhh ,.....is he a noob or smthng??
Holy lord how can you possibly not know THE ONES ON THE EDGES YOU MOVE FIRST
I don’t play chess... what happened
Hahhahaha
My video started to buffer right after he lost
then he retired
"you said you were gonna be me at ches-   yea I know know know watch watch watch"  literally dies in 2 moves.  Schlatt was confidant tho.
Wow. What a natural and unscripted chain of events.
Definitely not staged lol
I'll never understand chess, but i still find this funny
He looks like Zane from The vlog squad ngl
checkmate oof
The "I love Chess" board in the background makes it even better
It's funny how you see "I love chess on a board in the background" but he still losses in two moves
Staged af.
Im good at chess im russian
I think she saw it coming
xqc lost his crown
IM DEAD LOLLLL
"She's not gonna see this one coming." What the fuck was his plan?
You're all so stupid acting like this is real
Worser than xqc and moist critical
HOW TF DOES THIS HAVE 11 MILLION VIEWS
Girl:-😂 Boy:-😒
I wanted to see his whole reaction after his ultimate defeat!!!
"I go first?" Asked Jonathan Schlatt, also known as JSchlatt or just Schlatt, wanting to avoid being presumptuous. Alex Botez, in response, echoes back "You go first," followed by "you said you were going to beat me in chess," clearly doubtful of Schlatt's skill. Stammering, Schlatt confirms, "no no no, I know, I know. Watch," as he moves his pawn to G4. Being the chess player she is, Alex moves her pawn to E5, "playing simple chess" as she put it. Jonathan Schlatt smirks. "She'll never see this coming." He moves a pawn to F3. Not realising his mistake, he chuckles to himself. As he displays his confidence, Alex moves her queen to H4, checkmating JSchlatt in 2 turns. Baffled and confused, Jonathan is paralyzed, trying to comprehend what happened. "Schlatt?" Is the last thing he hears, before retreating into solitude, never to be heard from again.
So what just happened? My guy thought the King was Queen was busted with defeat after figuring what just happened.
She's not gonna see this comming.  Morgan Freeman: Turns out she did see that comming the whole time
... And the brain cells were GONE. Simple
Why does this have more views than any of his channel's videos
dude that was so obvious reactions are even more fake xD
Sir can you not count that was 4 moves
pogchamps players be like
This is even worse than throbbing mate
?????????????????????????????????????
this is a sitcom scene, the looks on their faces are too fucking good
Lol
Only a 10 year old gets caught on that ancient trick. He’s obviously in on it. Good acting though.
That is an achivement, if I’ve ever seen one
Scripted
Airship fortess theme, hell yes.
0:25 *Is this the real life, or is this just fantasy*
“She’s not gonna see this”  Your opponent is WIM, she should have known every possible 2nd move possible in chess.
Wow! i too am a speedrun chess player. i think my losing record is four. what a mad lad, he did it in two.
Boke
That's a King's Gambit at it finest
It was this moment when he knew ..he blundered
Kings Gambit
This is next level genius levels.
Idk how to play chess so can anyone tell me how she win
Wait....what happened?
This is more better than the Germans
why the fuck does this have 11m views what
Definitely not scripted no sir not at all no way.
girl - Omae wa mō shinde iru guy - NANI?!
Guys, I think she saw it coming
has left the chat.
this is a real big time rush moment right here  ah ah oh ah ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
This has to be staged, no one is this stupid...
Can someone explain what the fuck just happened?
100% scripted. I refuse to believe otherwise.
😂😂😂
Shlatt?             Shlatt.EXE has encountered a problem, Troubleshooting
Schlatt: hehehe...  *CLICK OF DESPAIR*
F
I cant believe people think this is real
Schlatt‘s mind has left the Chat.
Big Guy be like: some spice meal...yeah bwoi😂
Schlatt have a mental breakdown after he lost
This Video I CAN DEFINITELY RELATE TO
Fragrance man needs to improve
HAHAHAHA XD
Can we take a moment to appreciate Schlatt had a board that said "I love chess" behind him?
Almost as bad as xqc
i know the feeling when you lose in 2 moves.
**leaving his king wide open** she'll never see this coming
4 moves
He looked like Chris from the mr beast team in the first
schlatt? are you still processing?
That “Schlatt?” Was what sold it for me
I don’t know why ,but i cant stop watching this again and again
*Schlatt.exe has stopped working*
Lolololololololol
I don’t know what just happened but he clearly doesn’t either 🤣
Me who doesn’t even know who to play chess really saw that coming (i didn’t know which peice but i knew their was a checkmate there)
SLATT SLATT SLATT!
jaquemate le gano la reina en dos moves
U guys know it's a fake comedic sketch right?
His face at the end says it all
That is exactly the moves they say not to do in chess, my man didn’t care  😂😂😂
Love the spirit 😂
ur ez '
Please tell me this is fake.
bruh moment
The smile "I love chess" behind explain everything
Can someone exlplain to me why you would play this opening?
whats the music off of this
He did that on purpose right? It’s scripted, right?  He had to see it
bruh moment
lolcowdom
Scholars mate? Heck that, we have the big guy mate in 2
He should have done it on purpose like a simp but we all know he would have done anything else
Such an idiot 😂😂 it is one of the most well know and simple move every chess players knows about
Oohh the 'Fool's Mate' :D
Schlatt can do many things takeover the world is not one of them.
What is worse? Schlatt losing in 2 moves against Botez, or xQc losing in 6 moves against Jesus? 🤔😂
That silence is frickn gold🤣😂
The REAL King's Gambit
schlatt.exe is not responding
Bro went mute😂
Clearly a skit.. But funny!
My man gave his king to save rest of the pieces what a guy
He losses only with 2 steps, but he win 10M views, so I guess u and me are the morons in this story.
Schlatt:Wtf! Girl:what do you mean Schlatt: Well that's fantastic..😂😂
Wow.
Nah his brain is just lagging.
more views than anything on his channel
I feel like this is fake because he just let her have the checkmate
Anime villains thinking they could beat the protagonist be like:
alex’s face was like “the fuck?”
bruh what was he even doing there  he trapped his knight, and bishop couldn't rlly do anything with the pond's permission..   "she won't see this coming" yeah i bet she didn't
F
Same happened to me playing with Computer 😂, my reaction was the same... Then I had to rewind
how would he fall for that
I think his brain started buffering
qUeAMz GAmBeT
Hahay boi
Fools checkmate gotta love it
What a noob😂
Comments with many likes and mine does not even reach 100, please touch my photo
The reason that you clicked this video is because it's just of 27 seconds.
wait... 10 Million????
KINGS CAN ONLY MOVE ONE SPACE AT A TIME. SCHLATT IS SUPPOSED TO WIN. I DEMAND A REMATCH
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Lol
2 move checkkkk HELLO
obviously staged
Jschlatt plays the King's gambit like an absolute pro 👏
Fools move
hes just there processing what happened
I swear after this  He had quit chess
He confused but I'm smiling ;)
I love how he was laughing that she will lose and the boom heart crack
*she's not gonna see this coming* -famous last words
that's what he gets for being a yankees fan go sox
Him: "She's not going to see this coming." Her: "Hold my beer..."
He made a noob mistake.
I play chess i may be crap but I play chess     I'm 13 what the heck do you expect some grandmaster
my favorite comments are the ones talking about schlatt as if he is a small child or an animal
It's scripted mate
Now this should be a meme!
Ah, the king gambit. Classic opening.
She won the battle but not the war, the king and bishops will become all-powerful in the end.
This clip had better character development than many TV shows.
I did this checkm8, once. And I still processes what my opponent was trying to do?
Schlatt..!!! He was like WTF just happened..!!
If you look closely you can see the moment where his spirit dies.
Alexandra was like “He’s not gonna- oh my god he did it”
I actually pulled the 3 move white check mate in a tournament once and it was hilarious, of course my luck ran out and lost the following round but still
schlatt?
Lol I love the ending  .....Schlatt?
I can’t stop watching this 🤣
Plot twist: This video was released on April Fools so he did this on purpose! His realization was all fake too. Alexandria Botez: "Schlatt, is this the real king's gambit?" Schlatt: "That was the plan all along, to open the bishop's diagonal in order to get a king's gambit accepted
Kings Gambit
Did she just make a foolsmate?
This needs to be renamed "The Schlattline"
It is called foolsmate 😂
Loading.
Welp i guess i am not the only one....
Yeah sacrificing you're king early on is a good move for beginners
Schlatt: "Your skilled alex" Alex: "I know" Schlatt: "But i think i found a guy who can be your matched opponent" Alex: "Oh? And who is that?" Schlatt: "12th world champion, international grandmaster, merited master sport of the USSR Anatoly Karpov !".
I’ve learned how to play chess for like 2 years and couldn’t process what happened-
Schlatt.exe has stopped working
He got shut down 😂
I think at one point every chess player in this comment section had vietnam flashbacks
Dont u win a chess game by taking down thw king? Idk i dont play proper chess i make some rules up
how has no one realized that it’s staged, their acting is bad
In German: "Narrenmatt"
Botez gambit king variation
*schlatt.EXE has stop working.*
Onosecond
This is literally the only way a person can loose chess in two moves
i mean he ain't wrong he just gotta remove the s from the she
i was crying
Me: Lets try this  100th attempt still no luck Imao
Shahveer jafry lol
Its a never ending loading screen
Why do i have a feeling that the girl used a sharpie to get her eyebrows
Wait how did she get two moves though
It gets me everytime
Oké this reminds me of a dream smp movie were they explain everything and then he says: '' live is like a chess game for jschlatt'' and all the comments be like: and he lost in 2 moves 😂😂
I dont get this how did the king just teleport?
Could have castled?
Congratulations you are terrible
Yehehe
she didnt win he just lost
Bro how do u not know that trick
How the hell do you not see that coming like bruh 😂🤣
she really didnt see such an easy win coming
I love feminists who play chess. They’re not really feminists... shhh!
Pahahahahaha
I mean, I'm not a professional or anything, I lose against my grandfather all the time, but even I wouldn't do a lame move like that
To this day he is still paralyzed in confusion.
Is schlatt move e4 he could have lived longer XD
"Schlatt?"
Can someone explain that?  She moved her queen to one of his pawns which could kill the queen, but she moved it then its checkmate?    *My_Brain.exe has stopped working*
I have done this exact thing at a school chess tournament our school lost because of that
Karma
Why does this have 10 mil views
It’s the “Schlatt” for me.
Tbh I think he probably did this for comedic effect
So chess got re imagined with the king wearing the queens crown huh.
Respect for those who think this is real👍👍🙏
He failed in the worst way possible that I think he let her win so easily for the shits and gigs
Legends say that me is still paralized
Words of wisdom
0:17 Her face when he moved his 2nd pawn :D :D :D ..."did he just..."
Ayyyyy 500k like
You can literally see her facial expression go like "what the fuck????" when he makes his second move
Lol
She didn’t see what was coming lol
They call it a fools mate for a reason
I am not the best at chess but what was he even trying to do that mve opend up nothing for him other then his king he even blocked his knight with the other pawn im not angry just disappointed
Yall excited for the next update? :D
Am I the only one who didnt understand what happened?
Chess game in 2 moves A.K.A "Fool's Mate."
You just got cancelled boy! and yeah i know this is fake
Biggest L ever
What did just happen?
this is specifically me versus my friend, my brother, my sister, my parents, my computer and even my little brother  *Im SuCk*
Had it coming
Ah yes, the fools gambate
He had to bash his own bishop after that awful game
So nobody talk about “i love chess :)” on the whiteboard behind him ? You clearly don’t love them boy 🤣
2 moves mate puzzle solve
Me=🗿
Tf
haha😅
His brain literally went:  *”shit..”*
When you have more views on a clip video than any video on your channel
*Wait that illegal!*
Surely this was staged
Bobby fischer been real quiet since this guy played chess...
i really watched the video like a million times for their priceless reaction...
slatt
In Schlatt's defense, she definitely did not see that coming
scripted, how could u turn to g4 then f3, it's so fucking useless
Fool's mate spotted !😂😂

This is defo planned ngl altho funny
staged but funny
This made me remember my luckiest win (same thing happened)
The queens gambit!!!
Lol look at the facial expression. 😂😂😂😂
That was epic
This is called the "fool's mate", and is the quickest possible way of winning a chess match. It's called like that because you really, REALLY have to play like a complete fool to lose in this way. Even novices, even people who had never played chess in their lives won't be able to make the two WORST open moves that are possible in their first try.
Fun fact: You played chess after watching it 5 times
Me watching who don't know how to play chess
A
This is scripted
I don't even know how to play chess. I don't get why she won but it looked impressive lol
they way she lowers her head
Staged as f
Acting was invented in 1563 1562:
BEANS!
This is the best trick in chess, literally!
🤣🤣
Boy thought he was playing a master lmfao
is this real?
Big guy got big vid viral
How?!
Relationship goals
This man just went through 30 different emotions
I still remember that once I joined a chess tournament when I was 12 years old but got checkmate guy by a freaking 6-year-old with this same exact move. I never played chess ever since :)
Schlatt?
Baka mitai
0:21 the moment of realization
What website is this?
10M views
lol, thats basic chess
Well he played "Fool's Mate". For the first time in my life I saw someone playing this.
xqc getting 6 moved wasn't that bad after all..
''She's not going to see this comiing"      also she: wins him in 2 moves
The acting is spot on
Fools mate. Its funny when its someone else but when your on the other end its so disapointing
I once won like that against my chess teacher, felt like a god afterwards
bruh imagine losing a game of chess could not be me
Best I’ve done was 5 moves
Fools mate on the road.
Her face after he moved that second pawn 😂
“g4. Get the bishop out.” also schlatt: *immediately blocks it back in with f3*
Totally staged.
fools mate
Eventually, he stopped thinking.
Wtf happened
Win*
"She's not gonna see this coming" Hahaha
She definitely didn’t see that coming
maybe he is gone now becasue of rage
I agree, she did not see that coming
We're no strangers to love You know the rules and so do I A full commitment's what I'm thinking of You wouldn't get this from any other guy  I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling Gotta make you understand  Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you  We've known each other for so long Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it Inside we both know what's been going on We know the game and we're gonna play it And if you ask me how I'm feeling Don't tell me you're too blind to see  Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you  Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you  Never gonna give, never gonna give (Give you up)  We've known each other for so long Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it Inside we both know what's been going on We know the game and we're gonna play it  I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling Gotta make you understand  Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you  Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you  Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye
Pure disappointment.
Pretty sure this was a bit but it's hilarious
This dude exposed his king just 2 seconds in the game
This move was developed 7 years ago from a video.
he needs a diamond play button instead of that silver play button on the bed
What was he trying to do anyway?
schlatt?
Omg queens gambit
Schlatt?
I can't stop repeating this 😭😂😂
legends says that he was still processing
Isn't she an actress who plays as Allegra in the Flash?
This looks fake
un bruh momento
schlatt: Shes not gonna see this one coming Her: SO U CHOSE DEATH
Who taught this man how to play chess??? 🤨. Even beginners don't move pieces like that. 🤣🤣🤣
Nice
She knew what was happening after the first move
Schlatt: she won't see this one comeing...  1 move later   Schlatt:*loses* Also schlatt:*smash pc*
He’s right, she didn’t see that coming.
I don't know, but this is called the fool checkmate or in spanish "El mate del tonto" and secures an instant win
his reaction after her doing fool's mate lmao
Ya'll eatin this up like Oatmeal, its painfully scripted. Cringe.
At least he's better at chess than me
scripted, cliche
After 2 months he is still wondering what happened
She did not see that coming
LMAOO
This is the fools mate opening if your wondering
He was so confident and he lost
He did that on purpose lmao. (I refuse to believe that anyone would actually make that mistake)
"Hehe she's not gonna see this coming" She: *uno reverse card*
Her reaction bro lmao
Pretty sure he did this on purpose right?
He's literally have no idea what just happened
That 'HeHe' was amazing
He went 🙂......😦
"She's not gonna see this one coming" When did Schlatt change his gender?
Her queen was open oh no
Ive had this happen to me
Book move into blunder
Congrats on 600k!!!!!🎉🎉🎉 subs in the future
Kings gambit
Almost at 600k lol
lmao
Schlatt was right. She didn’t see that one coming.
Dude, always cover the king. Wtf basics bro
This feels way too staged
her face before she won was priceless
Can someone explain to me if I’m a idiot and get confused by this or if this isn’t even an actual move in a game of chess.
I like how there's just an awkward silence when she wins
imma try doing that against someone
There's actually a term for that in chess: "fool's mate."
Dang she definitely didn't see that king gambit coming.
How is that even possible?
It's a good opener for trapping beginner players
Legend says that schlatt.exe stopped working.
0,00001 iq
rek
im just wondering how he is that bad at chess I am an unborn fetus and haven't taken a step outside of the womb and I am still better than him
If anyone don’t know it’s called Fool’s mate and he’s reaction describes it perfectly 😂.
Fool's mate.
The face of confusion
Is called the fool's checkmate Well said
Can't recommend him enough 04pokeman on IG is really good. I really appreciate his hard work on my account recovery
Does anyone else have no idea who this man is but youtube threw one clip of him into your recommended, you watched it and now the algorithm thinks you're a huge fan?
This is why I wish I knew jack shit about chess so I could figure out how Schlatt lost
XD
I'm shit at chess and I would of done better, he must of been simping 🤣
Did he maybe just confuse the king and the queen? (They  both wear some kind of crown.)
Off
He sacrificed his king to develop his bishop, what a lad
plot twist: he sets her up
I bet Big guy made a lot of money from this video
How does this have more views than anything on Jschlatt's chanel
thats the reason why we dont do birds opening
Wait, cant he just move His King with a Tower?
Schlatt, are you ok? That look that alex gave you at the end was evil... pUrE evil... (⊙_⊙;)
Fixed match....
She's 2207...he's only 400 xD
This is in fact THE fastest way to checkmate.
Poor bastard
I can hear *Hello Everyone* ~
I can literally bet this was scripted
wait, isn't anybody gonna say anything about how he looks like chris from mrbeast?
its like moist and xqc but even better
it's the easiest move to counter cause only rookie use it
Silent mode enabled
I LOVE CHESS             :)
I just know this trap with original chests like when u get it to centre and loose like 5 figures but u made it strait to king ??? U really dont know this trap?
Yes, I know this. I was teaching my brother how to play Chess and he beat me in the exact same way.
Ehhhhh?!?!!!
Big guy just sat ther like 👁👄👁
He is right when he says clips get a lot of views. 10 mil
they did
Jschlatt.exe is not responding
.... This hurts to see as a pro chess player
This is legendary
Bad bad bad
meh fake af.
Her face 🤣
No offense, but this is 100% fake.
His rage keyboards”My time has come once again”
Slatt
Ah yes, the fool's mate.
Too bad I know 0 things about chess.
top 10 pictures taken moments before disaster
"She's not going to see this coming".
No matter how many time I watch this, I'm still amazed by how he managed to play the 2 worst possible moves!
Should’ve gone f3 e5, g3 Qh4 with a botez gambit
wowwww
Wow it was so real
This is a joke?
I didn't know that the fool's move could happen in real life...
Lmao the moment of silence in the end 🤣
That opening is grab gambit guys
have only one way to lose in chess in 2 moves and he chose this one
scripted!!!
help i dont know howto play chess so i dont understand
Her face of INSTANT confusion, just like a "is this big guy serious right now?". How fast did it take her to come up with the move to take him out that quickly?  I guess she is the master.
I have absolutely no idea how to play chess, but I think shlatt made a mistake
ustawione
Yeh toh shuru hone se pehle hi khatam hogaya🤣
0:22 visible confusion
another snowden with maggie... total loser. Price must not be proud.
Fake as bleep
SHE PLAYED THE FOOL'S GAMBIT I LOVE HER
There is literally one way to lose a game in 2 moves. This is kinda impressive
Now it cannot be anyything but scripted... What was the master plan in the first place? I can't see any starting with these two moves.
Lol
scripted
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
çoban matı mıydı bu
I don't get it
I've done this.
That’s called “fools mate”.
Someone please explain
He was right -- she probably didn't see that move coming.
i would love to find out whats going on inside his head when he moved his pawn to f3
He is stupid
That is what I call a fool
Since when could you move the King halfway across the board in one move? That wasn't a thing when I played chess as a kid.
He was successfully defeated
Schlatt's the real winner getting 10m views
Idiot
"She is not gonna see this one coming"  She most certainly did not!
Wow, what a girl 😂😂😂
Somebody explain?
Lmao never see anything like this
Oof
I have good news and I have bad news for you. The bad news is that we are all sinners. We have all missed the mark set by God (Romans 3:23). The bad news gets even worse. The penalty for sinners is death (Romans 6:23) and eternal separation from God in a place called hell. The good news is even though we are all sinners, Jesus Christ died for us (Romans 5:8). The good news gets even better. All we have to do to spend eternity in Paradise and avoid hell is to believe that Jesus died on the Cross for us. It is an absolutely FREE gift from God. Many will never know how wonderful a relationship with Jesus is because they are afraid to ask. Try asking. What do you have to lose? Just ask Jesus into your heart and to forgive your sins. It literally costs you nothing, but will give you everything. God Bless.
The queens gambit
"She's not gonna see this one coming" *last words before disaster*
Wait wtf did she just do?!?!
that's the dumbest chess opening i ever saw
She saw it coming
“Schlatt?”
Sorry to ruin it but I think this was staged
This is the most popular video jschlong ever made
The way she uses the blue yeti bugs me
Hahahaha she’s not gonna see this one coming   Her: wins
hahaha gold!!
The moment he moved that 1st pawn, I knew he'd move the one next to it. Poor fucker had no idea what he was doing...
Glatt?
“She’s not gonna see this one coming” famous last words
The musics good
Jesus Christ he fell for the most bait move ever, fair play to her tho😂😂
I think this is the world record for the fastest game of chest
This was me when I first ever played chess
this guy must have never played chess before
Omg..i come here because i see so much comments about someone really play chess and lost in 2 steps.i think that was joke.but,after see this one.all i can say..is he a toddler?
I remember that move, I used to do it in my chess courses when I had the chance!
the chess gods must be still laughing
Lol
it takes a special brain to lose in 2 moves
*he* didnt see that coming
0:19
Is there some Chess-legend that can explain what just happened?
When is next update for chess
That face she made when she beat him in two moves is a legend.
"She is not gonna see this one" She: 2200 Rated
The power of hindsight is frightening
Damn not even she saw this coming 🤣
That background "I love chess :)" tho
Nyengir mlu si
Omae wa mou shindeiru
i would've felt violated if i lost in 2 moves
I have been testing and this it THE fastest game end i can find.
Talking smack before proceeding to get Fool’s Mated is truly the Schlatt way.
BRUH
I genuinely wheezed.
Rare footage of me thinking what will happen in the shower then mehurting my own feelings
shlat really shat the board eh
shlat?
Triggered
MY GOD the embarrassment!! did he bury his head after?
I love how there is a board in the back that says “ I Love Chess”.
lmao, is schlatt a beginner?, I learned the basics in kindergarten, and the first thing my dad taught me was Fool's mate, how to win with it, and how to avoid it, and schlatt fell into that beginner fault.
What just happened? Can someone explain pls
definitely staged
Has to be staged
Just do a rochade and stay in the game... Wtf.
OOF
Tat evil smile
Lol ez
Scripted.
What a fool
Schlatt matt
He looks a lot like shaveer jafri
First time I’ve seen someone lose in 2 moves.
Never gets old
Ive done this move before
*Schlatt is the new checkmate*
He was so stupid at his second move
Rumors say he is still trying to process what happened.
gotta love fool's mate
Meowoowwowo
ur so garbage
WHO ELSE GOT THIS IN THEIR RECOMMENDED SOOOO MANY TIMES?
Should've used the knight
*Emasculated for LIFE !!* 🤣
"She's not gonna see this one coming" *UNO Reverse*
Obviously staged lol. Im a beginner and as soon as I saw pawn to f3 I knew it was a fool's mate
I can relate to him😭
100% staged but okay.
Schlatt: "she's not gonna see this one coming" The girl (IDK the name): *beats Schlatt* Schlatt: *silent*
Who watched this video many times?
How? I don't know a thing about chess...
Don’t give bylat
Note to self, never expose ur king IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE😂
Schlatt.exe has stopped working.
A friend of mine did this to me once. I was so flabbergasted....
I lost a chess match when I was 10 years old at a tournament with the same moves 😅. That feeling of absolute amazement, confusion, embarassment and disappointment is the reason I no longer play chess.
h-he didnt just  he really just fool's mated
lmao
The wife of the king lock him
I lost in one
I used to use that tactic
This checkmate should be renamed as dumbmate
I don’t get how she won she didn’t kill the king.
T H R O B B I N G
Autonomous check mate. Shouldn't the girl actually move the queen ?
Now I kinda wanna learn chess, although I have no friends nor strangers to play with
Hi indonesian. I know you come here after GOTHAM CHESS and DEWA KIPAS right?
Girl: That' was easy
at this moment is when he knew he F*cked up
I've no idea how chess works, anyone could explain wtf happened?
F
🤣 She was so confused by how easy it was to beat you 💔
It was at this moment he knew.....he f****d up
i barely oplay chess can someone explain wat is happening
Hacker girl its so troller
Love how it ends after she says "Schlatt"
He got dunked on
Paid actors
dude you kidding me  IS HE FCKIN A CHESS PLAYER
this is. peak comedy. can't convince me otherwise
Same happened to me in the school 😭😭😭
The on where you win in two moves is fools mate right?
Haha 2moves
Noob
Can someone explain to me how this works?
15s chess game
HOLY SHIT get actually used the airship fortress song from Mario Kart and your opinion doesn't matter it's the best
Feel like this is fake but if not you should never play chess again
lol fool's mate ez that was a dumb move
Now imagine losing in 1 turn super embarrassing
😂
Both:Uhhhh what the fuck just happened
*Meanwhile in an alternate universe..*    How many times did I tell you NOT TO MOVE YOUR F PAWN !!!!
I need to watch this so I can win ez
she actually was doing a strat but he made it easier
Schlatt
I've never seen the fool's mate in action before. Fucking awesome.
The monster in the doorway 👁️👄👁️
Fake
"...Schlatt?"
Fool's mate
"Schlatt?" She worringly exclaims as her friend is paralyzed in shock after a stunning defeat. And thus the video concludes on a freezeframe of Schlatt more commonly known as Jschlatt
i still dont get it-
Im gonna use this strategy if only my opponent moves his 2F pawn, but it's not gonna work if my opponent moves a different pawn
Deadly silent
Ah yes.....the fools mate
😏...😐
🤣🤣🤣🤣
too fake to be funny
Im confused to :/
I cant even tell if he lost on purpose or not
not bad.....but fake
HAHAHAHAHAHA OH MY GOD XDD
fake and scripted
HE REALLY THOUGHT HE DID SOMETHING KSKSJDND
Chess meta.
plottwist: he did it on purpose lol
What how did he lose
This is the MOST FUCKING ILLOGICAL CHESS MOVE I HAVE EVER SEEN 😑
Super falso
Lol
What's the song? It looks so familiar
This move is so famous how haven’t u heard of it 😂 only first timers fall for it
It was at this moment he knew he flanked up
Perfect
Thats basically a fools mate.
I smell scripted bs
That airship fortress theme tho...
She win with queen vs king Queen is strong
Lol
Lmao
I literally can't stop rewatching it 😭☠️
Everyone is saying that she wasn't going to see it coming. That wrong because that was her plan so
This is perfect for last surprise on persona 5      YOU’l NEVER SEE IT COMING
I won a game exactly like this once. I was so shocked. Fastest game I've ever played.
Fake
I like who she looks at the screen like “this man know he messed up right?”
I have never seen this before
😂😂😂😂
the "...schlatt?" at the end is so perfect
Pro tip, just don't play the bird opening.
Who starts from that position?
He lost to a women
Alright... Can someone explain, because I know absolutely nothing about chess. Last time I played was quite a few years ago.
It’s called fools-mate if you didn’t know 😏
I thought I was bad at chess.
“She’s not gonna see this one coming.” Me: “Oh god, I hope she doesn’t she that geez man.” Edit: If you know what I mean 😏
**Anatoli Karpov enters the game**
LOOOOL
Big man gives me vibes of that school bully who needs decades to process life
HAHAHAHHAHAHA
How did he lose she just moved the crown then he lost

Her voice is ........!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That look she made before moving the queen bruh 🤣🤣🤣 she’s like “ I know this fool did not just...”💀
Funny
Castling...?
He lost in 2 moves and he is so silent like the 2 letters on his name.
This vid has so much replay value
Yüzde 1 milyon kurgu
Alex: I am going to beat you in 5 moves I am warning you! Schlatt: 2, take it or leave it
Nah it was just a tactical king sacrifice WHITE is completely winning
Watch,watch G 4 ,F3........ silence
Fool’s Mate Lul
what just happen? ?
The fools gambit.
lol that was a fools mate
Well he did not Lie that's for sure
Oh the amount of times i tried using this trick when i was a child
Kid you not. I was play a game with my cousin. He was talking smack saying how he was getting so good and that I was going to lose so badly. I won similarly with only two moves. I laughedy butt off and he said he was going easy. But obviously he just wasn't paying attention. Honestly all luck.
I know nothing about chess. How did he lose so fast?
the face when you take the last cookie 0:23
Holding back his tears
"She's not gonna see it coming"  Even me, saw the winning move.
THIS HAS NEARLY 10 MILLION VIEWS?????????
Golden reaction that is
Seems matched
Staged.
Jesus Loves You don't let anyone down grade you. He says to love yourself and to love others as you love yourself. "I am fearfully and wonderfully made" Psalm 139:14
BLACKED
This is without a doubt the worst opening. I do not know a single person who does this
The fools checkmate got em
Outstanding move
Isn't that technically 4
Can someone explain, what his plan was to do there in his next move? I dont really get chess, to know what he wanted to do. (I got how she won, but what was his plan?)
Dum moment
How? How did she win? Idk anything about chess
"G4, get the- get the Bishop out" Immediately blocks the bishop with his next move and gets mated
haha! mijn vriend michiel kan dit!
"She's not gonna see this one coming" *Shoots himself in the head right in front of her as she looks in shock* Me: Well he wasn't wrong.......
Schlatt's mind: Loading... Pls stand by
Don't you hate it when you mix up your Kings and Queens?
Bruh moment
I’ve done that
I imidiately saw on how stupid his move was Lmfao
That's what I call destroyed in seconds
This is why I don't play chess
Never underestimate girls.... especially when its Andrea
happened to me once.. never again!
yeah i once lost the same way
The end was the best part: “ShLaTt?”
Can someone who is Pro at chest explain please.. 😭😭
There is a FAMOUS quote in Prince of Persia : "I am the architect of my own destruction." I got it now.
Big brain
his plan backd fired lol i saw that
XD he just froze
She is just to good
He ducked up
Fastest lost is the west
HMMM WATCHA SAYYY HMM THAT YOU ONLY MEANT WELL WELL OF COURSE YOU DID
What was his big plan that she wasn't gonna see coming?
I love how you can just see the regret on his face
Can any chess expert explain me why that happened?
Киндермат.
Schlatt.exe stopped working
C'mon man that's 101
Schlatt:Freezes Morgz:PAUSE
Legend says he's still processing his defeat
Did... did he accidentally lose to a fool’s mate?
XD                lol
i seriously don't know if he did that on purpose it would be too fucking much of a coincidence if he didn't
Hmm
Lol he did not see that coming
World record
The utter chick physiologically hover because surfboard legally moor along a opposite facilities. efficacious, righteous crab
POV: You just got vectord
She didn't saw that coming
I can't understand if he's serious or he's conscious of the fact he sucks at chess
It must be staged
If you ever feel like you suck at something always remember ,     *My man lost in chess in his 2nd move*
"...Schlatt?"  Perfection.
schlatt: whut?
lol
oooofff
congrats my dude
Is fake but still funny
exactly this scenario was mentioned 10 times in tutorial. mb she did tutorial xD
4iq
Lol, is it just me who doesn’t understand how he lost? 😅
He never saw that coming
Just how dumb can someone be
I believe this was scripted.
"Give orange me give eat orange me eat orange give me eat orange give me you." :) 🍊
Fun Fact: this is actually called a Fools Mate. It’s the fastest possible way to win in chees
thats literally the ONLY WAY to lose that quickly. its called the fool's gambit
Fun fact : in title there is 28 sec  And in Video it is 27 sec 😂😂😂
bruh?
the moment he move that pawn, he dug his own grave.
fake af
Rip
THE FOOL'S MATE .IT HAPPENED TO ME WHEN I STARTED TO PLAY CHESS
"She's not gonna see this one coming" *Not if i lose before she could!*
chess speedrun any% world record
He understood he lost only when the result came out
That was the fastest checkmate I just learned it
oml XD
It was at this moment he knew.                                              HE FUCKED UP! and  nice mustache
He came too fast
0:22 i watched this a thousand times😂😂
Comedic value at its all time high
OMG my stomach 😂😂🤣🤣💀💀
It was the moment when Schlatt knew, he
wkwkwkw noob
*"Schlatt..."*
Dewa_Kipas
Welcome to the season premiere of "The fuck's in my recommendations?"
At this moment schlatt knew, He fucked up.
Fake, everyone knows NOT to move that pawn
Everyone above 300 knows that mate, never ever move those pieces at the start of the game...
Schlatt: She's not gonna see this one coming Me: He's*
lol
9 million+ people: *interesting*
She played the queen's gambit.
Schlatt? SCHLATT!!! *GAME OVER*
Truly disgusting, that some "Chess players" would make these horrible moves
Surely that constitutes Rape.
i watch this video everyday ATLEAST 2 times
We haven't checked on schlatt in a while is he ok?
we call that fools mate
Alright imma go play chess for the first time
Youtube reccomended me this shit for a hundred times
schllat:shes not gonna see this coming her:literaly finishes the game in two move's  me:ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!
queen gambit
Why did my brain still try to find a move so its not mate, even though it is clearly mate😂
I feel like this a bit. For a video
J boi ur gatbage
0:04 i love chess on the background😂
He got fools mated
Fun fact: these two are friends  and they  set  up this game  for content she told him before the game how he has to open so she can mate him  in two. Wrap  it up and sell it on Youtube
"she would not see that coming" Task failed successfully
My yt recommendation is full of meme today and i did not complain about it 😂😂
Obviously fake bro
To be honest idk what happened there
LMAO
To be fair, she did not see that coming
Has anyone else got this in their recommended like at least 5 times in the past month? 😂
Once I was at a summer camp with the Cub Scout’s, there was this little white kid who thought he was so smart and shit. The satisfaction of whipping his snobby, pretentious smile off of his face in two moves. Immaculate
why would someone use that opening?
when you lose a game in 2 moves it's called Fool's Mate
“Schlatt?”
This is basically what Cr1tikal did to xQc
Hey you don't know the people are in trouble of corona and you people playing games  Today be serious about quarantine by
U lost seriously in two moves       "It's a NO from me:
Bruh moment
This is my last brain cell trying to remember what the square root of 4 is on my social studies test.
And he was never able to recover from that blow.....
This is such a perfect video XD
Kamikaze: Schlatt Variation
HIM: THE FUCK JUST HAPPENED ME: REALLY DUDE
This is a famous move 😂😂
Mega oof
I just remember my dad just beat me in chess with just 4 moves last night....
Schlat???
Didn't even know you could get mated that fast
close game!
Dudeeee....I'm dead 😂
I didnt saw that coming, what the fuck
Schlatt:Get the bishop out *Blocks it on his second move*
In contrast to you, I cannot play chess.
What did he even try to do
Truly amazing, that some "grandmasters" could see that coming
The silence was so LOUD
Bruh look at his face. From 😂 to 😵
I’ve actually done that before
you can only move the king 1 space tho
This is me vs. My sis ( but i won just noting)
eventually bigguy stopped thinking
"She's not gonna see this one coming"  *2 seconds later*  Schlatt.exe has stopped working
She s from Romania lol. Look at her name
WHAT WAS THAT IN A DARK ROOM
BIG GUY
Lmao got 'em!
He was so proud of his 2 moves but he lost
Its What they call pro gamer move
you will lose with dewa kipas.
Went from 😀 to 😐 in 2 moves
There’s a reason they call it Fool’s Mate.
That isn't checkmate he could castle with his rook
He's a bit confused, but he's got the spirit
He has to be trolling
Somebody once said men don't give up. They just stop trying.
this is the most staged thing ive seen in my life
how exactly did he lose?
Is it real? Just a very bad bad bad player can make this error.
Bruh how😂 How did he loseeeeeeeee How?!?!?
I don’t get is how did she win
And the fact that In the war of manberg documentary of dream smp by evanmcgaming states that schlatt is like a chess player makes it even more awkward.......
Lol
He so embarrased lol
Never rush in chess.
what a world record
Beth Harmon got Scholar's mated and became world champion Yep. The one to dethrone magnus will be Shclatt
"She'll never see this coming."  Proceeds to give her the perfect set-up for the quickest checkmate possible in chess.
she didn't see it coming
That white board in the background about to be extinct
Grob's Attack Fail.
That's why....don't be so bragging or get karma
Lol 😂🤣
fools mate
Her face after jshlatt doing his move had me dead-
what the fuck...... we are all ded
LOL
Is he doing that on purpose?
Little did he know
this happened to me before and it is not fun
00:20- turn down for what
Schlatt.exe not found
Schlatt's next line: *I can explain*
Man experienced Mid-Life-Crisis
Yeah, this is actually called bruh moment
The face he made at the end, I can tell he's screaming inside.
Was this staged?
Shoot on iphone meme
fake af
Close game.
Got him with a fools mate
A yes a classic
And I thought xQc was bad for losing in 6
I literally clicked this thinking "you can't win a game of chess in 2 moves"...I was as shocked as Schlatt was (and probably still is).
🤣🤣🤣
*Schlatt e.x.e has stopped working*
What was she not gonna see coming? She saw the checkmate very clearly. Loo
Lmaoo
This has more views than any vid on SchlattLive, weird  (I'm aware that "elon r u ok" has 20 million views so I don't get a bunch of replies)
This is a certified Bruh moment!
that was bruh
this one clip of schlatt has more views than any singular jschlatt video
Ah yes *kings move more than 1* but they can(n’t) attack (back)
Enough Internet for today
Her expression when he made the second move tho 🤣🤣      Like wtf is this guy doing
the cum gambit
😮                                                                      _Schlatt?_
SCLAT NUB
cracked
0:21 AHHA HIS FACE LOL
Can someone time how she won never mind I got the king and queen cofused
I invite to the studio... 12th World Champion International Grandmaster Merited Master of Sport of the USSR ... ALEX BOTEZ!!!
Its ok to loose to a beautiful gal 😂
“Curb your over confidence”
how tho
It was at that moment he knew he
i like how he acted like he knew what he was doing
I have no idea what happened but it's the funniest shit I've ever seen
Harmon ?
Grob attack going horribly wrong
Schlatt: "Your skilled alex" Alex: "I know" Schlatt: "But i think i found a guy who can be your matched opponent" Alex: "Oh? And who is that?" Schlatt: "12th world champion, international grandmaster, merited master sport of the USSR *Anatoly Karpov* !".
theres no way he didnt know what he was doing. everyone chess player knows the 2 move checkmate
Queen be like:onayoma mu shinde yru
Schlatt played into the Fool's Mate lmao
when schlatt play f3, alex botez was like: *are you serious?*
representation of the pacific theatre of WW2
Пош цуо вуеоо сут авп
LMFAO
Wooow yankee with _BRIM_
"Please God, give me the self-confidence of a mediocre white man."
*And that what u call a gamer move*
okay i suck at chess but even i know that's not right
Ha ha ha
Bruh moment in two moves
That my mat
I'm so confused what just happened she just placed the king right next to the soldier can someone explain what just happened here
Imagine losing chess in 2 moves
My uncle did that to me before lol i was shooked
He's defending the pawn more than the king😭😭😭
I don't understand chess but there FACEEEEESSSSS THOOOOO
I didn't even know it was possible to win that fast😂
Jokesta
Gothamchess will say "she is cheater"
Obviously done on purpose
Ez win
Botez: And this is how I met your father
Jschlatt, the man who was EMPORER/dictator of L’Manberg, loses in chess in 2 moves
schlatt: its my big brain moment she is not gonna se this 😳
Plot twist: She mind controlled him.
lol whata  dumb move..
This techincally should've been a 4 move win, but Schlatt practically opened himself up for a nice and clean kill
*Holy music stops*
I dont understand chess what happened XD
I get this was a joke, but I'd have to quit chess if I ever got fool's or scholar mated
0:22 Bruh moment
Excuse me but the queen would have died
1000000000000% FAAAAAKE
Ive never seen a more appropriate moment to type in GGEZ until now
let me guess, someone stole your sweet roll?
*Checkmate By Davie 504*
Oof
at the end he was like ''hold on...what did i witness whta happned
nice setting....
This is the most popular video in this channel. haha i guess people like seeing other people lose chess in 2 moves
I CAN HEAR HIS EGO BEING CRUSHED
Nah he done it purposely,I don't believe he done such "begginers" mistake.
It was all planned everyone knows!
He got silent
It was preplanned nothing who play chess could be so silly 🙄🙄
This is NOT skripted -  NOT AT ALL
you never meet Dewa_Kipas before, you will lose before you play
0:22 that face
What was he even trying to do
He probably mistook the King for a Queen HAHAHAHAHAH
qUiN gAmbIt
“Get the bishop out” *traps his own bishop*
Bobby Fischer vs this guy
I was as confused as he was
0:14 LeL hehehe she will not see this coming im so smart  She moves her piece  Guy: WUT??????
I don’t play chess so can someone explain what just happened?
She will not win againts dewa kipas🔥
I mean he was just a bad player
Am i the only one trying to figure what was his plan?
Paid actors no ones dumb to not predict the most common move but ok
😏 to 😐
"Get the bishop out"
"You won't last 5 minutes playing this game"
"I'm just gonna play simple chess, nothing to see here" And he bought it
It’s a bit sad that me a child can beat a grown man at chess
POG LOL
Should have used the Tennison Gambit and fire the ICBM
Everything about this felt set up
Well I don’t think either of them saw that one coming.
totally not staged
I like to imagine that this wasn't even scripted
L
Heard Nux roast the shit out of this
POV: You watched this video more than once
Dewa kipas
I have a feeling schlatt lost on  purpose. For Content
LOL ITS SO EASY TO PREVENT GETTING 2-MOVE-COMBO’D AND HE STILL DID
geef opseminst credits aan frank
I win with just moving horses
Thats the fastest way of checkmate LoL
F
Amateur’s, i can loose before the game even starts >:D
He is kind of an idiot for doing that
I wanna know what she was thinking, like “did he really just...?”
But can’t he castle the king and rook so he’d only end up sacrificing the rook?
think this is staged. schlatt knew this would happen, hence played it and did it for views. yuck.
the eerie background sound fits perfect with the situation. WHAT THE FUUUUU
HAHA
Plot Twist: His mic wasn't muted when he said.. *She's not gonna see this coming*
This was so staged. Those first two moves literally do nothing good for him
Being good at chess  A robot:wow you’ve wasted your life
And That Kids was How I Met Your Mother...
love his reaction 😂😂
No way did he not know what he was doing  His acting is amazing here but there's no way he did this completely unintentionally
Well apparently, it looks like this dude didn't watch that 'how to win in 2 moves' video.
Shlatt:"She's not gonna see this coming" Alexandra: "No u."
"she won't see this coming" me:I mean,he was not wrong
STAGED
This could be fake, but i dont care, his face is just great XD
He lost at the first move
Er im pritty sure you have your king and queen the wrong way around the king is ment to be faceing the queen. u cant win chess in 2 moves it is atleast 4
Schlatt ?
The bad ending
Dewa kipas
She Really said'there is no escape''
For those who don’t understand chess, this isn’t her playing rly good, this is a one case scenario and the fastest way to lose a game, and it’s the only way to lose in 2 moves.
Dunno if he was intentionally doing that for the laughs.
his reaction pretty priceless 🤣🤣
Compensate his pp with with name
Man this year's Oscar goes to these paid actors
*I love chess*
The pon would kill the queen
Dude this is legit faster than the Guinness world record no cap
Two move checkmate
If I understood how chess works I probably would be dying laughing, but I don't get it.
Never. And I mean NEVER... say you'll win at something- because if you lose you look stupid.
Am I allowed to say LOL
Hello, police? I just witnessed a fucking murder
Oh my gosh how did that make me laugh so hard🤣
That’s why he loves chess
Schlatt was just on crack, thats why he missed that
I got a girl I liked in 3 moves with this technique.
Lame
Never have i seen man die so quicjky on the inside
his face when the queen went h4
Mental damage over 9000
Haha
You have to be pretty bad at chess to let that happen
I never knew that fools mate existed
no guys, he is just so used to playing 5D chess that he made a genius move in another timeline but it didn't work because this is normal 4Head chess
Safe he did this pnly fir the vid
This is literally called the Fool’s Mate
eheheheh -schlatt 2021
This makes me feel a lot better about sucking at chess
Big brain
Yeah because this clearly WASNT STAGED AT ALL FFS
r/watchpeopledieinside
Outstanding move!
Huhuhu whaaaa  ahahhaahhahahahha 😂😂😂😂
She is not gonna see this one coming more like I did not see it coming.
He's shocked lol

Everyone saying Fool's Mate, no one saying Fool's Game? (just for intenditors)
I’ve done that before ://
She was playing chess and he was playing checkers
Very long Dark Souls boss battles: *Epic* 20s Chess battle: *LegendaryGodLike*
That happened to me the first time I played online it was the last tho
I can’t tell how he lost. His king still exists??
Fools Mate.
R.I.P
Kween Gambet
Damm fool's mate fastest way to get your ass absolutely handed to you in chess
Did he really make those stupid moves and honestly felt he had the advantage?
theres no way he did that on purpose if hes a real chess player.  every good chess player knows not to move those 2 pawns in the beginning. its basic fundamentals of chess.
Lol Fool's Mate boi
Just some planned moves to get some attention. 😂 Even a kid wont do such miserable moves.
probably staged lmao. this is the only move you can do to get checkmated in 2 moves.
There’s literally a one way to lose the chess with two moves and he nailed it like a boss
How did she win
NANI!?
Me: Mom, can we have King’s Gambit? Mom: No, we have King’s Gambit at home *King’s Gambit at home:*
Can someone explain to me why he lost?
I refuse to believe this wasn't scripted
Understandable have a great day
I clicked because I thought that was chris
This should be added to 'watch people die inside' compilations.
Bruh
People who lose within 2 moves on first try become true beasts with practice.
Its look like me when i first time playing chest
0:20 When you're vibin to your favourite song on shuffle and a depressing song starts playing.
0:22 Him: whe what!?!?!?
Classic move to wreak people who don't really know chess
Shes not gonna see this fucking coming
She was like “huh? Well uhm... checkmate?”
Black Queen : CHECKMATE!!  Schlatt : *NANI*
I love chess :)
sad
What a power move
The funny thing is that it’s called a fools mate
That wasn’t checkmate, it’s called the king sacrifice okay
This was staged right
I have no idea of chess, but I certainly would have lasted longer
That was the first thing i lerned not to do in chess
fake
"She's not gonna see this coming " Its at this moment he knew ... he fucked up .
When will chess 2 come out?
this has got to be staged lol  surely he's not that dumb
Wtf
her face after she won
2 move checkmate is what that's called
Lmao
Ai yo whatdaa fock
“I’m just gonna play a normal chess game” wins next move*
I remember using that move once when i play with my cousin when i was a kid, and it's hilarious af
He did this on purpose. Right? Please say right
0:22 lmao look at shlats face
Big oof
this smart person was too dumb
Physical recovery: 2 days Mental Recovery: 2 months Dignity Recovery: yeet.

Me doesn't even know hot to play chess also me What an idiot
How does this have half a million likes?
Bro this cheak is like the first thing you get to know when you play chess with experienced players
Okay, could someone who knows chess explain this checkmate to me?
Wow
That's actually the fastest way you could win
someone tell me that isnt jade from victorious
Schlatt: I'm so good at chess, the game ended so fast
I don't understand what happened I play checkers
Lol it was his foolishness
either schlatt is dumb or his oppenent was a god
I love how he hyped him self up and even said “she not gonna see this coming” like he was gonna win      But we all saw what happened 😂
His reaction 😂
Queen's Gambit could have been a lot shorter is what this tells me.
fools mate lmao
This has a term call Fool's Mate
😂 Shlatt hears just she saying umm  shlatt
take that beach!
I actually did the same thing yesterday
me when the
Sigh
What an idiot. Lmao jkjk ik the truth
Schlatt?
world record
I dunno who got the bigger surprise, this guy or Eren after Reiner and Bertholt outed themselves as the armored and colossal titan.
We all know that he did it on purpose, it was all calculated, clearly.
Is he that stoopid tho
Faker
He died
HIM: She is not gonna see. HER: *YOU TRIGGERED MY TRAP CARD*
Every chess player knows dont do that dont
Le coup du berger en francais
His face after he lost 😂😂😂
that awkward silence after jshlatt looses lmfao
“Schlatt?”
The fact that she took a minute to look at it like "Wait, did he really just..." just makes it even better
Caught my girl with this once...she is now my ex
THIS IS HILARIOUS lmfao
What just happened? How it happened?
I can win in 0 moves. step 1: Play someone with dimensia step 2: before game starts tell them to look step 3: when they move pieces to that you win step 4: when he asked what happened you say....we played and you won
HER FACE WAS PERFECT
I don’t understand I’m not good at chess
How he loss is because if she moved her queen to E4 he would be in checkmate because he cant move any peices to block and the king can only move diagonal in this situation which is where the queen would be
What kind of speedrun is this?
You just got wrecked son!
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooof
Thats how he lost his 4th cannon life
The Airship Fortress music is a nice touch tbh
I know it was on purpose but yea funny video
"E4" Resigns
I really should NOT take this video seriously but this technique in chess is called "Fools mate " or "two-move checkmate" , it can only work if your team is the black team, just wanted to show this to anyone who is interested.
He is still in shock.
XQC? That you?
Pro : I can win a match in 2 minutes. Schlatt : I can lose a match in 2 moves.
The move is going to be called "The Fool's Schlatt" From now on
The signature look of superiority
0:22😧 XD
nothing better than the good ol fool’s mate
he was soo confused lmao
Accurate rappresentation of his president Role in the dream SMP
schlatt is fast
Fun fact: This is literally the fastest checkmate in Chess. It's called the Fool's Mate.
he lost on purpose
See you on 5 or so years
I do not understand anything here
staged
Epic
F in the chat
literally the fastest way to lose
Finally, someone who is on the same level of chess playing as me!
There's no way this isn't staged right?
8.4 million people really wanted to see schlatt lose a chess game in 2 moves
Dumpass 😂😂😂😂
Wait what was he trying to do before he lost
0:23 Expressions😂😂😂
XD XD XD
*she did not see that coming*
When you have the same application and you know the movement 😎
u so stupid, that's the oldest checkmate method in the book! but also never obvious, not really hating
the moment when he messed up
hes lost 27 of my life
It's actually impressive how schlatt found the quickest way to lose
hIS REACTION
Dame dane da me nu
AHAHAHAHAHHAH
He never play a chest in his life or smth? I won several matches within my family with that move when my opponent randomly chose that specific move set. It's literally a forbidden first move here in my family because it's simply asking to end the game.
What was he trying to do?
so staged :D
This video has more views than his most popular video on his main channel…
I once did this on my dad it was HILARIOUS
Owned lmao
BIG BRAIN 1000
He did this on purpose...I’m sure. Why else would he play f3?
😂😂😂
You don't mess with the GM
EPICCCCO     CHESS MOMENTO!
Schlatt.exe is not responding

Yah I know it's foolmate now.Plz stop stating fun fact
Im even worser than him at the game😭😂
LOL
I've seen this as soon I saw the thumbnail  i saw how this man just lost
Me playing chess on expert.
I just used this move 5 years ago in a chess tournament, my opponent was shocked and pissed at the same time. I haven't heard from him maybe he committed suicide
Haha it’s like what Charlie did to XQC but staged!
Music
Good lord
The Fool's Mate.
Honestly, and this could be just cause i'm not good at chess, but I did not see what he was going for.
The best way to win chess is to play with schlatt.
His brain is melting rn
That "I love Chess :)" in the background makes it even funnier
I like it how he has in his background "I live chess" but instantly looses after 2 moves
_wat_
I love the moment he moved his second pawn, the girl made a face that looks like she saying "are you kidding me?"
You look a bit of a Fool, mate.😄
I m gonna die of laughing🤣🤣🤣
bruh the people who say this is scripted REALLY don’t know who schlatt is
dumbass
BRUH
This goes to show the power of the fools chest. Schlatt almost couldn't Handel the power as he immediately went into something known as "pog paralysis"   My point exactly. He immediately could tell what was going on the second he began force-pogging. As quick as he could he went into a meditative state, a trick for escape that only the most legendary of Alpha's have a knowledge of.
My man thought he would win and karma struck him in the face
Fake. Scripted.
Schlatt?
Bonk
"She's not gonna see this one coming" - Bill Cosby
Well this was fun game of chest like did u guys like his move oh yeah that move was sick
LMFAOOOOO

Fact :Only the black chess side can do so in 2 moves

The worlds fastest game of chess
crazy how he lost in this way
Dang that was so funny ;))))
It was at this moment he knew, he “faked “up
A good ol’ fools mate. Fools mate is getting checkmate in two moves
I did this to my friend for 3 times. Somehow he keeps on not noticing that his king is at risk.
nice scripted
“She’s not gonna see this one” Top 10 quotes before disaster
I did this today and I was so proud of myself
don,t put the side pawns first people
he's right, she didn't see such an idiotic move coming
He still proccesing what just happen he even more confused than me and i dont even know how to play chess.
I love karma! ;)
He knew what he was doing. He is all about content 🤣
I remember this happening to me. I felt that facial expression...
Can we just appreciate how there's the "airship fortress" music in the background from MKDS (Mario Kario DS) Edit:lel i meant kart not kario
fools mate really?
I used that move on my classmate and won two times in a row but not in two moves
Everything he said was true
cheese
Fastest fights in history lmao.
If I ever lose a chess game in two moves, I will never forget that day, it will hunt me for the rest of my chess career.
How did she win ????
Plz can anyone sub here
I like when he loses both of'em was like:𝗵𝘂𝗺𝗼𝗿 𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝗼𝗻 𝗺𝘆 𝗽𝗮𝗶𝗻
Anyone explain? Idk anything about chess
What is the music called? I like it
ERROR 404
People rather watch an idiot play chess then watch their math class
Welcome to chess
This makes no sense.Can someone tell me how it makes sense
Who are they?
Who else rewatched this video about 25 times?
I didn't know that was a move
:(
Schlatt?
that looks like sub 0:20
Yeah, not scripted... at... all...
*Roundabout by Yes start playing*
This is literally so dumb and intellectual of both of them at the same time that it seems that it is scripted which it may or may not be
0:08 I'm going to put this on the center of the board, nothing to see here
I thought it was impossible for anyone to unironically get fool's mated.
What a classic. This move only works on people who have never played chess before. This means botox predicted that schlatt sucked at chess.
Hahahahahha
i didnt even know you could get chekmatted in 2 moves ill be honest
Schlatt: Shes not going to see this coming... yes. she didnt see you losing after two moves
wait i have no idea how this chess works at all can someone explain to me how she won like im a 6 year old

I sense a disturbance in the youtube algorithm any second
And I thought XQC was garbage at chess

As a chess player, though not an expert, I looked at the title and knew what happened without even seeing the thumbnail.

John 3:16-17 16. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen!

Never, never, under any circumstances move the F pon
That schlatt? At the end,I cant...😂
World record
i dont understand, someone explain
He did actually
I don’t understand how did he lose
Too bad this is staged for views
So bad
Fact: this is the fastest way to checkmate ur opponent (  *2 move checkmate* )
According to the legends he is still in the call and silent
Black: Omaiwa mou shindeiru.  White: NANI?
You got clapped by a girl in two moves fam I wouldn’t do that if I were you
There's something about smart girls. 🔥 And there's nothing about Tik-Tok girls.

Nice reaction hahahahaha
What happened?
roasted😂😂😂😂
Next up: Schlatt loses a chess game in 1 move - your computer has run out of *battery*
Chess any% speedrun glitchless        Meme done, now serious question. What did he think he could do? Why did he think that was a good idea?
The face you make, when you find out your girlfriend is more "gamer" Than you
It was at this moment he knew
That wouldn't be a check mate, it would be a stalemate
"She's not gonna see it coming" Very poor choice of words
To You 6 Years In The Future
I was playing chess with my dad and remembered this video  It ended up working out to be the fastest I have ever checkmated someone
Schlatt’s face at the end killed me
Big guy.
so there really is a way to beat someone lower than 4 moves
The "Schlatt?" at the end makes this video 10 times funnier
as someone who doesn't understand chess, what is this supposed to mean?

Believe what He did for you on the cross, He took your sins all of them and took the punishment for you and died on the cross for your sin and GOD rose Him on the 3rd day being sinless Himself to die for you and took your place ✝ Believe in your heart Jesus died for your sins and GOD rose Him on the 3rd day and confess with your mouth Lord Jesus and thou shall be Saved! (read Romans 10:9-10 KJV)Jesus Christ will save you from your sin and hell just Repent and believe in Him!! He will change your heart and your life supernaturally! He loves you more than anyone! That cry in the night He hears it and cares so much and wants you to know HIM through His Son Jesus Christ.

GOD bless you reading this you were meant to see this.
I did this move when i was 10 years old
Task failed successfully
ah yes the iconic fools mate
I defeated my big sister three times in a row using this and after that I laughed so hard she was so new to chess and I was an ok player lol
There is a reason this opening is called as a Fool's Checkmate
It is fake
nobody: Bots in chess on very easy mode
ooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 🤯🤯🤯
A queen in angland
She was just like  R u dom???
My friend said that if he beat me in 4 move i will have to serve him for a week and... freak i lose in 4 move :/
u can see the hope in his eyes die
*I think I messed up*
Am I the only one who literally has no idea how she won that
I keep watching this again and again!!!
People that move those pawns like that so early trigger the hell out of me. Why do even want to play if you are just going to do that?
The well known "Stone Cold" mate: arrive, raise hell, leave
I once beat someone with this. It was so funny.
Well she didn’t see it coming
Bro start your opening on the middle. Always
I master the black more than white but sometimes I want it to be quick and pick white
“. . . Schlatt?”
And he was buried in the chess courtyard 😂
Schlat be like: o—————————————————o
Ah yes the fools gambit
Do you believe in God? And are you saved? If so go tell someone else and tell them to tell someone else if not then go read the Bible take Jesus as your saver. If you don't want to then well you don't have to......
This, Ladies and Gentlemen, is called a Foolsmate, the fastest way to end a game of chess.
Name of song pls
How did this happen how did he lose
She doesn't see what
wait what, what
2 move win
can someone tell me what happened
I love how he doesn't do the best first move in chess
You gotta hate loosing to a fools mate
this happens to me in too many online chess games
1 Move?
Can someone explain why he lost?
Fun fact. This is clearly fake
"she didn't see it coming though" 0:14
Anyone care to explain for the people who don’t know how to play chess
Kings gambit.
This is big brain tim..... OH SHIT

She said "I'm about to end this man's whole career"

Oh no as soon as she moved the pawn I saw it coming

100% not staged
I get the feeling he got his King and Queen pieces mixed up.
I mean... he’s right. She didn’t see it coming.
Worst acting I've ever seen 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
Y'all know Why Am I here :p
Can some one explain how that works? I didn't get how he lose
Why he look like Christ From Mr. Beast Gang?
Behind the scenes please :)
i always win using that trick  But not with my father
Alex Botez is cool and all but chad critikal would've done it in 0 moves
The best part is that theres an “i love chess” in the background
Why are you stopping the video right before the flashback

It wasn’t a failure, he was trying to speedrun losing. He did a great job.
Wow yeah hes right she didnt see that coming I mean who know thing the game would be over THAT fast? 😂
What a smart big man
Brooooii
This is clearly fake. Maybe he didn't told botez about it but surely he intentionally played those moves. So that he can make a funny clip. Very much obvious because no one plays like this.
*record scratch* Yup, that’s me, you’re probably wondering how I ended up in this situation.

you have to be dumb to let an oppening on your king
FOOLS MATE!!!!! lmao
Can sb explain to me what Schlatt's plan was supposed to be???
He let her do a foolsmate on him, I always try a fools mate first and I usually fail. ;-;
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand Checkmate
Her: Omae wa mou Shindeiru Him: *NANI?*
"She's not going to see this coming"  *No one saw that coming*
Bruh that was so fast way to loss dude.

I like how it totally becomes silent when she wins the match lol 😂😂
This is the trailer to The Queen's Gambit 2
I don't see logic in chess game, Dama is way more logic and better.
Script.
Hehe
Wow she used the most risky maneuver possible
I love how he wrote "I Love Chess" In background 🤣
GG
I played chess and didnt eve knew that is posible to lose that fast because who the fuck leave King in danger like that
theres only 1 possible specific combination of moves to lose in 2 turns, and my man chose it
bruh
Shortest game I've seen😂😂
That was a fun chess speedrun
SIMP!!!
1st move: gets the bishop out 2nd move: *blocks the bishop*
I really wanted to listen to the conversation that followed after this.😂
Excuse me, for I am chess illiterate, but what the *fuck* just happened?
schlatt.exe stopped working
How tf!
That was the most badass reaction anyone could give at that moment
I guess the "I love chess" in the background isn't mutual
😂😂😂
He completely exposed his King which couldn't move anywhere to protect itself. Leaving the queen to instantly K.O the sucker
This has to be a bit right
What he was even trying to do tho? I dont see the strategy here, he just make its own horse and alfil uncapable to move
This is the fastest way anyone has *accidentally* won a game of chess
*_C    h    e    c    k    m    a    t     e._*
F
Heyyy i did this to in my tournament hahahahaha
Slatt.exe has stopped working.. :(
Methinks he forgot the the queen vs the king
juja experto del ajedrez
...this is staged right?
But you see, the king was just a puppet to the church and the true masterminds were the bishops.
I remember losing by two moments in the past, that's when I realized I was bad at chess XD
I cringed at the fact that he actually did a fool’s mate.
Things like this was the reason why I feared people in elementary school who let Queens out early lol.
Schlatt:she wont see this coming She technically didnt she didnt expect to win so quickly
Get rekt m8 🤣
He didn't lose, he just won backwards
Uh...someone call a tow truck. This dude just got REKT.
FOOLMATE
get foolsmated
The schlatt at the end
Haha I remember doing a fools mate to a cocky player who said he'll beat me easy, 2 moves later he ran away crying.
Poor little Timmy has no hands, so for Christmas I got him gloves 🧤 Everything’s okay though...      He hasn’t even opened it yet
Last time I checked...       No one asked
his face in the end😂😂
oh shit bidule😂
Its edited clip he wasn,t check mate he can dedmfend himself.
...Schlatt?
Protagonists vs sidekick
메.. 모...
"and thats how my journey started in chess" - GM Schlatt 15 years later ...
Love it when they fall for this 😂
Yes she didn't see this reaction coming.
Real life surprised pikachu face
HACKER LOL
schlatt can definitely get into a chess tournament with that strategic move
Feel like she wouldn't have seen it if the game didn't notify her
I didn't know it was possible to lose in 2 moves, I thought it required a minimum of 3. I guess you can lose in 2 if you help the opponent pull it off =)
This guy make xQc look smart
I dont play chess so i dont understand how he lost
Isn't this one the world famous Fool's Mate?
The face tho
Bro this dude looks like Tony Soprano's son.
I think thid idbcalled a fools mate
Like we say in french : mat du berger !
YOU JUST GOT FOOLS MATED SON
Clutch
Schlatt was like I don't need a brain anymore
Probably that board in the back  plays better than this big guy......
Ahh yes fool's move
Why do i feel like it was pre planned they both agreed to this.  Edit: is she also a chess player or just playing for fun? Idk any of these people
YOU'LL NEVR SE IT COMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENG
staged
0:24 kids these days
Faker than my mother in law eyebroes
Schlatt?
People in the highest rank in every game would do the same thing
OMG 🤣
RIPPP😂😂
I didn't know it was even possible to lose in two moves. So much to learn...
Legend has it, he still doesn't know what hit him!
"She's not gonna see this one coming"  Black Queen: **Takes a step**  Schlatt: **Internal silent screaming**
Don't you have anything faker?
This has to be staged even if schlatt never heard of fools mate there’s no way he could fall for that
All that matters to me is how long has he played chess and also how long has she played chess also
What
Chess SIMP
0:22 schlatt exe has stopped working
schlatt is such a funny guy
Hubris worthy of a Greek tragedy
Big guy had never been opposed with a being of this power and is stunned briefly.
Lmfao
So staged
I guess he doesn't love chess anymore lol.
This is why checkers is better.
Shot on iphone meme
Thank you for showing me the way how to win everyone lmao
i somewhat think this is scripted...
truly disgusting, that some "people" would do such horrible a thing
This seems staged.
Her face made this video.
That’s rough....but that’s chess hahaha
entregou de propósito :D
По технике Ботвинникова победила
I hope his love life doesn’t reflect this performance
The comedic composition of this video is brilliant and peak "2021" comedy, from music cutting abruptly to switches between his shock and her badass glare
Well, at least he got the spirit.
Me, not understanding how chess works  Also me: "I am very confused rn"
Shlatt="shes not gonna see this one comin" Alex="SO U HAVE CHOSEN DEATH"
Check mate
Fake video. This game is already a world record for being fastest to win. Youtuber's will crap out anything to get more likes and subscribers.
Big guy with small brain
Fake
WUT
I think chess is bullshit
speedrun
That look at the end makes it 100 times better
Was this staged?
Thought it was gonna be alt f4
Fake and gay.
Can barely tell this is fake
Schlatt the nub
This literally makes you give up on life like holy hrck
Xqc: FINALLY A WORTHY OPPONENT OUR BATTLE WILL BE LEGENDARY
Hillarious :D LOL
That's weird, womens never wins
It is more impressive to lose by this method than to win by this method.                       - Sun Tzu
She didn't see that coming.. You didn't either 😔
Hahahahhaha that's look is so Hilarious...🤣🤣🤣🤣
They be like  Alex: 🤨 Jschlatt: 😧
why does everyone have the exact same comment
It was at this moment he knew he fuked up
How is Schlatt the corrupt and evil president of the dream smp, but loses a chess game in 2 TURNS?🤨
This has gotta be staged LOL
i am dumb and don’t know how to play chess because nobody had the time to teach me so i’m confused as to why’she won
The "Shclatt?" at the end.
BRUH I'M DYING!!! HILARIOUS!!!
Why is this video in my recommendation, why this guy so thick and why this video got so many views...
“She isn’t going to see this coming” Yeah, she didn’t
Schlatt: She's not gonna see this coming. He wasn't wrong. She definitely didn't see that coming.
Such a  noob
Pwned. :D
Çoban matı LOL
Thats the dumbest way to get checkmate in chess like wtf
Fool’s mate
Oh god he's worse than xQc
"she's not gonna see this coming"    Neither did he
fake
Its kinda his own fault
Why did she have to end his career like that? I thought he loved chess.
Wait..I though I invented that move,,,,
Yea I'm sure he did that on purpose to get them views
Why are their faces so good at the end im dying
Bro I hear that Mario kart music epic
Fake. Feminazi propaganda.
The moment i see the second move   "oh f..."
How did she even win?! I don’t play chess so I’m gonna need someone to explain this win to me
that was called a fool's mate
Me:*saw the title and thumbnail* then see what is happening in the thumbnail Me:oh shit thats smart
Good thing for Schlatt is, you never fall for that move twice.
I know nothing about chess. Can someone explain to me how she won?
How do u play chess
I mean... it does takes A LOT of skill to find the one move that loses you the game ngl.
RP
Schlatt: She’s not gonna see this coming Schlatt’s Opponent: Hold my beer
I feel like it was kind of scripted.
Anyone else thought these two were born ten years earlier than they were?
I did that to a kid once, he was pissed
I've won a chess game in four moves before, but never TWO
Schlatt:She is not gonna see this coming Alex: I'm about to end this man's whole career
My god.... wait
When the enemy pays guards to reveal the secret passage to the king's chamber.
I did the exact thing to a friend in school and they were so confused it was hilarious
can someone that really know about chess explain what happened ?
I love chess         It backfired
Wa wa waaaa!!!
He did that on purpose
"Curb your overconfidence"
Nice DS Airship Fortress music in the background
Context please? What happened?
Which king was so rudely killed 😂😂
This guy is getting so many subs in like 3 months
What am I missing here? She can't move her king like that.
hahaha broke him xD
I am curious to know what was he trying to do. I can't see any fancy moves from that position that no one will see coming.
She defo didnt see it coming 😂😂 she didnt expect you to be that dumb
Ngl getting knocked out with a fool's mate is even worse than losing to barber's mate.
what
I did not even realize what she did at first.
Xqc ain’t got shit on schlatt
Schlatt vs xqc
How do you play chest tho? 🤔
Reaction was gold.
LOL
someone donate me an Apple iPad pro pls
Looks kinda fake
What¿🤔💩
I can't stop laughing🤣😂
not only he got checkmated in 2 moves, he said he opened with g4 to bring out his bishop, but blocked himself with f3 next move. idk what's going on in his head man
Her: Wins in 2 moves Me: Takes 100+ moves to beat my sister who just started
Wait how did she win? (Sori I'm a chess noob)
Wait how
Lost in 20s... not like I was counting or anything.
I learned about this checkmate when I first started chess, as soon as I saw “2 moves” I knew what was coming
Damn
0:15 Alexandra: 😁🤨🤔 checkmate
btw it's a 2200 elo vs 400, Mike Tyson vs a child
that's called "checkmate of the fool"
Think his processor broke down
I have a feeling that on the back of his body the words "I LOVE CHESS" will be changed into "CURSED YOU, CHESS!"😂
Lol see his reaction at the end😂
But that’s not checkmate wtf he could’ve put his queen infront
jschlatt: shes not gonna see this coming  *seconds later*  *jaw drops*
Hahaahahaha
Bro
you have a name for yourself as an opening or gambit
Fools mate
This is anime fights without all the flashback would look like
please please fix your hair
Fake lol
I hate these 2 moves, it's the most annoying thing you can do to someone
“She is not going see this one coming.”  DJ Khaled: “Congratulations. You played yourself.”
Lol
I feel dumb for asking this, but can someone please explain what happened? I don’t really know how to play chess, so I’m confused.
We actually call this "Napoleon's move" so it ain't new to us (well dad taught me that) and that's the only technique ik so...     Go easy on meh ._.
Grilled cheese.
My dude literally crashed like a old computer xD
I don't understand how she won
Anyway why let yourself, a random twitch guy (who may not have much chess xp), get fools-mated by a girl who's had experience in competitive chess before? I think that's kinda ... Gullible unless you've done the same and are just doing it to surprise her?  Most decent chess players wouldn't play f3 and g4 as the first two moves ... If this guy understands why.  Ok. Apart from the 'She's not gonna see this fucking coming' i think the rest of it is just crap playing by nature.
AHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😆😂 read and learned about fool's mate, didn't expect to see it in a youtube video 12 years later 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆 hartston is my chess role model
That's evil
slatt
But the king can only move 1 space
fake. But chess meme, nice
He's not wrong.
Rekt
HER FACE WHEN SHE SAW HIM MOVE HIS SECOND PIECE WAS JUST SO FUNNY
That was... Something
I cant tell if this was even staged because of the comments
He let her win...
I played chess for 5 years and i evev did not know you can loss for three moves
I wonder if anyone has legitimately lost this way
It's a fool's mate. Most frustrating thing 😂
She was so obviously going for a queen's opening and the mf opens up his king to her. Does he think about his moves or does he just do it? Either way, video is hilarious.
Fixed!
Thats my relation with Minecraft redstone
that was fast!
His face 😂😂😂 I played chess when I was younger, I’ve actually never seen a game end this fast. 😂
Schlatt: Moves to g4  Me: I know where this is going
fools gambit is the funniest thing ever
I have no idea how to play chess someone explain.
*After this im very sure he is dying inside😂*
😂😂😂 bc
whats the song called in the background?
What we learn :  LESS TALKING, WORK MORE
which mario song is it?
Black: I'm about to do what's called a pro gamer move Schlatt: ._.
that is the girl that could defeat the Chess BOT xd
And he didn’t even get the bishop out lol
Black Won!?
Play the Persona 5 music! You Never See it COMING!
Comments:5%normal                  95%:she is not gonna she this coming
Wtf He finds a way to loose in two steps . Wtf There is a board behind him which says i love chess
I had won against my brother the same way when I was 7
The only thing I'm paying attention to is her mic position rip
Was so staged and planned
Imagine speedruning on chess tournament
Legend says he never played chess again
Seemed like schlatt had an entire math sequence in his head to determine each and every move possible  Just to get fucking checkmated in two moves
Schlatt?
00:23 when u say u r gona fail but ended up being a University gold medalist
Big guy
Fool's mate!
Nah it was a tactical loss
is she a Phantom Thief?  Cuz you never saw that coming
Fun fact: This is literally the fastest checkmate in Chess. It’s called the Fool’s Mate.
I like how she closes a little of her eyes before do check-mate. XD
This is a glitch right?
POV 15th century: this woman is a witch
This is my favorite video in YouTube so far. 🤣
What happened was the crown can move 4 spaces in any angular direction, Schlatt unwilling made a pathway for the crown to go to one end of the bord then strait to the king, thus making it checkmate.
Oh my God this dude. He did a dumb
Alex: “You may have...not outsmarted me but I outsmarted your not outsmarting”
Lmao
This is staged sorry
bruh
0:19 When your whole life rolls before your eyes:
0:03 The confidence is unreal 😂😂
UNO reversed Card
She’s not gonna see, it's fucking kill me :> xDDD
LMAO
“You were right about one thing master,              the negotiations were short....”
I thought that 4 steps  was the fastest chekmate for white,now i know there's 2,even it goes 1:1000 times
This has gotta be staged.
WASTED
“Outstanding move!”
0:19  ZA WARUDO
Rumour has it that the whiteboard behind him has been edited now.
Haha 🤣 he don't even check before he move
🤣Destroyed by miss botez
I’m not kidding, I literally did this the other day
Jschlatt obviously let her win. The board says he loves chess and the board doesn’t lie
LOL
ya ha ha you found me
Schlatt: I am...inevitable.  Alex: And I...am...Iron Man!
This is chess WWE. Cause it's staged.
The only good thing about this is that he could lose even faster which is quite unbelievable.
Fools mate.
she did, in fact, did not see that coming.
Schlatt.exe  has stopped working.
This man go out terrible...no quicker way u could possibly lose..
“She’s not going to see this coming, hehe”  Her: Hold my beer
Thats called fools mate not check mate
"She's not gonna see this one coming." - Famous last words
Is this scripted?
How many of you thought white was gonna win
Not gonna lie man I woulda done the same thing u did
These are the exact moves I play during a match if I want it to end seriously
"She not gonna see it coming"  Shouldn't've said that, shouldn't've said that
I straight up lost in one move one time
Fool's mate....kinda suits this situation right
guy: she is not gonna see this coming  girl: uno reverse card ya bish yo gotta issue? guy: *processing power literally fucken died*
I love chess
That girl is supersmart or guy is super dumb.
Fun fact: you didn’t search for this
*BIG BRAIN* 💪🧠
*checkmate* Schlatt: :O Alex: *schlatt?*
His reaction was priceless lmao
This is scripted
Indian🇮🇳 k sath kavi khalo  girl loose
And that’s how you destroy guy’s ego
This is a big ass rookie mistake lmao. She didn't even set anything up for it.
LMAO
This was scripted because probability of this move is almost 0 and that too in a stream
Lol
7.1 Millions human get fooled
I like to think this is what meruem and komugi reincarnated into
-inhale -               You never see it COOOOMIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIING!!!        Also this got me motivated to play chess. Won against the AI twice.
Chess is WACK but my new VIDEO JUST DROPPED GET HYPE!!
What even happened i don't play chess
Thats the fastest checkmate
I like his reaction on the last move.
El mate del loco jaja
What the fuck happened 😂 his reaction tho 😂
He was so confident 🤣😭✋
Hehe. I can try this on my fiance! 😏
LOL
"She is not gonna see this one coming"  "YOU didn't see it coming?"
As a wise man once said- U didn't see that coming.
Tbf she probably didn’t see that coming
can someone explain what the fuck happened
Gotta love fools gambit.
When you are in first in kahoot but u get it wrong and ur at the bottom for the rest of the game
Esa tecnica en mexico se le conoce como al pastor, y lo se bien por que de las primeras partidas que tuve de ajedrez me la aplicaron cuando aprendi a jugar desde la secundaria, hace 7 años Por lo que se me hace chistoso que, si bien sabe de ajedrez no se diera cuenta de ese error facil de notar, al menos despues de varias derrotas desastrosas que tuve yo XD
"She's not gonna see this one coming"
Schlatt wasn't american enough to beat her
"she's not gonna see this one coming"   famous last words
W h a t
Song used for this vid?
That smile
Outstanding move
Only Legends know where the background music is from
I love how her reaction starts with: Is he trying to bait me?
Fake.
So this is the Queen's Gambit show everyone is talking about.
Theres still a move left shes probably not gonna like it.
this seems fake ..... no one does that opening  for white it has no merit to it
Epic
My friend did this to me and I was so pissed
i love her facial expression lmfao
Staged
Obviously done on purpose
.
ez script video xD
Real ones know where this music is from
I am just gonna play simple chess, she said.
Cancel him
Every single comment be like "" She's Not Gonna See This Coming--""
So... Is this not the normal chess, bc it looked like she checkmated the Queen instead of King? I'm confusion xD
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH... BAHAHAHA
THAT FACE
Reminds me of that one guy I played once who kept boasting about how good he was at chess and then proceeded to fall for the Scholar's Mate
Jdododoskwosndd
lose
"sChLaTt??"
I dont know what happened
Yeah that's literally a baby move
What was he trying to do anyway??
Haha
"she's not gonna see this coming"     Famous last words
He  wanted to impress the girl with new opening but forgets that the girl is master in chess.😂😂😂😂😂
Is he like the foreign Samay Raina lol ?
I feel bad for this guy now
Dam he got clapped
*She’s not gonna see this fucking coming*
was his last expression acting?
😐
See you all in 5 years
This was set up xD
'She's not gonna see this coming'. He was right. Cuz he had to see that coming.
Schlatt?
Yes
"Haha she never gonna see it coming"
WTF
You are gay, because you lost to a girl...and this is very gay.
Why the farmer on the right side can't destroy the queen???
I read schlatt wins a chess game in 2 moves I was like  Me:wait someone wins in 2 moves I want to watch But I love this either way basically know nothing about this game so can someone explain the game please?
0:05 Player 2: Connected 0:19 Player 2: Disconnect
_Jabami Yumeko in chess be like_
Next he'll master the wooden shield to round up his xQc repertoire
If this was a joke and you made it just for fun then,I guess its OK and you win my  vote for it but if this was serious then I'd say you are freaking stupid. Don't play chess.
The dreaded TWO-MOVE 'Ass-Ream' Checkmate!
She won her first trophy when she was around 8. Of course she beats him quickly.
Drac esrever onu ↩️
Famous last words
Play bitch games, win bitch prizes lmao men need to step down
Lol
Waiting for those 15 minutes videos 'bout this match
His reaction
Lol😂
scripted why would he even choose to move his pawns and leave his king unguarded
She really didn't see it coming but neither did he.
That was so perfect I genuinely don't know if that was scripted or not
“She’s not gonna see this coming”  Well yes, but actually no
This cant be queens Gambit this was uhh, fools mate or something
Truly disgusting that some "people" would do this horrible thing
thats called fools mate
Fools mate. The worst possible thing to happen in chess
what was he trying to do, though? Can anyone tell
Why am I here, I never played chess.  Edit 2 years later: This clip got me into chess, I love it Edit 3 years later: This clip got me into chess? Lol I forgot
I don't know how to play chess so I don't know anything what happened
I have finally seen a 2 move checkmate
Schlatt loses a chess game in 2 seconds      6.9M People : Interesting
Schlatt.exe has stopped responding
It was the logical move 🤣
MY FRIENDS TOILD ME THIS YESTERDAY! YOUR REACTION IS JUST PRICELESS! LMAOOOOO
"she's not gonna see this coming"  famous last words
I don’t play chess. What happened?
Judging by the expression of her face,,, Yep, she's definitely didn't she that coming.. Lol
this was more staged that the wwe
I would say that it was staged, but I have lost a game of chess in this exact way before. The look on his face at the end just about sums up the experience.
the schlatt at the end and the cut just made it 20 times better
Staged
Can someone explain this to me???
beat a guy with the same moves once, it was hilarious
I have no Idea what i am watching right now. I dont play chess. I dont even know the rules....
Woman always right. That's why the queen (woman) go to the right and wins it
His board says "I LOVE CHESS"   Just like how I "LOVE" my school
Schaltt is an XQC Disciple.
Lmao there reaction 😂
Ah, yes, the second fastest way to lose in chess, only second to resigning after the first move.
Did she move her King? Isnt the black king placed on the black square?
My friend: you are not that failure. Me:
“She is not gonna she this coming” He was right she didn’t
you did good 👍
In Germany we call this "Idiotenmatt" This translates to "idiot checkmate"
Nice setup :/
"She's not gonna see this coming" "Sore wa dou kana"
I hope this just prank.
YouTube asked me to watch this
Khatam....bye bye Tata goodbye....gaya😂😂
Schlatt??
But how did this happen
The reactions are priceless 😂
His face tells you how he feels
When you have it all thought out for the offense, but forgot about defense
time of me watching this rn it has 6.9M views
Fact that this has 69 lakh views
“She’s not gonna see this coming” Well yes but actually no
Queen's gambit in a nutshell
It's a very good example of fool's mate
He is doing it on purpose tho right? Or am I not getting something?
this is what actually introduced me to schlatt
That I love chess in the background is worse than sarcasm.
Oof
That's rough buddy.
I have made the same mistake many times thinking my king was the queen
Hahaha their reactions are funny as heck
Am I the only one that doesn’t even slightly understand chess
Basicly a bot in chess
Otra victima del pastor
😂😂no mames even tho I don’t understand to play chess this was funny how he lost just that quick
Call an ambulance but not for me.
" shes not gonna see this fuckin coming "  GAME !
a friend and i were at a con and found this harry potter stand w playable chess and asked me "u know the rules to like play?" "yeah" and mf did this
I’ve never seen someone’s happiness shatter this quickly, he went from 😀 to 😦
My dad did this to my mom once xD
Wait, why did she won?
"She's not gonna see this coming"  No u
Queens Gambit baby
I love the look on her face before she moves her queen. Like "...Did he really just do that? Idiot."
Who plays g4 and f3 as game opener? Really now? You just earned an oscar for this set up performancw
That was planned  There’s no way he would do that and it’s the only way for someone to lose in two moves
Famous laat words   Shes not going to see this  coming
*Chess In a nutshell, but It's a speedrun.*
Literally everyone: bruh
Ah the fools mate, my favorite
No mames le hicieron la del tonto xd
THE BIG MAN'S CRIBBAGE BOARD
Nobody saw this coming
Schlatt: “She’s not going to see this coming!!!!  Alex: “(so what do you want on your tombstone?)”
This kids is what you call a "Pro gamer move"
This is so obviously done on purpose.
Uh...you can't move the King like that. It's in the queen position but that was a king looking piece. I get the confusion.
The og mario kart music in the back tho
That is why I move my rook pawns up so that cannot be done
That was for the camera
"You fool! You fell victim to one of the classic blunders!".
The acting was so bad!
I can't understand, what happened?
"She's not gonna see this coming"  *I am four parallel universes ahead of you*
Ah the fools gambit
The fastest game ever
Mat de berge
LMFAO
This was a setup scenario, funny but don't think he actually got outskilled here.
This is my trauma when I was kid playing this with my mom
This man career end here all time spent and all practice is finished .
I sure this is a very common rookie mistake because I remember getting beaten by this move several times before learning the standard defensive configuration (whatever its called) and almost every time you proceed to set it up you are aware of the danger of that queen making that exact move. Thank god I was no good because I fucking hate chess, or is it the other way around.
Maybe he mixed up the king and queen pieces.  Otherwise, he is probably the worst chess player I’ve ever seen.
That’s why he had the goat skin in the Dream smp animatics.     I have nothing personal about him, that was just a joke and I am neutral to him just like Sweden in WW2
Poor noob
Whats the app?
Why does he look like a ripoff of Chris from Mr Beast?
wow
actually it can't possible because the black king and queen from above are switched.secret fact.
This moistcririkal vs xqc speedrun edition
The look on his face😂😂
Ouch.
Not gonna lie, I had the same reaction as this guy 😶
omg. I'm quite shocked
My man is clinically dead after that play.
Outstanding move
Complete scripted piece of shit!  better content deserve YT recommendations and views
You know this is totally set up right
She’s not ganna see this coming  She:room shambles
I guessed this move before they played , because it happened to me😵
Magic
Hahaha noob
this must be a joke this opening is called something like the fool's opening
Until you realize pause at 0:09 he could have checkmate her in 2 moved himself
Is the guy just a noob chess player or did he just didn't see it coming?
The queen of sharingan
100% staged. This is not a natural game. "She's never gonna see that coming." - what exactly? Making these two moves results in nothing except your own loss.
She ended his whole career 🤣😂
Big oof on his pride 🤯😵
This should be a speedrun...
Me not playing chess cuz it is time-consuming. Meanwhile Alex: Hold my move...
Call an ambulance But not for me
Ooofff
I don’t believe this is real, as pretty much anyone who loves chess would know about the world’s shortest chess game
Lol his face
I got played like that once but it was 4 moves
I've seen 3 videos like this. Fake as hell.
Big OOF
Dios, que cosa tan épica tío jajaja.
Loves to play chess but makes the mistake of leaving king unguarded
I love how everybody fell silent.
Bro he looked so sad.. 😭
0:18 her expression said it all
what a noob
When a queen give u a marrige proposal...
'she's not gonna see this coming' *I'm 'bout to end this man's whole career*
'she's not gonna see this coming' *I'm 'bout to end this man's whole career*
W h a t    i s    t h e    s o n g
Can you people shut up with your "shes not gonna bla bla" bullshit comments?  Its only funny for the first 10.000 times...
Thats staged

Wow. This couldn't possibly be staged for clicks=money......
This dude has no idea.  Haha
I just came to see cause she looks fit.
I don't know Rick, looks fake to me 😁
Queen’s gambit or something idk never watched the show
She was playing him like a fidle all the time.
I don't get it
Imagine getting humiliated on a video with millions of views.
Truly disgusting that some "people" would do this horrible thing.
Anime battles if they didn’t show every characters’ monologues:
This is all prepared
Damn 😂
Indeed she didnt know she was gonna win that fast
Lo tuve que ver 2 veces ahaha sendo movimiento
That’s how blue screen looks like irl
He def let her do it on purpose
The chess board is not evenly matched. Why are the king and queen reversed in their starting location?
Wait what
Fool’s mate
Wait, what happened?
Pretty obvious this was done on purpose.
He got discombobulated      Sorry...
Words before disaster: *She's not gonna see this coming*
chess speed run
Truly disgusting that some "people" would do such a horrible thing.
It Was At This Moment He Knew... He Fucked Up.
Skilled mab
Him: "she's not gonna see this coming* Her: *sees it coming *
XDDDD IM WHEEZEING
He said he's going to "get the bishop out" but then proceeds to block that move with his own pawn. Presumably not his actual intention then.
Nah... Because I have respect for the guy that didn’t happen
He: She's not gonna see this comming Her: AVARA KEDABRA !
Okay, (not so) Nice acting
"She's not gonna see this one coming." I see ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
no one: shiro to tet:
What happened i dont play chess
My brain: "don't fall for it. It's too easy... it has to be a trap" And that's why I suck.
Thank God this showed up in my recommended
"Guy gets beaten by Anne Hathaway in a chess game"
*Recommended Youtube is Legends😂😅*  *Im dying because his reaction. R u ok, sir? R u ok?😂😅*
She’s totally not gonna see this coming...  *no u*
ШЛАТ
Lame people typing same thing over and over again 🤮🤮
that HAS to be staged
She is not gonna see this coming   Her: u didn’t see this coming
so, it's not scripted...
She? You mean he he is biologically male.
Anyone exited for little nightmares 2?
How much u wanna bet that the first comment is gonna be- GAH
Get reckt m8
Hmm, I know of a 2 move loss, but it wasn't that one.  I guess there's more than one, huh.
"Schlatt?" ... "Did you murder yourself horribly out of shame?"
Bruh she fucking Scholar's Mated him.
Also known as "idiot mate" in chess books for children.
I saw how he moved the pawn and instantly realized it wasn’t clickbait. I’m surprised she got the fools mate, but I’m not surprised Schlatt lost.
Schlatt
She is not gonna see this one coming But you did cause the comments are full of this
Season 2 of Queen's Gambit looks a bit shit tbh
*OUTSTANDING MOVE*
Outstanding Move
_I bet it will be _*_impossible_*_ to finish this game with a _*_single move_*_ only._
"I love chess"
Ah yes, g4 f3, the Schlatt opening.
The Good Ol' Chess Blokes call this ''The Fool's Mate''
1000 IQ
Cool, I was searching for the abridged version of Queen's Gambit.
LMAOO AS A HUGE FAN OF CHESS AND QUEEN'S GAMBIT, THIS IS GOD SHIT 😭😭   *beth harmon wants to know your location*
Scripted bullshit
yep happend to me tooo
Ya boi literally changed the fastest way to win a match to the fastest way to lose a match
lol Fool's Mate, I lost this way once
Imagine being so awful at chess, you don't even have to stage a fool's mate to lose
Quicksilver “You didn’t see that coming?”
damn
Negative talent
*SAD SCHLATT NOISES*
*she never got the chance to see it coming*
This is exactly happened to me when I was in 9th standard 😂😂😂 I was like 😱😱😱😱      By the way I lost 😂😂😂😂😂
I've won a match like this before
Truly funny, how some “people” would do such a hilarious thing.
This video is staged right
WAIT DID SCHLATT REALLY JUST GET FOOL'S MATED AND HE DIDNT EVEN DO IT INTENTIONALLY LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
She's not going to see this coming. You mean I'm not going to see this coming.
This dood gets beaten by a girl wat a shame
This is what he deserves after taking over the Dream smp Lmanburg
POV: this is the only way to win in 2 moves. This was all planned.
I thought you can't move the king like that 🤔
Sla- (sh)?
Dumbest chess move ever bro
This is fake. Anyone that’s ever played chess knows that opening move.
"shes not gonna see this coming" famous last words
Тупой
"She's not gonna see this coming"  Uno reverse card
LMAOOO schlatt?
His reaction when he was checkmate is priceless 😂
So everyone just repeat what that guy said in comment section?  Pathetic
"She's not gonna see this coming" Her: "Omae wa mou shindeiru"
Looks like Xqc’s record was beat wow
6.5 million 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
Schlatt : she's not gonna see this coming  After move 2 : Mission failed successfully
What a noob
*She’s not going to see this coming* OH HOW THE TURNS HAVE TABLED
"She's not gonna see this coming" **Instant Uno Reverse**
You'll never see it coming~
*Omg this is so funny, Lol.*
I rarely Seen that much copy/paste and unoriginal comments
Him : she's not gonna see this coming Her : omae wa mou shindeiru Him : nani?😱 Her : checkmate
😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
So that's called a pro-gamer move
AGAHAHSHHSHAA
Man even though girls are equal as men, losing against one really hurts for some reason.
Should start playing UNO Has reverse card for a lifeline
Its 6.5M in just 1 week Imagine if that girl is on thumbnail.. It may be double
If this wasn't intentional, I'm feeling sorry for you.
No way this wasn't done on purpose. The winners? The people scooping up all that Youtube ad revenue from millions of views.
LOL XD
*When she said you ain't gonna last a minute with her*
I’m going to beat my brother in 2 moves now
hahhahahah ez win
"Not gonna see this one coming"  At least he was right about that part
😂😂😂😂😂 I do the same every time start playing chess .. place pawn ♟ in the center  like this girl 0:10
😂Is this guy some kind of noob
Wait idk how to play chess how did he lose? Is it like checkers?
THIS HAPPENED TO ME TOO ;-; I placed one pawn and moved the queen BAM! Game over- plus it happened in school-
Its called foolsmate!!
I’m confused what happened
How did she win sorry i Don't know chess
ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
“She’s not gonna see this coming “ Le she- I’m gonna end this man’s whole career
My face is literally doing the same expresión as his lol
Ok I legit do not see how she won like no joke can someone explain
98% of the comments: "She's not gonna see this coming" 1% of the comments: Bots 1% of the comments: Other stuff
It's great that she beats him in only two moves but calling your losing opponent 'slut' for no good reason at 0:26 is not a good advertisement for sportsmanship.
I don't know much about chess why she won?
That escalated fast.
This has more views than his most popular video on JschlattLIVE
I KNOW THAT MOVE
He lost his soul
lol that WFM Alexandra Botez, cute face and a master chess player
"she's not gonna see this coming"  her: genjutsu on that level doesn't work on me
**Confused Screaming**
Me not knowing how to play since I was never thought how to play : ok then
"she's not gonna see this coming". uno reverse card.
The faces they both make through out this video is what makes this really funny
I played in a tournament back in 5th grade and it was so satisfying pulling this off on an inexperienced Asian kid. I ended up losing the next game in 4 minutes
How did she win when she moved the king the piece like it’s a queen
Big kusa moment
Tf this guy looks like shahveer jafry 🤨
No guys, it’s all part of his master plan. If he doesn’t get chance to play the move, she’ll never see it coming.
I hit my mate with this once.  Now he can’t even look at a chessboard without his blood pressure increasing.
THIS IS SO COMMON IN CHESS, so stop commenting about "200 iq play"  Edit: THIS IS NOT THE QUEENS GAMBIT LOL
"She's not gonna see this coming".  She: Am about end this man's whole career.
"shes not gonna see this coming"  YOU ARE DEAD the survivors have been overwhelmed
fun fact: *this is literally the fastest way to lose a game of chess*
Le mat du con
I’m not a chess guy so someone explain how she won please
SCHLATTT?
Truly disgusting, that some “people” would do this horrible thing
Her reaction is so cute 😍
that move is so famous... I doubt he was not aware of its existence.
Schlatt?
she said 😏
What happened there?
Definitely not scripted
I felt pain when he moved his f pawn
That people, Truly some “Disgusting” horrible do would this thing.
I am sure that the objective of Chess is not to trap your King and give your opponent an open path to him.
i thought that this guy would win, what a-
It's called this was pre determined "I'll just gonna do a simple chess move AND put my pawn in the center nothing to see here" and everybody knows you don't open up yo king or queen pawn
Is this staged or is he really that bad?
“She’s not gonna see this coming.”  Well, he wasn’t wrong.
If you didnt get why she won its because Schlatt's Queen cant escape
"she's not gonna see it coming" She: Im gonna end this whole man's video
big LOL!
Jejsms
His and her expressions after her second move were awesome 😂😂😂
Staged
Shlatt: bad move* Alexandra: ok I’ll play easy Shlatt: she won’t see this one coming Alexandra:checkmate
Grandmaster material.
New lelouch
Truly disgusting, that some “people” would do such a horrible thing.
Just like the Tennessee Titans. All offense and no defense.
"She's not gonna see this coming." *Moves the one piece that could set up his very demise*  Oh, now you've messed up.
Lmao I just did that to my friend 2 days ago
All I have to say.... is WOW. I am stunned. Literally, STUNNED
“She not gonna see this coming”  - *famous last word before a disaster*
thats intentional
“She’s not gonna see this one coming” Alex:🤔 Schlatt:😶
*when they ask you if your fine and you say your fine but your not really fine*
*The board in the background saying “I LOVE CHESS C:” : ._.*
This was the fastest chess match I have ever seen in my life 😂😂
Bruv 😂 😂
I love how he went from “She is not going to see this one coming” to “Wait what “
Truly disgusting, that some “people” would do such a horrible thing.
Mate do louco
lmao
Only a noob would lose to this move
Sometimes my genious its, its almost frightening.
Black wins  Fatality.
Her: I'm home alone. Him: I'm busy playing chess. God: let there be luck. Chess:

Naiinis ka noh  Copy mo to tapos gawin mo sa ibang post 😂😆
Truly disgusting, that some "people" would do such a horrible thing.
Some girl beat me with that move when im competing in chess.
either she is a god or this was staged since I saw this on reddit before this game
Truly disgusting, that some "people" would do such a horrible thing.
"She is not gonna see this coming"  2 moves later  Schlatt: *Windows shutdown sound*

She pulled out the ultimate Uno reverse card
This dude is fresh and cool
Vegeta vs Android 18 in a nutshell
"Too soon junior"
So nobody is taking about the board in the background that says: "i love chess" Next time is going to say: "I hate chess"
I did trick a master ai to do that it was hilarious
"She's not gonna see this coming"   Her "modern problems require modern solutions"
“In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy's country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good. So, too, it is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them.” Sun Tzu
This is not a thing that people who play chess do, he done it for the views and wow look it worked!
I wanna battle her and see how good i am
Baaayymmmm!!!!
schlatt?
Damn.
"She is not gonna see this coming"  Yeah you are right she didnt even expect you'll lose like that

Truly disgusting that "people" do such a horrible thing.
You set this loss up and planned the game in advance.
That's dumb it's scripted lol
Ohhh i think i need to try that if i ever get the oportunity
I play chess a lot and whenever people shittalk and say they’re gonna win hitting them with the 2 turn checkmate is the best thing to happen (schlatt is very cool tho)
So the man just quickly do mannequin challenge or what?
Scripted
Equivalent to texting a girl to be her bf and her saying no as soon as u sent the text
Even a scripted moment can’t get more perfect than this.
Well, he looks like he deserve it.
Schlatt:"She's not gonna see this one coming"  Her: *SHARINGAN*
It's obviously planned lol
momento XD
I love how she has that look "Schlatt what are u doing????"
Wtf
Cool video but that win dosent count. You can’t let ur opponent move without saying check mate
Act?
When you underestimate somebody after not playing against them for more months
what was he even trying to do
I like the dry: “Schlatt?” At the end, just adds another level
i dont know who this “Schlatt” is but hes all over my recommended and i hate it
Me every time someone mates me in 10 moves or smth
Me after watching queens gambit, well alright i am gonna take my pills and stare at the sealing tonight
no game no life: netflix edition
"She's not gonna see this coming" ... Her: "No u"..
This is not fake at all
Truly disgusting, that some “people” would do such a horrible thing.

Both had different expressions of confusion but both at high levels.

Schlatt: 👁👄👁
I don't understand at all what just happened and now my brain feels small
🤦 🤦🤦 🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦
Hi I'm new to chess. How exactly did she checkmate him
Lol what a loser
2k2 elo vs 400 elo :)))
Bruh...
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooof
Her reaction is honestly priceless
This is an example of the extremely rare “Fool’s mate”
She's the only person who can see John Cena
Schlatt after this: well, off to hang myself!
I think he might have thought the markers for king and queen were reversed
Watch people die inside:
Schlatt: Got to get the bishop out. Also Schlatt: Proceeds to block his bishop even further.
He died inside lmao
Scripted
i love how hilarious this is
Penguinz0.
How in the freek man? My brain does not comprehend on how that work?!?        😂👌 but my mans actually took a L about 27 seconds.
The 4.6k dislikes are people who also had a loss like this
Pathetic I can lose in one
Well that end quickly ..
Jesus Christ I've NEVER seen such disrespect in my life.
"She's Not Gonna See This Coming"  Big Guy Left The Chat
Not trying to be rude but I wonder how long he's been playing chess. That's one of the oldest and most predictable moves possible. Lol.
Now I dont know how to play chess and forgot checkers so I'm assuming she just did A Jojo reference and Jumped them all
Truly disgusting, that some "people" would do such a horrible thing.
No way this my technique
If Davie504 played chess against dragon force
The confusion on his face when he lost 🤣 he's just like "Did I really just fucking lost in 2 turns?"
“She’s not gonna see this coming”     *Top ten sentences said before disaster*
Wow, oldest, fastest, easiest win available in chess, with lots of camera cuts. No way this was staged or anything.
WOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!
This is straight on choreography, I mean that's the move that is very vulnerable to capture the king
This is the same person who became a tyrant of a nation, Let that sink in
It is funny, but looks staged
she moves king first 5 paces not queen and checkmate I call hack
disgusting, who would do that
This is literally the fastest way to lose. I cant get rid of the feeling this is staged af
Ok. What the hell just happened? I'm confused.
Even the girl is confused what happened
SCRIPTED!!!
Get my bishop out....proceeds to completely box his bishop in.
Over here it’s basically known as “gekkenmat” loosely translate to “a moron’s checkmate”😂
This dude was elected president of a country
Quick reminder to protect your king
Totally not planned. Totally.
Big guy
Meanwhile in the back there is a board that says “I LOVE CHESS”
That was 3  moves learn to count kid
"She's not gonna see this coming"  By the look on her face she deffo didnt
0:18 that look in her face...
When your friend says he'll go easy on you
His thing in the back even said he loved chess.really
"She's not gonna see this coming" She: *whips out a full hand of UNO reverse cards*
This reminds me of the time I beat my friend in Connect 4 in 3 moves
It's a setup. LOL The 2 move checkmate is in most chess books. It's as old as the hills.
That's incorrect. You can block the king with another piece
I'm gonna assume this was staged. If not. Fuck dude, I would literally kill myself.
Wtf happened I don't know how to play chess lol
Lo ves o no lo ves?
The 4.5K actual chess players in the room thumbed this down.
Even my imaginary friend is more real than this video.
Schlatt dug his own grave
The old “fool’s mate”; kind of like walking up to a kid, taking a sucker out of his mouth and then saying “life isn’t fair”.
*Originality has left the comment section*
*WOMAN MOMENT*
Did he confuse the king nd queen or something?
Scripted
Jokes aside can anyone explain what happened?
Everyone: She's not gonna see this coming Me: I didn't see that coming
you must think he is dumb but he actually playing the king's gambit
Truly disgusting, that some “people” would do this horrible thing.
Ahh yes, *CONTENT*
In spanish we call this "Jaque Mate Pastoril", and I think that's beautiful.
Classic
Someone needs to make this into a 'to be continued' meme.
She is not gonna see this one coming  She: are you sure about that?

"Shes not gonna see this coming" *She saw it coming*

Gotta prank My gf when she beats me in chess Turn 1 Turn 2 Turn.....

I have lost over 10,000times in chess but that's quite impressive ngl
Thats FOOLS MATE.
Schlatt: "she's not gonna see this coming" Also Schlatt: *doesn't see it coming*

This seems extremely staged.

Nobody's talking about the "..... Schlatt."
XDDD
pro gamer move
Lmao
this is fake, but yea...
POV: you open the comments and see "shes not gonna see this coming......."
I love the expression on her face, when she just noticed his move. Almost like- "Uhh... you do realize I can just do 'this', right?"
Fake as fuck, oldest trick in the book. Terrible actors.

"Schlatt.exe has stopped working"
Her queen starts out on the wrong side, should be to the left of the king and hers isn't
Whats more disturbing is people thinking this isnt fake... lul
It takes talent
She was trying a 5 move check mate on him , but he being a master of chess, helped her end the game in 2

Hey once I lost in same exact way!
And i lost chess in 2 moves 2 times in a row
The “Schlatt” at the end
@SaGar wooh rumor has it, wooh rumor has it, wooh rumor has it,  that he's still checking that board..
I love this staged youtube clips 💖
chinese videos are more real than this
"She's not gonna see this one coming"  She does indeed look like she didn't see that self-destruct coming. 😂
I see. Modified King‘s Gambit . Genius.
One word "AKWARD"
w h a t
Truly disgusting that some “people” would do this horrible thing.
I remember the first time I got destroyed by this move 13 years ago in grade 10. I had the same expression as Schlatt here lol  The person that did it to me is now one of my closest friends and this was how we met
If your actually good at chess you would never play into a two move check mate, so this is staged.
That girl said GG with just 2 moves
Simp
Truly disgusting, that some “people” would do such a horrible thing
Insert deflating balloon sound here
😂😂
"That's a bold strategy cotton, let's see if it pays off for him"
I remember when I was in elementary school and they had a school wide chess tournament and I was so happy to sign up and be a part of something.  This was exactly how I lost.  Two moves.  I just remember the boy jumping up and down, screaming while running towards one of the teachers to tell them he'd won in two moves.  All our friends watching were just pointing and laughing... that was over 25 years ago and I still haven't forgotten that embarrassing defeat.  So Schlatt... I'm just saying, you will never forget this ;)
I know that move and im a chess player i won like 10 or more in our class and im from philippines and four move is a famous move
It's called The Fool's Mate
He probably mistook King as a queen
Truly disgusting, that some "people" would do such a horrible thing
I mean to be fair she probably didn’t see it coming
"......Schlatt?........."
I had to admit this also happened to me when I started playing chess.. pretty embarrasing XD
World record moment
It's called four moves though
*_Schlatt.brain.exe has stopped working_*
4 flat
Classic Fool’s Mate, that...
The utter DISMAY written across his face is hilarious
Has to be staged
Ahmmm was i the only one that did not understand and entered because of curiosity
I have no idea how chess works can somebody please explain what just happened?
Foolsmate boiiiiiii
I don’t get it
Done that before to and opponent
Simp
Its funny how I immediately saw where he was gonna mess up mostly cuz Ive done it before😂
i think he got confused with the queen and king pieced
He got fool's mated.
I love chess     The slogan of this guy
Watched this like five times lmao.
Hahaha this was good
You know even if you don't know chess that well, what are the chances your first 2 moves self-destructs the king lmao.
Schlatt: I’m gonna do what’s called a pro gamer move
Maybe I'm just slow or haven't played chess in a while but I have watched this video for way too long and still don't see how Black won....
His reaction when he lost was incredible, I'm sad I watched this at 5AM cause I wanted to burst out laughing
"shes not gonna see this coming"   gets clapped within 2 turns with a universal chess move
there is a reason on why that pawn is called the f pawn
She’s not gonna see this coming
The fools mate lol
how
I think it can be said, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that this man is an idiot.
she's TheLegend27.
It's actually impressive that he managed to preform the fools mate
Small child against a cage fighter.
The new season of queens gambit looks promising
Famous last words
His face🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
famous last words:  "She's not gonna see this coming"
Sorry destructing In 3.2.1
Did he mixed up king and queen and thought he opened up his queen so he can attack alex's king like she did, not realizing he actually opened his king
He just played the french defense accepted 🏳
Staged but okay
Left the king wide open with no where to run
Can anyone tell me what Schlat was trying to do? What is the benefit of that opening?
L don't have any idea why that aperread on my feed, but l loved thanks YouTube
This is dumb and staged clickbait.
It's literally the worst move on chess
Lol        Fool's mate
Damn this is even better than xqc 6 moves🤣
This has to be staged
How
i hate to admit i lost that way too i felt so dumb lol i feel for you schlatt
This is staged.  No one falls for a fool's mate.  Obviously those who liked this video know nothing about chess.
"Schlatt?"
📝📝
Her fact afterwards 😭😭😭
fools mate
Truly disgusting, that some “people” would do such a horrible thing.
Is that possible to lose in one move?
Lmao their faces were priceless 😂
She's a killer Queen
when i saw the title, i was thinking "schlatt would have to move a pawn which only his king defended"
Boxed like a fish
He thought his king was his king and king queen
The queen is here
Wtf just happened
I'm confused how did schlatt lose?
It’s ok everyone had that happen at least once, at least he didn’t meat the dreaded wall of pawns
XD
staged
Love the look on her face! "Did he really just do that? Well....okay. Bet HE didn't see that one coming."
This is me playing chess
I mean, does this not just seem like a bit they put together for content? You kinda have to go out of your way to set up fool's mate.
I don't know if anyone is gonna get the reference but... Spontaneous Human Combustion
I’m confused how’d she win?
How does this have so many views!
I played this exact game before
Truly disgusting that some “people” would do this horrible thing
Truly disgusting, that some “people” would do such a horrible thing.
"she's not going to see this one coming"  Plays Uno reverse
"Gitgud"
It looks like it was on purpose
Clearly scripted but i gueess its funny
Obviously a setup. Even if you didn't see the queen move,  you would never play F3 because it blocks in both your knight and bishop as well as killing any chance at castling kingside.
When your brain involuntarily turns off.
That's what's known as the Fool's Mate. Which makes you . . .
She really hit him with that 9-2-1 New  Lieutenant General.
Desde cierto ángulo te pareces a Lil peep
He was right about one thing though - nobody really saw that coming.
Chotto matte
So this is the Queen’s Gambit show everyone is talking about.
Truly disgusting that some “people” would do this horrible thing.
why do i get the feeling this is scripted.
Call an ambulance, BUT NOT FOR ME
big man
Goated
Legend says she is still waiting for what coming from him
There's no way people think this is actually real. This checkmate is _famous_ and requieres those 3 movements to take place, this was obviously staged
Why do experts play noobs at all? I got discouraged from chess at an early age because the only people who were interested to play at all were people who were already really good.
Schlatt: She's not gonna see this coming...   Alex: I'm gonna do what's called a "pro-gamer" move.
The guy that is big that is bad chess player
ti schlatt re mlk slatt einai
please, before posting comments, may someone read the previous ones.  it's never known there's...casually ... already that one you're going to post
Can someone explain how she won in like, two moves?
To obvious acting, he lost intentionally
Can someone explain what just happend
Truly disgusting that some "people" would do this horrible thing
Truly disgusting that some “people” would do this horrible thing.
Schlatt just got splatted
This video is so bullshit
Schlatt: loses in 2 moves Me: you very smart
I'm not a chess player, but can someone explain wtf was he trying to do? Even i could see the clear opening for the queen
This was like the chess equal of:"wanna see me speedbridge"
shlatt: "i got this in the bag" 3 seconds later: "ahhhhh shiiii-"
i wanna know did he realy did it purposelly to lose chess eint that hard
super fake and set up
Hmm there seems to be a severe lack of „she’s not gonna see this coming“ jokes here, maybe I should make one.
His face after her move to checkmate lol priceless
imagine
0:19 *Visible thinking intensifies*
Good ol' fools' mate!

Truly Disgusting that some "people" would do this horrible thing.
One word: embarrassing
100% of the comments "ShE's NoT GoInG To SeE tHiS cOmInG"
Ah, fools mate, classic.
Jujalag gringo?
"She's not going to see this coming."  She: "I'm gonna do what's called a pro gamer move."
It's called the fools mate
Uhh i need an explanation
normally it takes at least 5 moves.. you did it in 2. smh
I don’t know about chess and idk what happened
“Yeah baby that’s what I’ve been waiting for that’s what it’s all about!”
Whoever who has played chess for sometime knows this moves
F Chain for my man Schlatt
Dat I love chess in the back makes this funnier
lol
song?
On my first chess tournament i managed to deliver this checkmate
So fake
noob
Why..would you do that..? He brainfarted so hard
I just downloaded this game then deleted it😂
Rolled my eyes at the obvious female pandering......
F
Its so scripted its good
Well I've defeated black in same way.
Schlatt "Get the bishop out" Also Schatt "immediately blocks his bishop exit with a pawn"
Truly disgusting the some “people” would do this horrible thing.
He Lagged.
I remember using this move in a chess tournament lol
Hahahahaha
AAAAAAAHHHHHHH🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"she's not gonna see this coming" "you mean *you're* not gonna see this coming"
That's not something for sure to brag abt.
"She's not gonna see this coming"  Clearly you didn't see that coming
I don't know who's more confused...
You guys don't understand. It's called Reverse Psychology.
This man about to end his own carrier.
That girl prolly think she's worlds best player rn just bc she won against a guy. Like bruh u a girl u were lucky
In german it called idioten matt
*your tactics are frightening me sir*
She must still be looking around her room since this happened
...
Well what had happened was...
"She's not gonna see it coming"  Do you mean her victory lmao ?
can anyone tell me what Schlatt was trying to do? i’m terrible at chest so i’m not sure if he was actually trying to do something or not
Staged
I watch this every day.
Who could ever predict the self destruction move.
staged videos = stonks
My man missed the flight by a whole fucking day 😁😁
0:22 Schlatt.exe has stopped working
I think he mistook the king for a queen and vice versa
I can just hear the funny mic incoming.
His mind was a blue screen.
Can someone explain the move too me cos I'm lost, not huge on chess but that's the only two turn loss
*Directed by Robert B. Weide-*
Schlatt?
weak stage
That method is called fools mate
Its like the dumbest man playing against Beth Harmon from Queen's gambit xD
"She's not ginna see this coming" Also him:mind* why do i here boss music
Heh once in class my friend did this same to me it was the first time both of us were playing,I was kinda good at it and he never actually played in class....he did this to me and looking back at it I realize that not only was I destroyed I was unlucky as Frick too
How do I speak this chess language
Omae wa mou sindeiru
"-schlatt..."
BruUuhHhHh

Mission failed we get em next time.. 😅
checkmate
I remember when i do this to my friend....
Karma in games be like:
When the main protagonist reveals itself.
Best thing ever lol
A bot beat me with same thing
She’s not gonna see this coming She: Well anyway I checkmated him
he obviously knew this beforehand and did it on purpose to get views
Fake
Okay it's "she's not gonna see this *ONE* coming" not "she's not gonna see this coming". I don't know why but it annoyed me while I was going through the comments.
Oh I understand she moved the queen and when she gets the pawn either way he moves with the king can get taken for people who couldn’t understand
I use that chess app
4 moves but ok
Behind him on the white board it's written 'I Love Chess'. Wonder if that still a thing
I lost this way once
If this wasnt scripted it would be more awesome but its still funny either way XD
Truly disgusting that some"people" would do this horrible thing.
Coup du berger
Big rekt
You didn't see that coming?
Wtf just happened?
To this day he has that exact face at the end
shlatt: shes not gonna see this one coming The whole comment section: write that down write that down
ImUseLess
👍👍👍
I don't think no one's that dumb even my first time playing chess isn't like that That's so staged
Pog
It wasn't staged get over yourselves he lost
So this is that Gambit's queen show everyone talks about
“She’s not gonna see this coming”  *FATALITY*
“She’s not gonna see this coming”  *K.O*
Truly disgusting that some"people" would do this horrible thing.
"She's not gonna see this coming"  Alex: and I took that personally
the fact that he wrote i love chess in the back XD
This is impressive
He is so skillful just not the good kind
An old move from Soviet chess books - there are two more options for this move.  I've been doing this at the age of 7.  Yes, I am from Russia.
1st time watching my jaw dropped... 2nd re-run and I busted out laughing, poor guy he was so confident 🤣
What was his plan? 😂😂😂
L
Protect the middle....
His face
Gotta be scripted
I think this smells fake..
Naw but how do you fuck up THAT bad
You revealed your King. That is how you lost. You must have been like...phuck.
To think there was a guy who is worse than xQc :O
Windows Shutting Down 🖥️
Oh my fuck there's so much "sHeS not gOiNg tO SeE tHiS CoMiNg" comments.
Filmed😂😅🤣
This is me in chess class
My dude fr lost in 2 moves. How can you be that trash
Holy shit, that guy got REKT
Not faked for content or nothing
Meh just seems fake to me.
"I will beat you at chess"  Also same guy playing as white  "I go first?"  Then proceeds to expose himself by moving King's pawns.
You fool!
Lol this happened to me once because I was just bored so I decided to play chess and I sat there for a good 5 minutes trying to figure out what just happened
Bruh He left his king exposed
He blocked his bishop from being able to really do anything anyways
I LOVE CHESS :)
Funniest thing I have ever sine
schlatt official?
HE DIDN'T SAW THAT ONE COMING ! ! ! !
Schlatt:  *My goals are beyond your understanding*
Dude literally checkmated himself.
To this day I have not seen a youtuber portray this much pain
I'm pretty sure Schlatt did this on purpose. Fool's Mate is well-known and honestly I'm having a hard time believing Schlatt really let this happen haha
i bet she didn’t she it coming tho
She didn't need to see what was coming.
Shes not going to see this coming  Well, he was right.
pretty sure she didnt see that coming tho
So fake
Video should have been titled "she ended my career in 2 moves"
Guy calm down he’s just speed running
At that moment, his brain looked like a png file that didn’t load right
Scripted af
Obviously set up. That’s the only possible way to lose in 2 moves. Unless you are really bad at chess
I taught everyone knows what's 2 moves checkmate....
Out of the countless moves he could have chosen he chose that one...
people literally think this wasn't planned to make tons of money off youtube views. LOL
She really pulled the biggest Uno reverse card on him
Truly disgusting, that some "people" would do this horrible thing
Fool's Mate
Damn this gave me flashbacks about my dad telling me he won a chess game with an engineer, even though he was a guard at the time. The opponents are thinking too much about the complex strategies that they lost to a simple, tiny but descisive move.
His face went from “ heh she’s never gonna see this coming” to 👁👄👁
Ladies and gentleman, we got them
My mans face when he lost 🤣😃😂
Everyone is commenting "she did not see this coming" while I still think he loves chess
No one going to talk about the mario kart music??
This actually lasted 13 seconds only because she paused in disbelief of the fact you have I Love Chess right behind you. I'M DEAD😂😂😂🤭🤣🤣🤣🙈
0:22 that face was one in a million
Jshlatt: She not gonna see this coming. Also Jshlatt: My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
I actually did that on my dad
How to lose your title has a man in 27 seconds
what WAS he thinking?
Did a full 180...
Truly disgusting, that some “people” would do this horrible thing
LMFAOOOO she just ate him
The funny thing is that schlatt went to Harvard
He died, he literally died !!!!
fake af nobody is this dumb right? xd
at last someone who is worse than xqc (6 move andy) at chess *we have a winner*
"It's too soon, we didn't even reach a climax"

That look on her face when she realizes how quick he finished...
This clip is the most hilarious thing I’ve ever seen if it is genuine. I hope it is because I want to believe and imagine this goose is  now the most humiliated person on earth
The ultimate unexpected moment of the decade😭
Totally real and not fake at all🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤣
Wow
This comment section :  99.99% "She's not gonna see this coming" 00.01% Fun fact
I might be a bit old but guys, believe me, there was a time where we laughed for actual funny situation that naturally arose, people weren't spending all their lifes purpously  creating memes
Faker than Donald Trump...😂
If I am correct, this mate is called the Dumb Mate, and it is the fastest way to checkmate a player.
I just laughed with their reaction 😂
I dont get it
You can see the whiteboard in the background slowly erasing the words if you look closely.
Truly disgusting, that some “people” would do this horrible thing
Truly disgusting, that some “people” would do this horrible thing

He got confuse between queen and king.
Pro player move.
I always do that exact move.
Who cares
This happened to me in a Match against a AI i laughed my ass off and thought it was a wr but tbh it is but its easy to get
This is definitely not acted, sure.
BM Schlatt
I don’t even know what hell she just did
When your too busy thinking 3 moves ahead and don't see the next move will be fatal
Nevermind the video we got the Mario kart DS airship theme playin in the backround🔥
Bruh moment
Nice acting
Im not a chess expert so can someone explain how he loss 😓
0:17 You can actually pinpoint the exact moment she sees the win and calls him an idiot in her head.
That evil smile haha
Ray mak will obviously comment on this video, and see he did
0:22 *IS A SAME FACE AS TOMMY INNIT FACE AT*  *"muuuuUuUUuuUum? Im atopted?"*  Prove me wrong
Her face tho at the end😭🤚
Yeah.... would be sweet if true... but... staged.
so obviously set up...
This is called a "Fools Mate"  How ironic
The look of confusion on her face when he made that move makes it even more funny
This is the very first time I have actually witnessed someone doing the fools mate  unintentionally
They still waiting for Chess 2
Lmao
The face he made though
My guy just got clown mated for doing a fool's mate on white
Love how abruptly the music stops
Way Better at 0.25 speed
Alex: 'I'm just gonna play some straightforward simple chess Schlatt: *makes a move* Alex: 'aH YEes I aM tHe CHesS gOBLiN'
What a ‘man 😆
she is not going to see this coming like for originality like if u cry every time
Okay, who wants to be the first to call this guy the F-word?  (That's F as in fool.)
Im baffled and i don't even play chess
*Look at the thumbnail Me: GG
Good job simp, hilarious.
That wasn’t checkmate

Cool. And totally NOT scripted! *coughs*
"She's not gonna see this coming"  She sure didn't.
Holy
she wasn't even proud, she was just...confused which makes this even funnier
He had us in the first half
A Foul's Trick
You could choose a billion games of chess for every atom in the universe, my man was specific
Alex: It's free real estate
Totally not scripted
We always called it the fools mate
There's a reason why this move is known as "the fool's mate".
Dude its norm macdonald but 40 years ago.
How did she cheat
Looks faked as hell, these moves aren't sensible in any way even considering what beginners play.
*Outstanding Move.*
Funny video, but pretty obvious that this was prepared. And it makes it pretty cringey if you play chess. There is absolutely no reason he would play those two moves, if not for letting her do this. There is no minor or major piece that he can develop by playing the pawns like that, so the comment "she's not gonna see this coming" doesn't make sense. But hey, it got him five million views so I can only say well played.
Fake as fuck
How the fuck does chess work?
Guys just can't resist playing those moves against her....
It's okay, with a move like that, I don't think she saw it coming.
you’ve probably watched this more than one time   same here
I’ve done this, it’s awesome
When she said just putting my pawn in the center of the board nothing to see here
0:17 she's be like: is this guy stupid or something???
Lol 😂😂😂
Scripted
Worse than xqc lol
He went 😟
I almost wanna say this is staged. I do not believe chess experts would not see that move coming

Ah yes, the perfect loss. The mathematically most efficient way possible to throw a chess match. Props, I don’t think I’ve ever seen this before.
Someone make a curb your meme
I call that the American Opening
Congratulations on getting the world record for speed running Chess!
I don’t know why this was recommended to me but if this was not staged, I don’t know what is! I’m not that smart or a chess wiz, but started playing chess since I was 7 or 8yrs old and I’ve done a lot of dumb moves before, with my dumb 7 or 8 year old self, but the fastest checkmate I got caught with by playing with an adult is the regular 4 moves with a queen and bishop.
i've been there
This is even dumber than what in German is called a „peasant’s checkmate“ or „fool’s checkmate“...
😂
Big guy was just doing an any % speedrun
what was he even trying to do
Well this is quite an achievement I have to say.
She’s not gonna see this coming (Insert your joke here)

Schlatt: She's not gonna see this coming  Her: Uno reverse card

Its weird how nearly every streamer I've seen play chess is horrible. Its probably more played here in this country but damn, even kids from when i was at fourth grade is at least 200 elo higher than them.
Yes... the King sacrifice... very dangerous. Let's see if it pays off
That's fool's mate
People are so gullible. This is clearly staged lol
fools mate
Ah ha! THIS is why I don't play chess: I didn't see it coming either.
0:20 It was at this Moment that He Knew He F***** Up
Is this his first time playing chess?
The uselessness in moving those pawns.... not even a novice chess player makes that move unless he/she does it on purpose

The good news is that once that happens to you, you never make that mistake until you forget about it
This is a game you have to plan to lose.
Fake
is this real? did this really happen?   it seems real; not scripted of rehearsed . . . but his reaction seems a bit stiff.   perhaps he was just blown completely away by how soundly and thoroughly he was beaten in the time it takes to quickly tie one shoe.

Quick question, is this the same "Botez" that played Among us with pewds, toast, Valkyrae etc?

And that's called the Fool's Mate, because only a fool would play it.
This has to be a bit, nobody makes those two moves
What was your plan there?

"She's not gonna see this coming." Yeah from the expression before 'Black won' popped up on screen. No I don't think she saw that move coming.
I think that is a world record
Talk about a Last Surprise.
I dont know what just happened can someone explain
*Bruh*
The silence followed by a "...Schlatt?" Killed me lmao
This makes me feel better at losing in 4 moves one time
Look at all these people believing this is real lol...
Queen's Sacrifice? No  Big Guy's Sacrifice...
hey big guy
fools mate. 2 turn check mate
His last words.
Apparently he never played before.
I love her smirk at the end.
Mission failed better luck time!
mission failed, we'll get em next time
Probably staged but ok
Lol
0:16 she aint gonna see this coming 0:17-0:20 you...cant possibly...be this dumb...? 0:22 Shocked Pikachu face
Was this for real? If so, that's the first time I've ever seen the fool's mate actually happen. Scholar's mate and similar occur all the time at the novice level, but this is genuinely a first.
Bro that’s tough 😓🤦‍♂️😂
I think there is no more "i love chess" behind him
The white board behind him ahaha
This is basically the best example of "Expectations vs Reality" ever.
It seems staged.
It's a classic - Lucky Luke's horse, Jolly Jumper did the same thing when he was feeling a bit down and unfocused.

Best lines in history:  I am Iron Man  I am Inevitable  You have failed this city  She’s not gonna see this coming
It's called the "Fool's mate" for a reason
Isent thiss fools mate?
She is not going to see what coming? Even if we assume you failed to see the threat, you are not opening up any aggressive moves for any piece of your own, therefore you have nothing "coming". Therefore conclusion is this is staged, albeit the video is successful and most people seem to actually believe you are genuinely  surprised by the outcome. So well played.
haha nice clickbait to get views he knew what he was doing!
Basic rule: always play rochade.
Fake
Haha amazing acting

Well if he opens with white f3 & white g4 he is delusional and should lose.
What a loser lol
I feel like this was for sure scripted but I hope it wasn’t.... but it was :(
"It's ok Schlatt, it happens to a lot of guys."
what game?
Clearly staged lol
STAGED
Schlatt: She’s not going to see this coming. Alex: It’s free real estate.
The way she just says "Schlatt?" at the end killed me
Fake, but look at those views.
“She’s not going to see this coming” She really didnt, she really didn’t
@ 0:13 - if chess matches were like presidential debates, this would be the "please proceed, governor" moment.
Definitely planned I don’t know anyone who would make the moves he did 🤣
@ 0:19 - ...oh no... oh no... oh no-no-no-no-no...  🤣
That looked staged like everything else in this world "
HOW DID THIS GET 5M VIEWS IN 5 DAYS OMG
LOL🤣🤣🤣🤣
He got sent to the Shadow Realm
That had to be on purpose, right?
Bruh
This was so fake...
Queen's Gambit Season 2
Best fools mate I've ever seen 😅🤣🤣🤣
So jschlatt is the new xQc
That's what happens when you're a cocky person lol
That’s the queens gambit
das a big oof
this has become my favorite video on the internet
Terrible acting.
wow like i have only seen it once in a live game and that was today
I hear Mario Kart DS music :D Luigi's Mansion track
*Lamar's N word intensifies*
director: How much play acting can you do... Them: watch us ... :)
I bet he wanted to lose because it will be funnier
“In the center of the board” stfu
About 1-2 weeks before this video was published YouTube was spam-recommending a video by a guy explaining how to win a chess match in 2 moves. Blatant set-up.
Rip my bro  You'll get better
Haha unlucky
Yes Schlatt, I don't anyone could see that coming
Schlatt: CALL AN AUMBULANCE! BUT NOT FOR MEEEE! I Love Chess :) Board: Oh God Ur Not Artemis Fow— *Rubbed Off*
He only lasted 30 seconds...
fake
That was exactly how I defeated my uncle, he taught me chess and I just won 1 game out of many that we played. He never played again with me after getting defeated in just 2 moves.
Scripted
Schlatt: She'a not gonna see this coming!   Girl: *Omae wa mou shindeiru*
He should've used the Tennison gambit intercontinental ballistic missile variation...
Even i saw that one coming
fake. who the heck does open like that?
i perfectly understand him
that had to be staged
Yeah that's the kind of move I make when I'm playing with my 10 year old niece lmao
Rumours say his ego left him.
Wow it was not scripted
Staged af zzzz
this is me when i get 2 wins and a row in a game and get obliterated
He's face really  said 🤭 to 😦
xQc: feel my pain
Fools mate
Stupid/staged. Everyone who knows what a pawn is knows that's literally the only way to lose a game in 2 moves.
And that's the ultimate queen's gambit
*B R U H*
I’m king in checkers but I never played chess and idek the rules of it
That's not possible, that was an illegal move.
fun fact: you scrolled far enough to not see a "Shes not gonna see this coming"
Speedrunning chess xqc nerd world record just broken.
his face LOL 🤣
LMAO
THAT'S WHY YOU NEVER MOVE THE F PAWNNNN
Its so fake but still funny
Staged for the lulz.
Fools mate XD
That end tho she had lil remorse in eyes OR face lmao😂😂
Schlatt: *confused screaming* Her: menacing looks.
Fake
Am I the only one who thought that was Chris from MrBeast?
this is what happens when a quiet kid beats up a bully in 2 punch
Can someone explain what his plan was?
"Mission failed! We'll get em next time"
Wtf even happened...
Nice King sacrifice by White
Me who has no clue how to play chess... i dont know what just happened. Or why this was recommended to me.
The worst she can say is no
😁🤣lol
I could already see this coming with the thumbnail. When i was visualising what would the reactions be I cracked up 😂
She is not going to see this coming Lmao🤣
Lmao.
rekt lol
Lul
978 percent noob 22 percent idiot
Damn he still processing even when the video ended
Dude he got shit on you
0:21 this is moment Schlatt know....    ...He fucked up.
God tier
This is what it looks like when u just downloaded a game and skips to a pro level
Fake
Stick to being a bad dictator
Oldest trick in the world.
Definitely not planned at all. You got wrecked.
I dont get it. What was he even trying to do?
schlatt?
LOL EVEN THE GIRL WAS USING THE "WHAT-" EXPRESSION
Hes still stuck in loading screen
This is the direct opposite of what happened to Cr1T1KaL
she didn't see it coming she was generally confused as to why tf you just did that lmfao
Oh thats class
10% comments: about video 90% comments: 'she's not gonna see this coming' memes
Fake acting haha lol egh viral hit fake acting oopsie big oops.
“Schlatt?”
how did she win?
𝕀𝕞𝕞𝕒 𝕕𝕠 𝕕𝕚𝕤 𝕨𝕚𝕥 𝕕𝕒 𝕗𝕒𝕞
For those who are familiar with Achievement Hunter, Schlatt got Michael’d (His Yu-Gi-Oh! Game where he got exodia’d in a single move, which Ray “Brownman” Navarez Jr. had happen to him too)
I replay this for like 5times and lmfao
Imagine if it was fake...
Scripted
King gambit accepted
LMFAOOOO
His face bahahaha
worst move you could ever do.. smh get gud
Can we get a youtube buffer circle over his face ?
This dude is dumb as rocks.  Even if she didn't beat him, his moves didn't make sense.  He said he wanted his bishop out, but moved his pawns so his bishop gets blocked.  Is this even real?
He be like: 👁👄👁 nani?!?!?
God dammit Schlatt!
The best part is it’s literally the only way to get checkmated in two moved
First move everyone learns to counter in chess. Gee whiz. It’s a well known published move.
ACTUAL RELEVANT QUESTION TO MY CHESS PLAYERS OUT THERE  Couldn't he have used that move that switches the king and the rook? If not, why? DO TEACH    Also,  enough "didn't see this coming" quotes, guys. We get it, the comedic timing was there without your quote
Staged
Explain plz
“Just you watch” “ok sure” “She’s never gonna see this one coming” *moves queen* “Schlatt?”
queens’s gambit
She was like: “oh you didnt..... you gotta be kidding me....”
I don’t understand chess or what happened but I do understand his confusion and disappointment
I swear I had the same reaction  Haven't seen a fools mate in a long while
Zug zwang 😂😂😂😂
Is he really that stupid?  Honestly... losing to a queens gambit is REALLY BAD. Love you Schmitt but your IQ is non existent.
mission failed, we’ll get them next time
Fools Mate
Low key feels like an Office moment.  Botez is radiating Jim energy and Schlatt is radiating Micheal energy.
schlatt...
the pope is a big guy
fake n GEYYYY
Yeah I think this time, she was ready
Wow what a goofer he is, he really sucks at chess and this wasn’t done for content at all. It’s called fools mate aswell since no one seems to be saying it in the comments thought I’d let you guys know.
Everyone says she looks surprised... to me she looks smug
Fools chests
No way this wasn’t done on purpose
At least she didnt see it coming
I'm not sure what happened either.
I don’t understand how this is a win. Someone educate me please
The single worst opening you can ever do in Chess.  10/10 anime fight scene
Definitely scripted but funny!
Why and how did she win? I know nothing about this game,  and I didn’t even bother to learn how to play it.
I'm not entirely sure what he was planning to do. I think I missed something.
NEW WORLD RECORD
The realization hit him like a truck
She's never gonna see this coming!   ..... yeah so uhm basically that was a huge fucking lie
I love doing this to people, they become so clueless as to how they lost so fast
This man silently went through all the stages of grief all at once
he did this on purpose just to make a "funny" video from it...
This music brings me back
Fool's Mate   *Key word in the name*
Still remember the first time I played black and my opponent played the same two moves.  It only happened one more time, but I was playing white the second time and it was technically 3.5 moves. LOL
staged. obv..
"She's not going to see this coming"  *Well yes, but actually no.*
No one in their right mind does an opening like that. Feels like he did it on purpose for the comedic value
who dafug start with a pawn to g4 . thats child play
Random Fact That kind of checkmate is called a "Fool's Checkmate" since one would have to be an absolute idiot to not see it coming.  That is actual chess terminology; I'm not trying to be mean.
This is the manifestation of those "2 move checkmate" videos.
lol
Lol The girl staring at schlat when schlat loses its funny tho
She is practically Magnus Carlsen
Does this count as a worldrecord in losing in chess? Why are there no speedruns of this yet?
Hi
Never go full pepega
foolsmate
dunno who these people are, but I swear this was a bit.
I suppose this is staged?
Fools mate
“She’s never gonna see this one coming” top ten videos taken moments before disaster
it bothers me that she kinda using the microphone wrong
she's never gonna see this coming...  honestly she never did because she didnt know you were ever dumb enough to do anything like that
Pog
i reviewed this 100% and she acually won LMAO
Her just glancing to the side as if thinking "did... he really just let me do that?" is what makes this moment so beautiful.
I dont understand chess   Did she put the king/queen in a spot that could reach Schlatts king and it auto won the game?
Bruhhhh
What kind of move was that supposed to be? Because clearly she saw it coming.
i am sorry... i dont know much about chess but in these few moves, what did i miss that he tried to do? i mean he sounded like he had a plan but for me these moves he made were just like this whole video is made up and never happened like this.. i mean is this a real thing real people do?
I sadly know this move and knew bye the title that it has to be that otherwise it couldnt be two moves though (as far as i know)
did this once to a friend and he flipped the board lmfao
saddest shit i have ever seen.
My man really just scholors checked himself
that exact same thing happened to me too.. Last time i played chess
And we thought 6 moves was low...
I would share this to my friends, but instead I’m gonna use this move on them. Thank you.
im saving this for the next time i play chess
Cool video
Can someone explain this move please?
Not real. Come on people
Schlatt: Proceeds to doom himself Alex: You are evolving, just backwards
Dr. Robotnik : Confidence. A fool's substitute for intelligence
She’s not gonna see this one coming. She wins the game  Him:👁👄👁
At this moment that he knew he fucked up
I-I don’t understand how he lost???
“Let’s move the bishop out” *moves the pawn*
Definitely not staged
Grob ... actually makes for pretty fun games... including fool mating yourself :)
Im no genius but im pretty sure you win chess by killing the queen or king
Plotwist: he did that on purpose to get the lady(ies).
Staged
Thats why dutches defense is such a important chess layout
girl: wait i won? dude: wait i lose?
Fake
Meanwhile that arab guy who invented chess: "Pathetic"
Wait what xD
someone finally beat xqc's record
staged
She did the so called *pro* *gamer* *move*
Karma: checkmate
You guys do realize this is obviously staged right?
All NPCs in this comment section: shes not gonna see this coming.  Think of a new joke people not 50 of same in a row
Rookie mistake. He should stick to playing minecraft or whatever useless rubbish he does.
Y'all do realize this was intentional, right? There is exactly one way to get mate in 2 moves, it is very well known and the moves make no sense in any other context.
HE'S NOT OKAY
None chess players are just as confused as him😂
His face makes this amazing
f
When he lose i laugh so damn loud that i bother my neighbor in the upstairs 🤣🤣
It's called :"fool mate"
sup
Surely this has to be staged. He gets a path ready for the bishop, and then moves the next pawn into the one square that would trap his bishop and stop it from being useful. Who even does that?
"She's not going to see this coming"  *self-destructs*

Can someone explain to me just how like i dont even understand how thats Possible
This is called Fool’s Mate
The chess nerds will know that this play is called a fools mate
And now He is dead inside 😄
Was he trolling or is he just bad?  I've been at this chess thing for 16 years and never saw this happen for real.
What I know nothing about chess but how tf did she win is that not like breaking the game and cheating I’m soooo confused. I thought the purpose of chess was to take out all the other players pieces or sum?
She really didn’t see that one coming
Congratulations, you played yourself. XD
I mean... Surely this is fake... Right? I had to learn how not to fall into this trap when I was 7.
Small pp gang
Of course she's gonna see that coming, she played matches with the chess grandmasters
"She's fucking not going to see me coming..."
and i thought xQc was bad
What happened between them afterwards?
It's all uphill from here... I mean, you literally can't do any worse.
Who is she thank you please
Ah yes, the king sacrifice. Works every time
"She's not gonna see this coming" alex: *uno reverse card*
That was the most idiot person i have ever seen after me
In the background it says I love chess Instantly loses in two moves a new record
I watched this and all I felt was pain, because I was reminded of the time I had this exact loss in chess
Ik it’s staged but it’s still funny
Wait I’m so confused How did she win
I dont know how to play chess and it appears  neither does he .
* Persona 5 battle music*
I have my own 4 move gambit (I think) that I call the January Gambit, and if it's avoided, it becomes the January Opening
Hate it when you mix up the kings and queens when you aren't familiar with the board pieces
When there's not enough voice over in the video so all of the comments are about the same quote:
I AM LAUGHING SO HARD! THIS WAS FUNNIEST THING EVER!
the thing is schlatt now has the world record for fastest loss ever
Fool's Mate, chump.
At this moment Schlatt knew, he fucked up!
Fools Mate
Bruh
Capitalism is incompatible with the continued survival of the human species, and with the happiness and prosperity of the average person. Seize the means of production and suppress the billionaire class.
“G4, get the Bishop out.” *proceeds to NOT move his Bishop*
Well, I mean… yes…
I mean that's gotta be some kind of record on its own
I wish I understood chess
Oh it's fake
OOF!
mol
Only Mario Kart *OG's* will recognize the background music
The only place the king could move was diagonally up-right, and that is directly towards the Queen.  Quickest checkmate I've ever seen
This looks so staged
I see she has been learning from Jesus. Well done young disciple.
I like how the music stoped when he lost
For those of you who don't know this is called a fools mate and well it's the fastest way to lose the game so congrats schlatt ya played yourself
setting up that scholar's mate and he accelerated it
smal man
Bruh I thought dis was Chris from mr beast
I havent played chess since 6th Grade and i cringed really hard.
I fuckin love that during this entire clip, he has a board behind him saying "I love chess :)"  Little did this man know, that was his first mistake
Yeah not fake at all, there was nothing he could do with that move.
With a woman ahhahahahahaha
Fake and gay
This is gonna be in recommended after 7 years        Hello People in the future
can't be genuinely real...xD
fake.
Why was there Mario kart music in the background?
The queen’s gambit looking different tho
STUPID
God I hate this guy
Bowser Castle music from Mario Kart 🙂
This is so staged
The look on her face 💖😂
Worst than xQc Elundis Core
Press *F* for our fallen comrade.
hi
When the special needs kid gets overconfident.
Explain this to someone who doesn’t know who these people are or wtf just happened but it popped up in my recommended anyway (asking for a friend)
This was totally not staged.
You made the dumbest series of moves possible
0:15 instant replay button
She is a legend
Ive had this happen to me playing against the computer
That look on her face when he made his second move, she looks confused about his move.
Awesome
Honestly who starts a match like that
talk about throwing for content
The fucking expression she has when she realizes the opportunity before her
Is this that Queen's Gambit show everyone's talking about?
The classic scholars (or by the same token, fools) mate. The quickest checkmate.
Bet you wish she picked host now, eh?
Wow, that's not fake at all
“She’s not gonna see this coming”  Famous last words
this is the only way to lose by two moves, like theres no other way to do it, he made the perfectly worst two moves
XD I can't believe it was just 2 turns
*Teleports behind you*       *Omae wa mu..*
I don't even understand chess or how to play it so I guess that's fine
I swear the king can skip as a horse one time, no?
Auw!!! That must have felt like a punch in the face.
That’s some XQC/ Charlie tier checkmate right there
World record of beating chest 😂
i have never seen anyone slapped that hard on the chess board.
It even took her a second to process what he did 😂😂
honestly I thought the queen was the king and vice versa here
Nice, totally didn't set that up for the clout.
Even chess videos are staged these days? 🤕
That is actually called fools mate
Schlatt's Gambit
Speedruning POG!
Bruh really got fooled on
The cherry on top is the fact that a white board in the background fuckin says "I like chess :)"
I thought it was called fool’s mate because only a fool would fall for it ._.
Clearly did it for the video...
How can a bunch of people who are supposedly interested in chess, not know that that was a blatant set up? He knew exactly what was going to happen.
I love the disappointment in his face
Fun fact g4, e5, f3, Qh4 is the fastest way to checkmate.
I don’t play chess, so I just wanted to know if the game glitched or he genuinely just lost after two moves?
bruh this has to be staged dude did the exact fools mate
How fucking fake/staged is this video?  How can people actually think this is real?  Unbelievable
The first time I saw this type of win was more than 30 years ago at a high school chess tournament. The officiating judge couldn't believe his eyes. Just a combination of dumb luck on the winner's part and poor moves on the loser's part.
No way you don't know fools mate
"She's never gonna see this coming"   *Top 10 moments before disaster*
“Shlatt?”
As somebody who has no idea how to play chess can somebody please explain how she won? Lol
Chess Player:  THAT's FOOLS MATE
Totally not staged
This is actually the only way in chess to win in 2 moves from the start(As far as I know)
quickest chess game in history
Genuinely have no idea if Schlatt did this intentionally for a bit, or actually the stars aligned and Schlatt actually managed to literally get the worst move in chess.
oof
Waw
You can tell his heart just stops working at 0:22
He could move his pawn on the far right ( the one over the rook) twice to kill his queen.
Is this just staged?
Ahh fools mate it doesn't happen often but when it does it's both hilarious and glorious 😆
Both their faces are absolute gold 😂
Schlatt: “she’s not going to see this coming” Also schlatt: (Plays with a GM)
No way they didn't talk this through beforehand...
You didn't have to hurt him that bad! 😢
Look I'm no chess master.  But that was the single dumbest move I've ever seen anyone make.
I LOVE CHESS            Ü
lol!
Yo my guy schlatt is godly
Idk how ppl find this funny
Ive never seen or heard of this fools mate. But i guess it takes one to teach one.
An Apple Approves
"Eventually, Schlatt stopped thinking"
I'm not buying it
haha funni i laughed
Lol nice n funny skit
😂 both their faces are amazing
Ngl, he pretty dumb. Also i think he confuse on which is king or queen, if so, then he ultra dumb.
fake and gay
"She wouldn't see this coming" I mean, she wasn't expecting anyone to be that stupid so I guess she really didn't see that happening.
10 years ago, a dude lose that way against the professor. He was 8.
you know it is a good clip when it is: 1.less than 1 min 2.above 1m views 3.and you see this kind of comment  see you 7 years later
''She's not gonna see this coming'' Famous last words
My boy Schlatt was going for the Bird Opening but Botez started the counterplay
I dont know how chess works i thought that u win by defeating the queen and king and u got in the other teams base  Dk its very confusing
Airship Fortress from Mario Kart DS? Based Schlatt
Schlatt fastest game ever done merely by acting as a noob
This has happened to me
This is obviously staged. Who says, "shes not gonna see this coming hehehehe" after moving 2 pawns, it doesnt even make sence. This is obviously staged.
LMFAO
Ghanian pallbearers dance:
Oh my God, this is great
Noob's gambit. Works only on another noob.
Staged but funny
the _".....schlatt?"_ is gold
The "Schlatt?" at the end is killing me 😂
E
I get the feeling too many people who watch this, specially those who comment, believe it’s not staged.
half speed is absolutely hilarious
This must have been deliberate.
chess 101 checkmate in 2 moves
G4 just gonna move the bishop out -> F5 just gonna block the bishop coming out cuz this is a low effort fake and don't care about holes in the story.
playing the fools mate was not a good idea
L
I smell fake 🤥
Bruh that’s so humiliating lol xd
oh, the 2 most stupid moves you can do in chess. a classic
Beat xqc 6 moves record lmao
i dont know how to play chess but why did she win ?

Who's the girl???
Not al all STAGED, not at all.... Like yu wouldnt know this simple move...

The German name for this is „Idioten Matt“ so in Englisch Idiot checkmate. No joke
real question here: what the fk was he trying to do? what kind of opening is that lmao 😂
Slatt 🐍
It is a trick in chess and the probabilities of your opponent doing the correct moves for you to win is low.
i'm telling my kids this is the Queen's Gambit
The stare afterwards!

*Watch people die inside*
Plot twist: she saw it coming
I did this to my step dad when I was I think 13 and he has never played with me again
there are literally 3 different comments out of 7,500 comments. YouTube commenters are trash
What was the purpose of that second pawn move?
To be fair I'm pretty sure he thought his King was a queen.  That is the only way I see how he could possibly make that move so blindly.  Other than that RIP LMAO!!!!!
Obvious stage is obvious.
This video was in my YouTube recommended. I had no idea chess was such an easy game. To win, you basically need to be gorgeous and play someone who has no clue what all the pieces are for.
................................. schlatt?
FAKE
This is why I like playing Black.
her face said it all lmao "was this supposed to be some kind of trick or...?"

I always try to do the 4 move checkmate. People are shocked when I win with it but this...this is just stunning.
This had to of been planned
staged but funny
xQc's record was beaten...
I love not knowing any rules of chess so this shit is waaaay funnier than it should be
Fun fact: there is only ONE way to lose chess In two turns, and my man chose it.   Edit: Jesus Christ I know it's staged stop telling me.
girl be like 'god or what'
Schlatt: Me win Lose   Schlatt: 0_o
Not a chess player i barely know the rules how did she win
And we thought xqc was bad
Yeah this really happened and is not at all fake
Nice acting skills
I mean he’s right. She definitely didn’t see that one coming.
I HAVE DONE THIS TOO AND I WAS SO CONFUSED
This hurts me physically, and mentally

I wonder if anyone doesn't know this was a joke
LETS GOOOOOOO
It sounds like she set you up from the beginning, like somehow she knew you would make a move like that somehow.
is schlatt a gm or something? genuine question bc I got no clue who he is
Dude I did this in a group chess tournament most priceless face when I said check mate I had been wanting to do that to someone ever since I found out about that
Queen's Gambit in a nutshell
The lean forward like “is he really this dumb?”
i have no idea how to play chess but (thats all ty for reading.)
she technically didnt see that coming
F
Quite impressive.
This is either scripted or he’s just bad at chess
😶
Oh god the girl in the video is useing her microphone wrong
yeah, "TOTALLY" no rehearsed! You gotta be an idiot to start a game like that!
Cue the "curb your enthusiasm" credit music
lol scripted
If anyone is wondering, the background music originated in Mario Kart DS, it was the airfortess one, I don't remember the name, but that's what Google'S for
I'm actually pretty good at chess, I've practiced 4 hours a day for the past few months anyone wanna 1v1?
you can fucking see the exact moment a part of this mans soul just *dies*
In germany we say: Schäfermatt
This is the only time I've seen schlatt lose harder than the battle of Manberg
f
Its fake to generate some clips. Fck this kind of Humanity.
Watches queen gambit once
even in low ranks, I thought the fools mate was just technically the shortest mate. I didn't know it could actually happen. Schlatt can make anything possible huh
Wait wait wait. Idk much about chess ♟. Not even sure how to play chess ♟. But how in the blue sky did that happen??....
Lol
My dude just quitted reality in under 30 seconds.
He set himself up lol.
To be fair, she didn't see it coming, as her face and her leaning forward indicated that she couldn't believe what just happened.
I know this move xd
I mean, he was correct. She looked surprised so she most likely didn't see it coming.
The idea is to protect the king.
A true queen
The person schlatts playing against looks like a guy wtf
No one else think this was planned by both for views?
Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life" (Jn 3:16"  But you must repent too. From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. (Matthew 4:17)￠

There is one way you can loose chess in 2 moves and this guy did it
oh.
Fake as hell
Is this fake?
Wow, I've never actually seen someone walk into the fool's mate before.
man moment
Can we just talk about the music being from mario kart ds and making me highly nostalgic ?
The “Schlatt?” at the end tho got me
So staged
Why is Abraham Lincoln playing chess?
This made me laugh for 30 minutes straight xD
This has to be fake right?
Wow that totally wasnt staged at all!!!!
hahahahah whaaaaaaaaaat  wowwww epic ,but it might be planed before for more viewers :)
Not exactly a cr1itikal of chess
I hadnt played chess since i was 5 and i was joking with my frienr and said “oh im the best i beat my grandpa when i was 5, so i know what km doing” and i didnt know how the lieces moved and what they wetr named and i lost in like 5 moves lmaoo
He got foolmated
Moist has been dethroned
Fun fact: this is the only way to beat someone at chess in 2 moves, and it happened in a grandmaster tournament a few years back
Probably scripted
I bet you hé wont press rematch
I cant stop watching at this lmao
Every anime villain in a nutshell.
"She's not going to see this coming." famous last words
Queen's gambit
I actually did that to someone once and it was funny. It was just a rando in online chess but I have never seen someone leave so fast in my life
I bet the day after that, that board said "chess is stupid >:("
I didn't even know you can win in 2 moves
I didn't understand any of that
“She’s not gonna see this coming.” But I saw ur failure coming.
as someone who attended a chess group for too long: isn’t that just fool’s mate?
Wait, what even happened??
Yes, she didn’t
oh yes,this is not staged at all
You were trolled. She played e5 for that very reason. XD
I hold the Schlatt Face Shifter!!! 0:22
100% staged but funny nonetheless
My mans legit out here getting Foolsmated
I think the stream froze, he's actually punching the air in utter frustration for losing in 2 moves
You never see it comeeeeeeing
He’s lookin like xqc
Litteraly the entire ficking comment section:   "sHe wOnT SeE ThIS CoMInG"
Can someone explain what happened?
He is a great actor because nobody is that dumb.
This has to be scripted
0:23 fools mate intensifies?
She was going for the 4 move check mate but schlatt played himself making it even faster
She exposes her Queen, he exposes his King, not a good mix Schlatt xD
🤣🤣🤣
There was no sound, he just died!
I just won my first game with this two days ago!!!!
Fake and gay...
I still wonder what was in his head that time.
This happened to me during a school tournament
I mean who dfq opens with g4 😂
“She’s not gonna see this coming”  Famous last words before death
I m the only one who watched 20 time's and laugh every single time?😆😆😆
What was Schlatts plan?
Staged
As someone who grew up on she’s, I can say that I love confusing people with two move check mate, it’s a literal tactic and I love it-
I want to believe that Schlatt was planning on making fun of her for missing the chance to checkmate him, but his reaction says otherwise.  Fool's mate is simultaneously painful and satisfying to watch.
lol
Ain't this one of the first things they teach you when learning chess?
He somehow did worse than XQC
Am I the only one who is too stupid to understand chess?
0:20
well  technically he wasn't wrong
THE FACE SHE MADE WHEN HE OPENED HIS KING LMAO
Well, I thought fools mate was 4 moves. Wow, just wow. You can not make that up
Hes so good at chess, he can read what the other player is thinking and lose at will, this 2 move play was just a demonstration of the absolute power he holds
I don't play chess so don't understand what happened
Just to be fair, she really didn't see that coming. Damn.
BIG MAN
Moist to XqC: mate in 6 shlatt: hold my king
LMAOOO
This dude really fell for that
lol could this be anymore planned out
“And you said you’re gonna beat me” “Yup” *famous last words*
*sclatt.exe* has stopped working
I did this to my friend as well lol
This is staged as fuck
100% simp
Obviously staged and cringe
lol Mario Kart DS music
He obviously knew what was going to happen
how has no one told Alexandra that’s not how you use the blue yeti lol
its called Narrenmatt what she did btw :)
Lmao
Probably staged but still funny af.
Big guy
Jesus Christ XQC.v2
Worse than 6 moves yikes
yap i saw that when i grandma taught me chess. BAM and you are done just like that lol
I actually did this move on a chess championship at school when i was 10, the boy that lost cried and accused me of cheating. The judges made it a draw..
New world record?
How did this man manage to lose quicker than Xqc? Damn
Dumb af
WHILE CALLING YOURSELF "SCHLATT" AND THOSE CHESS SKILLS...SEEMS ABOUT RIGHT FOR A 27 SECOND GAME . OH , BY THE WAY , "BOTEZ" IN MY NATIVE TONGUE MEANS "CHRISTENING" . AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT SHE DID .
some how i tought he was in the phasmophobia truck
Exodia Obliterate: 2021 Recolorized
Better play another game that fits u
we all know he did this on purpose, right? this was a joke.
U do realize it was staged
HAHAHAHAHAHHA😂
That was 4 moves
I want to know what he was planning maybe there was a chance
0:19 - 0:22 his face went from 😁 to 😐
TIL The fastest possible chess game has 3 total moves till check
been playing for basically my whole life.... never have I seen someone get shutdown this fast
0:17 Her mind:"Did he realy just bend over for me to absulutly FUCK HIM UP?!"
So many moves to play and he chooses to play the absolute worst
Bruh
This reminds me of the time where cr1tikal won the chess championship against xqc.
When brain stops working:
The mario kart ds luigis mansion music bruh
6 moves?    Nice speedrun, now my turn
he knew what he was doing
How did she win lol
Lmao, imagine being "Schlatt", we all know that Big Guy can win a chess in one move
big guy why does this have 4 million views
How the fuck does this shit work
Big guy
Oh my lord her face at the end
Even I took a second to realize that what he LOL
Schlatt Gambit
ye i don't think anyone saw that move coming
Congratulations! You played yourself.
what was he even trying to do
It is funny tbh, but I feel like it was scripted.... No hate
Big guy
Someone watched the “how to win chess in two moves video”.
I instantly knew what was going to happen once she played “simple chess”.
The Fool's Mate! LOL!
Theres only one way to lose like that and he did it
Damn the governor from walking dead rly lost his chess skills
Ah yes, the King's Sacrifice, great move.
big guy
L
Well done
Ah yes. The Fool's Mate.
This is almost as good as when XQC lost.
I may be bad at chess but i dont have this type of confidence
A rookie mistakes....
That dissapointment lol
Schlatt you're inting.
“...S-Shlatt?..”
Fool's mate
I still like Charlies win. YEAH BABY THATS WHAT WERE LOOKING FOR, THATS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT!
nice acting
How many idiots in the comment section while post the same sentance? Why not read through some first, youre not original or funny fucktards
You left your queen why open  , ouch I felt that
Trinston was here.
Schlatt mind immediately goes into an alternate universe where he had never existed
Overrated movement I used this move when I was a little kid
🤣🤣
Worse than xqc lmao
the disappointment hits hard
"Schlatt?"
Schlatt?
this was a horrific murder
That escalated faster than Carson’s career going down.
Charlie beating xQc is still the best
you should have uploaded this on april first/april fools
I didn't even realize you could lose a game of chess in only 2 moves.
Now i think schlatt is more stoopid than the 21 kid
The board in this background “I love chess :)” makes me laugh
Alex really deadpanned at him like ‘tf Schlatt..’
When you get fools mated thats when you know when to quit chess...
A record has been beaten!!!
Me who doesn't know anything about chess:wait why has she won :o Edit:I figured it out :D
wut
To be fair, she probably didn't see that coming
LMAOOOO
Wow she was concentrating so hard to see that
“she’s not gonna see this one coming”  UNO REVERSE CARD
she’s playing chess while he’s playing checkers
THEIR FACES
i dont believe its not scripted ... i mean wtf is his actual plan ??
Schlatt... you should study something called "Fools Mate"
the dissapointment on her face
Schlatt?
This is so scripted
Faked. No one moves that pawn first. He even qualifies why it's a good idea, as if center pawn doesn't open up the bishop too. He categorically ISN'T opening up his bishop. He says he has something she's not gonna see coming, but he literally can't move anything from his back row anywhere worthwhile. I don't know anything about chess, but you can see this is set up from a mile away.
I don’t think the king can move that way.
"She's not going to see this coming." - Famous last words
What song is this
op
What were the Twitch chat like?
0:22 ur welcome
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahaXD
so was this scripted or he really didn't know
Next up: Schlatt loses in ONE move
Lol
How is that a checkmate
Him: She aint ever gonna see this coming  Her: I'm bout to end this man's whole career
Him : She's not gonna see this coming Her :Korega Requim...da *Checkmate*
How tf did the black king get there tho?! I can see what the guy was aiming for and I still don’t get it 😭
chess be like that
Fake
3000% fake
Me who doesn’t know anything about chess: how did she do that 0_0
Wow totally not scripted!

Ngl, had this happen to me once un ironically
XQC has some competition on his hands.

"she's not gonna see this coming" famous last words
This is like a ticktok video
I love that opening
Did she beat xqc vs critical record?
I am surprised at the number of people who think this isn't staged
There is nothing I hate as much as the delay before the checkmate is confirmed.

This is what happens when you wipe while sitting
I did this to my older brother when I was 10. He kicked my ass after this humiliation
"Im just gonna play a simple chess"
what
Wtf happened exactly tho fr?
Schlatt.exe has stopped responding
There's a reason it's called "Fool's mate".
Is this fake? I think it's fake.
People who believe that this is real probably don't play chess lol. Google fastest possible way to lose and you get this. Great acting though
I'm bad at chess, but what were he thinking?!
owo Persona 5 Last Surprise (He never see this coming!)
I think he mistook the queen for the king XD
People are naive to a point of believing a beginner found the shortest checkmate in the game on accident
Slatt slatt🐍
You didn't get his strategy of winning HER!
He actually beat xqc's record of 6 moves.
?She's not gonna see this coming." That's what she said bro
Yeah, this was really staged
So fake...but the scholars mate is always fun to watch
"She's not going to see this coming"  To be fair, she seemed surprised.
I hate it when a person act arrogantly even as a joke. Just like Schlatt did/
I’ve pulled that on my ex-boyfriend... he wasn’t very happy either 😂
Lol that I love chess sign is great but he loses
I love how his first move is a blunder
Fool's mate ahahahahaha
"Shes not gonna see this coming"   She didnt schlatt, she really didnt.
Friend:What opening do you play? Me: The King's Gambit. Friend: So you play F4 on the second move? Me: No, I Gambit the king itself.
you were saying?
Bruh there is only one way to win/lose chess in two moves, how did this happen?
isn’t that the music from airship fortress on mariokart DS 😂
Queen's Gambit (2020)
Schlatt eventually stop thinking..
I didn't even know it was possible to suck so hard at a game
The girl seems too good at chess. She should make a youtube channel about it.
Schlatt.exe has stopped responding.
*looks at title*  *looks at schlatt's opening move*   *o h  n o*
What was exactly his plan with that move? Other than putting his king at risk? In case she wouldn't have seen that, what was he going to do that was so spectacular? Seems a little fake, tbh
What
scripted lol..."i love chess" at the background yet didnt know that dumb 2-moves that every chess player knows
I believe it is called Fool's mate
looks fake
How did she win? I generally don’t know?
WHEEZEEEEE IT TOOK HIM SO LONG TO PROCESS!!!!!!!!
I'm sure that jschlatt purposely did this Lol
Lover her somewhat confused look when he does his second move :D But I really can´t judge, I suck at chess, hard.
“Block her”
"She's not going to see this coming" Those were his last words
Top 10 most tragic anime death
0:16 Look at Botez's face as she leans forward and question reality. 😂
You can see her face like "he did NOT just do that"
One of the reasons why Barne's Opening is not popular move
To be fair, no one would ever see that coming.
Worst than xqc
Ah yes, the classical King sacrifice
That is textbook “2 move checkmate”
That's why my bois... Never ever ever say you are gonna beat someone. Only if you are certain. You CAN say but... Unless you want to have the reaction like this. XDDDD
“Call an ambulance, call an ambulance”  BUT NOT FOR ME
Eventually jschlatt stopped thinking
See y‘all in 10 Years
Wow two moves my record was 16 moves
SCHLATT
Simp
F in the chat
I think staged
Fake as fck
some say hes an idiot, they say hes dumb as rock~
Man I didn't think XQC's speedrun of chess could be beat Schlatt proved me wrong
"She's not gonna see this coming"  Yeah... so, about that...
Does anyone know what he was actually trying to do?
Checkmate
well its obviously fake. but its still fun
This is my best trick fr
She literally didn't see this coming. Because at that point the games already over.
I still don’t understand how that’s checkmate? Didn’t black move their king in range of the queen? Or is this just a whoosh over my head?
Well she definitely didn't see a free win coming that's for sure
"I'm gonna beat you and win!"                          *--- Schlatt*
Intelligence 1 0 0
Literally me when playing with my friend
it takes special kind of skill to lose in 2 moves
The way he was so confident
I don’t get how that was check mate
I wonder if he got the king and queen mixed up. I’ve always had trouble with that.
real xqc hours
Can someone explain what he was trying to acomblish becouse it doesnt make any sense to me...
This is a certified Schlatt moment
[ Music Stops ]
Bruh
Schlatt: “She’s not gonna see this fuckin coming” Alex: *OMAE WA MOU... SHINDERU*  Schlatt’s face: “nani?!”
Foolsmate
I know nothing about Chess. But damn, this is like losing a rap battle.  Forever destroyed.
Famous last words before tragedy:  “She’s not gonna see this f**king coming”  Schlatt 2021
Looks like he did it on purpose
KO！
Ah, the infamous fool's mate.
"OUTSTANDING MOVE"
WHAT!!? That wasn’t even 2 turn!!?
I am sure most people have played it and saw how she could have won, and were right with their assumption.
Hmmmm yes lemme leave only one spot for the king to move. Surely it cant get exploited right?
worse than xQc, but good for trying tho-  edit: i don't even know if this is better or worse, it's too funny
"Do you have any last words, Eren Jaeger?"  "She's not going to see this coming"
uh oh
AHAHAHAHA
When he played g4 I just knew
No chess pieces were harmed in the making of this video. ;3
It’s funnier at .25 playback 😂
The realization hitting him and he’s just like “Wait...”
I assume he mistaken the Queen for a King and that is why he lost
This is cheating!!! He threw the match to beat “6 moves”
"She's not going to see this coming"
This is critikal's antithesis
Ah yes, the two-move checkmate. The greatest way to trick an idiot.
I once did this to my uncle. Fucking GOLDEN.
Congratulations you figured out how to lose in the least amount of moves, congrats.
Me, reads title: Damn. What a _fool_
That look on her face right before she made that move, quite devious.
Did he get the king and Queen mixed up?? 😅😅
“She’s not gonna see this coming” absolutely killed me😂😂
Funny to people not knowing about fool's mate.
"Schlatt?"
Well he certainly didnt see that coming
Looks like Ali-A
I was confused until I realized I had the King and Queen symbols mixed up.
Anime antagonists after claiming they are unbeatable.
fools mate
This just made my year and it is not even February. 😂😂😂  **mischievous giggle** “She’s not going to see this coming.” **silence** “Schlatt?...”
i dont know who schlatt is or why I was recommended this but i am not disappointed
How the fuck did she set him up in fools chess or at least I think that’s what it’s called
world record
I laugh so hard after he realize he lose
Pretty impressive, but she should've use the _intercontinental ballistic missile_
Lmao
Jschlatt.exe has stopped working please restart now.
xQc: loses a game in 6 moves  Schlatt: hold my beer
😂😂😂
I mean... technically she ddnt see THAT coming, ddnt she?
What was his plan even???
nah but i lowkey feel for him, i always think i’m pulling a big brained god tier move in games when in reality im forgetting something obvious and i look dumb lol
If *”I’m gonna do what’s called a pro gamer move”* was a summed up in a video.
schlatt?
100% setup but fucking hilarious nonetheless lmao
This has to be staged not even the worst player would ever make such a dumb move
Staged!!!!!!
Schlatt is a genius. He intentionally made himself lose
This dude is playing with his eyes open and his brain closed lmao
It's called "Fool's Mate" As old as the game its self, probably. Every chess player knows about it.
If this anime we have already 2 episodes worth of flashback in 0:16.
Why do people like Schlatt, he is genuinely stupid?
Schlatt: “she is not gonna see this one coming” Me: “outstanding move!”
*Eventually, Schlatt stopped thinking*
luul
He took the world record speedrun away from xqc
Fake and gay.  This is a very famous move, this is too obvious created content. You are a fool to think otherwise.
Please put a comment every year, to remind me to check that year off. We need to see how many years it takes to be recommended to the world.  2021 ✓ 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030
Lol this is called a fool’s mate actual term
Cant wait for people to figure out this is scripted
How’s she win
she like: GOTTEM BiTCH
See you in 10 years
lets be honest here he was right i doubt any of us would expect him to commit chess suicide
Use this comment as a ticket for being here 7 years early.
That was entertaining
Styled on
Classic fools mate
this is so funny
"Shes not gonna see this coming."  Words said before disaster
Hello viewers from the future
By the time this ends up in someones recommendation im still a virgin
Her face read: are you for real? 😕
🤣 in chess thats called foolsmate
pov: your here 10 years later cause it got recommended to you :)
Lol 😂
how is this a win. idk how chess works
Can someone explain why he lose?
oh so fake gtfo
How come schlatt couldn’t castle?
3 days ago
The face of absolute defeat
I don't understand chess what happened

Not that smart, it's actually as easy move.
“YOU FOOOOOOOLLL!”-Goku
And that definitely wasn't on purpose
Seems kinda staged
I didn't even know you could lose in 2 moves
He has the audacity to be surprised.
I mean... she really didn't see such a dumb play coming lol
Fake
Schlatt: I'mma Queen's Gambit the shit outta her. Alex moves Queen: so you have chosen death?  Schlatt: *NaNi??!!*
My guy speedran the Cr1tikal vs XQC match
10 years from now this clip will be recommend to son
in case you don’t know much about chess, he lost the game in the least amount of moves physically possible
Damn i didnt know that was possible. I mean xqc lost in 6 moves but 2?!
I... didn’t know the king could do that
Schlatt?
Lmao his face when he lose
Great script
I'm 99.9% sure this move is correct since it has given him a lot of views and exposure that he wouldn't have gotten if he played it any other way. Never seen or heard of this dude untill after this move, did it on purpose or not regardless funny clip.
What exactly was the plan? I can't tell what the big play was supposed to be on the third move that he didn't get to make, just seems like it was a deliberate loss.
Didn’t even know this was possible😂👌🏻
And that's how you define "irony" in 27 seconds, kids.
Yeah most halfway decent chess players don't expect you to trap your king immediately.
Don’t put urself down man it was 3 moves not 2
Okay but how did she win
If this shows up in ur recommendations 5-10 years later I said hi
I don't understand chess
Nah. That’s evolving but backwards.
Here before this is in everyone recommendations
This had me dying for too long
rumors say that he is still processing what just happened
I hate chess...
Claim your here before it got recommended 6 years later prize
Komugi be like
So this is where you get the inspiration for The Queen's Gambit
Only Jschlatt can pull off something of *THIS* calibur
I've never played chest nor do I know how to. Someone explain how she won. I am a degenerate
am i the only one who noticed that this is staged?
wuh
r
so clearly set up by him, look at the way he words it for more comedic value
“She’s not going to see this coming.”
Oh my lord her face when he moved his last pawn I can’t😂😂😂 0:16
Bruh that was so fake but whatever
2 lovebirds playing chess
Ok, fools checkmate nice and good, but i just know that he let her win. No one who knows anything about chess would actually do this if he tried to win.
WHERE IS CALL ME CARSON! HES MY FAV YOUTUBER
Ah, the fool's move
Out played.
Hehe
All part of his plan of course :)
Guess he never saw that coming ( cue persona 5 music)
This is better than a scholar’s mate
Well, turns out i did not know which one Schlatt was, until that ending
You literally have to actively help the opponent to get beaten in two moves.
the name of this is the 'Fool's Mate' which makes it even funnier
If you believe this is not staged, I have bad news for ya.
Schlatt: Please come over Her: But you promised me to play chess with me Schlatt: Forget chess, I dont have much time Her: We Are Going To Play Chess Schlatt: Ok fine  Schlatt: *see video* Her: This b- is so desperate
Not the “I love chess :)” in the background 😭😭
Is she a trans?
Fake as F
Scripted?
As the background says, he definitely will love chess
HIS FACE
Dang
I dont even know how pieces move....
Him: *She's not gonna see this coming* Her: *Uno reversed card*
Fake
I wasn’t even this bad when I played chess for the first time
The whiteboard: "I love chess :)"  After this: *I hate chess :(*
This has to be a skit, surely?
scripted
And they ask if you're fine but you're not fine
I feel like he actually knew what he was doing because that opening is so dumb you have to be intentionally throwing the game to play it
Oldest trick in the book
How cant you see that?lmao dude like focus goddamit.
Isn't this called a fool's checkmate
I’ve discovered chess imortality
I am wondering if he did that on purpose he is known to fuck up on purpose for the bit
I actually won like this once.  I saw the first move and I thought "no, is he really going to do this", and sure enough.  It's the fastest possible way to lose.  I'm not anything special in chess.  I just happened to read it right.  I can brag that that I won a chess game in two moves.
I love how Schlatt looks so disappointed and she just feels guilty for doing it 😂😂
I remember a book with a game like this in it, it was called "the homework machine"  Cringey book, good read for a middle schooler
What's with these pseudo intellectual streamers suddenly picking up chess? Lmao
World record : lose in 2 moves
Not sure if this dude did really mean it, or he just wanted to troll Botez. Pulling a Fool's Mate like this just feels weird, idk
This guy is the worst chess player to live he did the coco cola opeing only real chess players see what this guy did wrong
his smile and optimism: gone
We need a rematch
I guess she never did expect somebody to be this stupid. He wasn't wrong.
Fun fact this has more views than the actual video
“...”  Schlatt would never be the same after this  “She’s never gonna see this coming”
This is scripted, right? Please tell me this is scripted
xqc is okay now
I feel like it was scripted cuz no actual chess player would make that mistake 😂
As a chess player I was screaming when I saw the title and began watching the video
She's not gonna see this coming 🤝 can't wait to see you at Gabba ash
Ah yes, the fool's mate.  Only way to lose dumber than the bishop's mate
I might be wrong, but couldn’t he just take her queen with his right rook?...I thought it’s only checkmate if there’s no possible way to keep your king alive? I know very little about chess and obviously it said she won, but shouldn’t he be able to do that?
I love how Alex is just so confused by his move and is like "uhhh- why? Anyways"
I literally did this to my friend. Unironically
His fate was sealed from the beginning
Pretty sure she didn´t see that move coming
I don’t think he noticed it but I did
What music is this
He perfectly foolsmated himself
He got fool mated
the REAL Elizabeth Harman
This was a bit. Good acting -- but I see through the nonsense
“she’s not gonna see this one coming”
Let's just say it's called "Fool's Mate" for a reason...
Ah.. yes.. G4
She actually didn't see this coming.
Theres no way he didn't know  I dont even play chess and know this
When the player with the whites asks "Should I go first?", you know the result.
Shes not going to see this one coming...
*"The truth is, the game was rigged from the start."*
So fake its painful
If this isn’t scripted I don’t know what is.
So I watch this and literally the next day I’m playing chess with my friend and I make the EXACT SAME mistake even though I KNEW this could happen
The King's Gambit
I did the same thing in my school chess tournament and everyone was like "what just happened".... What happened was, my opponent was a total idiot!!
Is the song from Mariokart DS?
Bruh Schlatt just got fool's mate
What a loser
Didn't even know this is possible
Not just fake but also stupid
It’s so fake
LeGM
I'm just here because chess😐...
okay but what exactly was he planning to do?
Fun Fact: He Lost the game!
Not an EXCELLENT MOVE!
What did she even do?
this is staged so badly my face was not showing any emotion throughout the whole video
This is the most epic fail I’ve ever seen in my life
Her face before she moves to win is just priceless.
She said center of the board but there is no center. Ameteur.
He should of done that move where you destroy the board with an intercontinental ballistic missile
To the person who is reading this you’re perfect and don’t let anyone bring you down:) plz sub
he legit lost in the fastest way possible
He got foolsmated 😭😭
Why does the "She's not going to see this one coming" make it seem like he did that on purpose?
This is called fools mate and can only be achived if the player purpusly makes it happen, therefor this is fake.
HE MOVED HIS F PAWN!
xqc is not the joke anymore
I love the face he makes, The complete silence And the smug face she has  Its so perfect
virgin xqc's 6 move loss vs chad schlatt 2 moves loss
the cr1tikal move
The disappointment on his face
Hahahaha so silly boy  a noob
You have to have an insanely low brain capacity if you do that. Why, just why would you do that? What was the point of his second move? I’m getting worked up about nothing, but it just pissed me off.
"She's not gonna see this throw coming"
Can someone tell me the song in this video? Been wondering what it was since the original clip released
I love how he played “Airship Fortress” from Mario Kart DS. It fit perfectly with the situation.
Queen's Gambit in a nutshell.
The fool's mate
His smile and optimism: gone
“She’s not gonna see this one coming” OH SHE DIDNT ALRIGHT

World record chess speedrun any % no glitch
Eeeh don't feel bad I'd lose in one move. Hell I'd lose in 0 moves.
She didn’t see the stupidity of the move coming I guess
0:23 lol She gave like a a Mr Burns hunch when she did that 🤣 all I can read in her mind was "Excellent " just like Mr Burns always says in the Simpsons lol
*Schlatt loses: Schlad
*Schlatt??*
Plzz the background music 🙏🙏🙏🙏
His chuckle and then immediate shock, surprise, and awe.
I have never knew you can beat someone in 2 moves lol
Beans⁰
obviously staged
this is my favorite clip on the internet
This is not the first time you are watching!
Early queen is a strat i use And works alot of the time
Never seen a legit fool's mate before
All I can say is LOL 😂🤣
Omg, thats a fools' mate. Ive always wanted to pull one off on somebody, I usually try to do my bishop though
Just to be clear, he intentionally lost
When u have been playing chess for 7 years and u can clearly tell this was staged
"Not scripted"
she broke his mind XD
the fact he played the fastest checkmate in the game probably means he knows the move
Wut a noob
This one's called the "Simp's Gambit".
Nice Luigis mansion music
I always go for this move because there’s a chance I can get it to work
It’s xqc all over again
It's called "Fool's Mate" and this is obviously staged.
i don’t know how to play chess and i don’t know how it works but i’ll pretend i do by insulting jschlatt and calling him an idiot
Can someone explain how she won I don’t understand chess
I mean, he was right that she never expected him to do that. She questioned reality for a second lol
The ending is so perfect.
ur not the first
Don't worry you are funnier
this was obviously planned lmao
100% staged and fake
GAKE AND FAY
As someone who doesn't understand chess I have no idea what just happened but I sure enjoyed it.
staged
This is staged its crazy how easily some people are entertained
this should become a meme
This is also known as a Fool's Mate.
what happends later
This plan all along she fell for it🤡
I really don't understand chess. Does someone mind explaining how that was checkmate? (sorry if it should be obvious)
The king and Queen on both sides are in the same position which isn't allowed specifically because of this move
Big guy mad
XQC: *ah finally a worthy opponent*
Lol I forgot this was possible
I remember doing that exact same thing. We had a class where we had to play a game of chess and note down every single move, so we decided to make the game as quick as we could.
Let’s be honest : you watched this more than once
Legend says that his face is still full of confusion and regret to this day.
The best part is how this pattern literally requires white to open up their pawns and black to have cleared the path for their queen.  at least it wasnt mate in 3
His face is priceless
Ladies and gentlemen we witnessed a murder
She saw it as soon as he opened, that's why the face she made. That lie felt genuine tho "oh im just gonna play dumb"-> actually opens the way for her queen
I think somebody didn't understand this is ironic, it is not a real game, who on earth would really do that opening?
Ligit, this would be some anime shit right here
He did that on purpose
The expression on Alexander Botezs face would be so relatable in that position, she knows dam well it’s checkmate, she’s just confused why he would play that move
Fun fact:The move she did is what i think is called the fools move
So obivously staged by him :))
Losing in 2 moves. Phaaaa. Could never be me
This is so obviously staged
Someone once went to me "Hey, look, if you do this with your pawns, and I do that, then boom, checkmate at the beginning of the game!" and I went "Okay, yeah, but why would anyone do that?" True story.
Top 10 anime betrayals:
Waiting for the Training Arc of our protagonist
Its scripted, this comb is known in the chess community
Can someone who knows chess explain?
"I'll take 500 for shit that was scripted"
Top 10 Gamer move moments
Can someone explain how she wins? I don't know how to play chess and it looks like she just puts one piece in the middle right of the board and just wins somehow..
"She's not gonna see this coming"  Neither did you
The just played KING gambit
What were you trying to go for?
I love how as soon as he placed those 2 pawns i face palmed exactly when she checkmated him
people have unironically played the fools mate? wtf
flat?
I imagine that face in the last frame is the face you get when you take a test, and you studied for hours before hand, but then you tank the grade
They literally just stole Charlie’s content and then made it worse by faking it
This is so staged man, legit everything slat does is fake. that was the most fake reaction ive seen. He fakes everything he does and you guys still eat it up. Hes legit a whole differenrt person outside of the internet, he just wears his mask everyday to work.
Rip schlatt last words were “She not gonna see this one coming”
How did she win? I dont understand
You can see when his soul dies
Amazing how she check mates in only 2 moves. Must take years to reach that level of mastery.
I have no idea how to play chess except basic formations but I plan to learn soon because I'm tired of being out of the loop on these. So how exactly did she win if I may ask?
Damn it’s no longer 6 moves it’s 2 moves
This is scripted  100% 💯💯💯
I know it's scripted but its hella funny😂
Hello darkness my old friend
"Schlatt?"
Everybody’s talking about the “nothing to see here” but what about the look of pure despair at the end
That is priceless
I'm brand new to chess isn't that called a fools mate or something?
I know this
Jschlatt.EXE has stopped working
I saw that coming as soon as i saw her put that pawn forward
Still better than xQc
0:22 lol
This is literally the fastest mate possible
Sad
That’s why you never play the kings pawn
Fake
i've watched this countless times now
The new xqc
Only question how did she do that i am kinda new to chess
With those skills, that mindset, that composition, u can make GM in approximately 919191919 years GL
How did this get so many views? I get that this was uploaded by schlatt but still if this was uploaded to his regular channel this would be the 5th most viewed thing on the channel
what schlatt did is actually called the "Fools Mate" and is the absolute fastest way to lose a game in chess
Me: gets destroyed in an argument with my mom and gets roasted  Also me: thinks of a comeback in the shower that night  Me again: goes up to my mom the next day, thinking, “she’s not gonna see this one coming”  My mom:
Fool's Mate. Nearly impossible to lose this way by accident.
When I'm down I'll replay this video to know there is someone worse than me
He is soooooo bad lol
*Laughs*
It’s clearly scripted
the perfect clip
What’s the song called though?
HOW
My dude Schlatt speedrunning a loss like a champ. Didn't expect any less from him!
At the end the “Shlatt?* She’s like; You good bro?
Lol
U got outplayed
For what i received i passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the scriptures  1 Corinthians 15 3   PS: "according to the Scriptures" - what the Apostle means is that Lord Jesus fulfilled prophecy's of the Prophets of God in Old Testament. There are like hundreds of Prophecies that Lord Jesus fulfilled, just look it up dear ones. God is our Father. He is the best of Fathers, the most lovable and merciful of Fathers. Read the whole uncensored Bible that is Catholic(The Original) and  pray my friends. Wish you all well🙏amen🙏
Getting clotheslined with the Fool's Mate there XD
I love how hes listening to the theme from mario kart Ds from the pirate ship lvl   *Childhood intensifies*
Is there not a move to switch the king and rook or is there more to the rule? Or am I just wrong, haven't played chess or even looked at chess in 20 years...
Does does he really love chess? is this a joke? 😂😂
I love how people act like this is real and not scripted
shlatt?
Clickbait.. I dont think he is that stupid..aaaaaaand yea so far 3,2 million views.. SO YEA PLAN WORKED ..
they should make a TV show about this move
Wait, but what she did
Her "Schlatt?" makes this even funnier for some reason for me
Soooo... can someone break down what happened and how she won so fast? I’ve never played chess before.
Funny thing is I recognized the song right away  Airship Fortress on Mario Kart DS
“And you actually pinpoint the exact moment his heart stops”
totally not on purpose ofc
"She's not gonna see this coming."  Top 10 Words said before disaster
Wow, even beginners are less likely to get check mated in two turns...
Wait cant a pawn knock out a queen, or move sideways? I forgot, I havent played chess for centuries
He's good at government not chess
That’s so sad
Literally staged? wow so funny?
was this on purpose
What did he intend to do? I don't get those moves
0:13 me saying the math test was easy 0:21 me getting an F
Ima do a Schlatt move next time I play chess.
Idiot
Lol
wow
"She's not gonna see this coming."  *insert funny unoriginal*  now like, hand em over.
he probably did this on purpose for views, i mean it did get 3 and a half million views
Schlatt:"g4, get the bishop out"  Also Schlatt: effectively restricts the bishop's movement with f3  【ＹｅＡｈ，　ｔＨｉＳ　ｉＳ　ｂｉＧ　ＢｒＡｉｎ　ＴｉＭｅ】
He obviously aimed for that
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true .  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.
I clicked because I thought I saw myself in the thumbnail. I’m deadass this guy’s twin.
This video is *PERFECTION*
It's charming he did that on purpose just for the extra content with botez.
Bruh
And people wonder how Grand Masters are made
I half expected the Seinfeld theme to play when it showed he lost
The smartest loss ever.
lol but what are the chances of that happening
i just want to know what was he trying to do
lmaoooo mans rly just got Fool's Mated
L
That must be a joke nobody loses in 2 moves
Legend says he broke the sign that says 'I love chess' from the background, rip bro
Love that look.
I don’t blame him.  The boss music never started playing.
That would be so satisfying if it was real
Me in my mind: Even I can do better than that.  Me in real life: Gets checkmated in 1 one move.
🤣
What’s the music in this part of the video?
this is like me against my mum
Jajaja que estúpido
WHY IS THIS TRENDING BHAHAHA
Every day with a Big guy videos is a great day
rip big guy
I hate that this already has 3 mil views.
Hello people from the future
Checkmate....
Staged! Anyone who falls for this is not a chess player
Big guy
This is quite literally the fastest way to get checkmated, there is no other way you could e check mated faster
nice one big guy
I’m guessing your able to castle in this version of chess if they don’t know about it???
I’ve watched this too many times
I feel like this is scripted...
"She will never see this coming" Little did she know, that he truly showed his *Last Surprise*, hence we can say that she *never see it coming*.
When you take kings gambit too seriously!
"She’s not going to see this coming"  Mission failed succesfully
Acted
I DIDNT THINK IT WAS POSSIBLE TO LOSE A GAME OF CHESS THIS FAST HOLY SHIT
i watched this so many times it's beautiful
Ohhh, Your move was so bad like newbee
Whoops! I meant to do that.
Did someone legitimately get fool's mated
She's not gonna see this coming gets defeated 2 milliseconds later
Someone explain this to me I don't play chess?
Schlatt reaction 😶
ther's no way he didn't know it was fools mate
His heart sunk to the bottom in an instant
I dont understand how did he loose?
Everyone repeat the quote: "She's not going to see this coming."
0:22 You can actually pinpoint the moment his heart rips in half
Trend
schlatt?
i dont belive that is not fake
Is no one asking for the music this is a banger!
This was staged right
Thats What I call a Pro-gamer Move
Awkward silence after checkmate. Isn’t it?
Why does she look like young sheldon
Please tell me this is set up?
I simp for Botez.
Call an ambulance, but not for me
Scholar mate
Imagine if she just premoves considering Bg2
Schlatt definitely planned this to happen... lol
🤢🤢🤮🤮👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿🤬🗑🗑🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨😡😡😡👎🏿👎🏿
The queen’s gambit
That had to be fake
Who ever is reading this, God has a plan, trust the process💖
한국인한테 왜 뜨는겨 왜... 나 영어 못해 모른다고 씨팔
Not even possible tf
what was he actually planning?
@Nateos
Ok someone fill me in, I’ve never played chess how did she win?

That's why Grob's attack sucks

Bruh
A rival for the Tennison Gambit. Well played.
Lol 🤣
their expressions tell a whole damn story on its own bahaha
Number 30 on Trending, nice.
Lmao
Cmon man, who doesn't know the Fools Mate? Clearly staged.
Why is everything so fake now
Scripted lol😂
We found someone worse than the Goblin what
That chess game was shorter then my relationships
Why did this remind me of Lelouch playing chess.... oh yeah I know why because she kicked his ass in record time! XD
The pure instant change in his face from excitement to shock is amazing.
the moment that this clip has more views than the actual vid lmaooo
0:21 the moment the disaster strike
And so it was invented. A 2 move check mate caused by jschlat's dumbass
fool's mate
The face she made when she saw him moving that peon.
And I quote “She’s not gonna see this coming”
ok but like what was even his plan
Huh, never actually saw the Fool's mate in practice before. Always thought it was a hypothetical example no one would actually fall for.
.....schlattt..?
this is really fake
Someone willing to explain how this guys has a yt channel for a week and this vid has like 3m views after a day? and i have no fcking clue who he is whatsoever?????? is he like a big twitch streamer that decided to open a yt channel or whats goin on here
**pikachu face**
lol
He’s right she didn’t see that coming 😂😂
scripted??
Ahh yes, the famous king gambit
He lost so quick
when you have to let your gf win
I legit knew this was gonna happen when schlatt moved the pawn... I USE THIS OPENING EVERY GAME I PLAY
Schlatt managed to get himself into the only way to lose in two moves in the entire game.   bro what how did you manage to do that
its too soon ... MoistCr1tical record against xqc has been broken !!!
And that is what we call, “a pro gamer move”
Schlatt?
This has gotta be fake
obvious throwing for content
Wow he’s so powerful
Why does everyone talking "shes not gonna see this one coming", he clearly said *"shes not gonna see this f*cking coming."*
Relax guys, he's just simping for her
Why this video has so many views in no time?! lol
This guy
"Schlatt Matt" würde ich sagen 😂
I feel sorry for Ray Mark most of the idiot people be like wtf you again. I mean like dudes tryna watch yt and enjoy his time, you mofos make it sound like its bad for him to comment like stop being an asshole
He obviously did that deliberately
Phoney video.
That's actually 4 moves
The "I love Chess" sign behind him makes this even better
AT 0:26 HIS FACE . HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHHAHA
28 on trending
“She’s not gonna see this fu*king coming”  *Wrong answer* It has to be *he*
Seems like alex use “We didnt even reach climax” moves to this man😅😂
Schlatt: "She is not going to see this coming"  The girl: Watch how I effortlessly end this whole man's career
When you don’t know how to defend against the Fool’s mate.
still don't understand how she won
Ya sure know how to make a lady feel special
what exactly was he trying to accomplish with “she’s not gonna see this coming” like what possible move was he planning that made him think he had the upperhand
100% did this on purpose lmao
Lol.  "Schlatt?"
Thats what happens when you make a movie on netflix about chess. All stupid tik-tok generations try to do something that requires intelligent and ends up like this. Im not even surprised
"she's not gonna see this one coming."  "no u"  *surprise pikachu face*
Am I really the only one here who does not know how to play chess and have no idea what's going on
Not so big now
A Chess fan : did Schlatt WON  Me : she did'nt see that coming
i won that way plenty of times. And it's extrenely simple. Even more than you'd think
Forsen beats xQc's minecraft speedrun. Schlatt beats his chess speedrun. Mr. Cow can't take a break.
Dopo quanto ho visto ieri credo che Homyatol sarebbe in grado di perdere anche contro questo
Definitely scripted. There's is less than one percent chance a beginner opens with that, and an even lesser chance doing it to a streamer/chess master
The word “should be shes not gonna coming seeing this.”
I’m..shocked because all this time I could’ve beaten my mom with just two moves 💀
Schlatt got splatted
legend of the meme
Kings Gambit
He sure loves chess
To be fair, I bet she really didn’t see that coming
Game gambit
lmaooo
Wack
It's satire. Acting.
0:15 play it 1000 times until schlatt wins
“She’s not gonna see this coming.” Famous last words
too fake
Never play F3.
nice acting
just so u guys know its staged :P
Schlatt????
I wouldve cried and stopped playing after that
Oooooooooooh shez cute!
This has to have been planned

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA tell me this is staged pls 😂
Kings gambit
trash
Fool's mate
He went from 😈 to 😳 in like 3 seconds
Botez Gambit 😂
I'm kind of proud that I immediately knew how this was gonna end because of the title and the "G4"
and it is already as of move 2 that we have a completely new game
and it was in this position that white resigned the game, as there is nothing more to be done here
🎶 When you try your best and you don’t succeed~
King Gambit
My man got clapped
This play is a must know for chess players tbh
Fun fact this is literally the only way to lose in 2 moves
...why the fuck is this 30 on trending?! It’s just jshaltt loosing chess! 🤣
Bruh LMFAO! officially the worst chess player ever!
*schlatt.exe has stopped working*
Bruh
damn I didnt even know you could lose in two moves
Looks like scripted
I think this is high IQ simping
Not real, big guy always wins
Hit em with my move
I don't get it, Did he do it on purpose?
"..Schlatt?" LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOO i'm dead
As someone who plays chess occasionally, that was the dumbest move I've ever seen in my life. Also probably the easiest win I've ever seen.
bad acting
The look she gave when he made that move was great
It is called fool's mate for a reason
Staged. Still funny
You must cut at the end the laugh of this mexican at the interview
One question       What the actual F**k was that plan
Seems scripted he even said get the bishop out then plays the only 2 moves that leads to mate.
Kraliçe gambiti
Task failed successfully Mission failed Press F for respect GG EZ
Wait i am confused, how did he lose?
The fact i new what she was trying to do since her first moved had me cry laughing 😂
Chess speed run any% random seed New WR: losing in 2 moves Old WR: XQC losing in 4 moves
OOF
She looks like a chick who deals cards on an online casino. Where a physical person is dealing them
I love how Alexandra immediately notices the mistake and is just stunned for a moment.
Bet he tried that on purpose, still LMAO
Fool's mate
trying to beat xQc's highscore huh?
All that’s cool and all but what just happened Idk chess
He raised a death flag.
So staged
Huge replay value
Top 10 Epic Chess Anime
Him: She's not gonna see this coming *You can say that again pal!*
I wonder how a pro chess player gets out that move.
Insert your "she's not gonna see this coming" comment here👇
Not staged btw
I hope the scripting/planning didn’t take much longer than the video.
Set up, fake clip 🤦‍♂️
Oh hell yeah. Fool’s Mate.
Overconfident evil guy
I suck at chess. I barely remember the names of the different pieces...but even I knew THAT was a stupid move. 😂
Shlatupid
Fools mate, pure gold
Didn't know you could even do that
How tho
Bruh why would you open yourself wide open like that
Lmao wth?
I don’t understand cheas
"She's not gonna see this coming" Yes, she's dumbfounded.
I'm so proud of the small men community
Charlie is shaking
watching this after a chess game is funny
LOL
lmao
fake
I am gamer
Ahh yes, the fool's mate
He speedran it the wrong way
Reason number 1 of why you move at least one of the Pawns into the middle.
It's too soon, we haven't reached the climax yet
*Hey, to you reading* .... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
obviously scripted tho this happens sometimes but lol
Damn
He failed to properly implement the Tennison ICBM Gambit.
Wow! In my entire lifetime, I've never actually seen anyone get into a "fool's mate". You need to work on your game son.
Schlatt Vs xQc when?
I don't know who these people are, I just know that this is fucking hilarious
“Schlatt?”
Legend says he is still staring at his screen in disbelief to this day
It seems like XQC has a challenger for the title of Queen of Pepegas.
You know sometimes you just gotta send someone to take em out
Queen Dammit
My guy this has to be a skit, its too good to be true. Its fucking perfect
Script
C’mon. This is widely known by chess enthusiasts as the shortest possible chess game.
fake but ok
I love the evil look 0:18
He lost cause he didn't do the Botez Gambit, in which he sacrifices his Queen.
Schlatt blundered so hard he went from ?? to ????????
*insert unfunny joke about "she's not gonna see this coming" that has been used 4 times*
I have never actually seen someone get Fools Mated before
How did he lose exactly?
Has to be fake
Inside her head: “What???” “Is there something I’m not seeing?” “Why would he do that?” “Should I put him in check mate?” “In 2 moves?” “It’s almost like taking candy from a baby” “This feels wrong” “Oh well his mistake I won!”
I think it was set up.
You had one job man survive 3 moves.
“shes not going to see this coming”   *gets fools mated*
What's even more ironic is the whiteboard with I love chess written on it.
And this, ladies and gentlemen, is called the "Fool's Mate".
He just sat there dying
1 head move lol
Who TF is schallt   (Get it ;) )
Idiot
"You had one job"
The rise of pretend shock videos is alarming. Everyone has stopped being genuine anymore.
*Fool's mate*
Was that a fools mate or something
🤔->😂->😄->😦
So no one is gonna talk about how YouTube thinks this isn’t the most popular video on the channel??
Just stick with moving your kings pawn forward two spaces for your first move
The prowess of chess nerds is over 9000. Insane!
The wicked one comes.  Ephesians 6:11 [11]Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. Revelation 12:12 [12]Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time....
See what? What? I guess we too will never see what's coming...
And this is what I call the King's gambit
How painful is it to get your testicles stomped by high heels this hard
He: "She's never gonna see this coming" Alex: NEITHER DO YOU
The Airship Fortress music brings back great memories of being knocked off the track by bullets
Good job at winning the world record of losing. I couldn't do it myself.
Haha woman smart
Schlatt not knowing how the absolute fuck she did that
Uppss
Great fake game. Completely unscripted I'm sure. Shame on anyone who believes this is real and gives a like.
“You weren’t supposed to do that...”
Schlatt:"she's not going to see this coming"  it was at this moment he knew he fckd up
LMAOOOOO
As a person who knows nothing about chess, this video is making me bruh
This is now called  The "Schlatt Opening".
Truly a fool's check
Me: are we literally speedrunning in chess?
Schlatt made the one mistake that doesn't deserve to be made
Fat rip to this chad
I didn't even know you can go down in history that quick!
Even if you don’t understand chess, surely you have enough brain power to realise that opening that hole is a terrible idea
Me: Greatest loser in chess Schlatt: Loses in two moves Me: TEACH ME
Ive never played chess can someone explain how she won?
As someone who knows how to play chess Shlatt’s first move was terrible move the 2 middle pieces first to free you other pieces.
When is this from
Loops
Tbh, this is in the top 10 videos of the internet.
"This day you will see courage , honor and sacrifice so says your king ride with me into glory and legend  !! "  - White King . " Eh a uh yeah about that " Black Queen .

DESTROYED  DEMOLISHED
The fools gambit

Alexandra: "I came here expecting a challenge."  Schlatt: plays pawn f3  Alexandra: "All I found was you."
I can do it in one move
She did queens raid on him 😂
Ah yes, the famous Coom gambit
He was like "I'm gonna checkmate her for sure"  Makes the worst move possible🙊
LMAO-
Rayos!!!! Hasta a mi me dolió
still better than xqc
Noob
If You Feel Like A Failure Just Remember This Video
How the fuck do you manage to see the  only move that makes you lose the game the quickest possible way and think you're winning?
Man feels bad
Yeah, Magnus Carlsen doesn’t stand a chance in hell against GM Schlatt.
This channel is concentrated pure gold
Shooketh
😂😂bro I am dead 💀
ah i see you've played the king's sacrifice opining.
I assume the “I LOVE CHESS” whiteboard in the background isn’t going to be up for much longer.
She’s not gonna see this coming
Schlatt wins the YouTube algorithm in 2 moves
They didn't call him two-turn Shlatt for nothing...
Well at least he's not XQC
Why is this on trending smh
Chess is so fuckin stupid
Big guy
"Fool's checkmate?" More like "Simp's sacrifice."
Fastest pas received to go to toss nation
Is this queens gambit

Can someone please explain how a clip from gets on trending and has 2.6 million views in 1 day, when it’s just a clip taken from a video that’s like 7 months old

This is scripted, right? Because :O I knew Fool's Mate was possible, but never actually saw it done
She really didn’t expect it
I keep rewatching. It's so golden
Man took speed running to the next level
im 100% sure this is staged i do not belive for the life of me that any body gets fools mated like this on their first game
Is it me or is the placement of king and queen wrong? They’re not supposed to play mirror positions for this exact reason, because u can get checkmated easily if u played mirror.
That actually takes talent to lose that quickly.  I thought the fastest possible was 3 moves.
Lmfao Big Brained💀💀💀
scripted!
Clearly he just Simp-ed
Not really knowledgeable on chess. Somebody care to tell me what exactly happened?
I play chess alot and I didnt even know that was possible
Lmao
Let’s act like we didn’t just see that
Wtf did I just watch.
Imagine getting beaten by the fools checkmate
This is OLD bruh
That was the quickest chess match that I have seen 😳😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂love botaz
His face tho
Fool’s Mate
She knew what she was doing.
I like how this isn't clickbait.
I can’t tell if Schlatt really lost or he did it on purpose.
I like how clip of a video that’s months old is now trending.
This is what's known as 'fool's mate'. A checkmate done with the fewest possible amount of moves.
Big Guy trending
I didn’t even know you could win in 2 moves.
I'd love to see Jschlatt in Kakegurui
Jshlatt Died of a Seizure, Stroke, Coma, And Hemorrhagic Shock.
did you know that this checkmate was named the fools mate
You should really learn the Grob Attack.  It's the only way to make g4 a good opening move.  If she would've played something like d4, you can fianchetto the bishop to g2, threatening to take the pawn. In this instant, she played e4, opening the diagonal for the Queen.  So after g4, play h3 to prevent the checkmate, and then fianchetto the bishop.
Makes an interesting move   CURRENT OBJECTIVE SURVIVE
*THROBBING*
I did not think this is even possible even on purpose
"shes not even gonna see this coming" famous last words
the little *"shlatt?"* gets me everytime
talk about a queen that can go anywhere.
F in chat?
He: She is not gonna see this coming She: Lol
And now they're dating, wow
Plot twist: he lost on purpose in the worst way possible to go viral
The intensity on her face after he moved
Don’t mind me making a bookmark 0:26
I didn’t realize it was technically possible to lose in only two moves
Ah yes the classic Tennison King Sacrifice
That's like, the only way you can lose a game in two moves, it's like he wanted to do it on purpose
stop his face absolutely wrecks me every time i see this clip
ive always wanted to do this to somone. ive come close so many times!
Sad thing is this happened to me before
Lol
That’s the face u make when u hear someone open the door while ur beating off
I have no idea of what he tried to do and what she did, but it entertained me lol.
Schlatt
He said “get the bishop out” then didn’t get the bishop out? 🤨 He left no room to move that bishop... totally staged. 😠
Schlatt
What an idiot dude that’s embarrassing 🙈
Rigged game I bet
oof
... is that... Mario Kart Airship Fortress music???
i dont even see where he got sheckmate
It's 2021 and someone falls to Fool's mate
Bruh that's broken
This is so fake
"Schlatt?"
The fact that he play the white is even funnier xD
Technically is true what he say  We never see that coming
Admit it.. we have all had this happen to us once
Wait how did he lose?

Have your sins been forgiven today and forever?  Think about this.   The God of the bible,  the One True God made us to worship him, obey him, and enjoy him forever.   We break His laws daily by not putting Him first, not thanking Him like we should, we lie, we lust, we have sex before marriage, we dishonor our parents, we covet things other people have, we take God's name and use it in vain,  we use it in a low manner,  sometimes as a cuss word,  (God is holy and even His name is holy),  we don't love like we should, etc.  In doing so we're saying He's not a good provider,  He's a liar,  He's untrustworthy,  He's not worthy of praise.   All these things and more are counted against us.   The bible says God is the just judge of the world and one day He will settle the score for all the wrong we've done.  God is holy meaning He is righteous (morally perfect in thought, word,  and deed)  It also means He is set apart and higher than us.  God  being good, must punish all sin or wrong doing in the world.  This means that if you sin one time God will cast you in hell for eternity.   Because He is good and He doesn't turn a blind eye to sin.  But there is good news.  2000 years ago Jesus the Son  of God came into this world and lived a perfect life ( He never sinned once)  and He died on the cross taking the wrath that we deserve and paid the penalty for the sins we committed.   The bible says that if you will repent (confess and forsake your sins)  and trust in what Christ did on the cross (He took the wrath of God that was meant for you and I) then all your sins will be forgiven and when you die you will be in heaven with God and all who believe for eternity.  Jesus died and on the third day He rose from the grave.  Get right with God today don't wait.  Once you die after that comes the judgement.  It's the most important thing you can do.   If you repent and trust in what Christ did on the cross you will be born again or born spiritually.   Right now you're dead in your sins and you can't see the beauty of Jesus Christ but after you trust in Christ all the things you hate about God like obeying him,  serving Him,  loving Him and others,  reading the bible, praying and going to church you will love to do those things because God changes your heart.   That's how you know you have been born again and forgiven.  Please think long about this and ask me any questions you have as this is the most important thing you can ever think of in your life.   An eternity in hell (darkness and a lake of fire the bible describes it, with weeping and gnashing of teeth)  or an eternity out of that place and into the loving arms of God who is infinitely glorious, has infinite knowledge and has infinite power to do all that He pleases.   You decide.   Have a great day!

I’ve never seen someone so confused, in denial, and defeated. Damn gg

Moment when you realise you last longer in chess than the bedroom.....
Fool's mate. It rarely shows up in actual games
This is going to be the new twitch chess meme
xQc : *Finally a worthy opponent, our battle will be legendary!*
She said "Schlatt?" at the end to find out if he is dead or not
I've never seen a mate like this actually
LMAOOO
This had to be fake
....schlatt?
Fools checkmate XD
Lookin like Q.
Theres no way, how the fuck do you know how to move your pieces without throwing *THIS HARD?*
you dont know how unlucky you have to be to find the worst  2 moves in chess ever
How the fuck did this get on trending
😈Schlatt? **re-calculating...re-calculating**
This blows XqC's loss to Critikal out of the water.
Im pretty sure this is scripted but i would like to believe it's not
Damn girl...I need someone with that aptitude in my useless life.
This is called the foolsmate btw. Lol
HOW IS THIS ON TRENDING IM FUCKING CRYING
Did she reach climax?
I would like to see Gary Kasparov’s reaction to this match.
Just for YouTube...
This happened to me! I was playing my ex boyfriends dad at chess and I played the exact same way and he beat me and my reaction was "did I just lose?" And he said "yes" y'all I was dying of laughter! I was so impressed at how fast I lost I just burst XD!
What just happend
Speedrun fools mate
Please tell me this is staged... cause if it's not... Wow.
Forget Bitcoin.  Buy dogecoin. Make money.  That simple

"Wait how did he-" *sees thumbnail "Ah."
Next up: Chess player wins before even starting the game
Schlatt?
Big guy in the comments, I don’t like that one bit.
that's gotta be a world record right there
I love how everyone is trying to write a comment about how Schlatt said "She's not gonna see this fucking coming" and they're all just getting it wrong-
No way this isnt scripted. Like he probably couldnt have found a way to lose that fast if he tried.
Lol cute lil comedy sketch.
Big guy trending wtf
I can't believe she made the same mistake he did literally one move after he did it, and still flipped it into a checkmate.   That just blows my mind.
He was right she really didnt see that coming
I love a good Fool's Mate.
Oh no....
Song?
Why is her room so empty it looks like shes in a default room
This almost has the same energy as “Hey shitass, wanna see me speedbridge?”
Seems staged
I feel much better with me losing in 3 moves now :)
Imagine not seeing that coming a mile away
lmao his face after he lost
Can someone explain this? I thought you need to do a check mate in chess?
Fugazi
she won't see this coming she won't see this coming she won't see this coming she won't see this coming she won't see this coming she won't see this coming she won't see this coming she won't see this coming she won't see this coming
This has to be the funniest video I have ever seen
“She’s not gonna she this coming hahaha” 1second later...😐
I really hope this was staged

Pwned!!!
Ah I see you played the Big Man Gambit
it's literally mathematically impossible to checkmate in fewer moves than that.
Hippie Jesus has a contender, I see.
Omg

You just got fool mated
the comments are almost better than the video haha
Seems fake tbh everyone is aware of that checkmate.

did he just came in 2 seconds? i probably would too.
I didn’t even know it was possible
“She’s not gonna see this coming”   That’s cause you’ve got nothing to show 👀😂😂
Yeah, that happened
HAHAHA HAMBURGER MATE
the traditional 'fools mate' requires four moves and uses a bishop and queen to checkmate.
never open from the ends unless you expertly know what you are doing
see this is sad only because i've done it before
Her face when she saw what he did lol
Genuinely trying to see what move he was thinking that would open up.   I can’t see it.
"Schlatt" 🤣🤣The ending was too hilarious
Mario Kart 7 battleship theme song.😅😅
"Schlatt?..."
Am I the only one or does he look like Zayn
Fake
Amateur
This is staged for sure. Even if she didn’t have a queen on her board, f3 accomplishes literally nothing at all other than to impede whites development. There’s no way he thought he had any sort of plan with that move. I’d be far more inclined to believe it if he dropped a queen or something while planning an obvious attack, but f3 plans nothing at all other than to get mated in the literal fastest way possible.
man down! we need evac now damnit! now!!
I like how this is trending
Her reaction is just the best thing I've seen all week.
Is this the "queen's gambit" that every Netflix folk is talking about?
The "Schlatt" at the end tho

How to win chess easy: Play against someonE and tell them you need to think for a minute before you make your moves Open a tab where you play chess against a computer Play your opponents moves then play what the computer plays Continue until game is won

A true businessman hides his true genius with stuff like this, or, at least I hope so
He left the King unprotected its a staged game for us to waste our time no person who plays chess will be that stupid.

Is that Pokemon music?
He obviously did this on purpose
bruh lol. nice lol.
Never play f3!
Was that on purpose? Like how do you get fools mated? You have to actively set your opponent up.
Get my bishop out. First pawn blocks one spot for a bishop to advance more. Second pawn makes the bishop useless.
I’m sorry I don’t understand. How did she win? I thought that the king was suppose to be taken? Can someone explain please?
Yeah this isn't planned 😅
“She’s not gonna see this one coming” ... are you the girl now?

In 2005 I used this move on Chess Master. Not only would the computer straight up not allow me to me move that piece. I had the rest of the class to try and move the piece themselves to see. Even CHessmaster doesnt like to lose in two moves.
Ahhh so classic yet it gets em everytime ;)
so true big guy
Looks scripted ngl...
Ah yes, those reactions are priceless when they lost in just 2 moves🤣
Error 404.
Wait, that background music... Is that from mario kart DS? Luigi's mansion or something, right?
this will never not be funny
This gotta be staged
90% of the comments: she will never see that coming 5% of the comments: he wasn’t wrong 5% of the comments: queen Gambit
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.
I'm more of a checkers guy myself... \o/
How can you lose that fast bro?

This is one of those things that is only funny when it happens naturally, so you can imagine my disappointment when I clicked on this and it was painfully obviously scripted.
This is the chess equivalent of a haymaker to the face in boxing😂😂😂
schlatt is secretly sick at chess bc he knew what the fool's mate was. he just played fm bc he didnt wanna hurt botez's feelings.
Welp
I think schlatt thought the king was a queen
OK
Omg
How did he lose?

As soon as he put his pawn g4 I was dying and then he said,”she’s not gonna see this one coming.” 😂😂😂

Bro chess online games aren't as smart as irl chess, he could've swapped places between his king and his tower so if she ate the tower she would lose her queen

I did not even think a 2 move mate was possible
I play chess and I hate when that happens
The date went really well
-p come as you are
Thanks YouTube recommendations 😂
B r u h moment in schlatt's head
I love how on the whiteboard it says "I Love Chess" yet he loses the game in two moves
I don’t understand what happened uhhh
Schlatt didnt know the ol' fools mate
Someone has to show us all the possible ways to lose in 2 moves
he has white and he asks i go first? well he is very good at chess
She said uno reverse 🔄
scripting ultra pro max
Atleast he can say he beat xqc's record
would be actual funny if it wasnt scripted
"Schlatt?.." This reminds of the video when the dude throws his chihuahua into the snow. "Pancho?.."
0:22 EPIC MOMENT Big Guy :)
HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Well, she didnt see it coming xD
Jesus Christ will return very soon. Please put your faith in him, and what he did on the cross. We, as humans, live in a sinful nature. We are sinners, but the good news is that Jesus Christ sacrificed himself so that our sins could be forgiven. The Gospel is 1 Corinthians 15:1-4. Christ died for our sins, and on the third day, he rose from the dead, and ascended into heaven. Jesus loves and accepts everyone. It does not matter who you are or where you come from. He loves you, all you have to do is accept the GIFT that he provided for us. It's a gift that we do not earn ourselves. Not works, but through faith. Please get saved today.  Have a great day and remember that Jesus loves you; it does not matter who you are, he loves you. Maybe to help lift up someone else's day, you could spread this positive message around! Have a nice day!
So fake...

The look on his face has the same energy as a terrible gambler who is in debt and decide to blow some mafia dudes money. He tries to win it back by betting on a race horse. And when it seems like hes winning the horses leg breaks, and he watches in horror as it rolls pitiful while the other race horses gallop by.
Hi.
0:16 the moment she knew he fcked up 😂, their faces tho 😂😂
I never thought I'd see anyone above 100 go for a fool's mate.
"She is not going to see this coming" *Yeah, this is big brain time*
0:16 the look on her face HAHAHAH I can't
Ah yes, the classical king's gambit
And we thought it couldn’t get any better than xQc’s 6 move loss.
Lol Scripted
There’s a reason it’s called the fools mate for a reason
Has to be a setup.
"Call the ambulance" "But not for me"
Why would you do that
0:22  WHAT THE HELL !!??? How is it possible !?
Shes never gonna see this coming because the game already ended
Botez Gambit: Accidentally losing your Queen. Schlatt Gambit: 0:16
The hell was he tryna do? 😂
I guess just google quickest checkmate and play it out and make a video about it.
Fake
Diavolo vs Giorno in Chess
His name sounds like the way Peter Griffin would pronounce slot
big dude :(
The "schlatt?" at the end makes this 1000 times better
Plot twist: He meant that she doesn't see this coming that she will checkmate him in 2 moves and the boy face remember that tomorrow is friday.
I laughed so hard when I saw the whiteboard says "I Love Chess :)"
Big guy
I don't buy this!
Fake af
You’ve got this big guy..... oh
He may have taken the "King's gambit" too literally
kings gambit
his confidence is what gets me
He Is doodoo
“she’s not gonna see this one coming” her:confusion
Booooooooooooooooooom🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Now I know I shouldn't make this first move 😜😅 You learn from your mistakes.😑
i think she was going for scholars mate
Staged

not funny bac actor/tress
wow shes good, she should play profesionally
who is schlatt
0:23 I got distracted. I am sorry
Been there, done that
Rookie mistake buddy lmao
I am like 90% sure this was staged by Schlatt for comedic effect, which in all fairness did work. He knew the squares of his pieces because he was saying them out loud and he literally gave her an extra move by moving a pawn so she could get her queen in place even though he said this whole strategy was to get "his bishop out". And he pulled all the defenders away from that square. She literally did not see this coming because he orchestrated a mate for her faster than she could herself. In conclusion, he should have won the Love or Host as he is the funniest man and they would make a great couple. The end.
don't lie we all have been there once
This was staged as fuck
We've Been Tricked, We've Been Backstabbed and We've Been Quite Possibly, Bamboozled
He obviously did that on purpose Lmaoo
Loving the airship fortress theme, nostalgic
someone please use this clip to make a "curb your" meme

The look on Schlatt's face is a mixture of pure embarrassment, confusion and awe. Alex on the other hand has a signature look of superiority.
Schlatt: loses a game in 2 moves  xQc: finally a worthy opponent
Thats scripted
Oh no my king
Bruh
I never seen in practice the “Fool’s Mate” occur
boy, I wonder if this was scripted lol
Clearly he did that on purpose, his galaxy brain is to cosmic to understand
Big Guy
Like okay... Every chess player learned this fool's mate as a kid... It's so famous (or infamous) that it's mostly just used as the worst-case example of why not to move the F&G pawns. But nobody, like NOBODY expects their opponent to ACTUALLY wander into this. I wouldn't be surprised if this is the first time Alexandria has gotten this mate... (discounting the games where her opponent is trolling of course)
Good move. Lose quickly and get on with your life. No need to draw it out.
Luigi's mansion from Mario Kart DS What a music background 😍
"She's not gonna see this coming" i mean.. he's not wrong tho..nothing was coming from him after that 🤣
This only work if you're BLACK
Looks like all that political rampage he took on L'manberg removed his wisdom lmaoo
Harmon is that you?
"Nothing to see here." This should've raised several flags.
Gg no re
She broke the record...
This is like Botez Gambit on another level
C'mon, this was clearly on purpose. There is no way this is real.
that was set up i am f-ing sure
that what's she said
This is the only condition to loose in 2 moves lol he accomplished something.
0:19 - 0:22 his face went from 😄 to 😐
0:19 - 0:21 his face went from 😄 to 😐
he unintentionally got one of the fastest ways to lose by trying to win -_-
Gg
I have seen her somewhere, she came on a stream with Samay Raina i guess, man they were funny.
Why does this feel staged
She's throbbing
big guy more like big L
Love to see "The Fool's Mate" at it's finest.
You know that's this is litteraly the fool's mat ? (Mat de l'imbécile in french)
Been seeing this on repeat Still can't tell what he was going for
fool
Curb your chess match!
That move caught her by surprise. Even a person with such a high rating was surprised by the move.
"...Schlatt?"
I don't get it, what was he trying to do?
Fools mate is so specific you have to try to get it. Jesus Christ Schlatt
Oh she definitely saw it coming, but it appears you didn't lol.
bruh.
Staged for sure
nah he already knew the fool`s mate, it was just for content :)
As soon as I saw that thumbnail I knew it was a fat L
Her face at the end 😂
fool's check
*Haters will say it's scripted*
His rating is 400. ??? there is no point of playing against each other
THROBBING VICTORY
i dont understand what the hell happened
fill the gap  she wont see this coming  ________________________________
Me watching ok simple i know u should winbin move 2 me see him loss  Me: *ok.....*      *BRUH*
I like how he does that on purpose to get them content
when you grind too much for a boss so you beat him in 2 turns after his long monologue
Call an ambulance Call an ambulance  *But not for Me!!!*
Simps will do anything just to make a woman happy 🤷🏼‍♂️😂
Now this is a certified bruh moment
I need to try this
Wtf just happened
Lol, i must say that was jschlatt fault for being overconfident xD
Ah, the French Surrender opening, a true classic.
Was this set up
they both fucking bad
can someone please explane what happened there???
Did.. did he not see his King was exposed?
Schlatt deep inside: *Why are we still here? Just to suffer..*
Scripted
are you guys really debating this? it's staged, come on. no one opens like that
Lol
Staged but it's entertaining anyway
Schlatt? 😂😂😂
"She's not going to see this one" *Thinking he's being sneaky* Gets mated immediately  Shlatt: I sense you have obtained a Significantly higher Elo Rating in comparison to mine🤔 😂😂😂
bro i have done that to my brother and my mom. I got my sister in 4 moves. (They are not great at chess.)
See, guys, pVc ain't that bad after all
scripted op
I did the same damn mistake in a local competition and I also had the same thought as that guy. Couldnt move on from that experience.

You know, if he would’ve stuck to his plans of getting the bishop out after g4 then not going f3, it would’ve prevented this from happening.
This is cool and all, but it’s fake.

Hey bug guy I have a spanish final where I need to have a conversation in spanish with him. I am asking for your help with this final sense I suck with spanish. Help me
That's a rookie mistake
This happens to everybody at some stage. Then you try and replicate it and it never works lol.
I am just gonna say that it's incredibly unintuitive to play such opening, so schlatt most likely prepared in advance, but unlike most  people which prepare to play better he prepared to play the absolutely worst opening possible, just because of a joke, and I love it
scripted af
i like how he just acts like he is better or has something 😂
Let her win so she likes you more, I know his plan.
Schlatt is the kind of guy to look up how to loose chess as fast as possible.
Keep it up with the Valorant youtube videos! U post a lot of great stuff I'd like to play together. DM me on IG @geezaofficial and we can create some amazing videos. Who do you play the most? 100% going to keep supporting you if you want to follow me on all platforms I'd appreciate it.
WAt
Feels scripted
Beginners fall for the scholar's some times, but for someone to do the fool's mate on you, you need to actively place yourself in that dumpster fire. No one opens like that 😅
This is the quickest possible checkmate, and it requires those suicidal moves on white's part.
Guys is there something I can do to stop Ray Mak
His expression is everything!
Staged af. huauhua theyre not gonna see this coming
Plot twist- He is playing with secret daughter of Queen Elizabeth
The fact is its not that she made a big brain move he just made a smol brain move
Chess pros seeing the title : impossible!  Chess noobs seeing the title : impossible!
XD
So this is the Botez Gambit people are talking about...
one time i was playing chess with my friend. We were talking casually and i informed that there where ways to finish a game in 2 move, we both dont play much chess but i knew of the move but he didnt really know so i just gave him some trivia. We then started a game and i unintentionally used the move and finished the game in 2 moves and i laughed and was like "well there go finished a game in 2 moves"
this is the third episode of queens gambit
You have to be a 200 for this to happen.
schlatt’s face before 😄 schlatt’s face after 😧
These kind of videos always get recommended after 5 years
Uncle Rey
Let’s be real, there’s no way this wasn’t intentional.
saying slurs and being openly racist should be a defeat too
He's not wrong, she didn't see it coming
Let see how many subscribers I can get from this comment Current:8
xQc: *Finally, a worthy opponent*
Uno reverse trap card.
If the king's gambit was a TV show .
I find it weird to know that george is older than schlatt
i loved how the girl looked at him like "what the actual fuck"
I didn't think a chess game could end in 2 moves! New highs!
Chess but you only remember how to lose in every game:
Seems Fake
Schlatt: She is not gonna see this one coming.  Alexandra: Omae wa mou shindeiru  *moves queen*  Schlatt: Nani?
original video link?
PFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF BAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAH
What da heck is fool’s mate and why ppl keep talking about it?
She became Shiro in just a few seconds, damn.
This is when he realized he's not John Cena.
"I love chess" written on the white board as well 🤣
let's all just say schlatt was simping
small guy
i did not see this shit
Welp
schlatt is so bad i think big guy wouldve won against her in 1 move
What a speedrun
schlatt and xqc, two MASSIVELY brained chess players
So...what happened there?
GM; Hold on Missy
Sacrificing the King...not bad
I like how basically no one knows that the woman in this video is botez
He's just like, "here, let me move these pawns out of the way for ya.."
I thought he intentionally did that
*Big OoF* right there Bois.

I didn't think there was a GM worse than xQc
this is quite the humorous display, the fact that the one called schlatt is over confident and cocky about his so called strategy makes you think that hes planning something massive, however the female chess player quicky saw a flaw in his plan, and in only a few seconds the way we perceive him is changed completely, from an over confident fellow to a fool, on top of that, the females expression when winning gives off the feeling that she was not impressed one bit. this was quite funny indeed
There he is, there's my favourite Harvard boy
SIMP.     nobody is that stupid.
The look of defeat...
WTF WAS THAT ?!!!
Ah yes the classic move..
All Schlatt had to do was open with a Tennison Gambit and then follow it up with launching an RT-2PM2 'Topol-M' Cold-Launch Three-Stage Solid-Propelled Silo-Based Intercontinental Ballistic Missile at Alexandra, easy win
0/10, no ICBM launched from silo
WTF how did this get so many views?
For the love of chess, written boldly in the background. Even a novice won't force play with such a move G4.
Chess any %speedrun glitchless
Fool's mate. Schlatt needs to up his game bruh, even if he beat xqc for the title of 'biggest flop in chess history'
Lol 😂😂😂😂

Her eye movement after winning was amazing.

F*ckin donut
I'm pretty sure she was going for the 4 move checkmate but black variant so a little harder and then realised that
Don't worry dude, I'm an expert at chess...         Expert on losing lol
Not realistic
In theory he could take her queen then and there, iirc how chess is played
happened to me at a school tournament... it was really sad
It is  almost impossible to do that unconsciously, he is a genius in a way
Jackpot, YOU NEVER SEE IT COMING!!!!!!!
he played the mathematically worst opening move smh
King gambit
The second legendary chess match after Jesus vs xqc
The tune when she mentioned his name, that felt like so much embarrassment.
I didn't even know this was possible
at least he didn't get checkmated in one move
maybe this wouldn’t have happened if you were still verified on twitter 👍
Yeah I used this technique in my chess games

Typical idiot who open his mouth whitout using his brain beforehand. And i bet he can´t learn and the next day he pretends to be able to do anithing. I know this type of dusty pile up brainers.
Schlatt can't satisfy a woman confirmed
Never underestimate your opponent
From the first move I knew he was screwed
Her reaction was like "bruh"
Baby steps... 😬
Salak matı
Definitely not Queen's Gambit, it's Fools Mate👀
can someone explain to me how this works

In his defense she probably didn’t see it coming
Bad acting. Trash recommendation.

Schlatt?
Most likely staged, everyone knows not to play that move
Not even the metaverse can fix this
*sad schlatt noices*
“Im not mad,i’m impressed”
Well he is actually right in one point; no one could see a this awful move coming
Famous Last Words. “Heh, she’s never gonna see this coming.”
There are people who think this video isn’t a joke and that he genuinely made that move.
Thank you for reading this in your heart even though it isn't mine
Tbh I don’t think she saw it coming
Theres no way he did it unintentionally
I lost a game to Rza from Wu-Tang in 4 moves. I was hammered drunk, but was still extremely embarrassed. But after seeing this, I don’t feel so bad.
I questioned everything you did especially your first move.
This is probably the only time that the 2-move mate will ever happen
Can someone explain why did he lose
Bruh moment
I don’t even play chess and I saw he made a huge mistake after he picked up that second pawn
He left himself WIDE open 😭
Yall m8 don't saw it coming, but it was all but a tactic to let him have something to joke around with her
Wow! That was so not scripted!
I have no idea what happened
That was the worst move he could’ve made
You're pretty big big guy
Wait is he serious or are they jus messin around.?? This is the quickest mate in chess and I've never thought anyone would actually play this.?
I dont play chess so ima try to understand but did she move the pawn as a simple first move but then because schlatt moved his pawns in a straight line she was able to just put the king next to the line of pawns and attack all of them and also the king too?
Curb your chess
Why was this recommended to me i dont even know how to play Chess lol.
The look on her face when he made his second move is like. Wait. Is he joking or an idiot. 🤔😂
And i have no idea how to play chess
XQC: "FINALLY A WORTHY OPPONENT"
Schlatt was trying a technique that was responsible for my defeat in the previous chess tournament. Although I was a runner-up in the school at the tournament of 2016.
I dont think she saw that one coming.
sheeeesh
I mean sure, she might not’ve seen that coming, but because of just how bad of a move it was.
I think this is the manifestation of "if you understand the pawn, you've already lost"
Dam a new record
Noob...

More embarrassing than Moist vs XQC
Schlatts first move: Who are you?...Death
the face change- he rly said 😌-😀
In turkish we call this: "Aptal Matı" which refers to "Idiot Checkmate"
That's called Fool's Mate.
Why do i keep getting recommended chess related things?
Bro wtf is thinking I'm ded XD  omg he lit lost in2 moves bruh and he just goes silent omg dude dying
The moment he put that in 0:15  Her face was like "Bro, are you serious???"
Anyone know the music in the background
I wish I knew enough about chess to know what happened.
Ok but why nobody talks about how this random clip got 1 mil views in one day
No way schlatt obviously won

This happened to me in Summer Chess Class/Club on the first day. Dang Teacher was savage.
"Hey shitass, wanna see me play chess?"
Schlatt only knows how to play against little children  Aka Tommyinit
😂😂😂😂
ENORMOUS MAN
Schlatt how do you even-
So we are all going to act like this is not staged?
Lmao you can see the light dim in his eyes
Someone please explain?
He's scarred by chess for life.
The fools checkmate, a very bad move
JAJAJAJA
i dont play chess someone please explain
Schlatt.exe has stopped working.
Lmao did he get his queens and kings mixed up?
Huh?  This shit ain’t nothing like checkers😂
He should let the knight and bishop or kings pawn to move
Mistake of the pawn
"She will never see this coming" I mean.... he's not wrong.
Nope
what a queen 👑
F in the chat
Do not open from that side when she open like that.
This is the reason I fucking hate simply chess the queens look like kings and the kings look like queens I would have done the exact same thing
"It's too soon Hikaru"
one million in one day how
SIMP let her win
I didn't even know the queen can move that far. Imma dumbass

Schlatt?
man that risk was calculated. dumb as fuck but calculated
New record

It's weird that his other face slashes through me..
Why haven’t I learned this technique ?
1.4 million views already, great work Big guy
Once I was playing on a Chess Tournament, I was with the best of the best on my school, I wanted to go back to class so I lost on purpose by just moving straight, still took more time than Schlatt
He was so confident in the beginning. lol. I'm gonna use that trick more often.
Ah yes the King's Gambit
Nice
The only way to lose in 2 moves.
Darth Maul vs. Obi-Wan Kenobi, _Star Wars Rebels_
she is so badass
I did this in chess club once and the kid just punched his computer and disconnected
Part of me wonders if this was actually purposeful and Schlatt just decided to Google “quickest way to loose in chess” and do it for the bit. Cuz honestly I wouldn’t be surprised XD. This is just way too coincidental
.............SHLAT 4KT🤧🐍
hi im absolute trash at chess so can someone pls explain why he died immediately even if it was his turn next? like idk can't he move around or sumn before she can take it  yea im stupid but pls explain lol
I assume this is fake, right? Please tell me this is fake, I beg you
I had to rewatch this a few times to truly register the move, the reaction, the comment, everything just wow
"She will never see that coming"  Her: Getting fool from him. Feeling Easy..  But if you close your eyes..
ah yes, the fool’s mate
Queens Gambit, more like King's losing gamble     Ba da unz
I didn't think it was possible this is worse than xqc and critical
Thats the first trick u learn, and learn to defend against in grade 7 chess club.
What?
It's called the "Fool's Mate"
🤣🤣🤣🤣
What the hell That really low iq
Schlatt’s Gambit
bingus moment
Big guy
Hey no need to feel bad I’ve had this opening explained to me by length and I’ve fallen for it at least 3 times
This is why I don't like chess, I have no idea what just happened.
“She’s not gonna see this one coming” *famous last words*
Kings gambit
Help!
"she'll never see this coming" *Famous last words*
LMAO
Tbf I'm sure she didn't see a 2 move checkmate coming
Omg the acting...
To be fair there is no way she saw him being that bad coming.
The problem was Schlatt was thinking 10 steps ahead of her, she on the other hand only needs 2
He was so happy for atlest 2sec
This is a bigger loss than Xqc vs Cr1tikal
Lol
Gotta love how Schlatt’s like fifth channel video does better than the ‘main’ channel’s
If no one knew the move is called Fool's Mate
Looks like a scripted shit
I have outsmarted your outsmarting
As a person that knows chess, this isn't funny at all.
That “Schlatt??” at the end is still echoing in my head...the poor man had his brain recycled.
what is schlatt?
Set up for the views?
This is staged
the fucking little reel back she did before looking closer like "no way, did he just-"
I still don’t get how she won tho
He fell victim to one of the most classic blunders...
talk about hacks
He obviously did it in purpose...
I actually forgot that was a possibility because no one usually makes that mistake lol.
That’s just embarrassing
She oversmarted his oversmartness
My dude literally left a diagonal line open to his King...
*"She will never see this coming"*  -Famous Last Word
"...Schlatt?"
Bruh
throbbing gambit - schlatt variation
Scripted but still funny  Minus the funny part
She pulled the main chess move on him. Or as we call it in French: l'ouverture chinoise🇨🇳
I actually think he made that up, 3 days ago i saw a video on how to defeat the enemy in 2 moves and it was the moves were exactly like those in the video
Lol
... yikes..
Ok who the fuck is Schlatt? Stop associating him with Big Guy
To be fair she probably didn’t see that coming since no one expects the throw
Fool's mate
*Cheese bit*
Schlatt?
My friend did this to me twice in a roll LOL
Was this a joke and they planned this or did he legitimately not think she would know this move? I know this move and I don't even play chess.  Edit: Still don't know if this is legit or not.
Legit the fastest possible way to lose in chess
bruh lmao was this  on purpose
Aka Fool's Mate
I feel like even Schlatt knew that was a terrible move.
Don't douche if you're a doucher.   Douchet.
Someone worst than xqc
What happened?
Huh how did she win? Her turn was over and then he could kill her King with his Pawn! And even if he didn't do that, she would still have to move her King to kill his Queen and then her turn would be over again!
My teacher called this "mate de los locos" "madman mate"
Well, he was right- she didn’t see it coming....
This is the funniest shit I’ve ever seen
There were no sound He just dead
Officially: Schlatt is *долбоёб*
Is this the King gambit?
Im a non chess player and have no clue what happened. Someone explain plz lol
Congratulations, you played yourself.
Star Lord vs Gamora
It's a fools mate Queens Gambit is a whole other thing
This one is my absolute favorite
That look of dominance is EVERYTHING 0:23
I don’t get it, how did she win? How does moving your piece once equal a win? I’ve never played chess.
Well "he" didn't saw it coming
Hahahaha
world record???????
Intentional for content...
Fake.
Top 10 fastest king gambits
Big guy
You can see the exact frame where his heart gets broken....
fake, not even funny. vine style humor
ah yes, the infamous board of mate-in-2. I saw this a long time ago in a video somewhere, and I am surprised you've managed it.
Is this entire comments section a troll? The reasoning behind pawn G4 doesn’t make sense, since the pawn blocks the bishop. It’s a cute skit, but I’m just blown away by how many people are acting like this is a real game.
Bug giy
This better be staged
GG EZ
"She's not gonna see this one coming" Black: "GET 'IM A BODY BAG! YEAH!"🤣
I can't believe people don't realize he did it on purpose
my chess teacher taught me this
GG EZ
Big bruh
Schlatt got fooled schlatt fell for it hahahaha
wait en passant was possible why was that a checkmate?
I love cheese to
There are millions of possible move in chess, this guy just choose the worst 2 possible
He set up the fools mate for her on purpose because he wanted some brownie points.
BRUH
Dam she did what moist critical did on a whole different level n she was there for that
This is a joke right?
King sacrifice.
He still one more move  alt f4
"She's not gonna see this coming" ~ Famous last words
The comedic timing on this clip.
That "schlat?" In the end, still got me
BRUH LOL
No one saw that coming.
Congratulations, you played yourself.
This is what is called a pro gamer move
As someone who doesn’t understand chess, *what just happened*
there goes his soul
*playing this in his nuclear bunker*
Big guy
How are you all this gullible? It's so obviously set-up.
I love how you can just watch the disbelief enter into her soul when he makes that move.
The disbelief in his face
and i thought nothing could beat xqc's six moves
I mean to be fair, there’s no way she could have predicted he’d fuck up THAT badly
Internet connection and a camera don't make you magically a chess player, just like adding a digital keyboard to the bundle doesn't make you a pianist.
Lmfao schlatt actually got checkmated. Someone of big guys caliber would never be checkmated at all
This is pathetically fake.
Schlatt moment
If he didn’t move the pawn she could have still won with 3 more moves
funny as hell the first time i watched it but i think its staged
I'm Lost
Damn right she didn't see that stupid move coming
5'7 guy here!
He wasn’t lying, she definitely didn’t expect that
“She’s not going to see this coming”  I mean he’s not wrong on that.
Now ain't that a Pro Game Move !!!!
Idk y but i fuckin hate that girl
He didn't protect the king.
officially bruh moment
I'm ashamed of myself as a man whenever I have to witness such guys being raped by bare smol female clits into tears in vids like this.
Yeahhhh that’s not normal chess. Absolutely no reason he would have or should have lost.

I never knew this was possible but now I know
Fools mate
shoulve played the sicilian
"She is not gonna see this coming"  *3sec later*  She: "Za Waruuudooo"
Wow epic victory royal
THE “Schlatt?” MURDERED ME COLD AAAHKDNDJDNSNKSNXJW
"She wont see this coming" Her: "I am about to end this man's whole career"
More like schlatt gets a million views in 2 seconds.
Damn the acting wasn't too bad ngl
I bet she didn't see that one coming
She used the tennison gambit thingy
NIKHUYA!!
fools mate ftw
Пат!
Does she have a youtube channel?
That takes effort. You just simping and let her win
Show is the timbs
“So what’s the quickest way to lose, I got this really funny follow up to this whole rajj thing”
The face lol
Ah yes, the king sacrifice
F
Boring
"Schaltt?"
I bet the game analysis shows nothing except one book move, and one blunder.
its so clearly staged
2 moves PepeLaugh
She was actually pissed because you prevented a queen sac
the true king's gambit
She's like the anime villain that's really good at games
I believe this is called a “fools mate.”
Oof
I'm only 10 centimeter Yesterday I was 9 cm Tomorrow will be 11 cm I will grow 1 cm every day    *Oh Centimeter click 10cm*
Like, you can visually tell how confused she got. Like you can see her process of thought. 0:16: Did he really just do that? 0:18: Yes, he did... 0:19: And he has no idea.. 0:20 Time to end this.
See you again in the next 3 years
Schlattbefore:😏 after: 😐
My grandpa usually use that on me so I use different tactics to avoid that move
The fact that this just came out and already has 1 mil Surprises me
I thought Jesus Christ's magnificent 6 moves was impossible to beat. I guess I was wrong
What huh what happened
I want this to not be staged but it looks staged
How does this have 1.2 million views already wtf
I don’t remember this scene from the queen’s gambit??
ggwp
oh my gosh this new season of queen’s gambit looks litttt
I can tell  you this tho  She did not see that coming.
I just learned dis and now i saw dis video on how usefull that technique was
I still have no idea how chess works
SCHLATT?????????????
The “Fool’s Mate”. Always hilarious when someone pulls it off.
That was easy though, if your opponent is dumb.
His face went from 😃 to 😶
He gambited his king
"She's not gonna see this coming" *Honey, you've got a big storm comin'*
People who think it wasnt planned LOL
R/softwaregore
HIS FACE REALLY WENT 👁👄👁
Fools mate
Wasn’t that the king I’m so confused???
xqc has finally been relieved of the title “fastest chess lose”
Wait how did she win and how did he make a bad move idk the how that was a bad move or how she won @-@
"schlatt?"
this has to have been staged, right? I mean, it has to be.  Even a novice could see that coming.
how did this video blow up like this
He had to do that for content no way he is that bad lmao
schlatt
I won like this once, it was pretty funny
Cleary the I love chess means he just loves this game
How the fuck did this get 1m views!
Call an ambulance but not for me
He’s cr1itkal but reversed
Kween Gembot
The fastest game in the west
Uno reverse card
She didn’t see it coming, because she didn’t expect such a dumb move XD
Fools mate
As a person thats not familar with chess, how did she win ?
Damn that sucks
Worse than xQc
Now he is gonna make a minecraft content instead of Chess anymore!
Has to be scripted he literally did the only way possible to get checkmated in two moves
'Shes not gonna see this fucking coming'  Youre absolutely correct
She is the queen of queens
That "Schlatt ... ?" in the end sounded like "Dafuq was that ??"
The sign at his back makes it funnier
I actually remember this happening to me in middle school, tho I was Schlatt in this scenario, I really lost in 2 moves
the difference between us normies and those masters and gms are they laugh earlier
I've won *as planned*
"she is not gonna see this coming" - famous last words
Fools mate, ouch!
Goddamnit this’s happened to me before...
Hahaha Scissors ✂️
Videos taken seconds before disaster:
“Schlatt”
The confidence is strong with this one...but it failed
Holy
Somebody calculate the probability of the first four moves of the game being these four.  One in a whatever million chance to lose in 2 moves and Jschlatt managed to make it happen.
"Everyone has a plan till they get punched in the face"--Jesus
Lmaoo I made that mistake before too😂😂😂
This is...has to be...scripted...
I’m *dying*
jesus thats even worse than XQC's run lol
Well we finally reached a climax
So that's how real king gambit looks like...
I know that move
Chess nerds, what happened here?
This is the best chess game ive seen in a while. It has humour, twists and turns. Its perfect.
I just learned how to play chess to know why he lost and omg why would u do that
Where my cart fans at? SLATTT
The whiteboard is the cherry on top
SLATT!!
This is literally the fastest way it's even possible for white to be checkmated
Can someone explain how she won in two turns, I don’t know much about chess
All hails the queen👸
i mean she didn’t see it coming
yes,
Fool's Mate, committed by a fool.
Lol he thought
the fact that this got 1.1m views in 9 hours though
Me remembering the cruel moment when this happened to me
Im convinced Schlatt actually knows at least enough about chess to know how to fail miserably. Like he did that on purpose to be funny
Bro SERIOUSLY 🤣🤣🤣🤣
loser
This is the most "Omae wa mou shinderu" situation I've ever seen
So fake. No one would do such an obvious queens gambit
she isnt gon see this comin *moves* oh.....
*Ahh yes, Kings Gambit accepted monke variation*
Chess speedrun any% WR ?
A BRTILLIANT MOVE
Shitpost status
the amount of pure shock on his face is hilarious
Who is the girl?
How are there people who don't know this is a skit?
Bruh momment.
*Can anyone explain to me what's this channel? Look at the views in such a short time and the subs... 1m views in 9h, 225k subs in 8 days X D.*
i would consider doing a felony for  big  he just speaks to me
That make sense since the king has nowhere to go except that one tile where he is basically approaching the queen.
I remember I accidentally beat a beginner like this, and I felt so damn bad
Schlatt definitely did that on purpose, to get checkmated as fast as possible he has to do those exact moves. What she did for her first move is a regular start even amateurs know
The best feeling of satisfaction I have ever felt in my whole life 🤣
The Queen's Gambit (2020)
Fake
Our student teacher from Puerto Rico used this move on us all the time  I almost beat him once
Why did this blow up
Schlatt?
As Soon As I Saw His First Move I Knew How This Was Going To End!
Well, he made her think i guess
Legend says that Schlatt is still sitting there with the face of Confusion and Embarrassment
The "I LOVE CHESS :)" really makes this video
In the words of Herr Strauss: "That was not my intention."
I saw i video on my YouTube story saying how to beat anyone at chess in 2 moves this was the strategy
Called the Fool's Mate for a reason
I dont play chess i play checkers so could somebody explain to me what happened?
big man
What if I told you, he actually won.
Cant wait to see this end up on a watch people die inside complation. Lol
Staged
Game report : Book move : 1; blunder : 1.
First I thought, but the shortest possible checkmate is a four move checkmate.    Oh how young and naive i was
What happened?
Big guy
All around me are familiar faces
I can't stop laughing, Help!
He is the pure definition of watching Kakegurui then thinking you can gamble like a pro
This is what u get for your name being Big Guy lol jk u earned my sub bro good game 🤣😂🤣😂
I lost like that to my mom to bc she said it's her first time  Playing chess and I wasnt expecting something to happen like that so quickly xD
Bro, I had to rewatch to see what happened but his face after all of that😂👌
Destroyed in Seconds
i put this on loop lmao
HA-
"She's never gonna see it coming!"  "This is a test-"
Well this video got to 1 mil views in 8 hours
Ah yes, the infamous King Gambit.
Famous last words. RIP
2 M OMEGALUL V E S
*"she's not gonna see this fucking coming..."*
Like me if u are seeing  ray mak every where 😀
Can someone pls explain how she won
He played the wrong King’s Gambit
And I thought the one with charlie and XQC was bad. This is just embarassing
I don’t play chess how does this work
Yo I didn’t even know it’s possible to lose this fast.
I thought that was a king but it turned out to be a queen
Where did he learn grob opening?
I didn't know you could lose in two moves
1.1 M in 8h
Lost to a girl ouch
Miaou
king gambit
Bigger than the XQC vs Critikal game.
genius
pro plays
That's why my mentor always told me to move the peon to D4 or E4 early
Out gunned and put man
Can you spell “fake”
Yea so this is fake by the way
You got beat by a girl.
Hope that no man alive actually thinks this wasn’t scripted
“schlatt?”
i mean he's not wrong
This man was the over confident villain in every movie ever.
Lol
"She's not gonna see this coming-"  *final last words*
There are around 10^80 different games of chess possible. This is the worst
Nah, he let her win.
jschlatt moved the wrong pawn lmao
The chess bots have evolved into a human form.
How does chess work
big guy is very
She said "Call an ambulance! But not for me!"
Ha ha ha....great game 👍
Isn't this feel scripted?
his face just looks so disappointed at the end
Someone please explain why this made her win, I am lowly and do not understand the inner workings of chess.
This video should be named Curb your move
This has a name. It's called the Fool's Mate.
This is nonsense, I learned this move in 1983 from a book. And only someone who is a complete idiot or someone showing the loss would do this.
Cant stop laughing 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂
Dudes like, "Shes not gonna see this coming". It wouldnt be possible for her to see anything coming because literally NOTHING is coming 😂😂 He has made the 2 worst opening moves you possibly could 🤦‍♂️Fake but still pretty funny.
The cum gambit
That was so obviously fake
His face when he realizes
They call this fools mate and is the fastest possible checkmate in the game. But it's called fools mate because you either have to be trying to lose or you have to be dumb enough to actually open up like that
This was 100% setup. There is only one way for a two move checkmate to happen in chess. White even claims "I'm gonna get out my bishop" as he moves pawns that together block his bishop from getting out.
F
When I was in 7th grade, sometimes I'd go to the library and hang out with the kids up there. One time I played chess with a kid sitting alone, 2nd game this dude did the exact same thing with me.
Hi, I don't understand chess.
This was a joke right?
I like the “Schlat?” At the end
I’ve lost this way unironically
Why couldnt you move the pawn two spaces up to take the queen
NO WAY!  I think i made this exact same play when I was a kid. 3 moves total. I didnt even know how i won at the time. It was during a chess class elective. We played using computer laptops that had the apple mac chess game.
WHERE ARE THESE CLIPS FROM?!
*move pawn to F3*  everyone else : bruh
I broke my replay button
😁😁😁👍
A legit Fool's Mate. I'm impressed
this one got on da algorithm
2 MOVE CHECKMATE
I always use this trick in elementary school 😅 always work haha
That checkmate was taught to me and they literally called it the “ding-bat checkmate” because you have to be such a fucking dumbass to do it.
that’s not what i expected schlatt to look like  also how did he not know about this, not to do this is like the first thing they teach you in chess?
We haven't even hit a climax yet
Bruh that happened to me on online chess
Lmao
Rockies mate
It can be seen as the new world record
That's called a fools mate    you got fooled, mate
You fool! You fell for one of the classic blunders!
This might be an amazing video for someone who doesn't play chess
Surprised she didn't go French on him.
Call an ambulance call an ambulance but not for me😂
I watched this video and now all my recommendations are about chess
"never see that coming"?  my guy i saw that coming ABSOLUTELY ROLLED
Ouch, even worse than the big moist play on xqc
LMAO
Aw poor buddy
He even has a whiteboard that says I love chess
Outstanding
LOL !
this is the very few times there's a natural fool's mate happened
Unbelievable moves. LOL 😂
LOL
😆
😆
LETS GOOO!!!
"Staged"
Slatt🐍
what a big guy
Haha thats very funny big guy, schlatt is not possibly this stupid. Right?
fake
Checkmate
He literally played the worst possible opening lmao
**Wheeeezzzeeee**
Bold move let’s hope it pays off for him.
scripted?
Charlie will defeat this by checkmating someone in 1 move
Plot twist: Schlatt loses in 2 moves.
damn
how does this have a million views after being out for 8 hours
This has to be staged. There's no way Schlatt DIDNT see that unless his brain is incapable of processing future concepts.
Man straight up gave his king away expecting himself to win
Me
I'm so confused I need an explanation
Once again; legendary videos are always less than a minute
The look of pure disappointment on his face when he lost is golden
Congratulations, you played yourself.
Scholar's Checkmate -search it up
*Silently sips my coffee
Schools when they postpone the test but change their mind immediately:
I never thought it could be done, SOMEONE WORSE THAN XQC
Ummmm what about on posont
Who is this girl
lol loser
For anyone who doesn't know this:   This was staged.
The face at the end.. PRICELESS
SCHLATT THAT'S NOT EVEN A PROPER OPENING  YOU LET YOUR KING GET PINNED WHERE IT WAS  YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO CONTROL CENTER
A small price to pay for a big mans content
Damn bro, 8 hours already passed and this has a million views already.
Schlatt: Loses a game in 2 moves.  Me: Finally, a worthy opponent.
“You’ll never see it coming”
the "schlatt?" while it's on his face at the end is what really made me laugh
That face tho Nani!?
Schlatt : I'm gonna beat you!!! That girl : Imma end this man's whoel career
"Schlatt?"
this is more pepega than xQc’s 6 move loss
Fool's mate, happened to me the last time I played chess
as someone that doesn't fully understand what happened here...what happened here how did he lose so fast??
That final frame is priceless
Fools gambit
Serious question, cause I don't play chess.  *How?*  How did she win that?
Move 1: I’m gonna get my bishop out Move 2: blocks bishop
TO BE CONTINUED -->
I've never won a single game of chess in my life so I'm just here to say... How does that happen?
She got the eyes of a snake before finishing him off
That’s dumb the pond should of been able to move 2 on the wall allowing it to kill the queen
Felt
WAIT BRO WHAT- 🤣🤣🤣
Is this scripter? Please tell me it's scripted... It has got to be scripted..!
*sus*
On rewatch, my favourite part is the "wait, did he really just--" look on her face. Like, she leaned into the screen to make sure he'd really duffed it that badly before making the move.
how did this get a million views
Wow i thought it was just a dream..
Shlatt has increased confusion to level 21
As someone who doesn’t understand chess I still find this funny af
Fool's mate nice
Big guy
Wait who is that girl lmao
Holy shit...
HOLY SHIT 1M IN 7 HOURS
I don't play chess, wtf just happen?
I'm just gonna play simple chess *End the game within 2 moves*
P*ORN Acting  "g4 get the bishop out" next move : pawn f3 and blocked the bishop "she's not gonna see this coming what's coming ??
Постанова
THROBBING! THROBBING!

Big gay
Well that was fast...
face transitions are the best.
You think you're slick, huh?
Oh my god his face really went from  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) to (._.) HAHA
is it just me, or is chess more confusing than rocket science?
This actually happened to me in a chess tournament 2 years ago...ow

So this is the infamous Botez Gambit: Kingside variation
Lol! I think he got mixed up with the queen and king pieces 🤣
This has the same energy as warhammer titan saying "Eren Yeager, do you have any last words?"
Ah fools opening, such a meme.
And THAT was the moment she broke up with him.
My mans was doing a lose chess no glitches speedrun
0:22 I just maked the same face he did
He had to be doing a bit
Schlatt is a gm and planned all of this for content don't let him fool you, he's gonna step up and destroy the competition in the next pogchamps
Any% world record!! Congratulations!!!!
Lol
How did he lose?
the kings gambit
I don't know how chess works.
Now he meets the same fate as xQc did, Losing a game fast in chess
well, looks like a guide on how to become viral
I'm confused how did she win?
staged af
This is the shortest checkmate in chess. However the fact that it's staged does not take away the fact that the look on his face is priceless.
Ah yes the kings gambit
Wow nice speedrun
The cum gambit
had that happen to be but by npc
the fuckin queen gambet
King's Gambit : 2 move variation gets them everytime
OMG, a 2207 elo vs 400! 🤦‍♂️
La pibita se parece a joaco lopez
HAHAAHHAHAHA BIG GUY LITTLE BRAIN
I call hacks. You can't move your king until all of your front men have moved
I remember a couple weeks ago I lost in 4 moves against an Ai I felt so ashamed 😂😔
Hey there, Big Guy. Sun's gettin real low.
Pain
Fools mate
Literally the only way to win/lose in 2 moves
Honestly, what was he even preparing that she wouldn't see coming? Other than the Fool's Mate.
His face: wtf
Simple chess is an understatement
Cr1TiKaL's record  has been broken
0:19 - 0:21 his face went from 😄 to 😐
Pog
I’m just gonna play simple chess, what a cheeky bloody smile that was! Checkmate!
Queen’s Gambit or smth idk I never watched it
Bruh
I'm so confused. How the fuck did he lose?
I love two move checkmate
It's a price to pay.
real. lol
big guy.
Why is the theme of the haunted mansion from Mario Kart DS playing in the background lol
Hombre grande.
*S h c l a t t*
Pain
lmao
Impressive speedrun.
"I DONT MISS A SHOT"
"She's not gonna see this coming" Neither did I.
Learned something new today, all this time I thought you needed at least four moves to checkmate.  What a great day.
Ah yes, the Cum Gambit
Fools mate
Spoiler Alert:     She saw it coming
And here I thought the 6 moves couldn’t be beat PepeLaugh
4 moves :)
That “schlatt?” at the end is what makes this clip.
He didn't lose. That's just a strategic strategy
He really was going for a world record for the any% chess speedrun
New record
Outstanding move.
Ive actually tried this method many times where u can win in 2 moves... let’s say it works like 2% of the time
Idk why he didn’t fight for the mid squares.And i knew straight away what she was gonna do😂
His facial expression is the best 😂  It literally says: "well... Fuck!"
I love how schlatts face goes from "haha she's fucked" to "wait what"
Im fricking crying after seeing this, the silent in the end tho.
This is as fake as I imagined it to be.
Schlatt: it's big brain time
hahaha fools mate
GM in no time.
The look on her face was like: “uh... were you supposed to accomplish something with that?”
Did she just beat Penguinz0 record? Poor Charlie, first Mr. Krabs and then this
I never thought that would work in an actual game  I used to do it against myself
damn, she rekted his ass in less than half minute!
this is literally me and my friend   i lost my friend beat me in 3 moves
Mr Borgov would be scared of her
Just played my first chess game today- I had no idea what I was doing. Proud to say that I outlasted Schlatt by about 25 minutes and I didn’t get checkmated! (I did lose to the timer though)
Ah, the classic Fool's Mate. WATCH YOURSELF NEXT TIME!!
"She's not gonna see it coming." Famous last words
The proohecy is true
The look on his face was priceless...
*when u under-estimate the knowledge of the brain*
hah gotteeem
She wasn't ready for the game sacrifice.
BWHAHAHHAH LMFAOOO
Girl: you underestimate my power
"I'm just putting my pawn in the center of the board, nothing to see here."  *opens Queen with said pawn*
I beat someone in 3 moves I moved a pawn then I moved my bishop then he moved the pawn where his king would be and move the bishop again and I won it was pretty funny
This sadness on his face says it all
Well that was Karma.
I laugh so hard to his reaction 🤣
Schlatt?
checkfool
ROFL you can see the confusion on her face like, "bruh did you just...?"
I am confused
Who was the other streamer
Yo 6 hours and 870k views, this video gonna be viral🤣😂
i didnt even understand why she won
"Curb your chess."
the cum gambit
this is probably faked tho
The suicide mate.  Classic.
That's tough, but not as bad as liking your own comment
His spirit died with his king
Many (or most) Millennials and Zeds online today: 'What is chess?'
"To get all the answers wrong, you have to know which answers are right"  - that teacher from Spiderverse
I think ol schlatt was sandbagging here. I can't prove it, but my heart says he wanted Alex to laugh so he looked up the fastest way to lose.
This happened to me twice.

who is she?
there is no way this dude got himself in a fool’s mate
fake but still funny
Is there a full version of this? I really want to see the aftermath of this!!!
Music: Banshee Boardwalk form Mario Kart DS if you at all cared.
She looked so surprised! He was right, she wasn’t gonna see it coming
She can check me... anytime ... anywhere
Shlatt face in the end tho when he lose lololol
That's two on my list
Set up
scripted but still funny to watch
Schlatt out here sacrificing his King.
Technically he spoke the truth she didnt know what happen next
Fun fact: my dad has done that stupid move before
Big Guy
I don't care if this is fake this shut had me laugh for like 10 minutes 5 minute for the initial laugh then 1 more minute for each time I looked at his shocked face
Charlie got some competition
I dont even know what happened here
:0
The Queens Gambit (2020)
I LOVE CHESS : ) I HATE CHESS >: (
Schlatt
He : she's not gonna see this coming  She : famous last word
Now I don't know which one is the queen
Wow
GAMER!
This happened to me with my friend at school      Thank god I'm not the only one
That "What" at the end was perfect.
Alternate title : how to make a girl dissapointed with just 2 moves
Curb your chess career
Imma call the dipshit card. I’m not great at chess but the minimum moves I’ve lost in is 20
He found it, a loss faster than the Scholar's Mate. Magnificent.
Mario Kart music? Hmmm...
there is only one way to lose chess in two moves and schlatt somehow managed to do it
what happened
*"Schlatt?"*
Big guy loses and has silent big baby rage, colorized 20201
He's a fool mate
HIS FACE LMAO
he’s clearly not good
Jebaited
Later that week, Schlatt received in the mail a re-issued virginity card
He thought the King was the Queen
T H R O B B I N G  oh wait not this game
That's that patented average white male confidence right there
By the looks of it neither did he
[Glatt Ghost Pirate Noises]
This is literally called the “Fool’s ‘Mate” because you have to be a fool to let this happen
lmao the *queened move*
Oh common man, make it less obvious.
This is either fake or extremely unlucky, theres only two possible variations of the 2 checkmate capture, and you can only do it on black winning, as white goes first.
he was like "hehehehehehe" to "........."
Me at the start of the game : 0:02 Also me literally 2 moves after : 0:19
Big guy
That was the fakest shit I've ever seen
There are those that think this is real. There are those who understand its a setup. and then there is you...reading this dumb comment. congrats.
"she saw it coming" written on gravestone
the death gambit
her face
PepeLaugh 2 moves
Probably the best chess game I’ve seen in my life
0:16 Look at her. It was at this moment  she knew  this guy does not chess.
Staged
she did the fools mate or whatever its called. that was the first thing my friend did to me in chess
prematurejaculation-man move at its finest
“Schlatt”
The Schlatt at the end killed me lol
Wait how did he lose? Dont ypu have to get all the pieces off the board to win?
Damn he's trash
Probably staged
*Wait what*
it's called the "fools mate" for a reason though
it feels weird watching clips from the official source, like I gotta watch out with my comments because I'm being watched
Lol
im wondering what the fuck he was planning with that anyways
Real chess players knew exactly how she was gonna win when he moved his first piece
The unseen real life documentary of Queens Gambit
so scripted
Schlatt.jpeg has stopped rendering
This was clearly staged.
MAN DOWN, I REPEAT MAN DOWN
imma be honest this was staged
I'm positive he done this on purpose for content
a part of me wonders if this was real and if he wasn't memeing
LMAO HE DID A FOOLS MATE
Classic Fool’s Mate.
Jschlatt moment.
Quik Gambit
Suggesting that was not staged.
That was totally real and natural. Really.
Wow I thought 5 was the minimum lmfao
😂
big guy
“She’s not going to see this one coming”     -His last words
L
Technically not checkmate
Did he win
Queen Gambit
"How to speedrun chess"
How did she win?
this is clearly made up and the acting is bad lol
I never thought winning a chess match in 2 turns was possible.
i feel like he did it on purpose
He literally set it up for her, what does he expect
We all know he let her win on purpose
Big guy
Haha unlucky mate
This is too godd to not be staged
This is staged he cant be this dumb if he was born in harvard or whatever
That... happened to me before...
BIG GUY
This is perfect for a "what" meme
Wat?
When everything went south
man speedrun his entire chess career
That has to be fake lol
Well that wasn’t scripted at all
😃 ➡️😦
Trying to beat xqc i see
Now I have a new technique collection
Bad actor
She's not gonna see this coming *PLAYS FOOLS GAMBIT*
When you realize you fucked up
“Shlatt....?”
That is the face of a man who has just seen his pride flushed down the drain
I would bet 5 bucks he did this on purpose, you’re not gonna beat someone of botez’ skill most likely, so better to create a funny clip
Yo that’s Mario kart 7 music ain’t it
I'm actually embarrassed of how predictable that was And even then, I'm sure I would have fallen for it too cuz i have lost to that single move so many times
And he's background reads "I LOVE CHESS"
the good thing is once you lose like that, you notice it quickly
its called fools mate. i got checkmated by this aswell. all you feel is spain without the s
Schlatt was so dumb, big guy would never make this mistake
Even time itself paused
Well, that was stupid
His reaction is priceless 😂
HAHAHAHA
"Shlatt?"
i beat my little brother in chess this way once, he had no idea what hit him
There's the botez gambit, and there's the schlatt gambit.
Schlatt?
Schlatt just speed ran any% chess!!! WR?!?!!
He set himself up for that
WHO IS SCHLATT
Why you put the "I love chess :)" in the background just to get betrayed lol
How it feels to chew five gum
Finally, charlie has a worthy opponent.
.....How?!
that's what he gets for acting tough
Better luck next time
It's a checkmate and i just learned it yesterday... What a coincidence.
I didn’t even know this was possible because I’ve been playing chess for a long time and never even heard of a two move defeat yeah I heard of a 4 move defeat but not something this bad
690k views in five hours, dude relax
His life flashed before his eyes after that 😂😂😂
I can’t believe fucker actually did a fool’s mate holy fuck
Chess loss speedrun
I guess someone beat xqc’s 7 moves record
He did the xQc chess speedrun
0:22 when you realise that ur 200iq im more like 20iq
Did she just broke the world record in the fastest checkmate from MoistCr1t1kal?
I recently started playing chess, cause why tf not and seeing this is fucking hilarious.
This was fake..... but funny
This is a skit, right?
That's not how chess works the king is supposed to be on its coloir
that's a new world record
Big guy
I didn't know this was even possible.
How did she win
I don't know anything about chess but that was so funny
this feels staged
I love how even she looked confused by how quickly she won.
i remember learning about this. it was so funny
LOL
in my whole life of 10 years of playing chess i never saw this happens ...
lol some of us knew this checkmate but its still epic to see it in action
God fuckin- gorgeous
Damn he beat xqcs record
What was he planning though?
Ita just me or schalatt lost for the content(big brain move btw). It is just to perfect.
Thought she gon do gold movs
Ez win
The Queen's Gambit resumed in 27s for yall
i think he did this on purpose, man idk anymore
"Fool's Mate"  That's literally what it's called. Makes me think it was staged.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
0:20 she was like "are you for real?:
HAHAHAHAHA
Bro, watch anything on chess. I don't even play and I know you develop the center pawns, then more valuable pieces.
chess speedrun
ok
Quicker than xqc, didn't think possible
That expression 😂
Everyone here is a chess nerd I feel so lost
Love that the video ends on: "Schlatt..?"
She literally pulled a moist critical on him
A truly throbbing victory
Bruh
0:19 If you have no idea what happened, the queen hit his king, and it can only move into the range of the queen again..
This has to be a skit.
Lmao this 27 sec vid is the funniest thing I've seen on YouTube all day
Pretty sure he did it on purpose. I mean no one can be that stupid not even if you don’t understand the game. This is staged I’m calling it!
LMAO
"Where did it all go wrong?"
Shlatt just dies inside
Why bro look like a full grown toddler
Hello darkness my old friend
the king's gambit
I don't see why people don't complain about the game being broken that can only happen to you if you're on the white black has some unfair advantages as well but still broken game
All his smile and optimism: Gone.
I feel like Schlatt was so intelligent that he purposefully lost as fast as possible for comedic effect
I’ve always wanted to do that move to someone
"She will never see this coming"   _Make the worst move possible_
He literally managed to make the only move in the game where you lose instantly, all the while thinking he was big brain
Impressive.
The Queen piece looks like the king that's why I was confused
Jshlatt:"she's not gonna see this one coming Her: UNO reverse card
i hope he did that on purpose...
im still convinced he did this on purpose, most schlatt joke of all time.
I don't know why, but seeing woman prove a man wrong so effortlessly gives me pure, unadulterated joy.
someone put warning before we see this. That was brutal ☠️
I don’t know much about chess but why couldn’t he just put his piece one step to the front so that it blocks the king?
Only an idiot would actually open with those exact two moves
You loose against a woman, shame on you
His face when he lost 😂😂😂😂😂
Ah yes g4, one of the worst opening moves.
Shhhlatttt
xDDDD
Fool's mate
This is staged right?
Schlatt more like dumb hat
Who’s this Schlatt dude? I only know Big Guy
I honestly can't tell if this is a moment of comedic genius or a genuine blunder, knowing Schlatt it can be either.
What a- a- what a *fool*
"Schlatt? Schlatt?! SCHLAAAAAAATTTTTTT!"
This is the most staged thing I've ever seen.
0:25 Carti fans
Big guy I bet you could've beaten her, this schlatt guy is a noob
PFFT
This is FAAAAAAKE. The odds of this being real are so astoundingly low and you'd have to be a complete imbecile to make those moves, even if you aren't knowledgeable about chess. This is so obviously just an act.
He really said; oh shit
100% staged
"...Schlatt?"
“Shes not gonna see this coming”   words spoken nanoseconds before disaster
Pinnacle of pog chess
Only legends know where the music is from
That’s a new record
I love the way she just glares at the camera like "how are you this dense" I'm pretty sure Schlatt did it on purpose but I really want it to be real.
Greatest move I've ever seen.
this has the same energy as "hey shitass watch me speed bridge"
Ok big guy
YOU FOOL
No he definitely googled “fastest way to win/lose a chess match” I am absolutely certain. The gag setup is designed for the funny lose fast. You can’t get this one past me Schlattarino
I'm not super good with chess, so can someone explain why en passant doesn't apply? If it did Schlatt could've done that and taken the queen
The people who don’t think this is fake are morons
XD Ah such a classic easy win
HOW?!!?
what a "fools mate"
As a chess player when he moved the first pawn I saw where it was going from a mile away
Can we just appreciate the fucking great music choice? Damn I love MKDS...
Hey Big guy that did not play out well
I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD EVER SEE SOMEONE GET FOOLS MATED IN MY LIFE.
Staged.
Never saw it coming.
Well.....that was a fun 27 seconds of a game
Him: "she's not gonna see this coming" Her: Call an ambulance! Call an ambulance! *but not for me*
I don't know, feels fake.
also the only way to be beat that fast is to play way too poorly
Her microphone placement disgusts me.
I don’t understand it but it’s funny
Speedrunning chess any %
*"jschlatt"* Truer words have never been spoken
This feels staged
big guy just became a small man
cool video
ive always wondered if this is real or a bit lol
This has to be a world record.
He must have set a world record.
His mood changed so quickly
Schmitt really got fools mated
Schlatt just got fools mate’d out of existence
Bruh
Ok
I thought the guy in the thumbnail was chris for mr beast😂
Damn, she beat Charlie's record. You know what that means, time for critikal to obliterate X in a single, master class move.
this is dunber than a profeshinal man putting himself into checkmate
The oldest trick in the book, I don’t know either this is fake or not but well.
I don't know who the guy is, but i'm assuming that was a throw for content.
i love how she changes her facial expression right after schaltt's move
There's no way he didn't do that on purpose just to get a clip.
Yeah who the small guy now big guy
he had to have done that on purpose
i remember this happening to me... in the fucking seventh grade jschtupid
which stream is this from?
staged af lmao
Pretty sure that was set up
Shame on y to play this game again ..just don't play it again .
This is like the n00b combo from Halo, except in Chess form
Bro thats my strategy everytime i play XD
I’ve made this exact mistake
And you thought 6 moves was bad, now make that 2.
90% of these comments: “she’s not gonna see this one coming”  9%: “Fool’s Mate”  1%: other comments
Schlatt?
Got'em
Weak
LOL! What the heck was he thinking? Even I know better than to do that!
bruh moment
That was an intense match
That’s staged as fuck
The man wasn't even done expressing his excitement, it just got cut off by the end panel.
Mahone, the guy lost in the worst way possible.    Congrats Lassie!
this has to be a bit, its the only way to lose in 2 moves
Ah yes. Fool's mate. As a matter of fact, I have never seen an adult do this before. Nor have I seen my high school peers also do this. First time. :V
Big man is on the prowl
Holy shit y this popping off so hard
checkmate speedrun any% WR
Damn the pain on his face
Nice move man doing great
Is this a chess speedrun?
I love you big guy
Thats what happens when you overthink, all that G4 BS
Her face says it all
Why do I have a feeling he set that up?
Big guy
Scripted AF
internet connection lost
"She is not gonna see this coming." -Schlatt,Comander of the White Army
This was 💯 % not staged
Hes Australian
Bruh XD
bruh my dad does the same thing he so me move the pone then he wins
wow getting fools mate
No 10 fat gift subs from pikachu this time.
Lmao I remember doing the same trick to my friends when I was playing chess years ago
this is worse then xqc’s
Chess speedrun any %
Incredible.. even faster than a 4 move..
And I thought XQC got rolled
schlatt?
Totally real video! Epic own XD so true. NOT STAGED!.. FUNNY
Omegalul didn’t know anyone would take the world record away from the pepega lord Xqc himself pepelaugh
“She’s not gonna see this one coming” *Famous last words*
😅😂😂😂
F chain for Schlatt
“It’s too soon, Hikaru... we didn’t even reach a climax.”
Hold on, that's gotta be fake
Bruh
What is he originally planned to?. Lol
The look on his face-
Schlatt's any% checkmate speedrun
The Queen's Gambit (2020)
checkmaten't
Its happened to the best of us but that's how you learn.
Dont think ive seen confidence shatter so quickly before
KEKW is the only reaction to this
I would have done better and I don’t even know the pieces to chess
This is literally the fastest possible way to lose in chess. He fell for the fools mate
PFFFFFFF ONLY LOST IN 2 MOVES  i've lost in 1 move i an the actual worst at chess and im PROUD
Big guy
He literally b r o k e
RIP Big Guy
Big guy
How can you guys watch this? It's so obvious and boring...
Has to he the hardest thing to do
“Schlatt?” That made it even better,
KWKENSKEMENEAKEAJ
Shclatt: "shes not gonna expect this" Her: and i took that personally
He smiled when he saw her confused... What he didn't realise was why she was confused
2 moves... We all know how this goes
Looks fake
Big guy
The big guy isn't stupid im 99% sure he looked this up just for the bit
Did he do that on purose or is Big guy not that big in chess?
bruh moment
I bet he did that on purpose
Speedrunning Chess now huh?
Big guy
Love that Airship Fortess is the bgm
Oh I've done this too it ain't that hard
what's worse, losing in chess or finding out that 50% of people wipe standing up
ive only done one lesson of chess in my LIFE and i have 2nd hand embarassment watching that schlatt
cant be this stupid, got to be on purpose
Big guy really didn't know she would see that coming
One time I was in a elementary school chess tournament and won a match this exact way. That’s random and nobody gives a fuck but I don’t care
“Outstanding move”
*curb your enthusiasm theme plays*
We thought 6 moves was bad enough. xQc’s throne has been taken.
This is called "The fool's mate" but I think the Spanish name, "the idiot's mate" is way more fitting. It's also the fastest mate possible
What was the song playing I know it’s from Mario Kart DS tho
(Teleports behind you)
This was on your recommendations page, wasn't it?
Wait isn’t the king only allowed to move 1 space at a time im super confused rn
who did it best, xQc vs Critical or Big Man vs women
“Schlatt...?”  Oh he’s gone.
not scripted at all
We all thought xqc losing in 6 moves was bad...
He literally opens up himself
Jschlatt just got the worldrecord for getting checkmated!
"I LOVE CHESS" in the background has me dead
This was clearly planned, but it's still funny
He 100% let her win
It's both world record and skill 🤣
Xqc isn't the fart of chess anymore
Big guy
good going big guy
Crit1kal 6 move win: "Finally a worthy opponent."
The only way to get all answers on a test wrong is if you know all the correct answers. Big man here must have known this losing strategy and did it anyway for content... what a legend
She is a hacker. If this was real chess he would’ve won
This is the strategy called the fools gambit it only works if your playing against white and they do those exact moves
People have been calling this “The Cum Gambit.” For obvious reasons, of course.
i saw this coming.
i don't even play chess and i saw that
Big guy
has to be plannes
Rated 200 here And I wound never do that lol
You have to be a special kind of special to lose like this...
I guess botez finally climaxed
I wanna see schlatt actually try and beat her lmao
bruh this is so intentional
XD
:D
I knew it, I always play that move at the start of a game just in case someone is stupid enough to fall for it.
Big Guy what do you think of GME right now
i always try to go for that move just in case if ppl arent aware on what they're doing
"she's not gonna see this coming" I mean... Technically he wasn't wrong...
That's why you shouldn't be overconfident😹😹
"schlatt?"
Petition to change the title to "She's not going to see this coming"
I watched this immediately after chess club.
Nice one big guy
small girl
idk man this looks scripted
99:00:00
When i saw the first 2 moves i was like: Uhhhh is she going to 2ko him with the queen? Apperantly i was right
WTF!!!! lmao
unrelated but thats the song
Link?
This has happened to me before
Me playing against my dad when I was eleven even when my older brothers never beat him either:
"She’s not going to see this coming" Queen: Allow me to introduce myself
SLATTT
small guy
Yup he is right
there is only one way to loose a chess game in two moves... and this man did it   (yes i am aware this is scripted)
Overacted. Oscar please .
Embarrassing big man
Hedgefunds when they short Gamestop: she's not gonna see this one coming 😀
he FELL FOR THE FOOLS MATE
Is this clip real? Like come on i thought the fool's mate would never happen in a real game
I think i just died a little inside
o w -
Big guy
why am i just finding this clip-
Thats a speedrun
Loving that Mario Kart music!
He went from 😄 to 😐 in an instant
once he played g4 i knew it was over
I feel like he saw a golden opportunity for comedy
Her: What ima do is called a pro gamer move.
anyone else seen all these clips but watching them anyways to give him view?
This man literally went Grob and then OPENED MOST VULNERABLE SQUARE ON THE BOARD. Absolute madness
He knew exactly what he was doing that's the only way possible for a chess game to be ended in two moves
Fun fact: This was Schlatt's best performance in chess
i dont care how fake this looks, this is hilarious
shlatt became glatt after that one
Him: she's not going to see this one coming  Her: i'm about to end this mans whole career
Big chess
Lmaooo I've always loved this play, someday I'll be able to pull it off
The classic beginner 2 step trick ;)
Well, you beat her at losing. That counts, right?
That’s staged. But still very funny
I'm pretty sure that this was set up, but it's still really funny
L
you okay big guy?
He was so confidant too
Girth Mann
Wait was that a glitch orr
Big guy
Looks staged and  fake af.  Ugh.
staged
LMFAOOO
Is this even Schlatt’s channel or is this a fan made one?
Their acting is pretty bad.
This literally happened to me recently cause I wasn't sure which one the king and queen was. Friend whooped my ass like this XD
My guy really played the fools gambit
He had to have known. No way.
Day 2 of saying small guy on big guys videos: small guy
I hope he did that as a joke lmao
I clicked because I didn't think it was actually possible to lose in two moves. I was wrong.
Sorry bud, that’s tough
That would never heal
... My dude, that is literally the TEXTBOOK worst play that can be made... Literally in every chess book I read in school... Back when I had any interest in chess, that is...
I thought this memory was too painful for you
I’ve seen this move, I think is called losers-mate or something
smart move
big guy
Talk about epic fail.
he went instantly from this 😁 to this 😐
I never knew it was fucking possible until now
0:22 The salt is real
I literally watched the video that this was in today
The Schlattian Opening
lmaooo
Transcription:  [Schlatt] I go first? [Alexandra] You go first.  [Schlatt] Alright. [Alexandra] You said you were going to beat me at chess- [Schlatt] Yeah, no, no, no, I know, I know. Watch, watch. Watch. G4, get the bishop out.  [Alexandra] I'm just gonna play simple chess, I'm just putting my pawn in the centre of the board, nothing secret.  [Schlatt] *whispering* Move my... She's not going to see this fucking coming. *laughing*  [Alexandra] Schlatt?
There is the Scholars mate. This is the Schlatt Mate
Fake lol
Lol you lost
World record losing time.
how clever can it be 😂
You can’t fake out in chess
Chass
TRICKSTAB
I personally think that this is staged because everyone that is semi-good at chess knows not to do that.
* Dream Speedrun music starts playing *
SLAT SLAT SLAT
There is literally only one way to lose in a Che’ss match with 2 moves and be white
Four moves. The dude lost in four moves. I did not know that was even physically possible...
you should Collab with shlatt
"How to lose a game of chess faster than the rate of how fast r34 artists draw" should be the title of jschlatt's video lol
Big guy
Schlatt’s recent searches: “How to lose in chess fastest way possible”
That move is completely salvagable in 5D chess
Literally every chess player knows about this
XD
After I saw Schlatts face once she won I lost it LMFAO
So staged
4 moves
cool
Good one big man
im new at chess, but i know that move
You FOOL    Heheheehehehehee get it?
He needs to play with xqc now
i had the exact same match once
Big guy
It's skill to loose in 2 moves
Was this intentional? Did he know about The Fool’s Mate or did he actually lose the game in the quickest possible way on accident?
This has 100k views and 60k likes   Impressive

Мне этот баян еще дед показывал, постанова 100%

Over confidence =🖕
How can you manage to be worse than xqc Pepega Clap
How
the good old scholars mate happens to all of us
My mom wasn’t lying when she said u can win with 2 moves lol
Not surprised
W a s t e d
Schat: she’s never gonna see this coming That woman: uno reverse
Atleast xqc lost in 6 moves and not 2.
“Schlatt?”  Shlatt: 👁 👄 👁
He lost to a girl LOL
That was the worst opening I've ever seen
I did that to this guy in 6th grade. It’s so hilariously satisfying.
fake
Chess speedrun world record
I don’t know anything about chess so can someone explain why she won so fast
plot twist: he pulled an uno reverse card to winning
schallt breathes: Also him critical mission failure
"hehe she's not gonna see this coming"
We now know Schlatt makes the literal worst possible moves in chess
that  fake shit
I see that this will get many million views
Why do I find this humorous?
The good old Fools Mate.
L
I don't even watch these two but I love how hilarious this is.
It's even funnier when you know that the name of that check mate is: the fool's mate
He’s a comedic genius
Obvious he knew what would happen. For the views BOIZ
THE WAY HE JUST WENT 😶
schlatt im black
Fake and homosexual
He really did say "👁👄👁"
Legend Says his still staring at the screen
Legit has to be throwing theres no way
Look on the bright side, there were 14,000,605 scenarios that could have happen and 1 of those would have worked but it just seems u landed within the 14,000,604 bad scenarios where u lost :)
Speed run
His face went from 😀 to 😓
even tho it's a bit, it is indeed funny
schlatt?
schlatt?
I'll play those two moves online on purpose.  Usually when drunk, and I'm amazing by how many players don't see the mate or just don't play it to spite me. .
Well that's ironic
Pride precipitates a dizzying downfall

He really got caught by the Foul's mate  search it its a real term.

This never gets old
L
"Please no, it's too soon. We haven't even reached the climax yet."  Wait, wrong game.
Yeah even i know not to do that
Bruh moment
this was when big guy was at his shortest
Classic
lolloloool
Clearly scripted
Schlatt: She's not gonna see this one coming... Also Schlatt: *Gets fool's mated*
How not to play chess
YOU CAN LOSE IN 2 TURNS
i’m sorry but face had me wheezing
That face of instant regret is priceless omg that was the highlight of my day
There is another way
Can... Anyone explain what happend?
this has to be scripted there is no way he is that dumb
I'd big guy big guy
How have I never seen this before.
FYI, that moveset is called Fool's Mate which involves an incredibly unlucky opening which also happens to be the fastest possible checkmate
YouTube has to be inebriated right now-   “10 minutes ago” Also says a comment is from an hour ago?
Haters say it's fake.
She knew what she was doing.
What is her name or YouTube channel
Certified bruh moment
Im still not sure if he did this on purpose or not
"...Schlatt?"
scripted
Big guy
Schlatt: " You are not gonna win... "  Girl: " I'm gonna end this man's whole chess game..."
This had to be intentional
G4 is literally the worst opening every beginer should know  ..  It somehow looked planned.. coz it is really hard to find such loosing moves 😂😂
I don't know anything about chess, but this was fucking awesome lmao.
She won in chess. He won the mindgame
Our boy Charlie had the record for quite some time but well all records are meant to be broken 😔
This Was Calculated. Big man Schlatt is a genius We can't understand.
he was just going easy on her
I won a game of chess with 2 moves as well lol
I'm so glad my Dad taught me how to play chess, so that massacres like this will never happen to me
well
this happened to me once, what's worse is that it was a bot
fastest game of chess
As soon as I saw him move that second pawn I was laughing
Price play chess
I even didn't know it's possible to lose in 2 moves. Even I know the rules lol
Any% speedrun
Actually one of the reasons I started playing chess.
Real!
A smart friend of mine wanted to play against me and made the same 2 moves. I was so shocked that was even possibile
her face when she sees the 2nd pawn lmfao
the queen's dammit
That was scripted.
Xqc be like
Ultimate losing chess speedrun
I feel like this is definitely planned because he knew it'd get views
This video missing 10 minutes Introduction  And 7 minutes of sponsor...
😂
I was watching and isn't the woman a champ or grand champ? Because I was like damn it was a trick from the beginning.
I know her from the charlie xqc match
Its crazy that he found the mathematicly worst opening even if she didnt have chekmate there its still the worst
"Hey" "Look at us" "Who would have thought" "Not me"
lmao once I beat a 20 year old in chess (ive been playing chess for five years)
Large Guy!
it takes a real *big guy* to broadcast his own defeat like this
Wasn’t this called the fools mate or smn iirc?
wow! schlatt won but the opposite! so skilled
You are free so free you are literally dog water 💦
fool's mate is so unlikely that I came to know this existed after 2000 games online..... I did get scholared many many times.... but this was always the most unlikely
Magnus couldnt stand a chance again Big guy
He lasted shorter than XQC against Critikal
🎵 "You'll never see it coming!" 🎵
What How Is this move even allowed
that is a world record fastest loss if i have ever seen a faster one
Big guy lost faster than xqc
broke xQc’s record of 6 moves PagMan
The game didn,t end, how did he lost?
And that was the moment he knew ... he fkd up
you werent wrong, nobody expected him to go there
HIS FACE 😂 THE LOOK OF UTTER DISBELIEF IS GOLDDDDD
Still pretty sure it’s a bit.
Lol isn’t this called like Fool’s Mate. I don’t think I’ve ever even seen it.
Schlatt's actual name is Magnus Carlsen
Never play f3
Losing a chess match to a girl is the equivalent of losing a chess match to a girl. Wanna debate?
Technically it was three moves
Schllat: she is not going to see this coming Her:are u sure about that....
This video got like botted
xQc: *Getting Jesus flashbacks*
Holy moly!  I want to play with her chess!!!
I love the “Schlatt” at the ending
there is ONE WAY to lose in 2 moves and he did it
No one saw that coming
I think she saw it coming
that was a good date, not premature at all
I don't know rick..
the fuck I’m watching Queen’s Gambit rn
Elon Musk must be quivering in his shoes after seeing Schlatt's genius move.
What song is in the background?
IM small guy
Staged.
"It's too soon Hikaru, We didin't even reach Climax"
See chat , i aint bad dud
Don't worry, you're always the winner in our eyes big guy.
Delete XD !!!
Legit didn’t know it was possible to lose in 2 moves
I don’t think you guys realize jschlatt is actually playing golf chess
u know it’s bad when the fastest way u know how to win is only 4 moves but somehow...
Speedrunning to losing in chess
Ah yes... 1.g4, *the Grob.*
Plot twist: he actually didn't want to bother with playing through the rest of the match
Big guy
This man must have done it on purpose
“You fool! You fell victim to one of the classic blunders!”
I’m willing to sell literally every single one of my assets to bet my entire life on the fact that he knew what was going to happen or got trolled by someone’s advice.
Iconic
Thanks big guy
XQC: First time?
small guy
He lost faster than Chris Brown died in Stomp The Yard.
0:25 Way: I don't download it because I already have it. (Loquendo)
seems like a win to me
I thought xqc was bad lmaooo
How did he lose to a woman
Im gonna try this now lol
"Two moves Checkmate" -Shuck from Satellite city
The face is like: Ö
This man actually executed the fool's mate lol.
Big girl
thank god he didn't have a knife and teleportation skills
I didn't think anyone could beat xQc's record. I was very wrong
Fuck six moves man did 2
It’s alright Big Guy :)
This is the real life version of "Hey Shitass..."
Daymn alex looking mad cute
Schlatt?

This is fake
big guy
man im so tired of copying people's comments and trying to gain karma so im just leave this comment here no Kapp
big guy
You got clapped
What
I love this
This had to have been on purpose
This is amazing
Schlatt: *Gets Two Moved* His whiteboard: I Love Chess!
This is the easiest and dumbest strategy in the history of chess and Schlatt somehow recreated it
His name perfectly describes what just happened to him.
He was actually playing black 🧠
I mean...at least he loves chess
HE FELL FOR THE FOOL'S MATE 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
*schlatt*
His face after he loses made me laugh so hard
Where is the homeless jesus celebrating silently
Lol
0:14 Me entering exam after non stop studying and fully pumped... 0:22 Me after reading question paper...
Imagine actually getting a fools mate
Schlatt got hit with the fools mate lol
bruh
She hit him with the uno reverse
i bet she said ez gg wp when the video ended
i just downloaded an app to help me learn chess and one of the lessons was checkmates. this was one of them. i didnt even know that was possible but i got to see it in action in the wild
Haha, while this is funny, I highly believe that he did this on purpose.
he deserved that one
how did he not realize that😂😂😂 Thats literally the most popular way of winning someone with just 2 moves
That's the fastest possible checkmate you can have in the game of chess. Something to be noted
Recommended
He really got slapped in the face with the Fool's mate
he was laughing and the next thing u know it he lost😂😂
I would have lasted atleast 2 more moves than Schlatt.
i guess he didn't see it coming
He got da bishop' out tho.
Trying to be like XQc weirdchamp
"Foolsmate."
her face is a good meme template
Idk what happened
And who said chivalry was dead.
Oh
The Queen's Gambit (2020)
FUCKING BIG BRAIN
aye das some real speed
glad to see schlatt lose something after stabbing his "good friend" in the back
That is the only 2 move lose you can do, so staged
I thought it was clickbait
big guy plays some big chess
YESSSS YESSSIR
Well, rip
Is this called Scholar's mate?
HIS FUCKING FACE AHDHDJDHDHDHSHDHFHSHSGSHSSHSHAHShAha
his dead face...........
I've played chess since I was 8, and I have _never_ seen someone lose this fast

Meanwhile me waiting for Chess 2
Well he wasnt wrong, she definitely didnt see that coming
better luck next time, big guy
The fools mate
big guy
I actually can't tell is this staged or not
thats an L big guy
I thought 6 Moves were the lowest possible. Keep up the great work @xQcOW
famous last words:  “She’s not gonna see this coming.”
This same happend when i play with my brother
Schlatt is just playing mind games for the next round
This is the equivalent of Cr1tikal beating xqc in the Chess Tourny
That is called a fools mate
Great Move..👍🏻 As Thanos said, *The hardest choice requires a stronger will..*
Here before 100k
how do you lose faster than xqc
Me the person who don't even know how tf to play chess: *shocked anyways*
You know what they say “a master of their sport knows how to lose as easily as they know how to win” we should be fearful...
I do this alot to people its cheezy
Bruh she jabaited you with the three turn win
Big guy
LMFAO
That was the last time she was seen alive
Chess speedruns be like
I actually did this to another player in person and at first he was confused then was like “bruh, I fucking hate you🤣”
xQc loses in 6 moves Everyone makes Fun of him 2 months later
why is everyone calling him schlatt, this is big guy
Probably staged ngl
Now that's an achievement
He should've gone e4 ke2
pretty small brain for a big guy
He's actually making it so that every small clip that he post appears on my recommended
big guy 200k pog
Jschlatt pegged and dominated by romanian girl 2021.
nice
Schlatt you (pro) noob
The odds of this actually happening is so low.... and he did it
i didnt even know this was possible xd
Ego to Zero
Finally xQc can sleep peacefully
Repost
The King's Gambit, a 1 episode series on Netflix
Here I thought xqc's 6 moves was bad.
Is this a world record, fastest at losing a chess game
I can’t even tell what he was trying to do
Now I Can Finally Beat My Family At Chess
Show
What happened to these two? I wonder if they’re friends...
#1 chess player. Lets gooo
Get scholars mated noob
Schlatt’s better than me.
Top ten moments taken before disaster: “She’s not gonna see this coming.”
👀
"We didn't even reach climax yet"
I confused the King and Queen with each other because of the crowns. For a second, I thought she moved her King, when it was actually the Queen.
I’m unequivocally certain the writers made her OP. 😜
Throwing for content, that's all it is guys
Big guy
On chess like a board you could use the pond to take the queen but in the computer you instantly lose
*snickering* she’s not gonna see this one coming
He's actually decent for seeing the chance to get mated there
*Schlatt.EXE has stopped working.*
He was so confident
There using Mario Kards 7 DS music.
XD lol lmao 😂
Dam he a master
Lol
That happened to me when I was on chess tournament lol
Me :-Hoping To Get 25 Subscriber's Today🙂. Viewers:-Nikhal,Pheli Fursat Me  Nikhal😂😂😂. But i Really need some support😔😔.
Did anyone notice behind schlatt  He has wrote " I love chess " 😂😂😂😂😂
Super genius big brain I.Q, I'll do this the next time the wife wants to play chess with me.
He wasnt the loser. He was the second winner. duhh
wow big guy, you know how much i love chess. really appreciating the love with all of these videos clearly, obviously, and undeniably dedicated to me. love ya
Queens Gambit
He was using his brain so he won on the other side.
That chess game was as quick as my wife breaking up with me and hits me with alimony
she didn't even get to finish the fools mate trap
Schaltt: “I move this one.... she’s not going to see this one coming.”   *So you have chossen Dead*
i used to be in the chess club obviously in mexico and that play is called "la jugada del loco" in english is "the madman's move"
You can see her eyes tell's like "is this a trap?, is he serious?"🤣
The look of disbelief in his face is everything
smort
"It is evolving, just backwards."
I actually think he did It on purpose for content. Too perfect xD
ah yes the chess god
Yeah they totally didn't agree to do this
Who's this Schlatt guy? I only know Big guy
I even saw it comein I was like Oh no 😂
Chess Speedrun, Glitchless any% World Record
Big guy
Penguinz0 is shaking
Schlatt so emasculated he can't even talk to Botez as a romantic interest anymore.
lmaooo
Will be waiting for this to get recommended to me after a few years again 🦴
That's the stupidest thing he could've done
Only 2 moves?  Now if this was the legendary Charles White, it wouldn't even had taken one.
this was staged af
“...” “...schlatt?”
Schlatt?
And I thought these videos are 10+ years old...
Where is the vod for this video
Imagine losing chess in two moves
Mans got fools game
As soon as I saw his f3 I knew what was gonna happen
Isnt that like one of the basics of chess to *not do that.*
Hey post the link to the original video for more views, just a hint
It's hard to do if you try to do it
Honestly that’s kinda big brain if that’s a genuine reaction. Way he’s acting made it clear it’s on purpose
What just happened... I dunno chess :/ maybe I should learn it
When the Big Guy loses
Gg schlatt
I beat my first girlfriend the first time we met at chess the exact same way :) I wasn't expecting it but this video just brightened my day
Big guy
a two-move checkmate or a fool's mate, I'm sure he did it on purpose to be funny
This has got to be a world record
hes right she didn't see this fuckin coming.
Cr1tikal vs Xqc flashbacks
She won
As was said in spiderverse, "The only way to get all the answers wrong, is to know which ones are correct."  or something like that
Fake
We call that fools mate.
Oh geez; in Chess, they call this the fool's opening
schlatts reaction was golden
Nah guys He just speedrunning
big guy
I had no idea this was even possible, but it checks out. Chess is an amazing game.
ive seen a lot of 2 move checmates... but none like that  good job schlatt??
Brain cells have left the chat
Big Guy, more like Big Gay
Same energy as "hey shitass"
tag yourself i'm schlatt
I don't know about you, but in my country we call this translated "the stupid's checkmate" and I think is a very appropiate name.
"Shes not gonna see whats coming" Next thing he knows: dies and is immediately reborn with a new personality within the timelapse of a second
"All see the strategy by which I concur but non see the tactics by which victory is evolved" - A taking pig
...how??? How did you not see that
Where is this from? His Youtube, or?
Only OGs recognize the background music from Mario Kart
I duped two dudes in chess club (yes realy) with this move
Who is schlatt? This is big guy?
Imagine being foolsmated
There's even a tutorial on how win chess in two moves; it came out before this XD
I love how this man's face went from 😄 to 😐 instantly
*bruh.mp4*
Gig Buy
Schlattt is the smartest person I know.      ....     Schlatt is the 2nd most smart person i know
I just saw mans self-esteem get slaughtered on video
Ah.  The Foolsmate
and I thought I was bad
Hey now!!! It take serious calculation to find the fastest way to get checkmated in all of Chess. Give him a little credit
F
Simped for sure
Ive been looking for this video for so long
My guys soul got sucked out of him when he lost
make it into a curb meme
what a chad
Throbbing
nah schlatt won, best chess player ever
It was at this moment he realised *"he f**ked up."*
*"Schlatt?"*
She definetly did’nt see it coming tho
That’s big guy right there
"Shes not gonna see this one coming" ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Scripted
SIMP
That is literally the 2 move mate everyone is taught.But no opponent is so stupid to play g4 and f3 consecutively hahahahahah
plot twist: he threw for content
His nose is even bigger that the juicer, that must be why.
We want  Schlatt vs Creed Bratton
How
I thought this was intentional lmao
Goes from arrogant to awestruck in a 2 seconds flat
I remember this bs lmao when I was 10 my Granduncle beat me this way to teach me a lesson. Never move your pawns without consideration, otherwise you leave yourself wide open
“She’s not gonna see this coming.”  Well, he wasn’t wrong.
There is 1 possible way to get checkmated in 2 moves - and he did it.
Schlatt went from Big Guy to Big Loses
bruh moment
Holy shit
WTF?
Schlatt: she's not gonna see this coming  Her: i'm about to end this man whole career
He’s so good that he knows how to lose in 2 moves
i don't understand chess
well, actually she didnt see that coming right?
“she’s not gonna see this one coming” famous last words
This is what happens when you don't know how to play chess
how
This is big brain time
this is called "aptal matı" in turkish which means stupid mate
Schlatt went faster down then my grades did.
Jschlatt is so talented he won backward.
When you think your being big brain, but MegaMind is standing right behind you....
How did he win
Schlatt speedran chess.
i didn’t even know it was possible to lose that hard at chess but here we are
Chess speed Runs are fucking wild 6 Moves, Now 2!?
Well I mean he was right... she didn’t expect that play
It's the live version of Disappointed Black Guy meme~~~
i call this opening the kings' mate
The Queen’s Gambit in a nutshell.
Ок но почему
xQc hearing schlatt beaten in 2 move: "i have waited 4, no 5000 years for this"
Never thought schlatt would be a great anti chess player
chess lose speedrun
He did this on purpose
I could imagine Schlatt taunting someone from losing to a woman
Lok
Big guy
0OF Size: *MEGA*
wow you shortened a scholars mate.
the way his face went from laughing to confusion so quickly is hilarious
schlatt ur some cheese
He's that good he made the woman win the quickest way possible as Schlatt is a true feminist who cannot stand to oppress females
he lost faster than if my crush was my girlfriend
Mans the fastest chess player alive!! 😤💪🏾
Schlatt face of disbelief will always get me
best game ever man! you should send me tips!
Why are the titles in third person it feels weird
Oooof moment
In case anyone is wondering this is called a “fools mate” in chess, it’s the fastest possible way to get someone in checkmate, it requires white to move its pawns in the exact position he did, then for black to get his queen in position to check mate the king, so basically he just got check mated in the fastest possible way
HE BEAT XQC'S RECORD!!!
I don't know why this was in my recomended youtube videos but I have to say... nice acting you almost conviced me.
duel against charlie
If there's a scholars mate, what's this one called?
😂🤣😂🤣😂 the looks on his face then her face
The funniest thing? This is a fools mate. Schlatt is a fool
what
S P E E D R U N😤😤
This why Chess is gay! How unrealistic, that all your troops around you can not do anything!
"she won't see this coming" Famous last words
Any% speedrun
I can lose in one move it’s called forfeit
Takes a lot of skill to lose in two moves
these could literally all be tik tok uploads but because he despises the app he chooses youtube
That's literally the fastest way to lose a game of chess lol
You know he had to do that on purpose
lmao newbies in chess always fall for this one
This gotta be scripted, right?
Please tell me he knew what a queens gambit was. Please tell me hes not that stupid
He really went with the fool’s opening lmao
EXTRAORDINARILY LARGE MAN
This is after he found out about the standers
Idk why people still play this dead game , the developers haven't even responded or updated in 1500 years , do they even realise how OP the queen is , she needs a nerf .
Change the face in 1 second 🤭😶
Schlaat be like: 👁️👄👁️  R E T I R E D
That must be a world record
Schlatt: HACKSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Black: lol ezzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz trash kid
JSchallt lost faster than an unvaccinated childs lifespan
Someone explain the win to me
Nicely scripted
I have no idea what happend
Everytime I watch this it gets funnier
That is so bullshit.
Cant tell if this was scripted or if someone trolled Jschlatt lmao
I could beat her no problem
Schlatt was having a internal anime monologue after that one, that's why he was so quiet lol     "im- Impossible ! How was she able to calculate my move with such speed!"
“She’s not going to see this on coming” .............................................
literally the shortest possible game
Why did chess became a trend among streamers lately?  They never heard of it or sumting?
how do you fuck up that badly
Bro Two move check Bro cool
He was right about one thing, she probably didn't see that coming.
WTF,  ITS THE KING???
did ya say gg?
Incredible, spectacular, truly mesmerizing gameplay
large individual
He practiced hard to beat the record of xqc  Finally all the practice payback 😂😂
Its not scripted I was there off screen. Undetected.
This is amazing
How did he lose though???
Truly disgusting, that people would do this horrible thing.
xQc to schlatt be like : take my crown now
That's literally me trying to play chess
The fact this 2 move checkmate (the fool's mate) is only possible when Schlatt makes these specific moves goes to show it was his elite plan all along...
What
He did a perfect demonstration of what never to do as white.
Top 10 saddest anime deaths
I didn't even think that was possible
its called fools mate, he did that shit on purpose. he said he was gunna move bishop and he didnt
Bro thats simping next level
This a very bruu moment

theres no way he didnt do this on purpose
Ahhhhhh big guy yeahhhhgg
You played yourself
ROFL
Schlatt has been played like XQC lol
In chess this is called the "Fool's Mate" and is considered the worst opening.
Schlatt is one of the chess players of all time
Fake and gay
I don't get it, what happened? How?
No no no. He didn't lose, he could have put people infront of his queen and he wouldnt have lost
uh what was the original video called?
shes not going to see this coming hahaha! gets checkmate in 2 moves! lmao
I like the "Schlatt?" at the end.
"S C H L A T T"
Wut
Dum DUm
She didn't see it coming alright
I had only seen a fools mate one time before this, Ive spotted a second unicorn!
How did he lose
WHAT
I feel ya
Does Big Man need a editor to make a compilation of all of this for more monetization ?
my guy just got what people call fool's mate
He made xqc look good
i like how the music gets cut off just when he got checkmated
I can't believe this! Big Guy wouldn't lose! This is fake *LIBERAL* media! GET ME OUTTA HEEEEEERE

Big guy
Big man
Fake and gay
And here I thought schlatt was better than xqc smh
BigMan.exe has stopped responding
F
I only have gotten a fools mate ONE TIME
Of all the opening moves you can make, I can’t really think of a worse one than that pawn
Truly disgusting, that some people would do this horrible thing.    Oh shit, wrong video mb.
Lol
I don't know shit about chess and even I don't get beaten in two moves 😂
btw this is literally the ONLY way to lose in 2 moves as white.
im late..
Schlatt is very good at chess
-Queens Gambit, 2020
this has to be scripted
Nobody saw that coming.
big guy loses a chess game in 2 moves
ok
I LOVE CHESS :) in the background is killing me lmao
lmao
Big guy has done it again
fastest loss i've ever seen! impressive on schlatts part!
and I thought xqc's 6 move loss was bad...
His look of “oh shit” is great
Yeeeeeees
Such a man he let the girl win, and they say chivalry is dead.
hey i didnt go to school today but you learn something new everyday
Being called small men by big guy is like being called mere mortals by God- Its mildly insulting but we all know its true.
Wait what. Can someone explain this to me? I'm too dumb
hi
poor big guy.
Alex defiantly wipes standing up...
xqc any% speedrun
Wow that game was close
Where
I hope to be like that guy some day
can we stop talking about schlatt and start talking about how botez DESTROYED him
I remember this happening to me when I was little and was playing chess with a computer and I imagine the computer making the same face she did lol
wataha
Lets be honest the grob opening never really loses
good vid shatt
schlatt says: im the best chess player in america also schlatt: loses in 2 moves  OMEGA LOOL
Fake
Speedrun
Big man
Schlatt is bad at chess cus he doesn’t know which color to play with
Jschlatt is a genius and outplayed himself. That means that he is more than a mere genius. But if he's more than a mere genius and he outplayed himself then he is more than a mere more than a mere genius. But if he outplayed...
I think Shlatt didn't quiet understand the meaning of "Kings gambit"
me playing chess
It takes some real skill to lose that fast
HOWWWW
Lol, of all to get hit with, the Fool's Mate
Big guy
you'll get em next time champ
It’s ok Big Guy 👍
That's what you call a pro gamer move

Daboof
From 3km of distance those move...
Big gut

big guy
Truly disgusting, I can’t believe people do this horrible thing.
This guy kinda looks like big guy
Big guy
Big guy coming through with the clutch as usual
Schlatt went easy on her. It's alright.
hi big guy
Big Guy got Dommed
That mate name is fools mate if you didn't know
I didn’t even know you could lose in two moves
Hahaha what a fool
don't worry you won in australia!!
He’s his biggest fan
Who is Schlatt? All I know is big guy
Woah let’s not go pointing fingers all of a sudden...  Schlatt is a kind gentleman who clearly was trying to lose.
Schlatt is a very talented chess player.  When it comes to failing miserably.
Truly disgusting, that some people would do this horrible thing.
Schlatt is so good at chess he won backwards
19 dollar fortnite card
Hey big guys
You can tell he purposely lost.
Big Guy is a Chess Genius
GMschlatt
Big guy doesnt mean you have big brain too
poor guy
TRUE
To be fair, Schlatt didn't win a love or host with a person that would eventually get convicted of a felon so really, who is smarter?
He had to have done that on purpose right? That’s the fastest possible way to lose; a very specific way.
Ay another upload from Big Guy, perfect
my chess teacher called that move baby checkmate but its very hard to get someone to fall for it (only for beginners)
wait how did she win she didn't even call uno?
Yet another banger by gayschlatt
This is one of the saddest moments in history
Small Guy
Schlatt VS. XQC
Big guy
impeccable
big guy>schlatt
Schlatt could have more money than captain sparkles and the misfits combined if he made epic smp videos
What a game
This  was definently on purpose
Big gay
I feel like that was a bit because the mats a well known play in chess
Nice moves big guy
He really speedran loosing
Now that's called a pro big guy move.
Big Guy
Big guy got the moves
i beat my big brother the exact same way
She hit him with the ‘bruh gambit’
What's the original video?
I swear if he didn't do that on purpose I am unsubbing
Schlatt just got Charlie'd
I can't believe one of the best player in the world win in opposite way in just a second.
So dumb
And that's what we call a big brain move
big guy small brain
That battle was so intense!!!
The fact that I’m not even subscribed to him and I still am getting this recommended AND watch it... Well done Mr.Schlatt, get that bag!
She was hacking
Watch this channel surpass his main-
Well, she probably didn’t see it coming.
At least it wasn't 6 moves like xqc PepeLaugh
Damn I genuinely thought NO ONE could do worse than xQc’s opening but I guess I was wrong lol
gm status
Big guy
He did it on purpose. It was a power move.
His face went D:
it’s okay big guy, we small men are still here for you
Big guy is a master chess player
I didn't even know this was possible
big guy that's truly impressive
Big guy
Schlatt
LOOOL
Big gay
This HAS to be scripted right, this is too perfect to be real.

big guy
Only one way to lose in 2 moves and big guy managed to do it. DUBS
BIG MAN? MORE LIKE SMALL MAN HAHA

From the small men. We thank you big guy for your money making clips
I swear I saw this before T.T
this guy should do a collab with jschlatt, i think that would be pretty funny.
I hate her
Who is this chat guy? I am only here because if the bug guy
It's hacks. Big Man can't lose to a woman.
Big guy
it really feels like he lost that game on purpose
HAHAHA
Big guy opened his pawns wider then he opened his legs for James Charles
Kiddo Schlatt
A King gets his ass whooped by a Queen both in game and irl
Two Move Checkmate is something we learned in 4th grade chess club, Big Guy
Big guy, bigger moves
Big guy

fking classic lmao
His face went from 😄 to 😐😶
thats why they call him "pawns"
Chess god Riiight
Old clip, the chops are small.
Big guy
this is sad content
Big guy
He didint lose what are you talking about
What a skilled chess player!
This is why you always start with queen or king pawn you utter maroon. Or just use a knight. You also wrote Schlatt instead of big guy by accident.
Who is schlat and whys he on big guys chanel?
well schlatt was right, she didn't see it coming
Maybe it was Opposite Day and Schlatt actually won?
Schatt is truly a God a chess
he was speedrunning chess guys, c'mon
That's a big OOF from me chief
Poor big guy
His goals are beyond our understanding
xQc wants to know your location
Nice one Big Guy 💪
This wasn't shown in the video, but Big Guy then proceeded to smash his keyboard into oblivion.
Big guy VS Moist Cr1TiKaL would be an interestingly *T H R O B B I N G* match. Don't you agree, Big guy?
Hes the best chess player
Big guy
Moments before the steel toe timbs incident of 2008, colourised
That sure is a big guy on screen
Im almost certain he looked up how to lose in chess fast just for this moment
Don’t hate the playa, hate the game. 😎
Big Guy
You can just feel the pain and awe
game is rigged
Hell yeah
Schlatt looks familiar to Big Guy
Pog
🕴️
Gg
schlatt did such a good play and won im so proud of him!
a man of unpredictability
The big guy has lost
You're so good at chess, how do you do it?
The truth is, the game was rigged from the start.
Big Guy would beat her in under 1 move. This Schlatt guy really is pathetic.
Poopie scoopie
still a classic
big shalt uses big brian for big wins against girl
Big Guy Has Spoken
It's more like he becomes truly infatuated by Ms. Botez 💎
HE'S SO GOOD AT BEING BAD!! .. even someone who have never played chess wouldn't lose in 2 moves
One from the “main” channel and one from here. Next thing you know there is a new WeeklySlap.

Hello
Schlatt we know
If you had one more move you would’ve won for sure

Schlatt you’re doing this all wrong. You are meant to send huge compilation full of ads and reused clips with poor quality editing, that’s how you get all the views and money
I dont even know how you managed that
Well, he tried
Bruh momentum
2 moves , worse than xQc , hes becoming a small man.
