Please say this prayer. Lord Jesus I confess Im a sinner. Im a sinner who has went against your commandments and had disregarded them throughout my life time. Lord Jesus I accept you in my heart today as my Lord and saviour. I admit today that you are my Lord and saviour with my mouth. I believe in my heart that you were raised 3 days after you died to conquer death and shed blood on that cross to atone for my sin. Thank you Jesus for all you have done for me today and 2000 years ago. I receive and accept your gift of eternal salvation in your name. Amen.

Denmark's annual medical conference, Doctor Week, was held in Copenhagen November 11-15, 2019. Medical professionals attending the conference continued to pay attention to the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) state-sanctioned organ harvesting from living Falun Gong practitioners.    Representatives of DAFOH (Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting) discuss forced organ harvesting in China during Doctor Week, an annual meeting of medical professionals held in Copenhagen.  The five-day event was attended by approximately 3,500 medical professionals from Denmark, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands. A small number of Nordic doctors and nurses also attended the meeting.  The international non-governmental organization DAFOH (Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting), hosted a booth and informed attendees about the Chinese regime’s live organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience, including Falun Gong practitioners, people from Xinjiang and Tibet, and Christians.

so we all just ignoring the guy at the end?
How can *YOU* be saved and have *ETERNAL LIFE?*  1) *YOU* have *SINNED* (Romans 3:23) 2) The wages of *YOUR* sin is separation from God and death, in the *ETERNAL FLAMES OF HELL* (Romans 6:23) 3) To avoid this fate and go to heaven, *YOU* must be *PERFECT* because God is *PERFECT* (Revelation 21:27) 4) *YOU* will never be perfect because *YOU* have sinned, so *YOU* need a *SAVIOUR* since *YOU* cannot earn heaven by *YOUR* works (Ephesians 2:8-9) 5) Jesus Christ *IS* God; who came in the flesh, lived a *PERFECT* life and died as a *SUBSTITUTE* for *YOU,* so *YOU* don't have to pay the penalty for *YOUR* sins (2 Corinthians 5:21). 6) All God demands is that *YOU BELIEVE* in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ; that *HIS BLOOD* washes away *ALL* of *YOUR* sins and makes *YOU PERFECT* (John 3:16, John 6:47, Romans 10:9-10, 1 Corinthians 15:1-4). 7) Now *YOU* cannot go to hell because *YOU* have *NO* sins to pay for. Jesus *PAID* for *ALL* of *YOUR* sins. *YOU* have received the *FREE GIFT* of *ETERNAL LIFE* (1 John 5:13)..

Imagine this guy went out to take a video from the hotel in Netherlands
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
😂😂😂 The guy @ 1:50
unsubbed, you seem skunked :/
Arr you in netherlands?
My nigga trending
Science demonstrates & presents an Analogical Reasoning.! It has no foundational principle! False equivalences. Teachers just convey concepts, without any tangible proof.When you see a Teacher on holiday, ask the following. Why are you indoctrinating ppl with the Prussian mimicry system, utilising the Servile & Utilitarion arts, when ppl should be educated in the 'Liberal Arts'? Why is it, that  most Scientists observe & claim. None adhere to the Scientific method. Most theories will never progress past the Blackboard!? Can you provide one viable Scientific hypothesis, in the entire history of Cosmology, Astrology or Astrophysics!!! Do you have Empirical proof, for any of your Heliocentric claims!?   A mathematician cannot prove the truth of his axioms, nor can he prove anything, unless he takes them for granted. A historian, or a witness, can prove nothing, unless it is taken for granted that the memory and senses may be trusted. A natural philosopher can prove nothing, unless it is taken for granted that the course of nature is steady and uniform.  Belief allows people who are ignorant to think they know!  The Aim of Public Education is not to Spread Enlightenment at all. It is simply, to reduce as many Individuals as possible to the same Safe Level, to Breed a Standardized Citizenry, to put down Dissent & Originality. H.L.Mencken. Please, don't insult me with Mathemagics, or your Gravity!? The bending of a conceptualised medium known as Space & Time. Haha Also, a Mathemagics construction. You can block now. Questions I know you don't have the answers too. It's ok, stay ignorant.
Imagine the ending guy was cheating aswell 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Brilliant video, funny that a school kid would be walking around the red light district 😁
Nobody acts like they know their teacher outside of school.
