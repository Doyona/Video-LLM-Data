You've been on some nice boats.  What boat has been your very favorite, excluding ol' yeller? If different than above, what is your dream boat? Maybe one you've yet to board. Thank you for the years of your life that you have so graciously shared with us. It has been a wonderful viewing experience. The boys are growing up too fast. Gods speed.
OMG that pink sail was beautifully horridly awful.
Love the animation of the explanations , perfect break from video , so well executed. One hell of a Boat !
are you saying the living space is better on a cat than on a tri ?
Where is your pumpkin , vanilla cat guys???? So sorry about all the cracks!! What does the builders say about the cracks??!! I've neverheard of such a thing!
You guys do such great videos and, yeah, 👍 I enjoy watching you give boat tours for sure!
“Cheap at half the price”.  😂😂😂
Probably the best part of the Airforce right here!!!
Buy it!
I bet you loved that GB 57 CAT! Didn’t ya! 😊
touring was fun but LaVagabonde III is so cool. Cheers.
How about some ali yachts mono and cats!
That boat could do a circumnavigation in 2.5 months, amazing!!!
love love love the boat tours!!!
Ugh. Greta. So I am done with lavagabond. Soros probably helped them a lot as well.😏
I have always been fascinated with Gunboats.  Love the boat tours.
1:04 What is this gorgeous black boat? Have Riley and Elayna sailed on it as well?
When I was looking at buying a Gunboat 68,  9.4 Euro which is 15.2 AUD
Solo, uh no.
Yes good videos happy for wateva you guys do
Yep, love it.
The amount of work and effort that goes into what you guys do plus having kids is crazy. You guys are amazing and I love watching yalls videos
Loving these type of videos guys, we can see how happy and how much fun u are having too 💗
Love watching you tour other boats, keep up the great content.
lol "we arent allowed down here".....BOLTS!!
Made me tear up hearing that the boys are starting to get interested in sailing and the boats lil sailors in the making love it
U GUYZ ROCK😎⛵️
yes. change the direction of your channel.  these kinds of videos are great, I would move away from the life documentary type thing, keep the camera out of and away from the kids, it will be hard to heal when so connected to social media and the burn out.
first 10 seconds and already solid editing on the video!
Really excited to see you settle into your new boat. New boat experiences have been a creative hold over for content but my favorite is seeing your family in your home sailing the world.
Darwin and Lenny❤. Oi, it's good to see them again.
13:30  “Dad, why did they build the Great Wall of China?” “To keep the rabbits out son”
Love the tours. Mixes it up 😊
try windelo
Im here just to say that Eleyna  looks like nami in netflix one piece live action 😊
Hello Hope you’re doing well I was just wondering what’s happening about your boat as I’ve not heard nothing about it in the morning. Hope all is well
Man I wish I knew you guys were in town , enjoy Maryland sailing stay safe
I love watching you guys with the different boats✌️💜
Really enjoying the boat tour vids
Love it!
Riley,  In response to your question as to if we like this type of content. I am sure I speak for many when I say that to see you both so genuinely excited about something that you love to do, is why we keep coming back week after week. Heck! Even the boys are getting into it! Stay safe.
Love these videos, love all your videos, but these are super cool.
Love the boat tours
Ka nice ba oi,
Riley is in his element
YES ...LOVE YOUR ..BOAT-REVIEWS & seeing all the different set-ups!
Omg Lenny's sad poochy lip face literally made me cry 😭😭 I just wanted to jump thru my phone and squeeze hims wittle self! He was trying so hard to be brave and strong. 🥺 Ooh my heart 💔 give him lots of love and let him know its from a fan and that I'm so proud of him! I love seeing the real, raw parenting moments you share like that. The love and comfort you provided him is so beautiful to see. Yall are such great parents. Lenny and Darwin are very lucky to have you both 💜💚
“Honest Review”?  When a channel has to put the words “Honest Review” in the title of a review video, it implies that some of there reviews are dishonest. Just sayin’.🤔
I grew up sailing up and down the Chesapeake Bay. Great memories.
Love you guys and your videos - superb. But Riley, you give me a heart attack going up the mast like that without another line for protection.
Absolutely love love love it!
How is the trimarin coming along?Good saing .All the best to you and your fine brave Aussie family.Bon Voyage.
Miss you guys! Hope everyone and everything is okay. I’m having la vagabond withdrawal. Lol.
Could you perhaps do a video on what qualifications and training you need to operate a boat. Imagine I won the lottery and set sail; only thing I've been on is a ferry in Scotland. Disaster guaranteed.
WHAITNG FOR NEXT EPISODY MISS U GAYS
@SailingLaVagabond    .. Big Question.   Can you guys comment or video comment on some real aspects of sailing the GB57 single handed or as a live-a-baord family. This was great, but with a crew and captian, it appeared to be a vessle that needs a crew not just 2.  Thanks Mate.   @BarefootDad. (downunder)
What happened?  It’s been more than 2 weeks since you’ve posted a video.  All okay?
Haven't watched in while, life been crazy. So bizarre how i remembered back to the young young person Elena was filming and Riley was upset because "drained batteries"😂😂😂 Then WOW 😳 Viral Etc......What a contrast..... ❤️👍😁👏👏👏 Outstanding Contrast ill add 😂
Lenny’s face wanting a bandaid. OMG.
Yes, this is a great idea for content. I preferred the days of making pancakes but I'm glad you are making a living and not pushing to produce a weekly video. I mostly watch Wind Hippie now for low-key stories.
Very commercialized videos by now
I have a sailing/boat question.  I hope it's not too stupid, but I'm just learning to sail.  Why don't I see in-mast furling mainsails on catamarans?  It would seem that they would be more practical on cat than a monohull so you don't have to climb up on top of a cabin top to put in a reef.  Thank you.
Where the hell are the vids. I get burnout is supposed to be real hard to deal with but an excuse to not do vods unless someone writes a check is not why I subbed. What is going on?
Anyone have an idea when the next vid will be posted?
Hello from Canada 🇨🇦 Have you ever been in the Northumberland Strait in between PEI, Nova Scotia and New Bruinswick Any chance you would come to see where the largest tuna are catch north of Prince Edward Island?
Like all ur videos keep  coming guys
Love y'all the boys are getting so big omg  missed yall glad y'all are back love ya
It s ,, great in whatever u guys do ,, 👍🏽👍🏽🙏🏾🙏🏾
Living  space more  relaxing......nice  you  went  to where it  started   with  Lennie..stay  safe
It' been twelve days...where are you all? Miss youse.
Soy?
The saying is "Cheap at twice the price", not "Cheap at half the price", it would be cheap at half the price - LOL
I do, but I cant wait to see you guys on you new boat & just hanging out with your kids is blue see through waters again!
Boomer here.  Been watching old black and white TV shows with a young David Niven thing who does he remind me of?  It’s Riley.
It’s a fabulous segue whilst awaiting La Vagabonde 3! Informative, loads of fun and delightful to see you all enjoying this adventure.  I adore that you fill space with wicked experiences! ❤
Sorry crap
hello my favourite cuties. Elay and Riley. Loves.
Yep enjoying you sailing other boats. That was a bit scary with that near miss that person n Ed’s some lessons
E ❤ it’s more like the 9th boat u have shown to people like me who have only seen small power boats and dingys lol so thank u for that. I never would see these boats in person xx
Lenny crying broke my heart
I do love these videos, touring different boats is so much fun, thanks
The boat tours are a good temporary things. I am missing the older content - I liked this episode because it was more similar to your adventures.  There is another YouTube channel that specifically does boat tours and at first  I enjoyed it, but after a bit got board of it.  It's your family and your adventures that had made me continue to be a fan of yours and to be a patreon.  I am looking forward to you getting on your boat and these "boat tours" are an OK in between thing  . . .
You guys are awesome!   Hi. What animation software do you use?  Starting a podcast and wanted to animate some stuff. Thank you!  Love your videos!
Lol.  That cruiser coming hot.  Oh boy.  😂
Hey any thoughts of other creators guest on your channel to keep your algorithm up? Noticed it on other channels and seemed applicable following recent videos about life balance... cheers
Still waiting for the return of Bilge Pump day 857
To help the algorithm, yes actually seeing you Riley stretched by having to come to grips with new craft is fun to watch, also seeing Lenny work out new slides and the difference between that boat and this boat is as a parent who raised his 2 boys on a boat fun to see.
Riley needs some gold chains. 😅😂
Love the reviews of different boats!
Really enjoy the boat tours and shakedown cruises! (Point of order.....like union meeting)
I like your boat tour videos. Educational for all! Keep it up if you can.
I enjoy the new vessel tours.
You guys are amazing!!! I love this channel. This really makes me want to find a partner  who know how's to sail and run a boat and live on one and sail everywhere!! I'm waiting on you Lady!! Let's do it!!!
Yes! These videos are informative, interesting, and fun. I like all of your videos.
I love the “Review Series”.
You are turning a love of sailing into an authority of sailing. Great mix, family life, travelling stories and the nauticals. Keep it up - it's interesting and your experience increases with each new boat visited.
Used to live 10 minutes from the Chesepeake. We would take our boat and canoes out there😁
Love the pink sail
Will you guys be making a new La Vaga logo for the tri? including Darwin of course!
Yes I love these types of videos, in fact I've loved all of your videos whatever you've film ❤ xx
Yes i like you checking the boats out.  Please keep reviewing!!
Not sure how you do it but appreciate that you always look at these comments.  Riley, love that shirt from the final scene. LOVE both of you perspectives of time on different boats. I'd really love your go to recipes aboard. Did I miss that somewhere???
Thank you for the subtitles for the American accent 😂
Elanas new look... 🔥American South 30yrs straight guy- that dark hair on pail skin withn those eyes. 10 out of 10 so beautiful.  I've enjoyed y'all's adventures for years, so thank you for so muche content. Can't wait for another north Atlantic crossing in the off season 😂 but seriously. Galapagos isle should be on you guys bucket list... I know the required disinfection an no outside food or whatever is insane but... Maybe down the line obviously... These days just keep shooting for the moon. Crack on, I love you both and the family you've built.
Looking forward, today’s video!?❤
Please try honey 🍯 for your skin do a facial and eat spoon full morning and night to help you sleep better! Try dark honey 🍯 and honey all over the world 🌎 ✌️Elena 😊 loving different boat tours!
Love getting to see different boats and to hear you all talk through the pros and cons. It also just highlights both your knowledge and skill - Elaine, can you give us an update on how you are doing with burnout? I often think of you and hope you are finding some outlets where you can disconnect and allow yourself to just be…. :) Praying for you all and look forward to your next episode.
I really like to hear your opinion on different boats. The only other thing is let me know when your in Hampton VA because I would love to come say hi.
Ahhh. My phone bit the dust and I had to upgrade… I lost my old YT account and so I didn’t have you guys on my new one. I was sitting at work today and you guys just popped in my mind. I thought you guys had stopped posting or something… but no, just my fault 🤦🏼‍♀️ 😂 I have no resubscribed!! Glad to catch back up with you guys!! ❤️❤️❤️ love from SC.
I like the tour videos as especially with some local adventure and insights to them since buying a catamaran is not on my radar. What I appreciate the most is that you guys are branching out the business opportunities that youtube brings, that's perhaps what I find the most interesting and the more details you can share about what's happening in the background the better.
man ive been waiting for years for your new boat where the heckkk is it mannnnn
Like and Saskia
Love seeing the boats, keep it going
Hi guys… just wondering why you were tailing the lines? Spinnaker sheets, maybe?  Anyway, great channel and really enjoy watching. Have fun, sail safe.
I love that you are sailing different boats and go to different parts of the world.   I love the fast pace editing mixed with the two person dialogues, as opposed to the selfie monologues.   I also appreciate the atrial clips a lot! 😊
Just my opinion, but fuscia pink and mustard yellow look awesome together. :)
I don’t know Elayna… might need to see what the pink & mustard look like… 😍😍
What week was this? I was in Solomon’s for a week sailing my little cat. I’m talking 14’. Just want to know if I was there when you were. In-laws live in Solomon’s.
I was going to go down the Chesapeake last week. I would have crapped if I saw you guys.
Love to see all the boats!
Great review! Keep it up guys
Love you guys doing these boat reviews. Really gives a great insight on these boats. Your Sydney Uber driver!
Love the videos! Your kids are so cute! 😊
I love this type of video showing all the different boats.  Please keep doing them.
a big pink  tick to the Barbie sail ... gorgeous ... and for  the La Vagabonde family as always .. love you Fab Four and CO. ))))
Love it!!
love love love U guys touring on new boats!!!
Awww. Lenny getting cut was so sad but so stinkin' cute. My heart melted
Love to see more boats. Help me make up my mind.
Have you thought of doing an Australian circumnavigation series? There's so many random places I see on Google maps it would be so cool to see it all.
Yes Yes Yes  -- Love it!!!! Would love to see more of these type videos! Thank you! 💌
You guys do those parities. Usually a good job. Also I think this would be a good angle. You should look into it Riley spunk ya to take care of it.  I’m still not positive. It’s not you.
Yes, you have definitely found a certain niche in touring all types of vessels, and of course, your work is excellent!  Sail on.
I love the boat tours. Great work
Nice videos on the Gunboat. I do have a question though. I may have missed it in the videos, but is this a good single or couple sailing boat? It always seemed like you had a couple of people doing the work. Whether raising the quite large sails, or other tasks like docking there were many people involved. Would more crew than 2 be needed? It seemed like it.
Yeah, I really like seeing you exploring new boats! But I'm also looking forward to the adventures on your new boat 😁
I love every video yall do
I have only sailed 8-foot Sailfish when i was younger and I love your videos. Totally living vicariously through your adventures and stories. Please keep it up.
I live in Solomon’s… really cool to see you enjoying our backyard as much as we do! LaVagabonde is welcome anytime!  As the keelboat racing chairman for the SMSA sailing club(you walked right pay our clubhouse) let us know when you are back in the area and we’ll get you out on the racecourse!
The bandaid thing was amazing.  Love it.
Love these boat tours, super informative and gives great ideas and inspiration for someone building their own Cat. If you're still doing them in 2-10years time you can check out my Schionning, hopefully it'll be floating by then.. 😅
Yep. What I mosty like about your reviews of these different boats is that, as a fellow Australian, I can relate to your language. You’re not selling these things, well not a hard sell anyway. I also liked the massive open space of the gunboat, but i wonder how that might change with a bit of weather coming from behind. Its very open. Fair winds guys.
Yes,  I love these boat tours!  I thinks it's a great way to get to see and show the boats,  as well as a great promotion for you and them
I love love love seeing all the new boats hearing how they sail what it’s like to live on from a family that sails full time!!!! It’s like if someone is looking to buy a boat you guys have gone around and vetted all the pros and cons before I even step foot on them. The best part is we trust you guys so much and your not trying to sell the vessel your just letting us know what the experience of living and sailing the boat is like!!!! Cheers I want to see more and all different types mono haul to crazy race boats to the super yachts !!!!!
I'm not quite into the touring the new vessels thing but I love seeing whatever it is that you guys are passionate about. Keep doing what you love. Much love.
Love this series!⛵️ Fantastic job guys, love the honesty and excitement you bring to each experience. The boys are growing up so fast, they are going to be so ready for sailing on the tri!!
I like the boat tours
2 weeks I take my first sailing trip...years ago I took some lessons to learn to sail after the lessons I haven't had a chance to put what I learned to the test...so here I go...love you all...super love what your doing...many blessings to you all
Drooling over these incredible crafts - loving it.
What's the hat brand?
I don't care what vessel you guys are on so whatever floats your boat, I'll be watching! :D
Would love to see more videos like this, but can’t wait to see la vagabond 3 hit the waves 🌊⛵️ 😊
Continue exploring new vessels but I can't wait to see your new home as well !!!
NauitStyles.😐
Calling asymmetrical sails "big" is utter nonsense - they are fractional in size to symmetrical spinnakers.. are they easy to deploy, gybe and douse? yes - can they sail DEEP downwind? No... they are compromised sails at BEST....
I love watching your little family on its adventures. I don't mind this little series but can't wait for you to get on your new boat and set sail again!
More please! Thank you.
Does Lenny keep asking Riley “when are you going to make an honest woman out of me Mum”? 😂
That was a fantastic episode guys. Well done, love the kids antics and would have liked to throw something to the dode in the stink boat for being so manic. Looking forward to the next boat tour you do. Happy sailing.
Please keep doing these boat tour videos! I'm loving it! ⛵❤🌊
Love these videos!
We really enjoyed seeing you sailing on the different boats.  Much love ❤️ Cinzia & Peter xxx
I’m loving these videos I’m so nosey and it’s so cool seeing how other people live.
Please i love uguys just give us 1 episode of no self pro mo stuff no ever greens or anthing PLEASE
So, what's your CO2 footprint these days?
Yeah🤙
Love it do more ❤❤❤
I'm personally more a fan of the raw unfiltered family-boat-life videos, (like the extended cut from Thailand) The boat tours are too technical and don't really capture anything but a new boat. However ! Always grateful for a new snippet of your life anyway. Thank you ❤
I love seeing you all on different boats. Your boys are so cute and I love the way they just fall in love with all the people that sale with you guys.❤❤
The happiest day of your life is getting a new boat. Second happiest day...selling it. Good Luck❤
You leave me speechless….and BREATHLESS ! Every video shows your remarkable bravery and steadfast determination to live your dream !  Watching from Canada🇨🇦
Always my go-to feel-good channel
Omgggggg !!! He’s the saddest little guy when he cries ! Bless his heart ♥️
Love all your videos 🤩
love the tour of the boats,  especially the ones that are healthy boats.
Gotta love them 365 degree views!
Command
I’m loving this series! Seeing how excited and honoured you guys are about being able to do this, just puts a smile on my face 😊
I hate sellouts
Loving seeing all the cool boats out there 😊
It's cool to see you guys on these boats (and I'm sure tons of help for the sellers) because we've seen how much you really LIVE on your boat(s) and use the space to the fullest. So your reviews are trustworthy, plus seeing you discover new things you love about a vessel is fun. Maybe I missed this, but are you selling the Outremer to buy another boat or multiple boats for VA?
Yes please Dolores of these boat tours
Well done! I enjoy the boat tours and all of your content. Thank you for sharing.
Loving every video you guys do regardless of topic. These are not notch as usual so please keep doing them ( especially if you love doing yhem too) love to you all. Take care stay safe ❤
Elayna was like two seconds from taking that boat and running.
Elayna, you both are amazing! New fan here. Thank you for all you do. YES I love the boat tours. PLEASE can you share in a reply where you shop for your linen tops? Xoxo
Love it !
keep at it guys! love the new boat tours
yep.  Loving this content.  As long as I get to see you guys doing what you love, im in!
YES! I’m so into the boat tours and honest reviews!!! 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
😊
We love your boat tour videos! Look forward to seeing more.  From Dusty in WA
Wow was that guy drunk or high? They love their bow thruster.  People should be able to just jump on board a boat if the skipper is clearly irresponsible and just cut it and impound the boat.  He needed a night in the drunk tank to sober up. 😮
I love your videos and will always support you guys, but being honest I don’t love the boat tour videos as much as your OG content. Really looking forward to your tri being finished and seeing you get back to regular programming 😆 So keen for the trimaran tour! The mustard colour looks unreal. La Vagabonde life and travel content has my heart 💚
What an awesome environment to bring up two young boys on a cat with extra crew to keep every one safe. This beautiful twin hull just slices through the water so easily at speed. There is such a lot to learn about the skills and luck required with wind when trying secure a boat of any size at the jetty. I almost lost two fingers at the knuckles, my fingers tangled in rope that a sailor threw to me to stop his sailing boat's forward motion at the jetty.  Another day at the jetty; When my 27 foot cruiser was hit by a powerful gust of wind, going from zero to several knots in seconds; I frantically tried to swing the rope across and around a post only to have my hand slammed across the post, bending my fingers right back with the rope slicing my hand open with massive bruising. Nice way to end a day on the water. Take care, looking forward to 65 foot Rapido.
Did you guys hear about hell of Hawaii? What a pity for the people there. I pray for them 🙏
WE LOVE YOU GUYS TOURING ON NEW VESSELS!!! More plz
I Love these boat reviews
Yes I did love it as always, but for me a little more (just a little) on the technical side of the boats would be cool. Great job : )
I love what makes you happy 🧞‍♀️
“Saskia” 🤣 🤣 🤣 ☠️
No, not really
Maybe a little less Real estate vibes & a little more of a mix of lifestyle would be cool! We love watching you all tho! Sending Love to Lenny! Hope your hand heals up fast dude!
The boat tours are great and if you are both happy and enjoying yourselves then keep it up! The kids seem to enjoy it too which is a big win!
We’re going to stop watching TBB because the boat tours aren’t interesting. We prefer your old shows
Man i cannot wait to see the trimaran!
You become expert on sailing aroud the world and its good for me to follow you,have à good sail !❤
Miss you saskia ❤
I like the different boats. its cool to see how each sail. love you guys, stay safe
"muma's a genius" hell yea hahaha
Great video! Maybe do one for the entry level folks who watch your channel. Gotta start somewhere.
I’m digging everything your doing! Geaux after it!!!!
Definitely do more boat tours!
I love these videos. Cool to see other boats
btw, pink goes with any color including mustard
Beautiful pink sail: Love is pulling the boat... Yes, the main salon is very comfortable, I like spacious areas, it relaxes me (social is accurate)... No monkey jumping today?...The captain didn't do his cushion jumping routine either. He could be Cirque du Soleil star, I tell you ⭐ 🎪... The green ship was interesting. Sailing on some pirate and ancient ships could be fun, too (I saw one in the back 🏴‍☠️)... Going global, uh More gold for the Santa sack, not bad... Lenny terrorizes boats with his reviews, he decided words wouldn't be necessary this time, he farted on it, instead 🌪️.. I hope he's not thinking about becoming a boat broker...
mama _is_ a genius
Definitely dig the boat tour and reviews
The various boat tours have been interesting, educational and a great way to expose your gang/subscribers/cult/friends/fellow sailing nerds/etc to many different boats that we would not have the chance to see and learn about. So heck yeah, sail every different kind of floating object you can!
Love seeing all the different types of boats! And tours too
Keep on displaying boats
❤
Better help is being sued for releasing people's data to the internet for profit
I live in New Jersey. You should stop at sandy hook marina.i would like to meet you guys.
No interest in buying but enjoy seeing the boats
Loved it!! So much more interesting than seeing constant updates about what's new on your boat build every week. Not casting shade... just sayin. Having said that... can't wait till your on the Rapido!! I'm sure you can't either. Keep up the good work and keep having fun!
Yes I  am enjoying the boat tours, with your family oriented attention to cruiser requirements. Don't  usually watch this type of video but you are picking some good boats to review. I am sure its helping them sell.
I no longer watch TV watching YouTube and in particular your channel is my relaxing time, my time to wind down. Keep them coming🎉
What a privilege to be able to take that beautiful boat out and sail her on this waters.❤ I love this style of video as I’m sure others do to. The skill and experience you’re adding to your repertoire is obvious. I agree that the living space on this little beauty afforded a very social trip.❤
I always enjoy your journey whatever direction you go.
Been watching you and the family for years now, but Just watched my first episode with my 3yr old, Rohm. He was glued to the screen when he saw Lenny got hurt, quickly asking me to rewind it; and even after rewatching that part he kept asking,”How’s Lenny?” So here is me asking for a Jr SLV fanatic..  Hope you all are wonderful!
Precious childhood for your boys ❤️❤️ Blessings Y’all!!
Love, love,love these videos for the simple reason Riley is soooo happy. He's in his element, sitting in the best boats ever built, it's where he belongs and I can't wait to see to his face when he gets his hands on his rapido. I agree that it'll only be a matter of time until we see a collaboration with one of the big boat builder and Riley designing a multihull.  Like the pininfarina and ferrari team. Love you guys 👌
Really do enjoy your boat reviews... and of course the other content too... adventure on!
👍🏼I’m enjoying your tours ty
I enjoy anything y'all do 😁
I like watching y’all on different boats…this boat is pretty spectacular I must say….
I love when you tour new boats for a week or longer and let us know the good and bad about them. Love all your videos. Keep them coming.
"point of order" can you imagine humans using something called social networking to create a revenue stream for people who really don't have the credentials to recommend anything? Full Stop.
Hey Riley and Saskia, I absolutely love the boat tours you’ve been doing and I love the diversity of the tours that you’re doing. I also love that you started with Greenpeace and not just some fancy Gun Boat. I’d love to see some “classic” vessels in the future, as well.
Great video, sending love to you all. ❤❤❤
Your boat "visit" videos are really interesting. I now live in land locked Czech Republic but I still love the sea and really enjoy what you get up to as a family. Happy sailing, Gail, Czech Republic ❤️
Love the touring!
Yes, do more boat hopping! I so enjoy learning about the different sailing experiences. And I love looking at all the different boats. This Gunner, incidently, gets my #1 vote!!!
I found your twin Riley Luke Grimes from Yellowstone the show he looks so much like you !
Love these videos!  Can’t wait to see you on your new boat. Keep them coming
Thank you! learning a lot
Love the format of the different boats. You have a winner here. So interesting how other boats function and appeal to the senses. Keep it going.
Keep on keeping on. A superior approach to highlighting a boat for sale. You may have found a new groove or side hustle. Thank you
Elayna, you didn't do your 'dolphin-o' dance. So dissappointing..... Love you all. Cheers
You know it's a bad day when you screw up parking your boat and the most well-known sailing channel on YouTube record it😅
these movies are awesome :)
Most of us have production boats (we have a Beneteau Oceanis 50). I’d really like you to do some videos on regular production boats like Benes, Bavarias, Hanses, Dufors, Lagoons etc. These are boats that people charter, and it would be great if you could give your opinion on the kind of boats that 90% of people sail. Great videos. Love you guys.
I have enjoyed your tours, especially seeing the boughts out sailing!
really enjoyed this video guys
The price tag ... $2.2m US. ballpark.
go to two harbors in Catalina California
?
?
To me is seemed like the Carver's rear thruster simply stuck in the on position?  is that even possible? I don't think the stern or bow thrusters work very good when you have the main props engaged.  That is a big, heavy boat, with hardly any visibility from the helm.  Takes experience to move in tight quarters.
Love the 'Vaga take on showing cool boats. But.... sail to them on your La Vaga III. THEN show them off
I really like your videos on different boats.  Please do as many as you like.
Omg those 2 adorable boys are growing so fast.  It is amazing how much Darwin has grown.   2 good looking parents helps
I like the sailboat hopping campaign. I think it’s great content. Don’t know how long you can keep it up. It sounds like a logistics nightmare. Thanks
Hate to get personal but the new hair colour is aging you can we get back to blonde please, we can put up with the odd grey hair but BLACK is awfull. Like the GUNBOAT but will never be able to afford one .
Yes, it is an entertaining win-win.  Looking fwd to the next boat
Thanks Riley and Elayna - another great boat tour - although it feels wrong calling that a boat! More like a dream vessel! Can't wait for the next installment!
Keep Rock’en the Sea!⛵️ Your Journey is a great Adventure to watch!!!😎 Good fortune to you!❤
We want more videos always
There's not a better couple sailing couple that is that could do the job you guys do You guys are off the charts no pun intended incredible show incredible presentations and most incredible story....
Lenny just melts my heart ❤
Loving these videos. So fun to see all the different boats.
Love’m wish you guys could actually take them for a 10-12 day this way you have time to get acquainted with it and then take it for an adventure on your own with the boys and give it a review. But also I know nothing and love the videos anyways will always watch 👍
I do enjoy you guys touring boats.... But I also can't wait for you guys to get back to your own adventures on the new trimoran!! The more we get of you guys the better absolutely!!! The way that you portray your videos makes people feel like they are part of your family and vice versa..... So therefore you are almost like apart of my family that I don't really know personally.  But no that you guys are obviously great people in great parents... And I just look forward to every one of your videos..... Hope that makes sense..?.?😅😊
Getting burnt out with this boat tour series, think I’m gonna take a break from the channel and come back when you guys finally get your own Tri ✌️❤️ love y’all and take care
I’m loving the boat tour videos
Love seeing the different boats keep up the great vids really enjoying the reviews.
Loving seeing you sail all the different yachts....what a dream!
Love everything you do!!
Good morning from Minnesota USA! Great episode!
Awesome videos as ever but I'm really enjoying the boat tours and seeing such a variety! Good luck with the rest of the touring
Love seeing all the different boats but especial the multi hulls. Awesome boat this week.

Please do more boat tours I loving this
I would enjoy watching more of the “Honest Review” videos, especially of unique boats like this
No I don't really like these videos.  I like it better about life on your own boat.  I like the longer less edited videos like your very first ones.  I do like looking around the areas that you go to.  There is my honest and very Australian answer.  I will continue to watch your videos but I like your travelling around on different boats less than your videos on your own boat.  I look forward to see you get to know your new Trimaran.  Thanks for sharing.
This sounds like a fantastic opportunity for both of you! I look forward to seeing                La Vagabonde going Worldwide.
Thanks
I like what makes you happy but you wanted to know so here it is... I do miss the 4 of you sailing your own boat w guests. I like those the best!
Of course I do love your touring videos.  But I love it a little more when you are alone, or nearly alone with but a couple of ship mates.  Regardless I will not stop watching your family.  It is a rare life.  But it is a good life.
Brilliant use  of your time while your new boat is being completed.  Really interesting and fun  to watch you learning and responding to each new boat.
Long time subscriber firs time comment.  Love the new format of the chanel keep up the good work!
A great couple. I love your candor. Is sailing really this glamourous? I took physics and my skepticism is very high. So, I don't think so. But congratulations on making it appear like it is. Great movies. I do like this one because it gives insights into cats that you cannot get just walking around one in a marina.
Sorry guys have to say we're over seeing other boats for sale! So going to move on till you come back on your own boat!
Yes more videos like this please.
do more!
Really loved it guys. Thank you!
I want to see you settle in the trimaran
I think you might want to do this sailing on all types of boats before buying one. The different designs all create compromises somewhere. I think as well that this is a great way to wait out the delivery of a new boat. Just see if you can make these last long enough to get onto the new boat…
I love how the owners give you and your family so much freedom to totally experience their boats. Like the week the crew stayed at a B&B on shore so you and the family could stay on board. Shows much trust and respect
I like watching the videos of you guys sailing other vessels, but I think I'm gonna like it a lot more when you're on Vagabonde III. I just can't wait, however I am  adult enough to know I have to wait🤔😁🤣🤣🤣🤦🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♂️
I love seeing new boats, keep it up.  Great video
interesting to see the different boats, keep this going.  I was wondering if the two of you have thoughts that this is something you should have done prior to committing to the Rapido, not that I think the Rapido isn't worthy of being featured in this boat tour.  Just that you may have a few more ideas.
Love every episode you guys put out. Keep doing what you love and I’ll keep watching
The tour videos are very cool!
Thank you,It is my DreamBoat,😍😍😍
Thank  guys for another entertaining episode, though sad that you have to sell your other Catamaran but hey that is life and your new Catamaran would of not be cheap. Take care and be safe.
Love videos like this and seeing how you live with your family on so many different types of on the water homes! Please keep the videos coming! 😊
Congratulations on Tending!!!
Great to see you all happy and well. As for the boat tours keep them coming. Satsuki definitely has a flare for it. With the introduction of banana and guinea pig rating systems surely we will see a return of Bilgey! No doubt the rapido isn't far from becoming a floating jungle Jim for the boys. Will definitely grab a cold beer and join you all for the tour.👍 Stay right side up!
Some crew???? You mean people who actually know  how to sail!!!!!
Love having you show us different boats. Thank yous!
Yes, more videos like this please.
Lenny poking out that lip and starting to cry then tears busting out of his eyes was heart-breaking but adorable.  It is a sight I remember oh so well with my kids.  I miss those days - they are 18 now.
Not a single wind vs speed stat while sailing the Gunboat when usually they are all about the #'s. Things that make you go Hmmmm.
❤❤
I don't know much about boats or sailing but I've really enjoyed watching you guys tour different boats! As someone who holds an environmental science degree I really enjoyed the Green Peace video. Can't wait to see more in the future and I am super excited for the reveal of your new vessel when the time comes!
I knew instantly that riley was talking about the killer whales near Spain. And def keep up  these videos, even if this one had a bit more fanboying than usual 😂
I would love to see more of run through and test sailing boats for sale. You should keep doing it even after you get your new home.
Love these boat review videos.
Can belive Lenny made me cry.
Where's Bridget?
"Moma's a genius"😅
Absolutely love seeing all the different vessels!!
Loving these videos but can’t wait for u guys to settle the family in the new boat though
Noooooooooo ..I'm sorry about your hand Lenny 🥲🥲it was so sad when you really hurt your poor ✋ hand... hope you have healed nicely 😁❤️
An “Honest Review” would include the mention of some aspects about the boat you don’t like.  Your praise about the Gunboat 57 was a bit weak and mostly revolved around the friendly deck space.  I recall very little mention of the actual sailing ease or performance.  Also, Riley in the bosun’s chair suggested there was a problem with the rigging that didn’t get “reviewed”.  Keep it real.  I’m a big fan.
Hello you lot 🫶❤️😁🥰🪔✨😍🪬🧿🎁🎁😍🫶🫶🫶🫶😂🤣🤣
That motoryacht captain should be forbidden to ever be at a helm ever again. I was a better pilot at 14 years old.
More!
Really loving these boat tours. Keep up the great work. You all look so healthy which is sign of loving what you do. ❤
I DEFINITELY like these types of tours!  But i'm also very excited to see you all on your trimaran!!!  Gorgeous color!  Main sail color...hmmm...not an easy one.  While navy and white is a clear choice in my book, it wouldn't give that awesome radiance of the pink.  Something in the red/orange family would go very well and give you great sun-filtered color.  Final thought....you can go totally retro with aqua!
Absolutely LOVE watching this chapter of your lives! Watching you sail these amazing vessels is Magic, and your Sweet Little Guys are Thriving! Happy, Healthy Little Sailors. I’m so excited to see the New Rapido! Your videos make this 65 y/o ‘70’s Beach Bunny very happy and look forward to each new episode. Sending Hugs to you all. 😊😎🤗🌊💙🩵🩵🩷
✨Such a stunning boat ✨ Such a great episode, can’t wait for the next one. You guys are amazing & we all appreciate you,    From girl to girl. missing the blonde on you, I feel as if the dark doesn’t truly show your glowing personality or beautiful skin tone.   😢 ☀️✨👱‍♀️  ❤❤❤
I wonder if they'll be honest enough to answer if the boys have ever fallen off board 😂 My kids would probably have 100 times by now ❤
Yes love the boat tours!
what did he hit he hit everything was the funniest sheet
Love you guys touring on other vessels it’s good to see all the different options.
Apparently studies show that the colour pink makes people feel happy 🎉
I still think it's so cool you guys sailed Greta to silence the deniers and their appeals to hypocrisy.
I got a question..... no doubt an amazing boat.... but how do you lock up your kitchen? or is all that stuff just kinda " out in the open" when you are gone to shore and what not? sure it probably wouldn't be a problem in a lot of places.... but I think some places you may have to worry about things getting stolen....... or maybe I am just paranoid ?! anybody have any thought on this?
Your more boats! Love the content
What is cost for few days tur?
Riley & Elayna, you are producing the best  content. among the top sailing channels right now!!!. Going around the world reviewing the most interesting boats we don't see very often is good stuff . And Lenny & Darwin are fun also. Best looking kids on the water.
It's very interesting to see all the boats and places you are showing us. Elayna looks good in black hair. Rileys got excellent assesment skills for live aboard sailing designs. The boys are really growing talking and being fantasic crew for your videos.
You gotta love this family, wishing you nothing but good luck for the future  guys ✌
Love the new format but can't wait for the trimaran.
I think that it is so fun getting to watch you guys tour different boats and meet new people. I also love how much the kids seem to be gettig into the experience and loving getting to explore all kinds of different boats! <3
Elay! Your hair is sooooooo good this colour & cut. Making me wanna cut mine heheh
Nice
Sell the Tri and purchase this one!!
Yes , yes, yes, fun learning And Seeing different rides. You guys ROCK! Make the years fly by.
Hello you guys, I absoluetly love watching your videos and I think by now I have seen all of them.. I must admit that I enjoyed watching the videos before the boat tours more. Maybe it is because I am not that interested in the boats themselves and all the facts but more into you guys and you re amazing family! Everyday life, great moments, laughs and struggels are the best content. But if the boat tours make you happy, keep doing them because that counts.  Sail save ❤
TOURS rock.  House, Boat, Tiny hut... tours help orientate where things are and give great ideas for storage.
I love the Riley and Saskia boat tour duo.  Great job guys, excited to see the boats coming up and even more excited to see the trimaran soon!
The sailing world need: - honest boat reviews. If you can do that and still be invited on other ones great! But it's a tricky one. - boaters practicing boat handling.  That motorboat captain is dangerous. - more designers making protected or protectable cockpits without losing the outdoor feel. Also, there is a 20y old ORMA 60 on your seller's site. I can feel my inner Riley stir in me :-)
It's incredible visiting so many different boats. I know nothing about them, but I'm learning so much !  Cheers xx
Wonder why they call it a gunboat To me gunboats HAVE GUNS  Do some Old styles,too  You  have one in your list maybe it's the next one Of a long slender mono  Except for not being gaffed rig looks like Shamrock of the late 1800's
💯🤍2 beautiful little angels🧑🏼👱🏻✨🔥❤️👍🏻👏🏻💪🏻
YES YES I love watching you touring all these boats.... keep it up!!
Enjoy these. Would be nice to see some carbon monohulls
Love these videos!
365 degree views 😂 Riley
I love this new style of content!
🤍
Keep em' coming! Love it.
Love these types of videos!
I like these vidoes because you give me the chance to see options that I would not be able to see.
Absolutely love these types of videos, for sure would love more. And all the little family moments are awesome. How you juggle it all is beyond brilliant. Can't wait to see you settled on the new boat, that is exciting!
I love the touring and sailing different videos each week.
I’m enjoying the boat tours but I’m really eager to see your new boat finished and you moving in and sailing it.
Great video, like touring the different boats.  It’s like an in-depth and entertaining boat show on screen!
I like the boat tour, it’s interesting to hear your view of different sailing vessels. But I waiting for the trimaran as well. Thnx guys!
Greta to see you trying out different boats.
When lenny started crying with his cut, I teared up...what a sweet, brave little man... and I love all your movies touringnew placesand boats... and can't wait to see the new boat 😊
I love the boatshow format! Totally enjoyable and interesting and so fun!!
The classic child's lip curl!!  These videos are great, and you obviously enjoy making them.
Awesome video!
Rileys Roundup Sailboats
Killer whales are dolphins though
Riley!! That shirt u have on at the end frickin epic! :O awesome shirt
Loving the boat tours.  Also really love Darwins Jelly mustache.
Love it ALL!!
I don't know a lot about boats and sailing, so these videos have been super informative and enjoyable to watch! Thank you for making such great content no matter the format!
It’s okay Lenny. My Mom was a genius too.
I enjoy your tours of other boats.  I enjoy all your videos.  I've been watching you guys almost since the beginning.
love the boat reviews
O my dear, when that guy with the red beard pop up on the screen, I really thought you had Prince Harry on board!🤣🤣🤣🤣
That capt was drunk.
Loving these boat tours and looking forward to this round the world adventure
Riley was right....Orcas are the largest of the Dolphin family.
Such a beautiful boat! Cant believe the other boater pulled in and out of port like that. Oblivious to what was happening. Have to say i think this is the first time i saw Lenny cry and i wanted to just hug him. Seeing all these boats is epic.
Love the format that you are doing until LV111 is on the water. Staying relevant and expanding our looks, at different vessels. Thank you for taking us along.
Curious to know if, after what you've seen touring/living on these vessels, you've had any hindsight about design choices made on the Rapido? Any changes you'd make?
Love seeing these kinds of videos, and it is so cool to see the chesapeake bay on your channel, I'm sailing around there in October for the Annapolis boat show.  You coming?
What is going on with the boat you are having built?
I love this series of videos on other boats.  It's so much fun to see these beautiful examples and learn more about sailboats.  I can't wait to see the big luxury monohull! Is that next week?  Riley = James Bond next episode?
Yesss! !!
Awesome boat, awesome video!
Did Riles mean to say 365 degree views again?😂 17:20ish mark..
Always good to see new and exciting episodes, and always makes me (lol for real) to see Riley get so stoked about a boat design, or different aspects of sailing. Love you guys! safe travels!!!
I love the boat tours!
As per your request, Riley...Providing your opinions, based on your experience, about other sailing vessels is a thoughtful use of your platform. I'm certain that many of your subscribers were just like you, before La Vagabond, and could only benefit from your continued experience and knowledge. You and Elayna have sailed monohulls, catamarans and very soon...trimarans. While your own wish list is unique to the kind and type of sailing you do, and the family you have onboard, you have the opportunity to reach more potential sailors. You've also worked very hard to protect the integrity of your online brand, which lends to your credibility as a source of valuable information.
Happy you had the mental break and happy to see you back on Camera again.
What an absolutely gorgeous sailing yacht!
Really love whatever you guys do. If it makes you happy checking out other boats keep it up and we will watch!
Think the sloped windows make this the kids favourite cat! Love seeing you sail on these different boats - must be disruptive/tiring though, bet you'll be glad to be back on your own boat!
I live on thé Coast of Georgia, right by Charleston. My husband and I have been watching your channel since we first began dating, and we decided to have a baby near the time you two had Lenny. We actually decided to move to the beach about 3 years ago, with the idea of one day learning to sail & have a boat.   It’s neat to me that you all are selling the boat in Charleston of all places.   This might be weird? But I want to convince my husband to go tour the boat to see what you guys sailed in person. Would be inspiring for our future boat & cool to see.   Thank you guys for the entertainment all these years; I know you’ll miss the cat.
Love it Riley
I can’t wait to see y’all on your new boat!!
Absolutely love these videos ❤
Greatly enjoying your boat tours/trips. Very cool to get your impressions with the fun of your family included. Bravo!
365 degree view?
it was such a pleasure to help film this! 🎉
The man driving the powerboat should not be allowed on the water, he has no respect for other peoples boats! Unbelievable!!!  Love the tours! Elay are you going goth? LOL! no seriously that black hair looks nice. Cheers!
Yes! Please continue to sail different boats and show us what they go for! Its a lot of fun to watch!!
Yea mate more is good!
I have loved watching this series of you touring various boats. What a great idea to do this whilst you are between boats! You have turned lemons into lemonade!
sassy needs to have redish hair for the right attitude i think lol LOVE the boat but sticking to my 1260 seawind
“Saskia loves it too”😂❤❤
Hey fam, how quick is Darwin on his feet considering he's a sea-legs baby...? Maaan he shot down that hallway in a blink!
That old fella has enough coin to be on that yacht, but presumably to arrogant to get lessons how to sail it. Seeing a lot of stupid on the water lately. I guess it will take enough people being killed before certain internationally qualifications are required. Like some countries are doing re insurance, with salvage cover.
I don't like this kind video's, because this is basically sales peace.
HELL YES I'd love to see more from Riley & Saskia 😂 on ya craft tours. You're so knowledgeable guys. I'm learning heaps about so many different yacht types..! 👏👏👏   Side comment: I'm sure it's not in your budget "yet", but for your World Wide chartering biz, I would've thought Vandal would make an incredible addition to your fleet?   Ok, that aside... chop chop fam! I'm hanging to see the Rapido sooo much!   Can't believe how big the boys are getting already.. Reminds me of when my 3 boys were little tackers.  🤔Hmmm "Little Tackers" (c) Youth sailing tours??? 😮
Really enjoy seeing the different vessels and how they perform and meet your needs.
0:45 like button pressed.
Great video! Since I was a child I have always been fascinated by catamarans and I am not even a sailor. What an amazing boat! Thanks for showing it. Btw i wish that wrecker-ralph captain had bought a smaller boat instead so he would have an easier time controling it. Maybe a 5 meter long one.
Vocês são incríveis né  Deus  abençoe vocês aí...
I enjoy watching everything!! I can't wait for your new adventure, the boat tours are incredible ❤ Till next time SLV have a safe and happy week!!
18:20 phew! Imagine you have a super expensive boat or a boat you spent many months building on your own, and someone arrives like that near your boat. Scary!
Did anyone notify the marina about what happened?
what a boat id love it my self.
Lenny's pouty crying face is a riot lmao.
Absolutely! Do more truly enjoy your sales pitch…
Love the Gunboat and the Pink sale is my favorite
Love these boat tours and reviews. Please keep it up. That said, sooo looking forward to the new Tri😁
There's nothing like seeing you tour & review/critique the boat(s) under sail -- real life, not just a dockside tour.  Keep it up as a side gig, love it!
Riley, whether its your opinion about new boats, free diving, educational reading or mental health, the thoughts, research and effort behind your words of wisdom are always insightful. For now, I'm really enjoying these learnings about different types of boats. Next month, I'm sure life will bring you a different and interesting passion... whatever that maybe, I/we will enjoy (vicariously) your valuable insights about that topic, as well... we look forward to it, like an uncharted adventure.
It was big purple on le vagabond 2 and big pink on vandal the spinnakers up look so cool and give the boat a signature identity for vagabond 3 why not run a competition for your viewers to create a signature spinnaker design? Or give Lenny and Darwin some paints and let them at it 😄
Watching you sail reminds me that wind is such an amazing source of energy. Seems like the world should harness more wind energy and get onto a global system of producing electricity. Like the sun, wind is a neverending source (for another few billion years at least).
Thumbs up on the boat reviews!
love this video concept. Please do more
Your reviews are quite good. By sailing and living on the boat, one gets a true picture of life on board. Keep it up.
we'll be heading to Charleston again friends with boats there. As for the epic boat tours keep it real add a little cost to running them.. Yes sailboats are a chic magnet most channels have a back story "how we met" marry, kids and dogs... few cats thx guys..
💗
Yikes, looks like Motorhead tried to spring off the bow (good idea) but forgot the actual spring (bad idea)... OTOH, I've had my moments too when I missed a throw and decided to just dock anyway where I could have just held in place and fixed it properly. Verrrrry (massively) inelegant...
More boat tours legends thanks
Was hoping to see y’all fly a hull.  Maybe not practical with a family onboard.
Yes more tours please.  Great vids. Been watching since the Med.
It's great getting a boat review from sailors that you feel you know. It's got way more value than some rando with a sales pitch. Cheers guys atb
Love this boating series!  The boys are growing up so fast!
Miss the arrival happen, to get wind tricky situation, but landing on a brand new gunboat ... Hope for good insurance !!
I love watching you try out all these top of the line sailboats - very exciting opportunity for you and for us to see! When little Lenny got his cut, I got teary. I'm glad he has parents who honor his feelings and comfort him so lovingly. And VA going GLOBAL?!!! Wahoo!
Balance 526 Love to see you on one!😊
Please keep doing the boat reviews and in particular spending at least a couple of days living with and sailing it. It would be great if you could interview the designer/builder to explore the intent and philosophy behind the boat.
Yes they are great videos guys!
🤙👍
Awwww my heart broke seeing both Darwin and Lennys little lips when they cried. They are the sweetest little sirs. ❤❤
*point of information
When motoring, the engine noise was quite loud. Would it be deafening when the engines are running for a whole day during a passage?
..this could be a whole new thing to add to the channel. Maybe a "Boat of the month" show 12 times a year, with a calendar to buy.. Good on ya, mate..
Are you selling the new boat
Love these videos
Even though I'm very skeptical about showing children on the internet, I'm very grateful to see Lenny and Darwin on a regular basis. It wouldn't be the same without them ♥
Love your videos guys and love the boat tours, the Rainbow Warrior was certainly a fav.
Definitely like seeing you sail as that is the main reason I watch your videos.  We currently sail in Annapolis with Sailtime and will keep a look out for this gunboat.  It has an interesting cockpit.  Does it get cold without being closed in?
Fantastic video.  Love the fast boat tours..      you really are showing us all that fast boats can be family cruisers .
definitely continue this type of boat review series, who knew there was so many intricacies on different types of vessels ?!
Love your personal tours of various sailing vessels.; very groovy
We like it it’s very entertaining and it’s great to see the boys playing onboard
Love these vids
You guys are awesome.entertainment. current adventures fantastic.  How you chat  to camera and Riley interrupts and keeps it so down to earth and real all the time is hilarious  and makes you guys so linkable although I'm lookimg at elana thinking don't worry it's fine WE LIKE IT. Lol. It's only been a week I'm on YouTube dying for anything interesting to watch snd thought you guys missed a week. U guys some best entertainment on here  Keeping it real is awesome..
I absolutely loved watching you two give your two cents worth on all the different boats (and I don't even own a boat or ever plan to).  Talk about an awesome plug for the sale of that vessel (cheap at half the price, like you said Riley).   Whatever you guys talk about is very interesting - you have a lovely combination of part serious, part educational and part pure fun and adventure.  You guys really are liquid gold.
Oh my god Lenny 😢❤
Can't wait to see the lunch of the new Vagabond 🎉🎉
'The only cat that will do 1.4 times wind speed' Windelo? Pretty darn fast in any case, and an even better forward facing helm, with doors open or shut to the rest of the living space. I'd love to see your review of them!
I love these types of videos!!! Thank you!
G'day,  It appears this boat would take a crew to sail? How many crew at a minimum would you say? I like when Riley & yourself give feedback on whether the boat is manageable by a couple or requires extra hands on deck. It is something to factor in for any potential purchaser. Also, how would this boat, qith the open plan deck cope in colder weather? Is there someway to close in the space when it is cold? Love ya work.
Omg love love these tour type videos. Having Riley explain things seeing dif crew on dif vessels so major so into them plz plz more
The boys are getting so big
Love it
I love this so much guys!!!
So much fun seeing you sailing these vessels!
I want to see a Chris White..
Stunner. Captivating open views..endless ocean views. Definitely a social space. Fav so far. Bet you can beat that, cause always. -ABH Casey
they sound like charlatans.
Vessel tour was interesting.
The best videos EVER!❤😊
Yes more boat videos. It is so much fun watching the boys grow onboard.
❤ the show and all the different boats u both look great keep up the brilliant work x
Darwin wide open throttle down the hallway with Elayna in hot pursuit saying you cant go down there. Raising toddlers is a running yelling kind of of a job.
absolutely do as many of these type of ventures as you can. we all benefit from learning more. I didn't quite understand the sale of Vagabond 2 and the promotion of all the charters?
Barbie sail!!! 😍
Oh man that guy with the boat at the dock - heart in mouth!!!!!!!!
Hi guys,yes I love watching you go on the different boats,I  love watching your channel
Keep the boat variety up. I'm not a sailor but love seeing what is available and what is important.
So sick and tired of therapy endorsements on EVERY YouTube channel. I think enough is enough!
@12:25 "I think the best baby food is Gerber!" 🤣🤣🤣 I hope he was joking for the camera. There's multiple videos of people magnifying metal out of it, multiple recalls & it taste awful! If I can't eat it, my baby's not eating it.
But that pink sail! It’s such happiness!
Great videos dudes keep them coming!
Love whatever you guys do. Mate … I think the phrase is “cheap at twice the price” … 😂
WHO ELSE LOVES TRAVELING ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Loving these videos thanks guys.
You might turn into sales ppl, if you haven't already 😅 How about finishing the Rapido and then swap it with this one. ;-)
Love these tours so much 🙂
These videos are awsome
YOU KEEP SELLING QUACKS BUT DID YOU LEARN TO USE CV17 YET ???  HOW ABOUT ADVANCED BREATH WORK LIKE PRANIC BREATHING , BALANCED BREATHING AND FIRE BREATH ???  WHAT ABOUT PSYCHIC SELF DEFENSE ???  THE JOURNEY IS INWARD / THE ILLUSION IS OUTWARD LOL
So good getting to look at different boats and the floor plan on that boat is amazing for socialising amazing, keep up filming different boat that people have never seen
68 Gun next with crew, you'll need child care and a teacher
I´d love to see you guys sailing different boats from time to time 👌 As long as you keep it light, fun and real if you know what I mean.. Dont try to sell them. There's plenty of those channels on Youtube already, but not that many actually sailing the vessels and sharing their thoughts, so that ´s a great idea 👏  Just never stop having fun with what you're doing. That's what makes me watch every single video you upload 🥰(Well that, and the chance of seeing Riley dressed up like a pirate/old lady/youneverknowwhat, and Elayna making steaming sauna clips 😉😂😂) Thank you guys, best wishes 🙏
Vaga II is not sold yet?!?!?!?
What if betterhelp is actually AI? 😂
Epic guys love these videos guys   Keen for more like it  it’s so amazing for u guys to have created a platform where u can now travel the world to show off other boats to help sell them it’s so cool  love ur work ❤🇦🇺🙏
It’s a cool thing that you’re doing. Checking out very fine boats, living on them and filming. I like it and hope to see more.
That Gunboat is awesome! Thanks for showing us around!
Great review, especially if the boat is within your $ range… you get the feel of what it would be like to live on her, rather then technical data, and camera views, while sitting in a marina.
I love your videos...
I learned to sail on that stretch of the Chesapeake so I was amused by the many places ya’ll had run aground! Nice to be in such fine company.   Love these vlogs. Looking forward to more!
Love it….learning lots about the different boats…… I really liked Fujin 😊
Not only is it great to see you guys review boats, I think it's extremely important for the industry.
I’m sure you guys have givin it a lot of thought but I guess cause I like a lot of space I feel like going from a catamaran to a trimaran you’re sacrificing a lot of extra space. If I remember correctly your switching to a trimaran for the extra speed. Do you think as your kids grow and want more space will you switch back? I imagine it would be more comfortable for your family at some point.
Love that you are getting to sail with experienced people on a range of different boats. Your sailing will just keep getting better. I’d love to see you do a regatta.
When I was about 13 my Dad had bought a new boat with 2 engines, never having a boat with two engines he was unaware when we went to leave the marina the first time that one of the engines was not on. Holy crap that was terrifying. I think we hit everything as we slowly went in a destructive circle while everyone and anyone was yelling at us. Lessons were learned.
That CP bay thing was really sketchy, owner of that big boat had no idea what he was doing coming in AND leaving the marina. Grown up people just letting things go totaly by luck and chance with such a big boat, pisses me off. Well, enough of my negativity now 😂 great vid guys, looking so forward to seeing more of lv3, stay safe, love from Norway.
Riley ya these are really cool to see you guys check out new boats! You guys should have done this before you designed the new boat? Maybe would have had a lot more ideas to toss at the new boat! But ya really cool!
As someone who’s been watching your story for the last couple years now I do enjoy seeing you sail and review other vessels. ✊️😎
As a parent for 7 kids I couldn’t imagine how hard it would be on board you are the best and that lip of lennies will sink hearts 💕 and it’s all for the rabbits 🐇 lol and a big gday mate from Victoria and cheers 🍻
love you guys with the new boats, keep it going. The gunboat has always been my favourite.🤙super fun, love you all
the yacht reviews are cool ... keep them coming!
Pink sail the way to go ever get stranded coast guard could find you easier
Sailing Vessels are built for a specific genre.  You could cross the Atlantic with this one but its more intended for social cruising up and down the coast entertaining  your mates I would think.  She looks stunning and well built.
Another wonderfully inspirational video guys.
Missed you guys were u been at how's the boys n you n Riley all doing love you all  safe sailing 👄❤
Love the video.  Beautiful yacht.
“Is this a Diamond Shroud?”  “Yeah……”
I DID LIKE THIS VIDEO
Great video  and enjoy seeing different boats and your thoughts on them.
For me, comfort/social/living space far exceeds needing to sail super fast. So, I would be a CAT buyer all the way.
Thank you so much for the boat reviews! Still can hardly wait for your new boat, of course!
Nice one
Enjoyed you guys sharing your adventures on different vessels. Look forward to more in the future and of course the new tri!!!
I can't wait to see the new tri, ocean going Lambo. Lovin the boat tours as long as the boats are really cool kit. Bring back Saskia, that chick had no idea what she was talkin about but damn she was hottie.
These these last few videos are definitely not as good as most of the ones in the past. Miss the old vibes.
How old is the Gunboat? Are they the original owners?…did you guys say brand new it’s $4mil?!
I am a fan of your  YouTube channel for several years now. In response to your inquiry, I do find myself nostalgic for the older content. While searching for a boat, I would naturally visit a dealership. Over the past 7 years, my family and I have been enjoying sailing together, and your channel has been a valuable resource for understanding how others manage family life on board. With my boys aged 8 and 6, I've come to miss that aspect. Nonetheless, I must commend your team for consistently delivering amazing content!
yes give us more on various amazing sailing boats.
Seeing Greta really sucked.
Love how Elayna replies to Lenny "Mama is a genious ". Yes you are ❤🎉
Absolutely love the boat showcases!
Love this, the submarine thing I’d love to know a bit more about- any more info on this?
YES, LOVE THE VARIETY OF SAILBOAT TOURS
I love gunboats!
Just waiting to hit the 1.5 Billion $ Jackpot Lottery so I can get a Hanstager X-1, It's only 64' but it boasts plenty of room as it is also a tri.  Plenty of bling to go around as well............. Do like this one you're on just now........................ enjoy
Yes,,,enjoyed watching this video.
"so I really think the best baby food is Gerber's"  🤣🤣🤣
The boat visits are great fun.  When you all get onto your new water home sprinkle in dome more.  Love your channel!
Fantastic episode.
Yep - the more you explore other vessels, the more you will find things to incorporate in yours.   I am afraid each time I see you sail on these multi-engined catamarans, the more I think you will regret your single screw choice.
Es muy bueno 👍
Exciting times ahead, Travel yes please  and show us fabulous ships that sail the seas.
I love everything y’all do!! Especially what makes y’all happy 😊
There's a crab on the windshield - a very big one.  :)
Keep these coming. Love the episode. But, I can’t wait to see your boat!
I really enjoy you guys doing tours of the boats. The glee in Riley‘s face and eyes is so beautiful and his suck it all up learning everything he can. Hence, they have a lot of knowledge about boats and sailing and their natural. 😊
Loved this week. Full of joy. It was clear you loved it too.
Yes! Do more videos like these! 26:50
Love the boats...
I think it is amazing to see different boats. I have never sailed do this is so fun to learn and watch
I've decided the dolphins and killer whales are trying to send us a message 'stop taking our fish', like the penguins in the movie Happy Feet.
Digging these boat tour videos
Congratulations on the newest adventure!
Elayna. Please change your hair back to your normal colour 😊
I have never failed, but I love seeing & learning about all the different vessels! Would love to see more!!!
Gooooooood things……
I love watching y'all on different boats. The exposed cabin area of this boat is amazing. I have a 37 foot motor boat and everyone always ends up on the fly bridge 😂
Exploring new boats?  Love it ... especially your experienced eye for what works and what works best.
We just went on a cat for a few days sailing in the Whitsindays and I'm tempted to sell the house and buy one purely because our baby slept so well on the boat! I will say though I do admire you raising 2 kids on a boat, its not exactly the most kid friendly environment so making it work like you have is impressive!
❤❤❤definitely! We want more!!!!!!
Gunboats were my first love when I got interested in sailing, before the French bought them and if im not wrong vandal was one of the last ones built in the states but i could be wrong.  I am sure everyone here would love to see you go on different boats for sure count me in!
yes im loving all the tours about different boats, your practically teaching me about the difference in boats. and inspiring me alott!!
I long for the days your not always trying to sell us some thing.
Heard about some Goldfish attacks on boats too, especially Catamarans. Awful, absolutely awful. 😮
I love the new vessels, but even more I love hearing what you like or don't like and why.  Your input and opinions make everything better.
A giant pink sail... it seems to be perfect timing with the Barbie movie and all.
A wonderful bird is the Pelican His beak holds as much as his belly can He can hold in his beak enough for a week I wonder how the hell he can?
They are a most charming couple bringing us many joyful hours shared. Thank you.
I sat down to watch this video because I cut my finger really bad. Feeling for your little guy.
Love the boat tour/shakedown videos. I'd love to get your impression of the windelo 54.  I hope Lenny's hand is ok. He was a very brave soldier.
Wow
Yes, I've very much enjoyed your demonstrations and reviews of other boats, and I hope that you'll be able to continue doing this, even after you launch your new boat. It's advantageous for both your channel and for those spelling these magnificent vessels.
Love the LaTour series!
great video
🧡🧡 Love this boat tou🧡🧡🧡🧡. keep show more💦💦💦⛵🛶🚤🛥⛴🚢 💦💦💦 ,  and see you soon on the 3rd💦💦💦💦  .🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻Health to all of us .
Love the sailing of all these different boats! Although, we did miss Elayna’s alter ego from last episode. Fun stuff!
great show more more more more  Ty guys
Yeah, love you guys reviewing cool boats! You guys on fujin was super super cool!
I really enjoy watching these videos of you guys sailing different types of boats! Love your family!
Could you single hand sail her, Riley?
A sign of great trust in your sailing capacity. Symbiotic relationship. You help them sell and you get advantage as well especially in sailing track record. All the best! Looking forward to La Vagabonde III. Thanks for sharing Lenny & Darwin's antics.
Very fun seeing* all the different boats
Absolutely LOVE your channel, #1 by far. I cannot WAIT to see your new boat finished. Oh goody.
Been fun to watch you tour boats…always appreciate your family adventures❤
Riley I love the shirt you wore for final thoughts. Lenny made me cry but Elayna you are a magical mom.
I'm so proud and lucky to have been with you all since the original mono whole been so long I can't remember how that happened but it's been fantastic so far
I'm not one to comment much but I really enjoyed this.
Yeah I love spending time with you all can't wait for the new boat Terry from Panama City
👍
Are you kidding who doesn't want to ride on a gunboat man that was great
Riley, could a couple sail this boat successfully? Btw, your neighbors are morons. Omg. Fools, too much grandmas cough medicine on board.I love watching you Guys on a different vessel each week. Cant wait to see the Spirit sailboat.
Love seeing these other vessels! Amazing to see that living space surrounded by glass.
*How NOT to use a bow-thruster*
How many people do you need to sail this boat could Riley and family sail it on there own or would you need some crew long distances
I preferred you on the first sailboat, they were original, I haven't watched the channel for about 2 years, and just today that I was watching they put Greta's image, 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Definitely incorporating boat reviews is an added bonus to your channel.  Having it a family affair gives a more complete idea of how it could be your lifestyle as well ( most sailors are couples)
I love the touring of the vessels. You guys are doing such a great job. I can tell you research even like the pelicans. And I love the information you guys put out. Your adventures excite my curiosity every week.
Absolutely love you guys touring all these unique boats. It’s quite easy to tell how much you both enjoy it, too!
Love this type of video... honestly, I like them all 🙂
These videos these days are really awesome.  Love the touring and checking out all the different boats.  Love that you still do some free diving as well., that's what got me hooked on you two to begin with, now everything you guys are doing is the coolest :)
I think it could be a nice mix in from time to time, but looking forward to the adventures
Good vid more mould be cool 😎🇨🇦
I really enjoy your videos and this series where you are touring different boats is a ton of fun to watch. Thanks
like it 👍
_@ __25:44__: Excellent capture!_
I’ve loved watching you sail different boats!  This boat was especially cool.  It’s just so interesting to see the difference of how each boat sails…..the big pink sail was beautiful!  Keep doing what you’re doing, I think it’s working.  💦
“Mommy’s a genius” loved this

Seeing all these different boats over the years--monohulls thru trimarans--has been educational as well as entertaining. The wide shots of the lounge area of this boat (e.g. 17:00) are just stunning. It's like living outdoors. Amazing! And so smooth through the water. Thanks for the tour. Looking forward to the next.

I've got catching up to do. What happened with the new boat built in Vietnam?
Great Video! I honestly have enjoyed any type of videos you guys do.
love the video keep it up
LaVagabonde Multihulls Inc. " LVB 55 " Trimarans, Lol...
Love to see more boat lifestyle. The family 👪 so caring and loving luv it
I say, I do love you guys loving trying out the other boats, and Vandal is a badass boat.  I gotta win the Mega Millions first, it's 50/50
Love the new boat tours guys!
Love you guys touring on all these different boats.  It so awesome!!
LOVE IT GUYS !
You guys are cool look at windhippie solar Sailer in a 25-foot give respect the true sailor

I love all of your adventures and seeing how easily the kids adapt to all the different boats.
RE: 25:05... Why are large window considered a no-no? Is it a structural/rigidity concern?
I love to see you and your family anytime anywhere, you all are so entertaining, and can't wait to see La Vagabonde  III, good luck to you and have fun!!!!!!!!!!!
Please be humble look at all the shity low-budget boats that have done twice what you guys have had give them credit God bless you be safe
Unfortunately Sailing La Vagabonde is turning from a sail channel into a sale channel.
That last drama scene is why I SOLD - there are far too many morons on cruising grounds these days- Unmanned boats on anchor dragging-shew - not for me-  Florida is worse- scenes like this on a daily basis- no respect for other mariners - it’s like you have a bunch of drunk fools out there these days- Good luck out there Fam! Stay safe!
Great so glad you had help but way over your head
Loved that episode!
🌈⛵🌞🤠👍
Love your program look forward to seeing you every week keep up the awesome work ❤❤
Great job
OMG  as a X power boater of 25 years on the Chesapeake bay, no wonder the power boaters that docked in front of you faces were blurred.  Just shaking my head.
I love these videos ❤
Reviewing boats from you guys makes it real without the BS mainly because of your history of sailing different stile boats and the years at sea. Riley your no BS up front like or not personality makes a world of difference. Elayna your experience of not only the sailing and operating the as well as the convivence of the living on board is so informative, what you bring to the review could actually make or break a deal. PS not that it matters, I loved the blonde hair. Luv you guys.
I recall that in one of the early seasons when Jack was on board you asked him, both for his benefit and the benefit of any potential employers watching, what he wanted to do next in the sailing industry.  And he sort of cracked back that he’d be happy enough to captain a 60 foot Gunboat.  Then you both gave a bit of a smile that was one part sly and one part wistful.  And now here you are!
Just curious, with Vagabond Adventures doing so well, what happens to your mate that was running it when you sell Vagabond II?
Could you sail this vessel without the crew? Just your family of 4? What would be the 1st jobs that you'll hand over to the boys as they get bigger. Thank-you in Advance. Greetings from the West Coast of Canada
What a fabulous vessel, absolutely beautiful. I’m enjoying the different boat tours and can’t wait for the next.
Definitely love the boat tours! Keep it up.
Wow man. Excellent.
When will your boat be ready to sail?
Why is it called a gun boat? I don’t get it…
Yes, yes, yes.  Love seeing these top of the line sail boats with your expert opinions.
Yes I’m loving the videos keep them coming
Great tour
This was fantastic! Again, your enthusiasm and joy made this episode so awesome! Thank you. 💞
Love you guys but since you asked for feedback - I haven’t really been a fan of this series. I’m not a boatie and usually watch the channel cause I enjoy the vlog-style episodes, your family life and seeing you explore new areas. But I’m sure changing up the content has been a refreshing change for you personally.
The accident guy only knows one throttle setting, on full.  Riley, the phrase is "cheap at twice the price" and not "cheap at half the price."  lol
i love all your content but nothing beats your longer hour raw sailing vids, sales vids are nice to switch up once in a while but ya no lol
Ok final thoughts, Riley that shirt is awesome 🤩 I want it!  Also, the gunboat is so sexy.
not allowed down here.......that's what billylids will do.....😊
Riley stop interrupting Elena, that's so rude!
Being the original YouTube sailing channel, I fully endorse you abandoning your trimaran (or spend a year on it and sell), and getting a gunboat 68 next.
Yes I like seeing different types of sailing boats. The bigger the better. I also enjoy seeing below deck.
Congrats on the good news!  Good luck to you.  Be careful not to grow too fast.  Don't forget the old saying, "Act in haste, repent at leisure."
Do you know what happened with that boat that crashed into another and then fucked off without leaving any details? Surely you've got this as evidence to the owners
Tajin seasoning takes mango and watermelon to the next level.
I grew up on the Chesapeake bay.  It was so nice to see the Solomon’s, Thomas point light and the best sailing estuary in the world.
❤❤❤❤
I love these videos! You guys are so smart and experienced, I love hearing your thoughts on each vessel.
Aww, Lenny's little pouty lip😢. The boys are both growing too fast .  God bless y'all 🙏   I was raised around Atlanta, Ga. , But have lived in SW Fla for a few years now. We are at Anna Maria Island on the Pacific gulf coast, and I remember the pelicans diving straight down from way up in the sky for fish when we were first here. Its amazing , isnt it? , Lol , that they can see a fish underwater from way up there! 😲
I love your show, guys. Just wondering, does anyone know how a sail boat comes to be called gunboat?
Every skipper has a perspective.  It would be interesting to interview owners of their pros and cons of their own boats.
Your work ethic is insane! The boys have got some great role models to learn from. The excitement is building for the grand reveal!
I LOVE you trying out all these boats. However how a person would ever decide which one to buy is beyond me. So please keep showing  everyone all the different designs.  Please stay safe and healthy.m
Do what you like guys!!!!
Super glad to see all of you relaxed and enjoying yourselves. The different sailing vessels are a great way to learn about these things. You give us a window into a world most of us would never see. Thank you, and best of luck to you and your family!
0:48 Thanks!
Love seeing the different boats. Tour yourselves silly.
What an amazing boat!  I really like this type of video.  I learn a lot about the different type of boats with your videos.  Keep them coming.
I’ve been loving these videos!!
Fyi we just finished skiing in California!! Mammoth mountain closed out the season August 6th 2023. Cheers from Northern California!!!
Chesapeake Bay!!?? Y'all are in the States!? Ahhh! Not far from me 🤣👍♥️🥳 I'm a Virginian. Wish we could have met up! Safe travels 🙏✨
You guy's wanting  and loving the experience. It's  a big yes continue trying different boats. What a wonderful time to be living!!!
Great rolling Stones throwback
It would be interesting to see this boat in a heavy gale in the open ocean.
Awesome review more please
So much preparation 24/7 with these sailboats labor of love no doubt
These videos are good.  I would prefer more sailing action if possible, especially since your time on each vessel is limited.  Accomodations and family time is fine, but how the boats actually perform and handle is my interest.
Such great manners on your boys! Beautiful boat. Thanks for taking us along. That captain was not careful. He was like gunning it.
Great seeing you guys always keep up the great show Love it
I’m anxious to see your new boat, but in lieu of that, the different boats are good to see.
YES! Keep on new boats
One of my favorite movies is Waterworld. Living on the ocean, snorkeling,  scuba diving, spear fishing for your food,  so exciting. I would definitely have to have an air compressor to fill my tanks.
I always thought that if you hadn't decided on the Rapido that your new boat was going to be a Gunboat.  That's an amazing boat!
Thank you for the upload that was nail-biting to watch that yacht leaving the marina.
Its been so much fun, interesting and educational to see these videos! Ryley, you are so kind to not be more critucal of the guy piloting the sport fisher. He was wreckless! Hes really lucky to have people like y'all help him, actually you were keeping the sail boat from being bashed into, but he really shouldn't be piloting that size boat until he's improved!  Love the vlogs!!
Yes. We (my wife, daughter and I) are into these boat tour videos! What a convenient win for everyone. Keep them going!
Love the boat tour videos, the green peace boat trip was epic. The boys are growing up right before our eyes. The evolution of the channel is primo especially considering the fact you guys are doing everything while raising your youngsters, bravo, keep up the great work. Thanks
The Chesapeake is my home, so I'll struggle to keep this comment short.  First, I'm loving the boat tours/sea trials, seems like Riley's dream job.  Second, Riley's comment at 6:00 "if the Chesapeake looked like the Bahamas, everyone would be here" I believe refers to the water color.  A combination of heaps of trees and plants that lose their leaves in autumn, and pollution, make the water a murky blue/green/brown.  But for those of us who need to finish our careers before heading to the Caribbean, the Chesapeake is about as good as it gets!  Thanks for all you do LaVagabonde!
What's a gun boat, never heard the term b4. Besides the military
Love the E&R Review Show.
A Barbie pink sail wow oh Lennon and that quivering lip just wanted to give him a hug sweet boy ! Great video as always !
Love the tours!  I like the Barbie sale!
You would love touring new vessels more if I was there. lol.
Tours are awesome…Yes yes yes! The children are so adept at being adaptable.
Love to see the different boats and your reviews
You guies make legit movies. Qualities top notch! Always cool to watch new content from you. Btw, Im 21yo and been a steady listener scince the first crossing. Cheers🌴
Greetings from Hobart, TAS. :D Longtime viewer and fan of your fam. Definitely do more of these boat reviews. Your accumilated sailing experience gives the videos a lot of value. Keep being yourselves and living in the moment. Love you guys, Tony (63, ex windsurfer) 🥰
APPRECIATE  all posts.  Honesty, vulnerability so lovely.  Thank you.  Any chance Riley could get rid of the moustache?
I don’t comment on videos, I just don’t.  Yet here I am contradicting myself.  Your “movies” are far and away the content I look forward to most.  Not because I am a sailor as I am not.  Not because I am a family man as I am not.  But, to be honest, because I find myself tearing up during every one of your episodes for one reason or another.  You, more than anyone on YT pull at my heart strings with your enthusiasm, honesty, passion and genuineness.  It literally makes me emotional every time and I absolutely love it.  I realize that most of YT is just the “good stuff” but never the less it gives me true joy to see you and your family find the place in the world that makes you happy.  You have earned and deserve every bit (and arguably more) of the success you are experiencing and I wish more and more.  This latest series of videos on board various vessels is a joy to watch and I look forward to every single future episode.  Keep up the fantastic work and please accept my most heart felt wishes of continuing success for your family and everyone who has the opportunity be a part of your life.  Cheers!  Pete…
Love the vids
Loving these Videos guys, gives us a good introduction and run-through on different sailing boats and possible options, I wish I had the budget for the Gunboat. Keep up the great work.
“Saskia loves it too” 😂😂😂 For a second I was like ‘Who’s Saskia?!’ Then I remembered. Lol!
What is the meaning of y’all’s boat name
I really enjoy watching your tour around the world with all the unique sailboats, but I look forward to seeing your new home on the water soon.
new boats always
😞🤮
It is so intersting seeing the different styles and market value of these vessels. I love watching you sail all of them. It is a terrifiec incentive to purchases one, and you make it hard to resist. I would enjoy seeing more videos in the same genre.
1. WHEN DID DARWIN start talking!?? 2. If neither Elena, nor Riley are behind the camera, then who is? I’m just curious.
i would love to see boat number three, cant wait till you guys are settled
I love this series of sailing all different kinds of boats, but my favorite part of this one was the little frog at the end!
"So I really think the best baby food is Gerber...." made me totally LOL! Ha ha!
Yes!! Love watching you get to know these boats so you can give the pros and cons. I also want to hear what  Lenny (sp?) thinks of them!
Amazing tour videos, yes!!! 💖 Definitely learning so much about these other ships and your opinions, thank you. 🙏 MASSIVE healing vibes for Lenny's finger. ☝ Aloha, blessings. 🤙
Orca/Dolphins, can be called killer whales just as long as we can call lions “killer zebras” or, us humans, “killer turkeys,” or, dung beetles “killer dungs”🤔
10:46 omg his little face saying you can look at it. Broke my heart! You are truly blessed he’s an amazing gorgeous little boy inside and out. Love from my family to yours 🤍💛🧡🤎
I enjoy each and every one of your videos.. but honestly you all reviewing boats have been my favorite to date. Bring em on!!!!
I live the boat review videos from you guys.  All of your videos are great, and these new videos are also totally awesome! Cheers
I like the tour videos.
:48 😂😂😂😂
If LV Adventures is doing so well, why are you selling LV now?
great to see actual sailing vids of boats, not just a walk through
👍👍
That pink sail is everything!
I’m throughly enjoying all the different boats, especially the way you’re doing them & giving so much information about them that would take all of us so much time and knowledge to find. The best part of it is that it’s still the same videos with the Boy’s, but with so much more.  “Come here, please” , to the Dog…..was a testament to what wonderful parents you guy’s are!! ❤
I totally enjoy these videos of your boat tours. I love hearing little Lenny's  reviews. Nothing more honest then weird from a child.
Loved the video. Beautiful boat. Poor little Lenny, broke my heart with his little pout. Looking forward to SLV3 😊
Lenny's bottom lip has me ALL in my feels!!
Yes I love you showing other people boats! Keep up the good work!
Your excitement and enthusiasm in these tour videos is exhilarating. So yes, love this series of videos, and look forward to more. 😃😎🤩
I was taught to never go faster that you are willing to hit something near other boats.
Mate, not a huge fan of the boat marketing videos.  It feels wrong, such that 99.5% of your viewers could never afford this boat.  Honestly can't wait till you get your new boat so we don't have to watch advertisements anymore.
❤❤❤❤
Yes please do more boat tour videos
More, more, more & more PLEASE! Love it!!!!❤
Oh! I wanted to say that it must be difficult to fit all that beauty and information into 30 minutes!
I think  touring  these  boats  is  amazing and  this  cat seems  very fast, stable  and  roomy and  great  video quality .
Love the tours-thank you👍
I've sailed twice in my 78 years! Once off Long Island, NY and once in Lake Superior, MN. Great fun but had no idea what our friends had to do to make it fun. Am the last person to say anything here. I am always entertained by your video's. These reviews are interesting, but I find them a bit chaotic compared to your life on board your own boats. A little more tranquil on LaVagabonde.  I am very eager to see the four of you settle into the new catamaran. I will say your adventures on these vessels must be very exciting for you.  So sending you wishes for continued fun-filled adventure sails! Cheers!
The Chesapeake Bay holds a special place in my heart. Our parents took us sailing there for two weeks when I was about 12 years old. I’m almost 50 now and remember it like it was yesterday.
Oh guy’s! The Gun boat is the one cat that makes me wish I was younger to sail one but too old now and I’m a single sailer . But what a beautiful cat 🥰💕🇹🇹
This series is definitely delightful guys 👏😁
This has been great love your tours
Guys, I love everything that you do, Elana is beautiful, and the kids are adorable and Riley, I love your commentary.
Enjoying watching you sail and give us tours of the various boats.
Can't see the video well   It's kinda squished together.  But the audio is fine.
We love these videos 🥰
HOw do you handle healthcare in all the different countries?
Keep these boat review videos coming. Very interesting seeing the different styles and designs.
Yeah mate keep them coming 😊
Enjoyed this video on you sailing on different vessels. Seeing  how big the boys have gotten and how lucky they are to experience sailing. Can't wait for your next adventure.
Nils, "So, I really think the best baby food is Gerber..." LOL! Yeah, Riley and Pants, this is a LOT of fun. Some of these boats probably haven't been seen by more than a handful of people :)
Well, I've actually stopped watching some folks who do too much selling, they got to where that was all they did. So, if the selling is very much spaced, with a lot of great videos about your new personal life with the trimaran, maybe it would be ok. Please only with special boats like this one.
Excellent video
👍👍👍
“What did he hit, he hit everything”,  omg I laughed at that!!  I was standing up and nervous watching him dock near you.  I was scared!  I love the review! Really cool boat that just about sells itself, I’m just not rich enough.
Amazing introduction to a broad variety of vessels for enjoying sailing. You are really influencing that very special niche in a beautiful way. Thank you guys. ❤
It looked to me like the guy in the power boat was expecting car handling in the boat. Boats don't start and stop when the forces do (engine or thrusters). They have to allow for the delays, momentum and water movement.
👍👍
Hey fun to be with you on the tours!
Captain Al Czervik comes in hard after a day of drinking and the smooth departure the next day was magic. Yep I can see why they are ready to unload the gunboat before Al arrives back in port
Fanstastic way forward guys. Please be just as kind to the smaller, older more traditional boats, as not all of us can afford the newer ones.
Great video…..I really needed it tonight, Lenny’s quivering lip broke my heart❤❤❤❤
Definitely keep it coming, good to see different setups, hearing pros and cons from you’s (the same reviewers). The content is great as always, go the alter personality 🤙.
I dont care about the vessel, I love to see mamasita smiling and happy. The catamarans are better than your trimaran family wise, confort against velocity. OsoYolo, Antigua Guatemala.
The living space is very odd... would prefer something with separate inside and outside (or at least the ability to separate if needed)
Love these video’s! Brilliant to do all these different things … along with your regular ones .. pretty much everything you do is really fun to watch!
Super fun seeing you making the rounds with these amazing boats. You guys bring humanity and reality to these vessels. ❤
Love the tours!!!
I enjoy watching all your videos including bout evaluations. You are always very informative and entertaining. Cant wait to see you launch SLV3! Safe and happy sailing and traveling!!
Loved this episode….. the boat tour was fun… not too technical, just relatable if you get my drift.   The boat was definitely child proof😉😂
❤🖤💛🤍
Omgggg - not even halfway through and Lenny has my heart melting with his cut hand and pouting bottom lip. Poor dude.
I bought and remodeled a Uniflight powerboat and lived aboard for 2 and a half years in 2009. Best time ever having the islands as our backyard! I caught a baby seahorse in my hands sitting on a sandbar off an island in Grant, Fl.
Technically riley was right killer whales are Technically Dolphins
Yes, would love to see you show us more boats. As a land sailor😅 I love seeing the footage about boat and your reviews. Look forward for more.
Riley, Elayna deserves her washing machine!!!!
Why are they called gun boats?
Whoever designed the gear I had to wear to work at the ‘84 Olympics thought pink and mustard went well together!  🤢
"We are sailing." Just music to the ears.
Groovy shirt Dad. Mustard and pink spinnakers should match just fine…
Sure, I'm enjoying the around-the-world tour.  But I can't wait for you to finally get onboard the trimaran and move into the next phase of your family's adventure.
Definitely love these videos, I’m not a boat person at all but I find it all fascinating. With the snip-its of the kids and dolphins and the banter between you all its highly entertaining. Thanks for all your hard work to keep us interested 👏
yess! Your accumulated experiences on different boats broadens all of are knowledge about the possibilities.
I would have loved to have seen/met you all at Solomon's. I live nearby. I'm a paraplegic confined to wheelchair and I love your videos to vicariously live through you since sailing is not really possible for a full time wheelchair user.
👍
One thing you seem to not need help with is your style of delivery and your editing.  This is NEW content and interesting because you have such credibility already, and you two demo-ing different sailing vessels is a no brainer.  People value your opinions because of the unabashed honesty with which you come across the screen.  It seems less stressful from my POV.  I'm still watching and following you. Can't wait to see your boat.
I live in Solomons like two streets down from the marina. I can’t believe we missed you guys again.
Tour more vessels please and I mean all 365°of them
Here on the Chesapeake Bay we welcome even Ausies with funny accents.
"Mommy will make a bandage." "But How?" "Mommy's a genius" Says every mom on the planet... :)
Beautiful Cat what a ride!  Great editing love the new episodes thanks!
Love the boat review videos!
Thank you so much to BetterHelp, we love their advertisement's.
--  "Mama might make her own bandage."            "But how?"                     "Mama's a genius❗"                                                         *_Thank you._*
Would absolutely love to see you guys make some in-depth videos on some interesting boats 🙂
Please do continue these videos just love seeing them.
These boat series have been so much fun to watch! I love the way Lenny and Darwin make themselves at home and melt the hearts of the crew members aboard😊 Thank for sharing👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Great video but why no view of boat speed while under sail?  Also, I have to question the objectivity of the review.  From your intro, it sounds like the owner asked you to help get publicity to sell the boat.  Seems like it would be pretty awkward to offer negative opinions in that situation?
You too?? Doing a merchandising for Barbie the movie 🎥!! “Hi Barbie!! Hiiii!!”
AWWWWW  come here please Lenny says to Sophie that is AWESOME!!!!!  YOU ALL ROCK....Brave little man!!!!  I cut myself ALL the TIME  way to Go Lenny,,....WISH I would WIN the Lottery!!! I would BUY your Old Boat in a SECOND!!!!!  PSPS  I LOVE THE LOAT TOURS
Gotta luv Gunboats, thx for this one, Adam/Tofino
That gunboat cat is sure nicer that that tri-maran you bought...
it hurts my heart seeing that older picture of you Elana when you were going through a rough time, it just makes me wanna cry and hug you...   Cayenne pepper... its great for cuts and stops bleeding almost instantly, just pour on the wound, hold it closed and this stuff coagulates the blood and starts the mending process, its amazing, it was something I found when I cut my finger real deep and it wouldn't stop bleeding, I poured heaps of the cayenne pepper on my wound and by the time I got to emergency, the doctor couldn't even pull it opened, he was even amazed.. i wouldn't use it on a graze, it works fantastic on cuts.. cayenne pepper is great under the tongue, just a pinch, if someone feels a heart attack coming on, yes its important to call emergency but this stuff works differently inside the body by thinning the blood because a heart attack is usually when the blood is thick..   wow, that guy in the other boat was dangerous, well it looked dangerous... Elana, you are a brilliant vessel skipper... I hope you realise this too. yes you will learn your new vessel so nerves usually come with learning..   its great to see the smiles on your faces too, you belong on the water, it tells when you are set free to roam the waters.. its great watching you guys on other vessels and it puts you into learning more but I cant wait for you to be on your vessel.
Loved it! Need more scientific explanations 😂
Love the boat tours along with the new locations
We love watching you enjoy yourselves. If what you're doing is bringing joy and satisfaction, we are all in too.
I just had to answer your question guys. I absolutely love this kind of content. I love the water and you two, make me feel like I’m along for the ride. Love learning about different boats and different parts of the world.   P.S. you are both incredible teachers…of sailing and life. So much respect and love 🙏❤️
Captain Crash and the Crew on that yacht nearly bought a Gunboat .. and half of the rest of the marina ... I REALLY wish you guys could have goten a new gunboat for SV3  ..
Yes. Loved it. Do more.
Yeah, more boat reviews, as long as they are not all expensive fantasy boats.
Hi guys. I really look forward to all your stuff. But I do like this series.  To see What there is out there. I'm not much of a sail boat girl grew up on power vessels. But if one day I win the lottery.  I just might try this out. Love u guys. Can't wait for more to come❤😊
It's so cool seeing this boat out on the water. My team at OHIO Design in San Francisco worked on branding for Vandal while the boat was being built...way back in the day. The owners are wonderful people. What a treat to be on such a beautiful piece of functional art! I can't wait to see the other boats around the world!
it's like you're both seeing the world for the very first time....all over again!  i've noticed such a fresh and upbeat energy in you both since deciding to try these different boats each week.  i see the excitement and newfound passion for sailing in your eyes.   love to live vicariously through you each week - see you next monday!!!  💜⛵
Another romantic evening for Riley and Elayna. 🥴 I'm so glad you are feeling better Elayna. There is a lot of love out here for you and your family. Sure there are probably people out here that just tune in for the sailing but my bet is that's a small percentage. I love the boat tours you are on. I'm not the one who has been waiting so long for their new home. Stay safe. ❤🙏
Love the video! Looking forward to the rest of the tour, its no wonder why your so excited, sailing some the coolest boats anywhere!! Sure beats my old pearson 26c cheers
I was so excited to see you uploaded a vlog, ❤❤
The wife and I love what you and the family are doing. Can't wait for the new boat.
I’ve never seen anything more than a fishing boat. So these boats are fascinating to look at even more fascinating to hear you talk about.
I'm really enjoying seeing you guys on different boats. I like to see the differences between comfort and performance.
I enjoy the boat tours very much. Super cool to see all these different boats and all the unique touches each one has. Keep them coming!!
Love the reviews! Unlike the sales video style of reviews that seem to be most common, it's much more useful to a potential buyer to see the boat in action. Especially enjoyed the Gunboat! Thanks again for all the massive effort you both put into these videos!
Such a great boat, loved the instrumentation and layout.  I would buy it if I didn't have all my resources currently tied up.  Wait, wait!!!  La Vagabonde II is for SALE!!!
I have to say that I love ANY vid you make. Love you guys all the way from Muskoka, Ontario. Canada. ☑
I love seeing all the different boats! Please keep it up.
Great idea to feature different vessels for sale while waiting for your own to be finished. Before YouTube, I would have been all over this on "reality" television.  Come to think about it, I'm surprised you haven't been approached by a production company!
Love the boat tours! How fun for you guys. Can I borrow 2 million bucks? Love this boat!  Safe travels and have a ball!
I think boat tours would be a great  job for you guys for when the boys want to be in one place for school yr
That last shot of one of the boys stuck to the window like a frog was hilarious 😂❤
It’s great watching your tours!! Also that Barbie sail was so cool
I like it mate
Wow! Exciting episode on a beautiful boat! Good thing Riley was there to grab the line and secure that yacht! Super close call!! Great job Riley! Then to see they damage another boat at their departure! Crazy. Curious, about etiquette. How did you guys handle that? Did you notify owner that his boat was hit and possibly damaged. I would hope if I was away from my boat at Marina that a fellow boater would inform me about it while away. Looking forward to the new boat and adventures! Of course Pink and mustard go together. Dunking Donuts has used that color scheme forever!
Love yall touring all thess boats almost like we are on them with you
…love everything about this video, the boys are so smart and aware! …great parents     I love the little animation of the pelicans, very clever. we live at the sea in Mexico part time, are constantly entertained by the ability to dive as they do, there are hundreds on our beaches, the are comical, goofy, amazing. 🤩 Watching them swallow a fish whole is the best!
Always good to see sailing videos.
I love Saskia’s tours!
Wait Riley where was you safety line going up that mast???? What a gorgeous boat. Lovely hair color elania.
Try 1 of those longboats 😅
I take it he has hit a few boats over the years without a care in the world smh
Loving the boat tours! Looking forward to the uk adventures coming up
I love these videos! Although not weekly, it adds to the suspense when the video arrives! Elayna looks more relaxed I am happy to say. Exciting times!
Great v
I love that you are able to do this with other peoples vessels it’s awesome watching how different each one is.  You are so clear and precise explaining everything you make it look so easy.  { I know it’s not but the way you describe it makes it easier for a novice to understand }. I hope there will be more in the future.  I get my sailing done through you both so thank you for the endless enjoyment you give me and everyone else.   Cheers mate
I am enjoying watching you all 'test driving' different boats. I used to spend summers on the Chesapeake where I learned to sail and water ski. Went fishing and crabbing too.
Is this just a warm weather sailing boat
Welcome to chucklehead motorboater world in the Chesapeake! Always a ridiculous adventure knowing they're out there on the water with you. 😅😅
Love whatever you're doing. But can't wait for you to get slv3 and take her through her paces.
This Gunboat certainly offers a new perspective on what's possible. It all made sense after your explanation of water-tightness or a submarine after closing the hatch to the hull.
Omg Lenny is so cute and brave ❤❤ Reilly you need to design your brand of boat. You are amazing my uncle was a harbor marine master in the Caribbean he became a fan of the channel and wants to know if you design or built boats. Elayna you are an amazing mom ❤
Best thumbnail!! 😂
Yes, more videos sailing other's boats!  Can't wait to see the new one finished!
Great boat in the Chesapeake or the Bahamas, right, w all the space.  Probably great too in the W Indies.  But how does that forward, giant cockpit w big windows work an ocean crossing and 6M seas?
I am one that love what you guys are doing. Such smiles :)
Love these adventures and seeing you all experience different boats and the interaction it gives you and the kids. I was crying with Lenny cutting he’s finger super brave he was ❤
You guys are awesome!!!
I am loving these boat reviews. ❤  But I cannot wait for the final boat review…Your new trimaran.!!!❤❤❤
Loving it, loving it.
the segment abount the Outremerr is confusing LV Adventures is doing so well we'er selling the boat.. What !!
❣❣❤❤❤❤❣❣
I love these videos guys. They are very helpful in my hunt. ❤
How about telling those kids NO?! I love you guys but I can only imagine that guy who owns the boat holding back his TRUE answer when asked about the kids sliding down the windshield! It’s about respect
Love love love ALL your videos ❤
I really like the boat reviews. Particularly since you are on the boat for a week. Even just a few days gives you the chance to really get a feel for the boat.
Really enjoy your real world boat reviews. Are Gunboats the ultimate Cats ?
Love the boat tours!! Can't wait for next week!!
EXCELLENT!!!!! sure make more on various reputable performance cruising vessels.
Absolutely love this type of video and learning about what is available. Thanks so much, we love you guys.....
Loving the global boat tour - bring it on.
I love your videos and I don't even own a boat! You are both very easy to watch and connect with this average person. I'm always wanting to learn and I love kids! Your kids' intelligence is so enhanced by what you're exposing them to. I watched your video when your little one got sick with the water born insect. That's one thing neither kids nor adults ever win against without doctors I don't think. As to the rest of the germs, I always felt eating a little dirt on an apple was the best way of building up immunity for my kids.  The best thing you're doing these days is keeping them away from not-so-healthy cultures around the world while showing them the good part of cultures.  Lastly, I wish you "Fair winds and following seas" (a popular inscription on U.S. Navy sailors' gravestones)
I’m enjoying these videos. I would never see all these different sailboats otherwise so I look forward to each new tour. Thank you from Kentucky USA
The kids keep getting bigger an bigger😂❤
Top boat speed in that hood wind?  20 kts ?
Yes Absolutely love all your different boat tours. The analysis of them all is so interesting. Love love love! Lennie from down under.  xx
Ah definitely into seeing you guys sail all these different vessels. Would watch three videos a week :) keep it up, loving all of it! Cheers
My 2cents... I like the walk thru, you also lived and sailed on it for week. Then gave your thoughts, gives more meaning to your review. Did like the slide on the front of the saloon, that's a first for me.   Fair winds....
Keep showing us the new boats or new to us. I would love to have had more detailed info on the boat speeds with the winds that you had to work with. What the boat is capable of doing and the actual crew needed to run this thing.
We gotta toughen those boys up! lol. I know easy to say when I’m not standing there looking at that sad face🥰  it’d be really cool to get a full inside below tour of these boats..we don’t care if it’s messy! I’m so curious what the space is like below
That pink sail is da💣.
That is one sexy boat!  I really enjoy the boat tours, more specifically, I enjoy YOUR boat tours.  I know Riley doesn't joke around about sailing and a vessel's abilities.  If I was looking for a boat, I'd definitely seek his advice.  These adventures on different vessels have been so great and fun to watch!
Of course we want to see as much of you as possible. But can you actually continue that for long term without being able to make one of these your own? It might get tires some packing unpacking from one to another. Don't get burnt out guys. ❤
We absolutely LOVE watching you guys experience new vessels. Keep it up, for sure 👏🍻
Fun seeing and learning about the new boats. 😘
Sweet Lenny’s tears made me tear up with him 🩵🩵🩵
Please add operating expenses with the boat price. Seeing crazy skipper almost ramming you and hitting another made me wonder about insurance. Yikes!
Interesting episode. Nascar boat fails, always fun to watch on tv. Not so much in real life, less so, right next to you. The morning man with towel. Very artistic. The technical bits are always informative. But let me say this, the animation of the pelican family meal, that really hit home.
Loving these videos showing different boats!! Another fantastic vid guys 👍🏼
I love the video!
Keep doing these as much as is practical !  Amazing what’s available especially if you have the big $s.  Hopefully though, the people who can buy them, use them as they’re intended. (Not like the Ferrari that does 200km a year and sits in a garage under a dust cover)
Loved to tour! Gunboats are 🔥
"It's cheap at half the price" 😅😅 Riley said that quote wrong, but got it dead right
I love this format.  I think it would really work well interspersed with your regular travels and I also think it's good for the kids.
I’ll continue to follow no matter what you do
What have you done to your hair Eleyna?
I'm totally loving these boat tour videos! Really cool to see all the different kinds and watching you enjoy sailing on them!!!❤
Yes we love your beautiful vessel tour. Please continue and safe voyages !
Yeah, lovin the boat review series, keep them coming.😊
Love seeing all the different types of boats!
Boat reviews with sailing.  Without sailing, meh.
Just to let you know, your sponsor, Better Help, is settling a 7.8million dollar lawsuit for selling people’s personal data to Facebook and other companies like it. Something to think about…
What a gorgeous boat! You do a great job showing how livable these boats can be for anyone who is considering a life on the water!
If Saskia likes doing boat tour/reviews, that’s all I need to know! It is great fun getting into boats you would probably otherwise never be able to visit in person. Very cool
Frothing the review videos Riley! Seriously man there great this should be an ongoing thing you doing even after the tri just a day or 2 or different boats would be something the freshen up the channel and also maybe a way you could bank up some videos to overlay the week's youse need some down time?
11:00 that is both Heartbreaking and Beautiful at the same time. I just fell in love with that little man.
😃👍👍👍❤ Well Done RILEY and ELAYNA please do keep it up! Following you from Seattle, WA.
I wanna see ya on a pirate ship! Arrrrg!
I just love your videos, guys, brilliant as always!
Absolutely,  I like the boat reviews.
Riley's moves at 14:00 has a strong Beatles vibe! 😎
Elayna it's dol-a- finos
Thank you
Good old credit card captains. See them everywhere!!
Really like the boat reviews!
Great way to kill time while DaThird is getting the finishing stuff done, don't rush them, get it done right.  Love you guys.
Love watching you checkout all these boats can’t wait to see the next one 💜🇦🇺
You've worked for it!
Love having your perspective on the different boats it’s so interesting. I’ve really enjoyed this series. 🧡u
Love these types of videos, more, more, more 👏👏👏🙌🙌😎
Love the videos
I absolutely love seeing y’all going out on different boats, I’ve been really excited to see what the next boat will be, not quite as excited as I will be to see the new trimaran but all in all I like the boat reviews, it’s interesting for me!
Well Jell. Love the boat experience videos but I’m begging you.  PLEASE don’t ever show me the inside of every drawer and locker.
Absolutely love the tours.....keep it up!
Love this style of video mate. Keep em' coming.
I'll watch your boat reviews as long as you're undersail for some of it. That beast was a beauty. Peace
Love this series! You've made me want to buy a boat!
Loving the tour's
I love watching you sail these different vessels. Riley and Elayna you are both So Qualified and So Knowledgeable at All the Vessels you've been on, And so comfortable... And Lenny and Darwin absolutely love this lifestyle.... They are happy, well adjusted, thriving little boys. Well Done RILEY and ELAYNA, YOU ARE DOING AN AMAZING JOB TEACHING AND RAISING YOUR SON'S ❤ BLESSING TO YOU ALL....
Awesome video, keep em coming!
Love the boat tours. Have a great week and enjoy.
No more tour boat videos. I'm waiting for Vagabond 3. Finish the boat, set sail and live within your means. I didn't really want a rock star channel. I subscribed to Elay and Riles sailing from the Med. (+2 bien sur).
Aww Lenny made me want to cry 😢
Yes! Yes!  These trials on different boats are fantastic!  Please do more,,,!!!
Please don't tour boats long term...sail around the world
I'd love some technical education about the boats you're trying out. For instance: what makes a gunboat a gunboat? Is it the brand or something about the design? Love these videos!
how fast did she sail ??? share some numbers. thanks
Definitely do more 👍🏽 it would also be nice to get a quick look at some other boats in the marinas too if there something nice/different as we often get a quick glimpse in the video but not enough.
Like you touring but cant wait to see your new tri
Aww Lenny wanting to be brave and then admitting that he may cry again was heart breaking, bless his little heart. I love seeing you on all the different sailing boats, I've always said I live vicariously through you lol. Looking forward to the launch of SLV3, it's going to be epic!
Hi La Vagabond Family!!!  Loving this series of real life boat tours!!!  Boys are getting so big and so happy yall are all together.  Hi from Savannah, GA.  I would love to learn how to sail from your team.
I think Darwin has fallen in love with Tiffany him crying so cute when she was leaving
This boat is a beauty.
Love seeing all the different options out there. It’s educating.
The bay is so big it looks like you're in open ocean... crazy place to sail ...My kingdom for a "Gunboat '...
Top tier content as usual, these videos are brilliant and informative. I do love a raw unfiltered video every now and again too, more of them would be amazing.
Hey guys, what stocks are you investing in? One day.....peace....
Love the boat tour videos ❤ Maybe do them 2x per year ??
Keep on going while you can.  Seeing new things is always enjoyable.
Why is it called a Gunboat? It makes me think of a warship.
These videos are great!!!!! Keep them coming please!
GOD LOVES YOU & SO DO I
I absolutely love these videos. So informative from all aspects. Thank you. Keep ‘em coming!
Great to see you back on air it seems you have been gone a few weeks. Yes, definitely I love these types of videos.  I really don't think you should have mentioned Greta Thunberg in this video as she's an Eco Terrorist. If this little know it all was that interested in the environment, then she wouldn't be flying all over the world spilling her propaganda and or illegally breaking the laws of other countries.  Anyhow your sailing channel should stay sailing and in that you are doing a fantastic job!
Lenny at the end..... Perfect hahahaha <3
I just love this!!! Hello to the folks in Charleston, SC ~from Hilton Head Island, SC  Awesome
Not in the market for a boat now and likely not ever,  but love these videos! So many different types of vessels out there.
Commented on this one the last time you posted it Would like to hear more about the center indoor helm and sailabilty As for what I'd like to see you sail is a HH55 or HH60
At 5:35 is a cool view! 😁👍At 9:58 is a quick view of all that's on top of the mast.
At the end, what did Riley mean by "this is now a submarine"?
Love the pink sail...love you guys!! Your boys are beyond precious!
Really enjoy seeing the different vessels. Amazing video and amazing family
Love All your videos an also this. Seeing beautiful boats with your prospective is really nice 👍 👍 Now come to Norway and eat my wod fire baked pizza. Mmmm delicious 😁🍕🍕🍕⛵️😁
great stuff fare dincam
Here for it!!!!
Yes, love these videos.
You realize Gretta is a dude.  That whole thing is a total lie along with the show he puts on everywhere.  He is trained to do this stuff.
18:14 & 19:40 WTF is that person doing operating a boat like that?!? He clearly has no clue what he's doing.. Way to agressive on the throttle and carrying way to much speed coming in and going out the same BS.. Huge hazzard on the water he is..
Can’t wait to see you on your new boat, but until then, love the reviews.
After the cut and bandage you said "good night guys" and almost kissed the camera, before you remembered not to kiss the audience. Funny
Woo hoo pink.
Its only a matter of time before Riley is designing and building his own signature line of boats.
What happened to the boat you were having built in Vietnam? I prefer your old adventures..Not buying a boat myself, and could care less about all the different boats.. I would love to see adventures like you used to do, only now as a family....These  latest video's seem to me like you are searching for content....They are way less frequent than they once were...You are putting out the bare minimum to satisfy the Youtube Algorithm ?
Great video,  really looking forward to the Spirit yacht. Their craftsmanship is beyond next level. ❤ ⛵
Yes more of the same
ok that's a big reveal, SLV III on the water in a few weeks?
Still, the best channel on the inter Webby! :)
definitely love the boat reviews.. keep them up.
where is the new boat. i thought it would be done ages ago. cheers
Your kids are amazing.  Lenny when he cut his finger and talking to you is too cute.
Ugh if it wasn’t SLV…. I’d click off as soon as I notice it’s a betterhelp ad ….. I like SLV too much
Just finished work. Love your channel. This GunBoat is incredible.
Oh I just about cried for poor Lenny 😢
I think mustard and pink would be making a bright statement! It'd be hard to miss. Love seeing all these big boats and the adventures ❤
I've sailed on some cool boats, but a 57ft cat built like a Porsche?? Pure envy 😆
👍😊 rewatched just a credit to you two to where you are now ! Unbelievable !!
1st
You guys are inspirational,enjoy every video you guys make. 🍻
The Best Family 🤍
❤❤❤❤ you guys are awesome !
Envy. So happy for you 4
DAMN I'M EARLY
