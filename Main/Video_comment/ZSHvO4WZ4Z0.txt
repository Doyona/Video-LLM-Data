So where is the naked Luke part lol 0:05
I checked Emily's channel and the breakup video is not there. And she's stopped posting 3 years ago. Wonder what happened.
Cause you gay?
You have the best friends ever. You are so very lucky.  They are always there for you no matter what
Homie just naked 😭😭😭😭😭
So the big question is, how much money did you guys spend in the arcade to get the lava lamp?  Probably much more than you could’ve bought it for 🤣🤣🤣🤣but you had fun winning it that’s what counts!
i have an older brother i can't take my girlfriend with me to vist him, because we joke around like yall with a few a few bad words lol
What happened to the break up video?
At least you're not out chasing women.  I mean dam
Who got to keep the lava lamp?
where is this place, how amazing
Sorry to hear about your break up. You seemed good together.
LOVE Skegness!! glad you all had such a great time at the aquarium, and i'm so glad that you and Emily can remain such good friends, lifes too short to go round falling out with each other when you've made the decision mutually
Is there anything Ash can't do????
Staying friends? What's the point.
I'm a woman in my 50's and I love your channel. Blame Eddie Hall lol 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤠🤠🤠
Wow I would love to swim with the fishes 🐟🎏🐟🎏 🐟
And all three without masks - great!
You guys are fokin hilarious :D Cheers from Finland!
Ash adorable as always
I really don’t understand how Ash doesn’t have a girlfriend…
You are single cause you refuse to grow up..like a bunch of little kids in preschool.
lava lamp ey! it's kinda relaxing! enjoy it guys!
Yes, I can see why he's single
You are still young Nile same as Ash.. Take your time you can still get a hot chicks even if u are at your 50's. Enjoy life.. Hugs 🤗lots of love💕 from here🇵🇭
Single? I thought that acrobat gal was his girlfriend? I'm way outta the loop. Great way to get views though, doing a break up video. Lol. Just like Lissa and that David doback. Or whatever their names are. 🤣👍
Everybody has their own issues but you are a great guy who has accomplished so much and will continue to do so. Just try to not put more pressure on yourself then you need 💖 and you have a great family and good friends, that means a lot! Also if you ever need a random girl to join the group… I’m in 💁‍♀️ that diving looked too fun!
I want the 'we got back together' video. 😭
ok, I like Nile Wilson but this video was pretty crappy.
I just can't with you lot 🤣
Who is the tall guy?
Big feet = big disappointment! 😉
Sorry about your break up. That is always hard.  I want to say that it seems to me that you and Katelyn Ohashi have some wonderful chemistry together. I have seen two videos with both of you in them and there just seems to be a unique spark and fun connection between you. Perhaps you could consider the idea of pursuing something with her? IDK what her status is. You sure always seems to have a wonderful time together.
I posted this on emilys channel already, but wanted to leave this message here as well: I'm late to the news, but I only discovered you two recently, fell in love with the honest and funny content and now just saw this. I wanted to thank you so much for modeling incredibly healthy behaviour. Media is full of drama driven content and unfortunately, healthy communication isn't something that's common. A lot of relationships or problems are handled incredibly toxic and heartbreaking, because there are just not a lot of educational videos out there, whereas drama driven entertainment is e v e r y w h e r e... I am sorry that it didn't work out for you in the end, but I am so thankful for this video. Huge thumbs up for how you are handling this.
You guys are such amazing friends that most woman in the group is going to be hard to keep happy once she’s decided that she wants the relationship to be “serious.”  It’s going to take a really amazing woman to be serious with you and not get jealous of the time you spend with each other or of the amazing bond you guys have with each other…. Or that kind of relationship is going to happen later in life when you guys all have other big things occupying your lives. What you have is amazing, hold onto it for as long as you can.
Beautiful fish. I wonder if have to know how to swim to do that.  It's great to have good friends like that. I hope their friendship lasts forever.
you've a great editor mate. Nice vid
Watching this lot is honestly like watching my brother and his mates 🤣🤣 No one does inappropriate mum references like Yorkshire folk do 🤣🤣🤦🏻‍♀️
You guys rock together!!! 😊👍🏼
Duch, kid like behavior, an kind of inmature.. in the videos you never was in love. Treating her like a dude. Well that my reason for you.. oh an i think you are gay but dont know it
Ok... Hold up.... Your medal is in the console of your car!?🤦‍♀️ 😆
love skeggy aquarium
Ellis is awesome!
The breakup made me sad.
It's like Regular Show for the fuzzy dice 😆
Is there anything Ash can’t do?
I'm dead watching this. You 3 pillocks dickin about is the funniest thing I've seen in ages🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Hope you're heart heals soon🥺
You guys are young male energy at its best.
aww maaaan.... such a bummer to watch the arial hoop video a few minutes ago and think whoah. . . they're totally gonna be a thing . . fast forward to the VERY next video I see is this one and you've broken up?!  ugh.  What a bummer.
Y’all so young!  You have many adventures ahead of you.  Keep enjoying life and hold out for the right person.  One of the biggest decisions in life.  Take your time.
What is Emily’s channel? I am new
I think Ashley would make a wicked boyfriend! 😂
not sure what the challenge was for this video but i think ash won!
Because you post crotch shots of all female athletes in your promo pictures. That’s said a lot about you. Not good. You don’t respect women.
I'm sorry for your breakup. Hang in there.  Remember that you don't have to be in a perfect mindset to be in a relationship. You just have to commit to it and put in the work. It is possible to be on a journey of your own and at the same time give love to someone else. Once you get married you'll realize that there are gonna be lots of ups and downs and the two of you aren't always in the same place mentally. That's where the commitment comes in the picture. 😄 I really hope you ger back together some day. I really liked her.
***So Why is Your Condo/Bachlor Pad so MESSY **#Niles** Wilson?????*** YOU Were Always SO Clean. ***And NOW A Pig Sti!!!!*** SAD I Have followed YOU for Years too. ..
Nile in his socks?  In an arcade?  Cool.  4:50
Dude is 12 years old...thats the answer
Was Ash on the void?
Who CARES mate move on chin up
Maybe it is the recording but I am usually really good understanding accents but having a really hard time.....so turned it off....try it again tomorrow!
You guys are crazy! It was fun watching.
I don't believe for one second that Ash has trouble finding a girl lol. He's so hot, funny, and seems like such a nice guy. I'd snatch him up in a second 😉.
Ash Watson is my dream man! Why is he single? And why is he straight? 😢 😢 😢
Love ya. It’s okay.
Ash is so awesome!
I honestly don’t understand Hell Ash is single. I’m a lesbian and I can still tell that that is one beautiful human being
Here we goooo   I LOVE YOU ASH, CAN I BE YOUR GF?? If not it's fine😂, hope you'll find a nice girl someday😘
Just goes to show no one looks good in a wet suit, lol. The most muscley dudes also look bad.
oh come on, u gotta come to mexico for diving
I love watching the adventures of the Three Musketeers. Always puts a smile on my face. You are all phenomenal friends
You wanna end depression! Unplug yourself from MSM.
The only logical reason is that his ego and standards are to high. I see no other option🤣
i'm in love
Sorry but I would never have allowed all of you to dive. John was a braver person than me.  You boys will grow up one of these days.
Why do people assume we need to be in a relationship to be happy????  Damn could have phoned me!!!
Well now I'm confused.... he said their break up video was "$%#t". So are they on good terms or not? Sounds like he is bitter.....
how much is the bearcub in the window? great vid and glad you guys had fun
I'm surprised you have any friends
U are single are u serious? Emily?
yall fricken killin me ty i needed some good laughing today!
'The REAL Reason I'm Single...' is because Dick and Pussy have a 'Shelf Life' and ours was up.
It's so weird, but your videos stopped showing up in my subscriptions, and they haven't been recommended like they used to be.  I hadn't watched a video in like 2 months. Youtube's been doing some weird stuff.
Omg. Just stumbled across your videos and literally crying with laughter. Then your getting ready to dive, and I’m thinking I swear that’s skegness aquarium, 20 minutes from my house!
ok but who is the camera man because he is cuttteeeee
Well ur not single anymore😏😏😂
He TOO DAYUM BIIIIG! 😂😂
Thanks behz for letting me find this channel. Cracking Vid
Please can I tag along when you do your next aquarium/arcade/fun run. Pretty please with a lava lamp on top. #iwillbuyyoueachalavalamp and personalise them. ☺️☺️☺️☺️⭐️🙂🤗😊😋🙂🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
lol ill put in an application to date nile and Ellis is my favorite :)
I'll be your new gf 😜
Hangin with the boys! Looks like a fun day. No drinking?
Where do I apply to be Nile's girlfriend?!?!?
Ash is so nice 👍🏻 and you are nice 👍🏻 I love your videos 😍
Have you got an A45 AMG
Missing Emily already
Go have fun with friends. Concentrate on yourself. Dont think about her and cut contact. Dont call her, dont answer, dont message. Dont enter a new relationship. After some time go meet other women, many women. Still dont enter relationships. Just have fun. You will learn a lot and become better generally and of course with girls too.
How does he have his camera in the water
Hi bro. My name is gourab chakravarti. I am from India. I am 14 years old male gymnast. I am your big fan. Love from 🇮🇳. Please reply. I will be waiting for your reply.
Because your gay.
Niles,  you and your mates are a riot . I hope you make more of those videos.
Niall you are a young handsome and successful he will find a beautiful woman one day and be very happy. Just keep living your life until you're ready to settle down nothing wrong with that.
People don’t have to wear masks in the uk anymore?
Omg the accent. I die
You have best friends that's great.  If your happy hanging out with your friends that's enough.  When you're ready, patient the correct time the lucky lady you'll meet. Just don't rush, get know her well before you fall in love. Some people don't need that when they have best friend.
I wish you played on both teams....
I hope there wasn’t a baby shark inside that egg when you caved it’s walls in 😳🤭 Love your bond, it’s nice to see! ❤️
The Juicy Orange in a wet suit. Lol 😍
I live about 1 hour away from SKEGVEGAS, also you've not completed it until you've swam in the murky brown ice cold sea xD
Lets be clear ...... I only understood about 70% of what they were saying in this video lol. But I stayed til the end.
Absolutely sign me up to be Ash's girlfriend!! Especially with this tache ;) Love from Hungary! ❤️
Best vlog ever.
Not just because your smart?
But you have/had a girlfriend right ?
This video is absolutely exhausting to watch
Nile a bit thin on top. Hair transplant incoming?
If I wasn’t happily married, I would date Ash in a heartbeat. Lol.
Skegbobs 🤣
We love you guys and wish you and Emily the best. Breakups are never easy x
I looooovvee looovvee this video and your energy omg can not stop laughing pls do more videos like this u guys are really having fun and so do I 😂🤟💃🤺

Brother I am writing to you from Chile to tell you that I understand little English but just seeing them makes my day keep it up Please, if they put subtitles in Spanish, they will I would appreciate greetings, they are geniuses from Chile Brian.
Thank you for being you and for being open
Is because your vain AF
No corona anymore I guess
Good vibes 🤙
Move over World, Commonwealth and Olympic medals. We have a new winner of the Skegness arcade lava lamp... 🚀
I was actually offended when I thought that we weren't gonna see the lava lamp xDD
You w... to much
3M are back !!! Yeeeah !!!
Ellis is our fave😉😁
Do you not have to wear masks indoors in the UK now?
Nile, there was a time when ⁷you and Em trained in the same facility but didn't know each other. Then, you met, fell in love and it was intense. Then, quarantine loosened and it came time for you two to part ways for now because it's what's best at this moment in time.  Almost, simultaneously, you had to announce the end of your Olympic career before you were ready. You had to walk away from the largest part of your life as far as the way you train, eat, sleep and approach things mentally. And, you had to do it, certainly not the way you wanted to retire, but you had to do it very publicly. That's an awful lot to deal with along with having a girlfriend, who's a rockstar in her chosen career. Yes, it would be awesome to see you and Em perform together, for the Circus, to bring that fire and energy you two share to the stage. But, you've got limitations due to your injury. I think that with the people you know, you could build a pathway around that injury. The body is a miracle and it can be reshaped, retrained to do the same skill set. It would be hard, like starting over from when you were four. Obviously, you'd progress faster and faster once you've mastered the patch or work around, but then you'd be an elite gymnast again and YOU could tell us that you're training for the next Olympic games or you've conquered your demon and you're retiring from your first love. You've got to learn to love yourself, the good and bad, or ALL your relationships are going to fail. You don't know what the future holds. There may come a time when you and Em meet again, at the right time and a more mature relationship grows. Personally, I could see the two of as coaches, her elegance complimenting your technical skills to bring about a well-rounded, well-balanced athlete to compete in in the Olympics, if that's something you're interested in becoming.. As far as, why Ashley doesn't have a girlfriend, if he's BETTER at everything in the relationship, THAT could be the problem. Or if Ashley is gay and hasn't met the right guy. Tom Daley & his husband, Lance Black, could introduce you to a nice guy. Whoever your significant other is, there's going to be a lot of 3 Musketeers as who has are going to have to approve! I'm looking forward to the sh*t show that follows.
Good Luck for the future
I didn't even watch the video and have no idea who u are, but no one gives a shit
https://youtu.be/rAWsiOeo5V0
This was such a funny video - I loved this
'That was fucking epic'... We just swam with sharks... Come on lads you just swam with some tiddlers 😂
I recently broke up with my job. For some reason this video made me feel better. (Also - sorry, but yeah, I don't get how Ashley is still single, either).
its been a hot minute since I've watched Nile but I was literally dying laughing within the first 3 minutes of the video starting!
That's not what they mean by plenty more fish in the sea lol.
Awesome video! Love that u was at skegness!
This was soooooo funny 😂😂😂😂 exactly what you needed

Gayyyyy
Melt

To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
Nile trying to win a lava lamp:  “this has turned into like the most intense competitive situation in my entire life”  😂😂
I thing I belong to the pack!  Been single for 28yrs now. Lol  Greetings from the Philippines mate!🤣💪💪💪
Had a great time watching you guys
Awww you guys make my ribs hurt in a good way 😂 I'm a busy mum of two I watch your channel in the evening after a long day its great you have a great family nile and your friends are true 👍 ( plenty more fish in the sea mate) lol x Keep bring the videos on i was wondering if you could use the backing track the shark tale but back flip to the beat or claps of the song bit random but hey lol chin up charge the mountain 👌🤓
Ash for The Bachelor!
Enough about Ash, let’s talk about Ellis! Love seeing him in the videos♥️ He adds that extra bit of awesome. I hope you guys do the video with Em before she goes back like you mentioned, would be fun to watch.
Alright that is the last time we saw of those guys. I will be taking over the channel now. Hahahaha 🤣😂😆
Love seeing the Three Muskateers doing what they do best: having fun,  keeping it real and bringing a smile to us.
From the title I wasn't expecting such a feel good hilarious video. Loved it! "Skeg Ness? Completed it mate!" hahaha
The ticket restocker: goddam competitive olympians...
This was the best way to start the day ❤️ u guys are hilarious
I really was hoping to hear that it was because Niles is into guys
No Regrets! hahaha
Heart felt sympathy to Nile on your breakup . However your friends will get you through the tough times. Loved the schenanigans in the aquarium. Looked like lots of fun. Hard to believe that Ash doesn’t have a girl friend...
What about planning a great cruise on Anthem of the Seas? My cruise was cancelled last year!
There is lots of fish in that aquarium!
Skegness just called their game hall is closed due to a ticket shortage 🤔🤣🤣
You and your buds sure seem to have fun together. You guys may enjoy going to a Theme Park (Water Park) and ride big coasters/water slides.
I'm surprised Ash the Bear didn't eat any of the fish. I mean it's what they do.
I'm surprised there is something Ash can't do.
Aww Ash you will find the right girl one day :)
I laughed so hard 😂😂😂💖💖 You guys just made my day, thank you!
genuinely one of my favourites so far
A couple.of comments peak.flow .... is crap !! Or mine is off the chart freaky..... I get 730 on a bad day average is 770. If your Asthmatic how can you use scuba gear? I've been declined from using it !! And inside the aquarium how come no masks ? But thr guide was wearing one ?
Don't be so sad...I know...thats impossible!  Just remember who you are.  You f7ck8n amazing!  That who you are! An amazing man!
You look like a fun gang to hang out with 😍
Ellis is my favourite!!!  Loved the video, the fun you have with each other makes us all smile
Nile, you are THE BASIC brit. Sunburned Face, Sportshirt, Tattoos, and creepy shoes 🤣🤣
You guys crack me up 😂😂
Lemme see camera man again 👀👀
hello future bf
Can we all admit there's really 4 musketeers and he's totally under represented?! Love Ellis!
Is there anything ash can’t do 😂
You guys always make my day :D  And huge respect for you and Emily. It’s tough especially when you’ve got so many fans involved. Wishing all you all the best going forward!
You guys are hysterical!!!!
I’ll be your gf ash @saralynnantes 💋
Hilarious
Don’t u just think that guys in their mid 20s would have at least matured by now.........SO DAMN WRONG!!!!!!!!! Love the content 😂😂
Ash IS the best!!! Always there when you need him, Nile
Guys you rock at spontaneous fun. Nial tough times for you and Em but super nice to see you guys being so open and honest. Take care of your heart. Smashed this one lads. Don't change or stop the fun times rolling xx🤗😘
Ellis is by far my favorite in these videos lol editing always 💯 and commentary also amazing when in person
You are definitely my fave trio on YouTube, but Ellis is kinda cute too! And seems like you all have fun together!
Elliott....keep an eye on him for us please...he's gunna emotionally crash in about two/three weeks time...
Damn, you're making me want to go to Skeggy now
You guys are awesome 👌
Okay, the man with the camera and the editor ... frickin' good work!
Good to see a video with the Bear 🐻 Too😘😘😘
You three are seriously so freakin hilarious 🤣🤣🤣 And Ellis Keep your distance I think they are Catchy You don’t want to Get Sick with the Crazy Disase🤪🤣🤪🤣🤪
So is this still a child friendly channel? Doesn’t seem like it
I'm truly sad that your relationship didn't work out. You seem to suit each other so well. Stay blessed💙
That was so freaking funny 😃😃😃
Love this trio hahahaha !!
Legends boys. Pure class.
where is the "U ARE THE SUNSHINE IN MY LI-IFE".............
Oye, you have the steering wheel on the wrong side, WTF?
Reflection in the glass wasn't blurred. ;)
What a fun video! It's nice to see you all out of the gym and having some laughs. I hope to see more of these types of videos. Cheers!
who cares she prob getting railed out
Why didn't they explain why Luke was naked on the balcony?
Ash 😍
Nile single, pubs are open.🌊
Ellis is my favourite. Ok. 👌
I haven't watched in a while. What's the name of the cute one?
Great video. You are on a roll with this one.
Finally on the D?? 🤗
Corona much
Stop with the stupid clickbait
Ur single bc ur not gay if u were????? You’d be swept up in a ❤️beat
Jeez you lot are a handful! 🤣 But it's awesome to have such solid mates who you can belly laugh constantly with. Thanks for the chuckles. 😘
I think it's for the best they didnt mesh well.  Emily was too silly, I dis6nt feel like she was her best self.  I mean come on she is an accomplished acrobatic performer and she was an idiot around Miles.  I think he was intimidating unintentionally, and he was a bit abrasive with her.  I dont think they were right for each other.  So I say good for you both for being adults and mutually going your own way.
as if you were in skeggy hahaha that's so near my home town lol
I would love to see you take on Blackpool arcades for a day! Love the vids keep them coming
Omg nile i could of met you that day  i live in skegness and your one of my idols and so inspiring you even spoken to my boyfriend the one with the ginger hair he is constantly telling me hows yous were talking to each other its made me so upset lol but hope you had an amazing time and hope to see you soon 🙂
I needed this laugh, today at gym wasn't very good, I felt like I really wasn't good enough and I hate that feeling 😔😭😪
Ash is ubba cute, we miss Emily xx
DAMN LUKE......WHAT A NIIICCCCEEEE BUTT AND BODY!!!!!  But I ABSOLUTELY LOVE seeing you 3 together cause you guys are so funny!!! 😂 😂💗💗💗  Also wondering why I can’t click the caption button?? If you can change that, it would be awesome cause sometimes it is hard to hear what is said so I like to click the caption button so I can read what I didn’t hear!!! 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
Three big blokes? Where’s the third one? Nile your tiny (6:54)
Hello from Boston, Massachusetts! You're at Skeggy! I visited there in 2019 while we were staying nearby at Skendelby Manor for a friend's 50th Birthday!
This video had me cackling with laughter.   Thanks for the laughs, Nile. I enjoyed how you presented something as simple as hanging out with friends at an arcade and swimming in a tank. Often we forget that even as adults, those moments can bring such joy.   Bummer on you and Em, but glad to see you keeping busy and committed to working on yourself and staying friends. Here’s hoping this next chapter is more significant than you can imagine, and you fall deeply in love with the person you become as more than just Nile, the athlete, or Em’s boyfriend.
Here for you Nile. Wishing you both the best, I loved you guys together but I do like the change in content. You tubers go overboard with their new girlfriends lol this was the content we needed but again I hope you’re happy, take care of you!
Ash is the best, but so is everyone else 😅
Ash actually IS the greatest (sorry guys <3)
Lol bloody assume
Can’t believe I didn’t I’m in the back ground lol in my work cloths lol god dam it 🤣🤣🤣
Well, geez - I thought from reading the tag-line that Nile was ready to come out of the closet. Silly me...
I'm 2 mins I and crying with laughter 😂😂
The REAL reason I’m single... I spend 100s of pounds on a 5 pound lava lamp
You four are the definition of LADS 🤣
Great video Nile, it made me laugh and cheered me up. You and your friends should take up scuba diving and make videos searching for GO Pros, Phones, Wallets and other things people loose in the water. Nile, you and your crew are the GREATEST. Best wishes to you and your crew always.
Ohh la la..... boys your 🍑 are callipygian 👀😍
Not easy dating an athlete or drummer from a metal band. You got this dude, when ya least expect it she'll or he will show up. ♡♡
Love you Nile, awesome video 😁😘
Anyone else wanna see a pick of ashes mum? 😂👌🏻 great vid guys unfortunate about emily you was great together. Keep vids coming mate
awww, what an experience! I've always wanted to do those experiences at the aquarium  near me.
more of these! This was hilarious
Love these videos
We want more of josh 👀💪🏻
That diver Josh is proper fit isn’t he
This was like watching a bag of squirrels trying to escape a small box... 😂 faf!  On another note, I'm glad you've got the lads looking after you 👍
small town bois in a big arcadee
Great video guys. Loved it. More like this please the banter is great.
Do something like the last seen with everyone in hoodies pulled over their faces, darken room and Lava lamp.
well that is to bad.....i thought you were both  happy
I knew this was going to be clickbait, but I clicked anyway, and I'm not sorry
👊🤘
Breakups really are shit, and sometimes doing fun things helps get your mind off it. But give yourself time to process the change as well... the wound will heal better if you let it rest. Best wishes from across the Atlantic ✌️
Pmsl the ending is epic 🤣🤣🤣 i loved this what a day out my idea of my perfection xx
There’s plenty more fish in the sea 😉
The underwater portion reminded me of the movie “ Fifty First Dates”! Love seeing you guys having fun. It helps me to pull out of my depression. Thank you to you all!
Friends are the best
Let's be honest the reason nile is single is cause hes secretly gay!!
🧡
Nile...whatever you do...do NOT...EVER get involved in smoking vaping nor anything...DONT WORRY about being fitted in some local crowd... YOU are MUCH BETTER THAN THAT! 👍🏆🎖
This was one of the most chaotic things I've ever seen. I loved it.
Good a love the 3 musketeers vlog, laughing all they way through. To be fair Nile, we all love Ashley so you are just going to have to lump it 😂
Hello humans
Omg you were in Skegness I love 10 min away ahhhhhhh
Saw the video on Em's channel the other day, and it's nice to see you both being ok and friendly after that. It can't be easy, but if it's for the best then it's all good. Good luck to you both on your future adventures!
Sweet Nile not wanting to pee in his wetsuit... let it loose, buddy.  There are two types of divers: those who pee in their wetsuits and those who lie about peeing in their wetsuits. 😉
I absolutely loved watching this! Totally cheered my day up! You guys seem like so much fun :)
Where can I apply to be Ash's gf? 🤔🤔
The lamp cost them £75, you can buy the same, at a discounted price of £5.99.
Bruh
👋🏼HI retired Rhythmic Gymnast subscriber here and I have to say this is one of the best, most entertaining, quality videos I've seen in a long time🏆🥳 Nice job 🤸🏼‍♀️

Fair play to you (and Emily) for being so open, candid and providing some much needed joy during this past year in particular! Best to ye all lads ❤️❤️
