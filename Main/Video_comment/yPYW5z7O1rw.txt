T pain was the first to do this type of music give that man his flowers now ,but R.I.P moe3
I thought I had found the love you gave me. Right after you left me. and then there I go, I gave in too soon.   My soul. Can’t take no more.  I deeply searched. I can’t let go. A thug still needs some love to hold.     No I’m stuck, listening and reading voice messages. The mornings you gave me so pleasant and, now that your gone. I lost it all. Can’t make this up. I done fucked up. But your the one I wanttt    I can’t deny, with color, you filled in my life. Wishing it could have continued on. So I’m thuggin it out. Ain’t letting tears out.   This pain in me. Is in this song. If this is it , if this is all. Take care is all I ask of you. Don’t ever change
I cried like a baby when I got the news , felt like you was my homie R.I.P Mo3
"4 THE LOVE" U HAD A BIG FKN HEART❤3 WISH I COULDVE MET U!!! ONLY PREACHER WHO COULD MAKE ME HAVE A LIL FAITH😇!!!PREACHER 4 THE STREETS!!! U WILL BE MISSED 💯BUT NEVAH FORGOTTEN LONG LIVE MO3

Hook undefeated
you can't tell me that the powers at b did not have something with the killing of mo3 because look at the talent that this dude got from G.o.d ain't no way that he wasn't going to be out in this public getting all this publicity ,I'm just trying to rap but I can't like that n**** mo3 , he told us in his interviews that he was heaven sent, I didn't believe it but now I go to his catalog, all I can do is get bent, I don't know why I'm drinking though, because he didn't even do that s***, or smoke, he just had that natural flow, (that would have been off beat) anyway r.i.p to da 🐐, most of them wouldn't know, about this hard ass rapper from da mf norf, if it wasn't for dem haters dat couldn't hang wit O, O is for Osama when he fucked ur baby mama , I'm not pushing pettiness, but was dem niggas carma, sike I'm out
We miss you 😭🖤
I miss so much I wish I could see u I love u so much I have a picture of u in my room love u mo3 I hope baby mo3 can push u up

He got a whole album done like this cant wait
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Dammnnnn I can't believe they dropped this I waited years 💯💯💯💯
No you forgot to pick up your homey he laying on the highway
