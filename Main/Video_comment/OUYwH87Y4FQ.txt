was a who has better eye liner fight
hahahahahaha
pat audio is working
yes voice over guy
we all make mistakes
the gogos
with nirvana he played before that
Well it was one of the most memorible nights of my life the 1st time I saw them play this live. Sun was setting, a few balloons floating over the crowd & a life changing moment for me  lasting a lifetime. My Hero will always lead me back to Dave Grohl's impact on me that night. 2018🎉
23:21 real stuff
Dam’ you guys are really good 21:40
Gotta love all the people huh, the band, and all the people
Dave you’re really good man
Dam’’tis F’n good
Wowzers I love the band! Watching emotionally.
Pride can't be stolen dave. Sorry 😂❤🎉😊😅
Sounds kinda like nirvana (skin and bones)
7-1-2025, Tuesday,. It's not the Foo Fighters without Tyler. Dave you should have done other projects w the band mates under new name
Everlong has always been my favorite by them also, I’ve been listening since the nirvana days a day one foo fighters fan….     29:00
You guys look and sound Awesome ❤😊
Great!!
Wow nice to see an accordion and organ make it back into a performance! A rare site. This song 'Skin and Bones' is partially (Matt Johnson) The The like. Never heard this song before.  Was looking at the Wikipedia page on the Troubadour. The list of acts played there is grossly short. Why they listed only certain acts I don't know. John Lennon, Harry Nilsson and Ringo Starr were thrown out for drunkenly heckling the Smother's Brothers once! LOL!  RIP Taylor.
Anyone here in 2025?
I think I might be your newest subscriber! Im 56 years old and have heard your songs throughout the years, but never actually listened closely. I have been stuck in this rabbit hole of realizing just how good your music is! This video is bar far the coolest video I have ever heard! Im a new/old fan!!
if what I heard at the troubadour is that Brett M was hookin up with Doug W to pay rent
Miss t ... great  set list.
Laying here next to my best friend for nearly 15 years- my dog Hank... he's happy and bright eyed but has health issues, these songs are just killing me... so raw and emotional..he probably won't last long, days, maybe a month or two.. thanks Dave and Company for the moments and your art..
Riot at the GoGo Show? Dancing In A Lesbian Bar, too!!!!
Love that drum beats. RIP Taylor. Sound Engineer thumbs up
too good acoustic T... ugh im so late but satisfied... pray foya sir T
Pubblicità a metà brano 🙈
I love Dave bro, I literally felt the adrenaline flow to my limbs with that jumpscare
"Everything always feels this real, when it's the @FooFighters." Love you legends!
My father has gotten up there in old age. These songs have got me very emotional. HERO got me balling
Delicious work this..
Power Dave yeah 🤟🎇🎆💪🤟
Bitter sweet finding this. There's the hero, playing like we all wish he still was.  💙
where do you come with the concertina thing? Portugal?
Love😊
holy shit. Wrote the song during Nirvana and now we hear it  jamm unplugged like it was at the Bridge  School benefit Concert
The best song ever, Times Like These.
Over the top
Harmonics of democracy .
Rip curt cobain
this is just fantastic
👍👍👍🤘🤘🤘
This is just one of the best live sets the band has ever recorded, so intimate and personal. I would love to see them on Tiny Desk but Im so eternally grateful we got this performance while Taylor was stilll with us. I cant put into words what this band has done for me.
Just re-watched this one again. Love this show.  Good to see Taylor again.
👏👏love❤❤
❤ But we Still have David Eric Grohl ❤😊
wjay are you  guys doing on 1 6  2024?  Bubba bash  , hope is what remains to be seen.
Que saudade de Taylor meu Deus 😢😢😢😢😢
GoGo riot at the Troubadour! Those were the days...
Nope
Dave Grohl seems to love Skin and Bones. He plays it every chance he gets lol.
So long Taylor. May you Rest in Peace, Legend!
Too alarmin' now to talk about Take your pictures down and shake it out Truth or consequence, say it aloud Use that evidence, race it around There goes my hero Watch him as he goes There goes my hero He's ordinary Don't the best of them bleed it out While the rest of them peter out? Truth or consequence, say it aloud Use that evidence, race it around There goes my hero Watch him as he goes There goes my hero He's ordinary Kudos, my hero Leavin' all the mess You know my hero The one that's on There goes my hero Watch him as he goes There goes my hero He's ordinary There goes my hero Watch him as he goes There goes my hero He's ordinary
12:46
These Days has a harrowing feel now. Vale Taylor. Great set.
I'am

Congragation, Home , skin and bones. How do you do it David? Just a man who plays in a band, and loved his mom.
That WAIT FOR IT!! at the end is wonderful haha
Još uvijek srce boli
This version of Everlong haunts me
not me crying when he asks tyler about his first show there
The piano in My Hero is beautiful.
come again to Herodion, Athens, Greece, it will be a dream come true! ❤
NATO PER FARE MUSICA 🤩🤩
fan - you are a local Northern VA - in Boyds - DC area.  Thinking about going to see ya in Columbus.  Road trip. Friends in Columbus.
You’re so much more….   The music must go on!!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤🎵🇧🇷🇧🇷🕊🕊
Eu ouço foo figthers desde a adolescência, senti uma pegada anos 70, ou foi impressão só minha!? Maravilhoso trabalho. 🗿🍷
F F The best band
RIP hawkins :(
🥰
Foo Fighters kept Rock and Roll alive ... Thanks David and his awesome band ... Rock and Roll lives on cuz of them..
When I randomly steal a car in GTA: 15:12
Con un acordeón? en definitiva los Foo son lo mejor ❤‍🔥
PAT FUCKING SMEAR EVERYBODY.
♥
genius
Band of the century...
I was about to die from an overdose in my apartment in Miami all alone after so many different drugs…I went to grab my phone and I couldn’t even see what I pressed and out of no where YouTube started and this song played. My heart was beating out of my chest and then the room turned white and I felt at peace. My heart slowed down and I survived. Jesus Christ is real people. He saved my life.!!!
RIP Taylor Hawkins <3
Dave we love you... Miss you NIRVANA
I'm so sad for my kids...they will never know what it's like to see a real rock band live. Today's "bands" will never hold a candle to this stuff. This year would have been my son's first FOO FIGHTERS show.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏💯
Love
Beautiful 🙏💗🌈
marcello tahitoe
It seems so awkward with no cheering after the songs ends.🫤
Chris looks like he’s trying to look like Taylor. 😉✌️
Pat was in a semi-trance in the back of the room when called upon.  Wonder if Waits got the best of Pat, or if Pat messed up Tom a little and doesn't want to dig up what was a drunken low. Ha!
I've been listening to Foo Fighters since around 2004 and don't regret a second of it. Not constantly unfortunately.
Art is evolution.
Everlong has ALWAYS been my favorite FF song, it's the song for me & my oldest younger brother...RIP Taylor, a part of me died that day too....
Simplesmente demais😁
How is the audience so quiet??? Amazing show!
Damn Taylor’s drumming here is amazing.
Pat Smear vs Tom Waits Hahahahahahahahaha
Perfect
Forever my favorite band 😍
It was bittersweet to listen to this. I can't imagine the pain you all are going through. RIP Taylor. 😭😭😭
That accordion solo ❤
Damn, T’s fills on My Hero we’re pretty special.
Rami on the accordion. Love.
The Foo Fighters are helping to destroy live music with their Covid restrictions and yet they have the gall to say Save Our Stages!!
All these acoustic version songs are amazing. But.. See Dave sing Time like These  without anyone behind the drums like last  3rd September 😢😢
pqp muiito fod@
Dave your songs are so beautiful sung acoustically.  Love them all.  My husband is terminally sick and this made me cry.
It’s my late Father’s birthday rn, so I’m feeling some kind’a way; the Tom Waits moment saved my tears
Taylors kit sounds amazing
I Love the FOO!  So happy my daughter turned me on to them and we were able to see them live in Sacramento in December of 2021.  I'm still depressed and very angry at Taylor Hawkins for leaving his family and friends behind.
Talk about a lump in the throat. RIP T.
Xps insulation
Much love from OZ 💙🌹
God, I miss Taylor….watched Shane, his son, tribute this song playing his dads drums in Wembley Stadium…one of the most emotional moments in rock…he was awesome 👏 RIP Taylor..you were a great guy
Taylor Hawkins was not a junkie so stop the bull.
Miss you forever, Taylor ♥
¿Ya les había dicho que los amo; Foo Fighters? ❤️💫🍷❤️😍
We miss you Taylor. The world world misses you. Such a great loss.
La pelle d’oca ❤
Sarah Come Home
much hero 4 me !!!
Trash band
The lyrics are really meaningful. I love the songs on this.
An incredible concert.  Loved every bit of it. What an awesome bunch of friends and talent this band it.
Like soo much acoustic.... Every song... I hope much dong... Spirit always.... Come to Indonesia... Maybe holiday.. Oky dave... I love you.. Be healty... 4 you.. And the band too...
I wonder if we would have ever heard this if Kurt Cobain lived...
These Days such a great song..underrated.
❤
My thoughts are with you Dave ❤️
I wanna know more about this fight Pat had with Tom Waits!!! WTF?!?!  How do you get in a fight with Tom Waits?!?!
Dave dose the best Tom Waits impersonation lol 😂
Taylor Hawkins 🖤
These men truly love each other. The loss of Taylor … 💔 Rest peacefully you beautiful soul.
Genial venga a tocar en venezuela estado zulia aca se quedaria a vivir aca de lo genial que es esta tierra zuliana venga yaaaaa yeaaaaa
Jesus loves you and He died for your sins
i'm here just to see taylor again....RIP taylor
Such a beautiful performance! Thinking of Taylor. 😍 Love from Canada
I love how Taylor plays These Days different to how he does it on the album
could listen this non stop, play-replay-play....
Well actually Greg from Badlands did work securtity for Poison around that time! If you know Chasson then youll laugh
Foo Fighters , the heros i look up to and love so very much <3
How refreshing to listen to the accordion, such a tipical instrument from mty country , Portugal :)
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
my hero souds perfect !
Had this on in the background doing some other things on the internet - had to stop what I was doing to come watch and just soak up the beautiful, moving music floating through my headset <3 The banter in between songs just lovely little grace notes <3
These Days just makes my heart hurt now .  RIP Taylor , you truly were the heart of the foos .
its times like this thank you and the donators
"I'm, I'm a new day rising; I'm a brand new sky to hang the stars upon tonight." Bloody Brilliant.
Great great stuff….. God bless you Taylor 🙏
Please check out my cover of “Everlong” here -> https://youtu.be/5pHPjcR_dxA
It's heartbreaking to listen to "These days" after Taylor passed away. May he rest in peace
this accoustic version of These days 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍, in fact all the songs are each one better than the other ones :)
Pretty remarkable how that sound comes from just Dave and his guitar.  Simply amazing…
Not to sound like a huge asshole but.. There have been a dozen huge acts that have performed at the Troubadour since it first opened its doors. If each band would donate just 10k on their huge fortunes to help this place out they would be fine. I don’t get why we the hard working common person who have own bills and other expenses to worry about has to help pay for this. Again I don’t mean to sound like a dick but when 1 person worth 320 million asks others to help it’s kinda……..
i love this, dave's voice comes out much better
Unfortunately a Taylor has passed Away and is now Drumming for Freddy and Lemmy K. and all the other big Stars in Rock'n'Roll Heaven
This was great!! Such an awesome band for so long! We will miss you, Taylor!! Beautiful personalities in this band ❤
I wish this was pressed on vinyl. The sales can go to the Troubadour. Every professional recording of the foo fighters needs to be available to own. We need this now more than ever. RIP Taylor ❤️
Sounds awesome
Thank you so much for your music over all these years. And this Performance was so amzaing, so emotional. It means a lot to me.  Thank you Foo Fighters from all my heart for all the awsome memories. Rest in Peace, Taylor, the Hawk one. You are so missed.  Greetings from Germany.
AMOR ETERNO.❤
Love you dave,feeling for you at this time x
I feel sick with grief
Perfection❤
“If everything could ever feel this real forever…..” This is the best 33 minute session.  It’s just so devastating to lose Taylor - for his family, his friends and the band.  Rest in beats and peace Taylor.  You will forever be a music legend.  💔💔🎼🎼🥁🥁
I think Skin and Bones would have been a good Nirvana song as well. I can totally see Kurt singing it.
SIN DUDA SU HUEVO DE ORO DE LA BANDA
This performance is beyond awesome. It has helped me really value Dav’s moving songs.  But being able to so clearly see Taylor’s drumming in action is mind blowing.  My God - this man is going to be missed!!!! Also love what the key board musician is adding to this concert.  One of the most emotionally satisfying 30 minutes of my life, despite the grief l am feeling for our lose of Taylor.
Is there a crowd? If so they are shite.
It is indeed times like these... Stay strong gentlemen!
Everlong is among the best songs ever written.  Seriously.  It comparable to the "Long and Winding Road."    Thank you Dave.  RIP Taylor.
RIP TAYLOR
that last strum scared the crap out of me lol
Se loco bom demais tmj !
This band alone could save this stage many times over.
Uau 😍😍😍
rest in peace Taylor ❤️  you will forever be missed
Rest in peace Taylor Hawkins, a legend to us all. Forever in our hearts x
RIP Taylor ❤️❤️❤️❤️
This acoustic performance is just the best, perfect reminder of the magice & talent of all these guys when they are together, just brings tears to your eyes in times like!  If everything could ever feel this real forever If anything could ever be this good again The only thing I'll ever ask of you You've got to promise not to stop RIP Taylor, fly free!
This is amazing. Prayers for everyone.
Hang in there, guys <3
Yeahh... dont ever mockk Tom Waits this is why its hard for me to relate to Dave Grohl cause hes such a fucking douche bag
God I love this band. Im actually so scared to never get another chance to see them live. Was supposed to see them in May. I love u T, rip.
🖤
🎶👻🧟‍♀️💚☠️🐰
Rest easy, Taylor. <3
Taylor, Taylor, Taylor, we already miss you so much! We are sad, very sad. RIP
These days hits different now
I fucking love you guys. And we obviously will miss Taylor so much, forever.  LA MUERTE NUNCA NOS VENCIÓ, PORQUE TODO LO QUE MUERE ES PORQUE ALGUNA VEZ NACIÓ ♥
RIP Taylor
So Fugazii, So sorry about your friend Taylor.
We'll miss you Taylor 😥
I was thinking Fuck the Crowd Sucks there then Dave said "We Should Applaud Ourselves "
Pat smear fighting tom waits ffs haha 😄
RIP: Taylor Hawkins
:(
RIP Taylor….  ❤️
amazing performance my deepest condolences R.I.P
RIP Taylor. So glad he was healthy and drug free when he suddenly died.
RIP Taylor. You will be a legend forever
10:16 Imagine being dedicated Foo Fighters' most beautiful song by the band itself.
❤️
RIP TAylor
RIP TAYLOR 25-3-2022
Crying my shit out here. Rest in Peace, Taylor.
Rest in Peace Taylor. Such a great drummer!!! F
I was watching this at the end of These Days when I my wife told me Taylor died… when I looked back at the beginning of Times Like These and he was gone.    I’m so sorry for the loss of your brother.  My heart bleeds for you and his family.
RIP Taylor you will be sorely missed
I'm feeling every song in my Bones, my soul...  In time Time like this hoy learn yo love again
RIP Taylor ;CC
☮️
times like these, best acoustic performance ever
This should be in Spotify dear looooord!
Loving this performance of Skin and Bones.  Dave's vocals sound great, and Taylor and Rami just killed it!
Love acoustic shows... You, your instrument and your voice. "Nothing else matters"...
Couple of things…  That skin and bone cover was fuuuuuckin sick  Taylor is ripppin those drums   That is all
One of the most amazing unplugged I've listened to!
I was just cooking lunch for my 84 year old mother, listening to this. She loves it! Thanks guys!
Wicked!!✌❤🙏🇨🇦🥰
Dave should have stayed a drummer
where is Chris N.&??
I agree
Tom Waits didn’t know who he was fucking with! Good on you Pat!
Amazing version of Everlong.  That song has gotten me through some pretty hard times.  Hell, the Foo Fighters have gotten me through some REALLY hard times as of recent.  Lost my dad, my stepsister, and my uncle (who used to take me to see Foo Fighters back in 97 before I could drive).  I needed to hear this again tonight.
Roll on June, see you in Manchester 🤘
How the heck did I miss this performance?!  So good!
https://youtu.be/aK1R0Ouh_D8
stupid idiot foo fighters made their crowds get vaccines and then we find out these hypocrite losers didn't get the vaccines themselves and they all got covid ,..FOO FIGHTERS SUCK
such a beautiful soul <3
this skin and bones version changed my world right now...
Hi from just outside London.....fantastic....favourite lyric ever - the only thing I'll ever ask of you, you gotta promise not to stop when I say when...boo-i-ful (cockney).
SOS.
I would love to hear a full concert like this. Thanks for sharing this. Such a great band. ❤️
I <3 u best, BASSMAN !:D
Our country is changing.  So much uncertainty.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Perhaps Taylor should spend more time on the kit , he could be better at it than political statements.
Gotta see them live as soon as the times like these are but a memory
That Rami solo on Skin and Bones is <3
Awesome
You guys are the best! I hope someday i will see you in concert.
OMG I sooo felt that. 🎵
Is that David Koresh on keys?
Dude.... Skin and Bones has a distinct The Doors vibe to it....
I've played the troubadour and it was one of the biggest shows we had. We played so loud, tried so hard to make an impression, and this is an acoustic stripped down set kinda of place to them. "Wouldn't it be cool if we played the troubadour? This tiny little place with only several hundred people. We could play an acoustic, quiet set. Really a big departure from the massive arenas we're used to". Must be nice.
Dave sure can handle that guitar and vocals! So sexy and talented... Thank you Foo Fighters for these killer tracks!
Brilliant. It sort of reminds me of Nirvana on MTVs Unplugged. Fucking quality.
The break from Live performing has really helped Dave's voice. But when they do get back to performing, they really need to cut songs like " The Best of You" out of the set list. It's such a strenuous song to sing since it's constantly screaming. Would help his voice least a little longer!
A única coisa ruim é querer estar perto de vcs de novo rsrsrs...amo
É difícil mas espero vê-los de novo live
Its time like this to learn to love again
💖💖💖💖
Banda maravilhosa 💖 viajei 40h de ônibus pra ver vcs! São especiais
<3
It's a normal thing to love that guy?  :P
Dammit these guys are in 5th place 3-22-21 for the Hall... that pisses me off ... 16 Grammys... should be first ballot ...
Beautifully done!  Anyone know what acoustic Shiflett was playing?
I thoroughly enjoyed this, especially that version of My Hero <3 Love me some Foo Fighters
Best FF recording I’ve ever seen
first, Skin and Bones, this different version (the lower stuff in the middle of the song) bro that is sick! I vote for recording this in the 606! ah and same thing for this Times Like These -Church- Version too.  With the Neve sound mixer of course. Cheers from a sound engineer who is still waiting here in France for the clubs and theaters to reopen. We, my wife who is a doctor in a covid department and I, find the time way too long. Take care folks, the end of this shit is near (I hope)!  16th march 2021.
33:36 love that
plays on my inside, my heart for times like these and those long ago.love ff to the max
so pro~ fun inside trub LA...roocked around when i lived in torrance 1976-77
The last strum scared me
Can't love this enough. Thanks FF!
in 98 along with my precious wife who has past on to the other side left my side way to young 36  miss her every day and always will. Larry Broad
foo fighters are the the shit best band iv ever seen in concert no lie.
Dave’s voice sounds really good here. Also I would love if they do another acoustic tour
My boss called me when i was hearing the songs ... But i didn't answered. It would be disrespectful to this Masterpiece.
Sanfoninha choradeira 🤣🙌
I’m boycotting foo fighters who I once liked can’t believe they support a fraudulent presidency it’s been proven big time can you say voting 🗳 machine fucked up stilling votes for Biden 🤔
Almost like an mtv unplugged session!  Thanks foos!
Foo fighters are turning into one of those bands  that are way better as time goes on & age continues to piss off! Like Johnny Cash/Joe Stummer/the Descendants etc
They are real good here! I saw them live on a festival years ago, and they were obviously drunk or some other way out of it. It was a real bummer. But i still love the recorded songs and this live is awesome <3
Your my hero Dave Grohl, Learned how to walk again thanks for opening my eyes Kenny Jones from Wexford Ireland Brother :)
No crowd, yet this was still an incredibly intense live performance. Really cool and for a great cause as well.
Playing chess for 30 minutes and needed some music to accompany me. Very glad I found this. Love live versions of songs. Love Foo Fighters. Love this!
CORRECT COME ON LISTEN   GIVE DAVE CAN NOT BE ALL PLACES HRH PRINCE CHARLES DONATES FO OLD BUILDINGS JUST FOLLOW  PROTOCOL
GREATEST BAND  WILL WELTHY PEOPLE GIVE A CASH SUM MATCHING IT.
SKIN AND BONES WELL HOPE HER HEART PLUS INTERNAL    PARTS
Merry Christmas Fellas ! 10:22
Oh man, I wish my dad was a live to see this. He and Doug were good friends.  I will post this for my mom. I didn't even know this existed.
Dave Looks Like Lemmy From Motorhead (Lemmy 2.0 for the new generation) Both gods of metal!!
Well done Dave and Co. That version of times like these is as good as I have ever heard. Thank you
Times like these I wish I lived in LA
Jesus is my only hero  He die for me.
damn that acoustic sounds sweet.
MAD LOVE FROM IOWA!!! #SAVEOURSTAGES
🤘🤘🤘👏👏👏
Still need help
Kurt
Showzão!
https://youtu.be/rMaaLXMCfBA my 6 year old rocking out to Foo Fighters 🤘🤘🤘❤
"if everything could ever feel THIS good forever"... well... I hope not.
This version of My Hero is the fucking bomb
one more sorry..... the stars are apon tonight, fly away
he said"don't say it's OK" the last heart beat....not yet
commercial breaks are the fastest
so to my liking. it really becomes beautiful here...12:15
I've been soo loving this band
badass poison tribute
My hero, what an amazing performance. A standing ovation FF 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼
Legends
Udahnya ngagetin anjir
one more thing on "skin and bones".....when they took of into the jam, I kept trying to anticipate the chord changes, but they kept going in "didn't see that coming" directions!!!!.....Loved it
we also enjoyed the featuring of Rami .....he's an awesome addition to the band!!!!!
Dave Grohl is an incredible human being!
I needed this right now. Thanks, Foos.  ✌️💙
Fuckin hell... how can you not love this band..
I want 20 dollar tickets for the rest of my life. I'm not asking for a SAG card yet. It's Denise! That was Cafe LA and I was probably sitting on Brett's lap. *He's not going to marry you*, his manager said in the ladies room. I'm not lookin' to get married, I said while putting on my lipstick in the mirror next to her. That's that girl Denise. Omgosh it's so real and authentic. I wasn't trying anything, there were just no more chairs. It was Cafe LA! 1992 God-willing. Go Go's Riot at a Punk Rock Show! I'll take it kindly ha .
What an awesome little show. The sound is one of the best mixes in all liveshows on Youtube (the vocals are crisp and nates bass is deep without being booming). Would have loved to have the spoken bits a bit beefier though. All in all wonderful. Have pledged to niva.
Of course Jaffe rips on the accordion!
I love skin n bones!
Love them in any style at any time in any mood (of mine)
What's up the terribly placed Ad breaks in the middle of 'These Days' around 21:40?! Moments like that make me wonder about the internet. I was totally groovin on that tune, then, Bud commercial buzz kill!
New song drop by Ola fresh https://youtu.be/L3DRFhC3GpA 👆👆👆👆👆🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I am here for that legend to post track listings 👍🏻
A new live gig ,It's like someone restarting life ✌✌
I hate it when people compare Dave Grohl to Jesus. He's great, but he's no Dave Grohl.
Fucking A... full stop
I am in love with them
Great sound balance guys 🤟🏼 very pleasant to hear
This is so powerful and sad at the same time. Here in my town, there was only one venue left for us to go to enjoy the few bands that came here. I remember to spent a lot of time there, just enjoying the music, with my friends, beers, jokes and a ton of experiences. Even myyself played there a few times. They announce their bankrupt a few weeks ago so... there is no more venues here to enjoy live music, to create new and magic experiences for all the new musicians. There isnt even a new generation of musicians in my town so... I guess it was something that had to happen. It's just so sad for me seeing the places where I grow up closing like this. This awesome performance just remind me of all of this and I have to share it. Thanks for reading and take care out-there.
Youtube seem to have recently increased their audio quality, as it was always a little muddy - this however (and the new Shame Shame video) sound AMAZING. Add the stereo separation of the instruments, pure acoustic joy!!
I absolutely love Skin & Bones. Great to see it performed here
haven't seen you this year. miss festivals, miss seing you guys in concert. thank you for this. that's heartwarming.
This acoustic sound suits you real great, guys...
Play Gloria
Dave's voice and the keyboard parts kill me with their beauty. It shows how classic these compositions are – awesome songs that will live on way beyond the lifetime of this band!

I came here for the music but now I find my mind wondering...I can't help but wonder how bands, like the Foo Fighters, decide which comments to respond to or even which comments to like...since there are obviously people who jump video to video trying to get a response...the only answer would be to not respond to anything at all.  Anyways...Enjoy the tunes!!!!
Came here after you sucked it up on SNL.
There goes my Gyro???? Is he hungry? xD
طيز
This version of “times like these” was powerful. well done Dave Grohl.
Daves voice, despite what some where saying....has only gotten rich and more mellow. If he were a T.S. bev he would be getting very collectible right about now. Really, band sounds great can't wait for  what comes next.
My Hero!
Say what you will about Chris D'Elia but that man sure can play the damn keys
Donated from the UK. Good work guys.
You guys are the best!
MTV unplugged next? : )
Can I program a light show to one or two of your songs while I learn how to program a GrandMa3 OnPC if it's downloadable and post it on my channel since I'm unemployed and about to lose my shit? Rock on!
Gracias por existir
Привет из России!) Вы крутые!
🤘🏼
I never knew foo fighter needs keyboardist until i watch this. Rami Jaffee addition to the member really fill the spot
This was amazing. And they always look like they're having so much fun.
What a great version of my favorite song 'My Hero'.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Special stuff - Mr Grohl will go down as a musical legend forever - take in the joy of seeing this music in real time in 2020
Best performance of Times Like These, ever.
Adoro esta Banda!!! Sucesso sempreeeee!!!!

Foo Fighters <3

Wait, the Troubadour is a real place?  I thought Billy Joel just made the word up to make it fit in "Say Goodbye to Hollywood"
Kinda gutted they didn’t play a poison song 😂
HOLY FUCK! how are ppl not screaming into their SCREENS. BRAVO! what a show guys! fucking slayed it  it really sucks there is NO audience :(
Very respectfully, and I think the Foo Fighters are one of the best rock bands in existence... why do they always end their concerts with Everlong? They have so many amazing songs. It almost helps to tag them as the “Everlong band”, but they’re so much more than that.
I'm so sad I want to play live agaiiiiiiiiiiiin
TRUMP2020
just had time to watch this. WOW! love this band
I wish I could figure out what acoustic sticks Taylor is using here.
Taylor rocking the concert toms
PRETEND I’M HOLDING A CARDBOARD!!!  I’d like a five minute video call, pleeeeaaase!!! I have an idea to share with you! it’s not a fkn song, relax.
*Here’s a tip for Android users to avoid watching adds:* Drag the red dot to the end of the video and then play it again. Done.   Ok, I helped you. Now help me out, please. I gotta talk to Dave in order to tell him about an idea I had. Just a 5 minute video call to see if he likes it or not. Any ideas on how I can get to the man? Anybody?
go to the mass foo fighters. bored of them just came here to say Silverchair was better and they split. Foo fighters are sooo boring!
Man I would pay a lot of money to see them in a venue as small as the Troub
Thank you!
My dad died last week....  - TIMES LIKE THESE... hit me hard with the tears, Dave.
It's so dark on this stage you can only see Taylor Hawkin's grin like the Cheshire Cat.
endorsing Biden...wtf?!
BRASILEIROS: Eu tenho uma ideia foda para a banda, preciso de 5 minutos pra falar com o Dave Grohl e explicar tudo, mas já faz 2 anos que não sei como chegar. Podem ajudar? Sei lá, deixa um like aqui ou comenta. Queria chamar a atenção deles de qq forma. Valeu!
Hello from Turkey. Would you like to listen to the video where twin sisters voiced "Times Like These"? https://youtu.be/_3sn7SPLW3c
The whole concert is amazing but this version of Times like These ( which is my current favorite FF song)  is so pure and moving there are no words... I really hope one day I can see you live. Keep up the great work and thank you.
Was an idiot for not watching these guys live in Toronto. Hopefully things go back to normal and they perform live again!   Great Set guys!
Foo Fighters selalu bikin saya terkagum-kagum tiap kali denger musiknya setelah sekian lama dianggurin.
Joe biden? Realy......?
I won’t give up...it’s been TWO YEARS, I still have an idea and I gotta show you guys...please, gimme 5 minutes to explain it! Send me an email!!  backward.guy@gmail.com  I’m sure you’ll like it.
that was a great version of times like these
Cool song - check out: @manchao.official
Fuck this snit# FF IS BEST.
that mellotron is the touch i didn't think those song could need fuck it, those version are golden.
Nirvana is way better than this trash.
I hope the band can hear all the applause they're getting through the screen.
LEGENDS!
Missed you guys you've just reminded me how much I enjoyed your music.
Wow nice.. checkout on my channel
Absolutely amazing. Music is the best drug... Greetings from Germany 🇩🇪
The silence is eerie.
Thank you. Needed this.
Who is coming to carry the torch of these Rock Gods. No one that I can think of even comes close.
Tom Waits is gonna be pissed. I would imagine he’s not a big foo fighters fan anyway on account of him being the worst musician ever. Love you Dave!
We don't often hear Rami Jaffee get such a feature.   I like it!
Watching from NL, Canada
Love Foo Fighters  too much♥️♥️♥️
Is that a bandoneón in Skin & Bones? I Love its vibe!
Dave vc e sua banda são feras demais!!!  Grande abraço do Brasil!!!!
Pat Smear is 61. Think about it.
Chris Shiflett envied Taylor Hawkins hillbilly style for a long time.
Fuckin Incredible....Very Rich.... Thank you guys...for the ripples of inspiration.
Way to go YouTube. Take a concert which was given as a call out to support the arts in the most dire of times known to modern man....and crap on it by monetizing it and placing ads in the middle of songs....I hope you’re donating every penny to a save the arts organization of some sort.
Skip to the last few seconds of any video let it complete and hit restart and bada bing no adverts
Best version of Everlong, so relaxing 💖
siempre
My Hero : 3 notes on the guitar, goose bumps all over my body and tears in my eyes. Damn I love this song live.
Question for drummers; it seems that the band isn’t playing really loud based on the conversation between Dave and Pat. How come that the drums don’t blow the rest of the band away?
Great set. Can’t wait to see them live again
Just “FREAKIN LOVE THE FF!”!!!!!!!
Oh Ya!!!!!!!  We “NEED” Live Music!,,,,,,,
did prince secretly give dave the song times like these.?
Great performance Dave along with The rest of the Foo Fighters!! Loving you from Cannon Falls,  Mn.  Im a performer too. Solo guitar and vocals along being a good drummer like you Dave. Love all your talents!!!  Thanks for the fund raiser!!
Long life nirvana
This year has been a hard one for everybody. This year for me has been difficult, my partners father died of a terminal illness, and then 3 weeks later my best friend died in hospital of an illness I cant pronounce, which causes internal bleeding in the throat, and in his case, caused a cardiac arrest. He was only 49. One of his favourite songs, that we played at the funeral, was One of These Days. Ive loved the Foos since forever, saw them at Ozfest in England on a small stage mid afternoon, back in the early days. So, to hear this song at the funeral, made me lose it, for a few seconds, and hearing this version, wow, so good, but more wet eyes. Not sure why I'm telling you all this. Music is the best thing Humans invented. I actually made a short video for my buddy. We went to see Foos at London Stadium few years ago, and I used my phone to record My Hero and Learn To Fly. I was pointing at Dave during My Hero, so I turned the pointing finger at a picture of my friend in the video. If you would like to see here is the link https://youtu.be/HMKI3SNpXCI Lets hope we soon get back to live gigs. Stay safe everyone, thanks for reading.
Listening to Everlong, the same sensations down my back as MTV Unplugged
Back to Brazil, pls.
That version of "times like these" is the most hauntingly beautiful version I've ever heard of a foos song... hit me square in the feels.
Excellent.  Gentleman making amazing music together in 2020.
An accordion solo on the first song, Skin and Bones!
This version of everlong hits more close to the slowed and reverb edit, i loved👌
I loved how Chris played a bit of "talk dirty to me."   Seeing as how "Poison" has become a dirty word here in the comments.
Please come to México, I wanna see you guys, the whole damn team of Foo fighters!
Perfeito❤
Foo fighters are amazing !
Wow, no me esperaba esto, grandes FF. Los amamos muchachos ❤
Piano in “My Hero” ... AWESOME!

this is for Pat Smear....damn bro finally
If Kurt Cobain were here as guest I suposse he'd say '' Shut up'' to Dave's intro .
I could listen to them jam and BS for days on end. Love all these guys.

I've missed the Foos.. one of the best shows I went to back in 2017.
Damit I miss live music!
Let me know that you are here before a million
Where is Nandi?
Piece of art. No more words ,for shure.
Simply the best,
How sad is this.. Not the music and the the foo righters are awesome. But that we are losing our live platforms for musicians to perform.. this is pretty cool but also kind of sad to hear them talk about these venues. It’s almost like they are talking about someone who is on there death bed in the next room. And keeping there voice down so they don’t hear it.. Sorry about my bleak outlook. But it is sad 😢 (have my own personal stuff going on) but this made it a little sadder. Maybe in a good way. I hope you guys reach your goal  🥅 thanks for the stellar performance✌🏼
Really good sound engineer/editing
Taylor looking like a skinny hulk hogan with that blond hair and black beard combo
It's so weird with no crowd and so sad. This new way of life is awful. We need music in our lives. It's what brings us together. Man!...I love the foo's and absolutely amazing live!!. Wishing you guys all the best.
Funny last chord !!!
The fact that there's no running around needed and no 'YIHAAAA' , ' HERE WE GO!! or ' OH YEAHHH'  at the end of all Dave's vocal lines makes u realize what a great songwriter, vocalist and front guy he is. Best Foo live show on YouTube in years!
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Can we talk about Rami absolutely killing this whole performance. Dude is awesome!
watching for the 3rd time
Why does Taylor look like nWo Hulk Hogan?
Does anyone know how I can get a true story to Dave and the band. Their music literally saved my life! It happened after One By One came out. I've been trying since to get it to them. Thanks
That's got to be the version of skin & bones
Best part 33:36
That was the best version of Everlong i have ever heard and I have heard you do it live :-)
I think the natural reverbs in the room added a great touch!
So awesome. Loved how I got to see Nate playing heaps. What I’d do for a Nate Fender. Thanks
fantastic show and amazing song choices :) Love the Foos
Incrível,  fantástico lol
( *Romans 2:4* ) "Don’t you see how wonderfully kind, tolerant, and patient God is with you? Does this mean nothing to you?

The God who created *the world and everyone* in it. The God who saw what *he made* and it was good. The God who saw *Adam and Eve* fall into sin, and the God who sees everything you *do, think, and say* every moment of every day. ☑ God Endures.

But while you fear God, you can also *trust in his Son, Jesus Christ, who died* to forgive you of all the mistakes you make here on earth.

Everlong is an amazing song, part of my life’s soundtrack, thx Dave ur band is amazing
Best performance of Skin& Bones I've ever seen!
❤❤❤
thank you, Foo's!  hey Taylor, i always knew bundle sticks could hang with a power player like yourself!  No matter how hard we swing them, they'll only go to 9!  Peace and love to you all!  You are our hero, Dave Grohl!

Can't all these super rich rock and pop stars just cut a few checks and save the venues themselves instead of asking regular ol' people to donate? Lots of unemployed people right now. It seems absurd. Like Seinfeld asking for federal funds or grants to help the stand-up comedy clubs in NYC. Jesus Christmas man...you are made of money Jerry. I'm sure you could write a check that would help every comedy club survive for a year or so and you wouldn't even notice it was gone from your bank account.  I call bullsh*t on so many of these "fundraisers " . Between Nirvana and Foo money, I'm sure Dave could solve the problem easy peasy for this venue and many others.

fantastic this acoustic live from Foo Fighters
I came here just out curiousity; only a casual fan...but man "Times Like These" really hit hard
Times like these, oh man
times like these gave me goosebumps like hell. what a beautiful version, thank you!!
can u play how i miss you sometime thanks..
I have a crush on Times like these 💙  Sounds spectacular
someone give pat smear a microphone  !
Dave Grohl for President!
Very good! Thank you very much Foo Fighters 🥁
the accordion just hits the troubadour
Oh my heart...There goes my hero, Times like these... Three years ago my brother bought my Foo tickets for my birthday. That was a great concert, but this one is transcendent. I bet you can hear this in Heaven Pete. xo
I really love this accoustic concert. Cool music and cool chat !
Reinvents Times like these; again.  That is so good.......
Times Like These... goosebumps all over my body. What a chilling, brave and powerful performance from the heart. Bravo.
Suara yang hebat Dave dan Foo Fighters akan dan selalu menjadi yang terfavorit🌹♥
THIS WAS MUCH NEEDED FOR EVERYONE !  Thanks Foo Fighters 💯 I miss seeing live music
Bravo FF!  Thank you for the all the great music
nice #known
Muito cretino quando a gente ta curtindo o som e a propaganda vem no MEIO da musica, em vez de pelo menos passar no final.
Foo U all !!
When you realize this is all a jojo refrence
This is the best 33 minutes of music ever!! Introducing our 3 and 7 year old to this great music, they love it as much as we do. Thank you for brightening our day ✌🤘
is that Reggie? rock? Fusion?
I am so glad I found this video,  here at my neck of the woods, SOROCABA in Sao Paulo Brasil, there's a whole of of people who simple love FOOFighters ,  Dave, God bless you !
This is so awkward (without an audience)... like everything else right now... and it feels exactly like what we need right now... ;-)
Rami Jaffee has been an excellent addition to the group.  I mean, he has been ever since he started popping up as a touring member.  But man, listen to him here.
wow es tremendo el show, soy de Argentina y fan de la banda.... muy bueno. CONGRATULATION!!!!!
Amazing just Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!  thank you guys please keep playing and  Not to stop when she says when!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Great Performance, especially Times like these.
I´m not crying, you are...fffffffffff******ck! Argentinian crowd is singing along with you, guys. we're still doing it from home...
Cannot compete with these guys! The integrity,the passion and love!! You guys constantly reset the bar! Love you guys coz you never stop amazing your fans thank you!!
I've listened to 'Times Like These' countless times but this one hit hard like it was the first time...his voice sounds as clear as ever.
ive seen you gugs live at mancher in 2018
Great songs!
Lights off headphones on eyes closed feesl like live
This was dope AF. Made my day. Love these boys!
This is going to be my Saturday morning soundtrack for a very long time. Thank you Foo Fighters for keeping music real...and for fighting the Foo
Xich qaysisini gapiga chunmadim🤣🤣🤣🤣
Simply LOVE this! 💙 Thank you Dave and guys. Supporting Save Our Stages!
Acoustics versions of songs like My hero or Times like these sounds like a pop boy band.   I miss so much the 97-2005 era when the band was not so popular
After long time he used to be the Guy on the Drums by Nirvana he definitely found his own Music Style! To long I heard in almost each FF song typical element's Kurt used to write simple songs! Now Dave is an other musician, he is where I wished he would be 20 years earlier! NirWana
wow
😍😍😍😍
Man! I’m so much looking forward to have you in Berlin next year after it has been postponed this year. Hope that “everything” changes a bit until then... Thanks for doing this session!
so fun!
watching this gave me goosebumps
Love these arrangements. Rami just brings a whole new element and flavor to these songs.
amo uma banda!
🤘⚡🤘⚡🤘⚡
So, does Dave ever need to introduce who they are anymore? And is it wrong that I just want to sit at Dave's feet and stay there...like everywhere..when he drops the kids off..just be known as that chick who sits at Dave's feet and hands him whatever he needs?
Man that band fall in on "These days" is tight. I had to go back and listen a few times. Every musician spot on with their timing...
The best version of Times Like These I have ever heard ❤️
FF fan until i saw the 864511320 sorry. my love of music does not come before my love of this country. taylor, you think youll be better off with sniffy joe, good effin luck. @davestruestories keep political opinions out of music. #TRUMP2020
I love what Rafi has brought to the band. His fills are like sugar sprinkled on your cereal.
Omg, this is the best thing that happend to me on quarantine♡ Thank you foo fighters!
youtube, I am always skipping whatever commercial you have hoovering over these long videos. I get it you want to make money, but one advertisement should be enough.
Thanks Foos for helping us get thru this sh!tstorm called 2020
Lovin Dave’s guitar. Can I have it?
Foo Fighters are already eligible for Rock and Roll Hall of Fame class of 2021
❤🦘🐨
The ad placement is disgusting.
These Days is my fav song, it sounds amazing acoustic
Song nirvana dave
Yo, for a second a thought Chris Shiflett was Taylor Hawkins...
LEGEND
Quanto comentário Brasileiro hahah amoo ❤🇧🇷
The accordion lead break was sic, lol @ Brett Michaels. Love the foos
From Greece with love !
FF needs to be Rock n Roll Hall of Fame ASAP!
"It's times like these you learn to live again..." That sure hits me for 2020
You guys sound great 👍... don't age either, like vampires 😎✌
i like the #sosfest
Donated.  thanks for the great performance
Por  alegrarme la vida una poca más. Gracias.
Cool!
I think we need a live album in this style.
Great show and stories guys. I have only driven by the Troubadour, never seen a show there until now! Maybe I will play there someday yet!
Que espectacular,Foo fighters🎸gracias por estas canciones tan hermmosas,que llegan en un momento justo🤘Gracias🤘
#uruguay #montevideo #seppenoscreo
Hold on, why does this have over 100 dislikes. They're the fuckin Foo Fighters there shouldn't be any dislikes
Sorry Rami, Dave doesn't care about your Troubadour experience.
I can't  begin to express how important music is the me and how much I miss live music. thank you for doing this and I hope we all make it to the next show
Love you guys, sending love from Australia 🇦🇺
Got no $$ jst Love. ☮ 🎶 💜(a.k.a . Velvet Bones ).
You sound amazing. Thank you for sharing your time, stories and talent. Everlong... one of my all time most favorite songs.
“Times Like These”perfect song for these crazy times. ❤️
My first and only gig at The Troubadour was in November 2000. I saw Backyard Babies supported by The Yo-Yo's. I met Burton C Bell at the gig.
The Troub!
The Foo's ar4e a band that will never forget where they came from and it seems they will always try to help keep the traditions alive.
If not then definitely at some point they will be in the rock n' roll hall of fame 1day. In 30 years time, we all should be thinking about the foo's like rock gods like the who & the likes. I supposed we fans already do.  But it won't be until there r no more.  That the rest of the world will truly appreciate what they have achieved. & how gr8 the really r.  But it does not matter 5mins or 500 years in the future.  There music is goin 2 live on to inspire new generations. Because the music inspired my life.  Thanks Foo fighters for ever single thing!!
Music is so important theses days more than ever. & Foo's make everything better about the world.  Get lost in there music & forgot about how messed up this world is.  Foo fighters always seem to no matter what put the music first.  Ever time I hear them, first thing that comes to my mind is my so grateful, privileged to be alive. & Grow up with there brilliant fantastic unbelievable music 🎶👍👌🤙🤘🤟🤗  If the foo's r a drug. Then I have been a really big high. Ever since I first heard them back in 2002.  Thanks Foo fighters for every single thing U ROCK!!
dave is really trying as emcee, only chris is playing along.
loving the piano part of my hero
Everlong makes me cry. This was a lovely version. <3
Dave and the Foos ROCK.
New https://youtu.be/OTOnvI72Kyo
I need this versions on Spotify NOW 😍
Ok this is one of them preformances that hits you in heart, Dave is sounding as good as ever and  this brought goosebumps & tears!!!    Wow 🙏🤘
Thanks for the positive energy, guys.  This helped lift the clouds for a bit.  "These Days" in the mix brought back the joy and pain of being with my fiance, then losing her to lung transplant complications.  Which I've never properly dealt with 4 years later.  Each time I hear it I heal just a little more.  And cry.  Again, thank you Dave, Chris, Pat, Taylor, Nate and Rami.  You continue to be among my favorite humans.
I love Pat Smear.
This has been like a Skin and Bones concert, amazing!
What a wonderful set. Reminds me of the time I attended Foo Fighters'  "In Your Honor" acoustic show in 2006 at the Pantages. It was intimate. It was nostalgic. It was everything I had hoped for. It was beautiful. It was like watching VH1 Storytellers in person. It was fucking magical.
FF Forever !!!! Thanks guys this was awesome
The jam on Skin and Bones is fantastic!
Outstanding! I donated! I LOVE LIVE music!!!
That rendition of skin & bones gave me such doors Vibes
Que baita show! What a great show!
Jesus these Bud Light Seltzer ads in the middle of songs...
Dave/Foo 💞 Me forever.
Love you guys ‘Take my Breath Away’  💋💋💋💋💋
Vibrant, gorgeous looking hips and legs, what a huge impact. Listen, Maybe Mabel Ridenbel's method may also help you as well. At minimum try googlinng her to see if it is something which is sensible to you for getting rid of varicose veins as well!
What a great set...phenomenal...
Let them open!
Who clicks dislike in this video? 120 persons, they're...  People who agree: Like  |  | V
This was just what us Foo Fighters Fans needed right now. Amazing!
The last strum around 33:37 scared the shit out of me. Classic Grohl. Intimidate with love <3
fantastic 33 minutes. thank you guys!
Maravilhoso
A fight with Tom Waits??   ...I can just picture circus midgets, flamingos, trombones, pirates with hooks for hands and skillets being involved!
HÁ... 33:38
this literally brought tears to my eyes...
Great set and ty foos.Love you guys!!Wonderful cause
Rami Jaffe on the Keys / Accordion is the real hero here!
Oke, I have known this for several years, but this confirms it: I need a Skins and Bones gig 2 or whatever you wanna call it.
Setlist:  Skin and Bones My Hero These Days Times Like These Everlong Learn to Fly  e vão se fude q eu n vou por a marcação do tempo
That was great!  I miss live music so much.  Thanks FF.
What a surprising tender sound you got guys. My hero was perfect! Strong and tender at the same time. Big hugs for you all!
Chris looking very 2003 James Hetfield 🤘
You guys are THE BEST, THE COOLEST band in the F*&**&#$ World!! No, in the galaxy!!!
1:50 skin and bones 10:20 My hero 17:47 these days 23:00 times like these 29:04 everlong
Ah, ‘My hero’ dedicated to Pat tore me a tear 😭
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WOO
Save our Sound.
Thanks 🙏
Pure magic
THIS TOAD BAND SUKS& STUPID NAME 2.....DID A CRAPPY JOB INDUCTING RUSH.JUST RUSH WANAB'S
Cápsulas en inglés..... Brutales como siempre. Thanks foo fighters.
I'm so sad that it was an acoustic concert :(
Incredible version of ”Times like these”!!!!
Love the Crematorium version of times like these...    Everlong awesome as ever....
Thank you Dave and Foo Fighters for sharing your talent. Its just amazing to see you guys perform in acoustic. More powers to you'll 🤗
Mr Grohl is very much a hero to me...he is so positive...much like his hero Paul Mccartney...hope for the future is a sure sign of true sucess.
Great version of Skin and Bones!
Wow that’s typically that kind of show that makes Foo Fighters one of the best and generous band in rock 🤘🏼🏴‍☠️
That ending tho 🤣
I've known about this band for the longest but for some reason never heard any of their songs until recently. EverLong is probably my favorite rn but wow it's just so good! Such a coincidence that they're tending right after getting into them 😂 Great performance!
Timothy 4:1-5  "The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron. They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth. For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving, because it is consecrated by the word of God and prayer."
Those who disliked this video are people Pat Smear has had a fight with at the Troubadour.
lovelovelove
Maravilloso🥰
Thank you Dave and everyone in the band.....This little show meant a lot to me .......Much Love ☮️ 🤘
Hey Dave, I’m a big fan and was wondering if I could have your black guitar.
spectacular performance
I don't know how to feel.  Happy. Sad.  Lucky?  Welcome to 2020.  Started my first band @valleyzeros in December 2019 and feel lucky to be creative be but sad not to play that music on stages that need us as much as we need them.  I need you... All of you...
Was kinda hoping the band would kick in during Times Like These or Everlong. Still exceptional as always.
🇧🇷🤟🏾♥️
MY DUDES ON TE TRENDING PAGE LETS FUCKING GOOOO
Killin' it, my doodz! Greetings from NL, Canada!
Es jodidamente grandioso!!!
We don’t deserve Dave Grohl
Thank you for being fucking awesome guys!
the foo fighters are fucking epic!  been to many shows and they never disappoint.  I remember one of those times, Dave sang DOA with us in the front row of the audience at key arena in Seattle. Dave can vouch.
i’m so glad to exist in a world with Foo Fighters in it.
So I donated why not the foo fighters just donate and write it off
I think it would be kick ass to have a Jack Black and Dave Grohl duet on "Skin and Bones". To me "Skin and Bones" sounds like it could be a Tenacious-D song. Anyone know if that has ever been done?
Absolutely amazing!
Sem dúvida,  uma maiores bandas da história,  minha banda favorita, por causa deles ,eu aprendi a tocar violão para tocar Everlong, música fantástica
And to think that October last year they visited my country for the first time ever and I had my dream come true, listening to them in first row, just some meters away from these legends.
Foo fighters and Rise Against was the best in the #sosfet
Here before the JoJo fans.
Foo Fighters the best !!!!!
Been a huge fan of the foo fighters for about 20 years now. And watching this set just made me appreciate them even more. you guys are amazing.
Where is Nandi at?
Thank you Foo Fighters! Awesome set. We’ve been listening to you since you started the band ❤️💜❤️💜❤️
I really need to finish jojo part 6.
Is this a jojo reference?
Who the hell is PatSmear? 😆 😆 😆 lol
Dave has the best voice in rock and roll, and I love the new arrangements to hear these beloved songs in a new and even more intimate way ❤️ thank you Dave Taylor Pat Nate Chris Rami for always bringing out the best ❤️ Foo Fighters always and forever ❤️

DONATION ISSUE: Using Chrome/Google Pay which I normally have no issues with, and have repeatedly had the CC verification fill in only to be followed by the "not a bot" check box and red letter warning instructing to fill out "missing" part, which (after looking MULTIPLE times) I realize is a glitch that shows "ZIP" where the 3 o 4 digit credit card CVC # should be. So it correctly shows the CVC number I put in, but the form ITSELF oddly changes the expected info/form to a zip code and won't correct or accept my info, which means, ultimately, my donation is not getting through. UGH. Not trying to go find a checkbook for this at the moment. REALLY wish it were functioning and hope it's not a much larger issue for others. IJS.

He didn't tune down to drop D for Everlong! Have I been doing that song wrong all my life??
I was nearly tears at Times Like These very emotional. Overall, the gig was great. Thank you Foo Fighters for doing it during these tough times.

These guys are ok but what they really need is a backup plan.  It's fine to have dreams of "making it big" but they should really look into carpentry, airline mechanics or H-Vac certification.
Great acoustic set. Thanks so much.

I love this band.  Dave is a rock God.
PAT is oldddd. i'm olddddddddd
Can't love this enough. WOW ❤️
Seriously
So nice to get the see theses guys play again! Greetings from Maine! I would've have seen them at Boston Calling this summer but you know..  This pandemic is really hitting close to home up here. Our big city, Portland, as have all the cities in Maine have been working hard to build a great network of venues and foster a music scene that has been dormant for decades. Over the past two decades great venues have opened up for music here in Maine, but now they all face closing. One venue Port City Music Hall has closed for good. The others like the State Theater, and One LongFellow Square are struggling and could close. This relief is well needed and necessary up here in Maine where bands don't often get up this north and venues work hard to bring music here. Plus it fosters a diverse and wonderful local scene of amazing bands and performers. Please donate!! This drummer needs to drum! haha.. (no really I do!)
The end is no longer near; the end is now HERE!  Tomorrow may be too late for you; no one is guaranteed tomorrow. We are all sinners and the wages of sin is eternal death in hell! REPENT and ACCEPT JESUS CHRIST as your saviour today in 3 simple steps  A - Accept that you are a sinner in need of a saviour B - Believe in your heart that Jesus Christ was born of a virgin, died and shed his blood for our sins, buried, resurrected on the third day, ascended to heaven and is seated at the right hand of God C - Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is lord of your life..
That was the most incredible version of Times Like These that I’ve ever heard.
Happy Stoner Sunday!!! I invite you to come learn about the basics to growing organics over hydroponics plus Trinidad OG review
Thank you🤘🤙🇵🇹🇧🇷

It's weird without the applause. Great performance though! X

What is the deal with Taylor’s shirt? It appears to be a phone number?
I honestly wasn't expecting it to be this good. Made me cry :')
Something else for you. If you die today will you go to heaven? Have you ever lied, stolen, used God's name as a curse word (O-M-G)? According to God's law, you're guilty, your headed for hell, ignorance will not be an excuse... But wait, God loves you, he made a way out for you, God's son Jesus died paying for your sin.    God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16    God is warning the world. End Time prophesies are jumping off the pages of the Bible, plagues, violence, scoffers, government control, earthquakes, fires, floods, people will be lovers of themselves, money, lovers of pleasure rather than God, evil will be called good and good called evil, sexual immorality rampant adultery, fornication, abuse... the ultimate in child abuse mommies killing their babies in child sacrifice (abortion), World leaders are prepping for a One-World order, government, religion (please don’t take a number on your forehead or right hand, read Revelation a number means no heaven, and there's only one alternative) The government is also prepping to have you believe that UFO's are real... Soon the antichrist will come and fix everything, everyone will love him, he will deceive many... then the tribulation will start, life on earth will be horrific. Today if you hear God whispering to your heart please respond before it's too late. Say a humble prayer, pour your heart out to God, he loves you, open your heart take a chance receive Jesus as your savior.
Skin and Bones changes every year. I like it!
Quarantine has not been good to the Ghrolmiester. Man titties and a beer belly to boot.
Foo Figthers! The Big Band!
Thank you. I love the band so much. I do some of your stuff on ukelele and mandolin... You guys make me a happy musician.. so thanks for the music!
Amazing! Thanks for the songs and the stories!
Chris looks like he's ready to go on a long haul in his 18 wheeler right after this show!
I have to WARN you all with LOVE...💝💝... We are living out revelations in the Bible, please choose Jesus Christ today while he can still be found. He died for all our sins. We all have ain in our life the Bible tells us and we each need a Savior. I'm so thankful Jesus died for my sins and please accept this gift on the cross he did for you too. He rose from the grave 3 days later and is seated on the right hand of God. We have to confess with our mouth to God we are sinners in need of a Savior. Turn from your sins, invite the Holy Spirit into your life and pray to God often, get a bible.. KJV is a good place to start!! I am praying for the ENTIRE 🌎 daily to choose Jesus today because I KNOW things in the world will continue to get worse according to what the Bible says. God is trying to shake people out if their slumber and choose him...this is his mercy on each of us!! He LOVES us so much he sent his only son to die on the cross for us so we can all make it back to heaven! Jesus took on the sins of the 🌎. I LOVE you ALL so much and pray for each person on Earth daily. He'll is real and you don't want to go there. I cry for those who reject Jesus, because I know things won't get better for them... 🙏💐💝

Thank you for doing this! It's some small consolation for not getting to see you on tour in Wichita, KS, yesterday. Hopefully, we'll see you down the road ...
This was awesome never get tired of everlong

Hola quisiera que me apoyaras a lograr esta meta de ser una gran youtuber te agradecería que me ayudarás a llegar a los 500 suscriptores con un granito de arena tuyo osea pasandote por mi canal y suscribirse a el te lo agradecería de todo corazón muchas gracias ♥️
The keys/synth player adds a lot. Loved the show.
Watching these performances is amazing!!! Not just the foos - they’re always great. It’s about the sheer emotional power of live music. Even with no crowd.  The time is right for some savvy individual to launch “the Netflix of live music” - if the performances were good, and the advertising subtle enough I’d happily pay for live performances like the ones in this virtual festival.... who’s with me!!! LONG LIVE LIVE MUSIC!!!!!
Que tremenda versión de Time Like These 😍

It's like Dave knows exactly what our souls need to heal ❤️ I really hope that there is recovery for this industry and soon. Too many people struggling right now. Thank you Foos for doing this!! Love you all!!!

One doesn't own emotion, and when one is owned by emotion, it's a reflection of one's belief that one owns them🎈Non-Duality
Such a great experience, live music is so special. This 2020 has been the Worst. Lost my Mom to Covid19.  These guy's and the whole of #SOS brought me up. Heard a lot of music that's new for me. The Roots were phenomenal live. Hoping for another weekend of live streaming bands. Thank you Moderators for the best chat.
Masks destroy your brain and nervous system. They are utterly detrimental to your health and well-being. Covid 19 does not exist. Your body is merely responding to the 5G frequency which it is not accustomed to. Look into symptoms of radiation sickness and they mirror one another. Do not wear masks, do not kill yourselves willingly.
Gotta love em'
The former guitar player of the Germs, Pat Smear the guitarist of the Foo fighters,  fought Tom Waits at a  Go-Gos punk show his first time at the Troubadour  Now that's  fucking punk rock.  Shit that's a great story for Tom Waits too. Hahaha
That was great! And made me think back to my first shows at the Troubadour. Mostly unknown LA bands but I recall seeing Femme Fatale and...KISS! That was an awesome night!
Casamento Tem Acontecimento Inusitado... https://youtu.be/WcIcnuywG4c
BR presente. Come back to Brazil as soon as possible!
I like Pat Smear’s guitar. Really nice sunburst hollow body six-string
Once upon a troubadour
E
Heartfelt and phenomenal per usual👍🏼
I love these guys ❣️❣️❣️
Best. Thank you, guys! Words cannot describe the love I have for this band. Hope you'll be entertaining us here in Cape Town, South Africa again soon.   Wait! Who disliked this video!? I want names, people!
Love you guys!
It's times like these that we really need Times Like These
Por Dios que maravilla de mini concierto,deberían grabar un concierto entero acústico.Fabulosos todos y como suena la voz de Dave,en verdad necesitaba un descanso,,creo que es mejor que no la fuerce tanto,así suena estupenda y clara.Me encantan estas versiones.
Times like these is my all time fave. All the feelings every single time.
Pat at his coolest evaaa.... hahaha..... Excellent show....
Dave, you'll love this, PROMISE https://youtu.be/gGbFUwfaaCc
🎶Esta muy buena esta canción 🔊
That synth on my hero though
So many ads and mid-song :(
I thought Dave was going to say "yeah so we are doing Poison songs tonight lol"
Great cause. Great Performance. Now its up to ALL of us to make this happen. Those who can, will...🎼🎵🎶🎸👌
Where are our hero’s going if the venues close down. Where are you going if they close down?
Donate to save clubs like the Troubadour. All small stages are where bands start out. They need to be supported to stay open!🙏
So thrilled to be familiar with the legendary Troubadour. First show. Beck. For legal reasons I can’t say what happened at the show. But it was a blast. 😊
Chris in covid times looks so much like Taylor and I'm here for it
If YouTube allowed multiple likes on this video, I would click thumbs up 1000 times...
The guy in the far left of the thumbnail looks like someone from a documentary that just recently blew up on Netflix. See if any of you can guess who I'm talking about lol.
*Hey ... to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” *www.soul.fish*
great as always. Big hug to everyone involved in live production. Hope this pandemic goes away pretty soon so we can have our stages alive kicking again.
Amo!
So great!
Damn. It's all so great, but Times Like These... Damn.
Show
Wow Times Like These! And yes as someone said...his voice is better than ever!!
Big dave.. the best drummer of nirvana, and a super star in foo fighters. I started in rock ñ roll,   listen nirvana. Tnks for make me a guitar man and rocker boy
Nice to see actual music on trending I love the foos
I was still growing shut the f****** he was good when it came out but there's so much better music now I can't even handle it cuz he's got a voice that you know he did whatever he could to sound like Kurt Cobain and it worked then but not now some bands need to know when to shut it down and shut the f****** their girls one of them
I’m here for the ads every 42 seconds.
DAVE FUCKING GROHL!
This is the Most Important post you will ever read;  Every one of us has broken God’s moral law, the Ten Commandments. We’ve all lied and we’ve all stolen, which makes us liars & thieves; And James 2 : 10 states that breaking even just one of these commandments makes us guilty of breaking them all.   The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because The Creator is perfect in holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in justice, meaning not a single sin will go unpunished; and our penalty for sin is death & hell, which the Bible describes as Eternal fire where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. Here, he lived a perfect & sinless life, only to take the punishment that we deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, & endured a painful death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. On the third day, he conquered death & rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of Gods judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace;  Except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, & through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old ways. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, & the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9), and you will be saved.  The moment you do this, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds pleasure in sin, & also, he will grant you eternal life in his presence; Nothing on this earth even close to compares to what awaits believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY.. meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make. And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ is awaiting YOU right this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you have surrendered to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. and as it is written  (Hebrews 9 : 27); ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ .  https://www.amazon.com/dp/1432117742/ref=emc_b_5_mob_i
How did anyone disklike this?
Thanks for doing this and for you guy's being who you are and what you have given to us over the years. You're by far my favorite band.. Continued success and see you next year being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
I miss these guys!!!! And their LIVE music
Put your money where your mouth is. Open your own music venue. Pay artists and the staff fairly.
Just... Wow
I would die for foo fighters no joke
it's amazing how much 10 years can change a person but regardless STILL LOVE YOU DAVE
Skin and Bones not 1 of my favourites but fek sake they didn't half knocked this one into the stratosphere. Absolutely quartz  perfect 🚀🎸🎵🎶🎼💥
Pat Smear fought Tom Waits at the Troubadour?? That needs to be on Tales from the Tour Bus ASAP. Awesome
I 💖 PAT
perfect as always 🇩🇪👍👍🎵
Quer saber se uma banda de Rock é boa ? Basta ver se eles conseguem mandar brasa no acústico como esses caras fizeram !
Was supposed to see FF live a few weeks back. So happy that they did this set. Lets hope this pandemic ends soon so we can all go back to seeing live music, live and in person. Rock on.
Times Like These!! Love this version!
The arrangement of the songs is nice. Dave's voice was so beautiful and touched my heart. Thank you so much, Foo Fighters🎵🌺🎼🎤🎸🎹👍👏👏👏
These Days was an awesome reimagining and Times Like These was hauntingly beautiful
How's no one talking about the most epic Skin and Bones performance ever?! Damn I was needing this in my life! I mean, the entire live was the most perfect, but they started kicking the s*it out of the front door with this song which is actually meant to be live
All star band all star people first
Still stoked by Times like these - impressive, strong, intense, so new and unknown
Lovely..Dave's voice sounded amazing..💓💓😍
Pleeeease release this version of Times like these on every platform asap, it was truly amazing! Didn't realise how much I've been missing live music until I was listening to this Foo's gig...
I got shivers when 'Times like these' started...
That version of Times Like These gave me insane goosebumps!!! Wow!
nunca vi tanto brasileiro num lugar só! KKKKKKKKK
Impressão minha ou a voz do Dave ta bem melhor?
Just  love  this .. Thanks   Foo  Fighters
This set was great. Could easily be released as an ep. i love the vibe and feel of these songs in this environment.
best band in the world congratulations to the group. 🇧🇷
Is it a wonder Foo fighters made the greatest live recording in recent memory considering that Dave and Pat were also in Nirvana and made the greatest live record ever with Nirvana unplugged.
Love the Foo Fighters. Thank you for all the great music and keep it coming. ❤️ Great live versions of My Hero, Everlong, Times Like These.
The foos are collecting donations to feed the already rich musicians who can't play because they voted for communists who shut everything down and are now attempting to overun our government and overthrow Capitalism. FUCK FOO FIGHTERS. GO CRY TO JIMMY FUKIN KIMMEL FOR MONEY. SURPRISED METALLICA ISN'T OUT THERE SUCKING ON SOME COMMUNIST COCK TRYING TO REMAIN RELAVENT. Right now Lars is looking up  from under some music exec's balls.
❤❤❤❤❤
Who else thinks that loud last cord is the first cord of their new album?
Great!!!! When you come back in Brazil????
so sweet
Everlong is such a good song, but I truly loved what they did with Skin and Bones which is maybe the FF song I like the less... Amazing stuff
WebMD information (among others)has  put my mind at ease regarding covid-19. Although, MY HEART GOES OUT to those who have died and suffer from covid-19 and their families, it reassures me that the threat is not NEARLY  as grievous as we see everyday on television and in the newspaper.  "Coronavirus Recovery Rates  Scientists and researchers are constantly tracking infections and recoveries. But they have data only on confirmed cases, so they can’t count people who don’t get COVID-19 tests. Experts also don’t have information about the outcome of every infection. However, early estimates predict that the overall COVID-19 recovery rate is between 97% and 99.75%." SOURCE: https://www.webmd.com/lung/covid-recovery-overview  Today's numbers (10/16/20)... 213,000 deaths ÷ 8 million cases x 100 = 2.6% death rate or 97.3% SURVIVAL RATE!!!!!  ( probably higher because we  haven't tested everyone. )  I will take those chances any day! That means there is almost zero risk of dying if I contract Coronavirus!!!!!  We live with similar risks everyday. One example is Car crashes.  33,000 deaths ÷ 6 million crashes x 100 = .5% chance of dying  or 99.5% survival rate. https://www.driverknowledge.com/car-accident-statistics/
Spero capiate l'italiano. Non ho potuto vedervi dal vivo qui in Italia per via del virus. Mi sto godendo questa stupenda live. Grazie. Siete magnifici!
The Satyricon in Pdx already shut down around 2010. Nothing else matters. KIDDING.
Check this out guys! https://open.spotify.com/artist/6oaEUIKOzbqxSPxXbVrNeg?si=ucUmUC5RSU28JVJ64i1nVA
Some of my favourite Foo sets are acoustic 😍
This is cool!
Dave's voice is UNREAL now, lockdown and quitting cigarettes was the best thing he could've done for his voice
That’s the way cool ripper y’all way cool 😎
And Nate still doesn't want to play an acoustic bass at an acoustic set...
Sensacional!
Em tempos assim você aprende a viver de novo ♥️
Beautiful
for the love of god, put this performance in the fuckin spotify
Skin and bones brilliant version goosebumps
This version of Everlong was so beautiful. His voice is so comforting. Love the Foo Fighters!
DOMINGO 18 DE OCTUBRE DE 2020 QUE  BUEN TEMA  LOCOOOOOOOOOOOOOO00000000 Y QUE GRAN  BANDA  COMO DICE EL COLORADO  MC ALLISTER  LOC0000000000OOOOOOOOOOOO L0COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO L0C0000000000000000000000000 LOCOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO LOC00OOOO0000OOOOOOOOOOO0 LOC0000000000000000000000000
A bright moment in this shitty year of 2020. Thank You
The last second was all of Dave's frustration of this year in one chord.
Absolutely made my morning 💗 I will forever love the foo fighters 🖤
I think Dave’s voice really needed this break. He sounds better than ever.
"And whoed you fight the night" "tom waits, it was his house and he didn't like us here"😂😂🤣😎
Venues: Just something else Mitch McSatanturtle's nihilism threatens and could kill.
This has made me realise how much I miss live music, especially The Foo Fighters. Dave’s voice sounds great and the interaction of the boys was brilliant. Cannot wait for them to return to the UK 🤘👊
Love this version of Times like these..❤️
They are incredible! I hope to see you at Rock in Rio Lisboa next year :D
WoW that pause on live stuff really did good on Dave his voice
This show was perfection....as usual. Dave seems like one of the coolest dudes on the planet.  It's also great to see Pat Smear doing his thing, he's so goddamn under-rated. Loved him since The Germs
Anyone knows what keyboard does Rami uses for "hammond" sound? Sounds amazing
always wonderful
The Love in the world just grew a bit right there. So much respect for you and yours my dear Foos.
Love you guys!
Great to see you, boys <3
Спасибо огромное за прекрасный концерт!🙏 Все неприменно наладится, до скорой  встречи на фестивалях! 🤘🤘🤘Вы лучшие😉
Pat's story about him and Tom Waits getting in a fight is golden 😂 And Dave's reaction to it even more 😂 Love those guys 😂
❤ and best wishes to Dave and the boys. Of all the bands I have seen on stage over the years, I have saw you guys the most. #1 on stage and in my heart.  Looking forward to this shit show to be done with so you can get back on stage again over in Bonnie Scotland 🤘😁
Cheers and love from Russia, we all have the same problem with our venues closing down. Live long, Foo Fighters!
Крутые чуваки
What a beautiful gig and action to save small stages. 👏🙏 Donation done ✅ 👍
The UK needs you guys... Our government have genuinely straight up told us musicians, artists, dancers, anyone creative etc to "find a different career path" because they've restricted everything to do with the creative paths even if they could be done safely and I don't see them lifting the restrictions any time soon either...   It's awful and heartbreaking, I personally have dedicated over half of my life from 11 years old to learning the Bass and performing, just to be told to find something else because they won't let it happen, when there's no knowledge or science to back it up either, it's just what they want... It's very scary. Thank you for this performance, it brought a tear to my eye just wishing I could do the same one day. Thanks again Foos, much love❤
Man this band has got me through some rough times over the years, thanks Foo's!
It's times like these you learn to live again...  Brought tears to my eyes. How I wish all of us were in a passionate crowd again, giving back the love and energy his band spreads.   I enjoyed their show a couple of times through the years. Endured rain, storm and sunshine with these guys, check the 2011 Pinkpop Learn to fly, with a rainbow. "If we keep playing, will you keep singing? " Absolutely.
a coffee and this - best way to start your sunday
Dave's voice...
Great Foos!!!!! 🤟🔝
Seriously Everlong is one of the best song in modern time
one of their best skin and bones performances
Perfect song choices for a difficult time for so many artists, promoters, venues and staff. If anyone can help save our stages (aside from the governments and people in power) it’s the mighty foo’s🤘🏻💛
One of these days... “Troubadour,” is a fantastic name. Incredible band... So talented. Withstanding the tests of time. This acoustic session will go down in history... All my love ...🍷 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troubadour
🇧🇷🎸🤘
This is just golden base material for TheRoneZone's Awkward series!
These venues will never go away. This is all an agenda. You are puppets working for your bosses pulling the strings.
❤️❤️❤️
Soooooo good. God I miss live music😭
Chris shiflett went full taylor hawkins/hulk hogan during lockdown.
❤❤❤🤟
If that was a livestream,  how did Daves guitar go to Drop D for everlong without even being touched? 😲
Dave grohl never look old
Amazing performance as usual❤️🤘🏻
These guys are so awsome.. 👌👌👌
Thank you Foo Fighters! You made my day 🎶
Dave grohl And the Foo fighters is the best rock band of all the time
Ya hacía falta
Thanks guys. We do indeed need to save our stages. Live music will be back, but it will need venues to be performed in!!
Why are there approaching 100 dislikes for this? If you don’t like the Foo Fighters then don’t watch the bloody video! Outstanding performance for a great cause. I’ll never figure people out.
Eu adoro essa banda desde criança 👶
Great show and a great cause.  Loved the Zeppelinesque keyboards with Times Like These.  Thanks you.
Dear Dave Grohl ,I discover in Nirvana but I try to learn drums and l prefer playing soccer with my friends and I'm sorry at this Times, Lucy don't look upon me.That's the reason I prefer lesson your beautiful albums and the other band I love ever the great RedHotChiliPeppers
Amazing show! But only 5 song? ...Maybe they would could play a few more like Next Year, Generator, In the Clear and a lot of more xd
I loved the accordion in Skin & Bones <3 Oh my!
Great seeing you guys!!!! Stay safe everybody!! Support music venues!! 😍
Much needed performance during the pandemic. Loved it! Except, who decided to put ads in the middle of Skin And Bones?! 😒
chills
I didn't even know I needed to hear this gig this morning. Turns out I did. Thank you FF ❤️❤️❤️
Brett Michaels has entered the chat.
I hate it when people compare Dave Grohl to Jesus. He's great, but he's no Dave Grohl.
UN GRAZIE DI TUTTO CUORE DALL'ITALIA 😁💓😂🎶🌈
“Breathe out so I can breathe you in, hold you in.” 😅  Don’t do this now, guys! 🙏 Stay safe everybody! This show was amazing! ♥️
When you see this performance you know what you already knew, FF is one of the best bands ever! Damn good!
Tom Waits!  LMAO
Goosebumps over and over. Foo's, promise not to stop. Ever.
BR 🇧🇷
Brs só dominam
Ufffffff 🔥👌🏻 !!!
We have the same hair, Dave. The Go Go Girls riot is one of the most undertold stories of our life. Thank you Foo Fighters! That was me holding 2 of you down, to my right and left holding hands, on the professor's lawn in Gainesville. Those saying don't come from nowhere. I yelled "We'll get off your lawn when the sun comes up!" That professor said ok and shut his front door. Opening for Tom Petty does come with perks Ha That's my first story
The Foos have filled the void that Tom Petty left in my heart. Thanks guys!
Who ever can put dislike on this video? They're might be bots, there's no other explanation.
Tem muito BR isso ai!!
I have a soft spot in my heart for the Foo Fighters. Was recently told that there are better rock bands in world and that their music has gotten too soft. But rock'n'roll is not just about beating the shit out of your instruments and screaming endlessly to the mic, it is also about THIS. It is a lifestyle and sense of togetherness, especially in hard times. Love you, Foos. ❤
These Days Foo Fighters One of these days, the ground will drop out from beneath your feet One of these days, your heart will stop and play it's final beat One of these days, the clocks will stop and time won't mean a thing One of these days, their bombs will drop and silence everything But it's alright, yeah it's alright, said it's alright Easy for you to say Your heart has never been broken Your pride has never been stolen Not yet, not yet, one of these days I bet your heart 'll be broken I bet your pride 'll be stolen I'll bet, I'll bet, I'll bet, I'll bet One of these days, one of these days One of these days, your eyes will close and pain will disappear One of these days, you will forget to hope and learn to fear But it's alright, yeah it's alright, said it's alright Easy for you to say Your heart has never been broken Your pride has never been stolen Not yet, not yet, one of these days I bet your heart 'll be broken I bet your pride 'll be stolen I'll bet, I'll bet, I'll bet, I'll bet One of these days, one of these days But it's alright, yeah it's alright, said it's alright Yeah it's alright Don't say it's alright, don't say it's alright Don't say it's alright One of these days your heart will stop and play it's final beat But it's alright, easy for you to say Your heart has never been broken Your pride has never been stolen Not yet, not yet, one of these days I bet your heart will be broken I bet your pride will be stolen I'll bet, I'll bet, I'll bet, I'll bet One of these days One of these days One of these days

I loved it all, but wow, My Hero was something else ( 10:22 ). Hope to see Foo Fighters live again together  with a big crowd. Let's keep the stages open!

Rock the world guys 🇮🇹❤️
1. Skin and Bones: 1:51 2. My Hero: 10:22 3. These Days: 17:48  4. Times Like These: 23:03 5. Everlong: 29:04
Thank you guys. Dude in the live chat requested an acoustic "White Limo" and I'll second that
Fuck man. I’m such a skeptic of fundraiser and non profits being that I’ve worked for them. Seems too much money doesn’t get to where it is supposed to go....bet here goes a few bucks. Salon owner and many of our salons in California are closing up as well.
So awesome to see them perform again. It's much needed in Times Like These! It was soul soothing. Can't wait to be able to see them live again.
Dave’s voice has literally never sounded better.  I still have goosebumps!
Is Grohl drink beer in real live?
Amazing show with awesome version of great songs🤘 Thanks guys 🤩
Dave’s like one of those guys u just want to sit down with and have a beer with and shoot the shit. 🍺
well I wanted to say thank you so much and I want to see that I get off the streets if possible tonight please
I wish these rock stars and the people who live in these Blue states who won’t open bk up before the states collapse would just give the Governor’s the 🖕🏾and just start opening bk up like the rest of the country is doing.
Dave dedicating My Hero to Pat Smear👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Thanks for the gig tonight!!! I really needed that right about now. I can't wait till this F'N virus is over, and things get back to normal and see you guys in concert again. By the way, I really need to hear that new album guys, please try to release it before the new year. Cheers from up here in Canada!
I've made a donation.  Thanks,  Foo Fighters, for this amazing performance and for helping in the effort to save our venues.  The world will be hugely impoverished if we lose  those independent performance spaces.
🇧🇷
Dave is just too fucking cool!
These dudez are just vibin. talking shit and messing around with Pat.Good times.
Forgot how much I like Dave’s voice, been a huge foo fighter fan since i was super young
🖤
Fan for life
That last strum right after everlong scared the shit out of me
Didn't know I needed this as much as I did today!! You always sound so amazing live!!  Blasting this so loud and feeling it in my soul!! We all need an acoustic Foo Fighters Album!! Didn't know I needed this acoustic version of Times like These. It was so fantastic!
Loved this version of “Times like these”.
Brilliant! Really enjoyed Times like these.
Best band ever!!
🤘🏼Greetings from KK Sabah,Malaysia🇲🇾🤘🏼
26:07 quando você bate o dedinho do pé
36:24 me cagué todo
And after that powerful feel droven Everlong, a classic Dave moment.
Acoustic for the soul in these crazy times! Thank you so much for helping to save your fans' sanity while helping fans save the venues. Cheers!
i love you dave <3
Tell your Democrat Governor’s to chill on the COVID lockdowns and restitutions! Maybe live music will survive just saying
is this new?
Beautiful! Foo Fighters continues helping me to keep my sanity...
Dave's voice sounds excellent. Didn't think I'd say this, but perhaps some extra time off is just what they needed
Saw Dave play with Scream, while on a Nirvana break, at the Crocodile Cafe in Seattle....another killer venue.
Sempre incrível
Obrigado pelo presente de aniversário ❤️
Seriously, I needed this so bad. I miss live music so much and I miss the Foo Fighters more than anything.
Bravissimi hanno musica nel sangue
Didn't know I needed an acoustic rendition of These Days in my life, but I'm blown away. Awesome performance.
I have been  supporting you all since 2011 ;  i  love you guys
Horrible audio.
Pat Smear... my hero! Way back with Nirvana!
Thank you!  You guys rock, seriously great performance!
Thank you foo fighters. Such a epic performance. Now it’s up to us to save theses iconic places. With out music the world can’t express its love ❤️.
36:23 e o susto? Skskskskk quase caiu da cama :v
thanks dave
The music is of course incredible as always but Dave's sense of humor was such a nice added bonus! Thank you Foo Fighters!! :)
Thank you, Foo Fighters!
Times like these moved me to tears: so bare and beautiful
Ouvi dizer que os brs dominaram essa live :>
Llegue tarde pero aun asi estuvo de lpm Aguanten los foo!!!!
I think they're live from Troubadour, guys
love these guys so much. this set was amazing
Slow How.....You Wanted It To Beeee🎶🎶🎵
Foo fighters will definitely be inducted next year into the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame. 💯
That was the most intense version of Times Like These I’ve ever heard and experienced. Truly beautiful.
I’d love it if Dave bought the Troubadour. If Tarantino can buy New Beverly Cinema, why not?
That was great seeing Pat, Dave and the guys performing like this. Gave  different interpretations of great songs. Reminded me of the MTV unplugged gig they did with Krist and the celloist when I was 18 years old.  Was lucky enough to see both bands but never like this.
These Days gets us all in our Skin and Bones, but Times Like These brings out My Hero Everlong...
Foo Fighters e foda!
Dave, you are my inspiration
Times likes this we learn to live again... Greatness at its best timing...
The best thing to happen in over 7 months. Thank you Foos!!!!
Hell yeah dude!
Amo amo obrigada por tudo vcs são a mlhr coisa a me aconteceu amo vcs de todo coração❤️❤️✨🎼🎶
My Hero sounds AWESOME as a slow acoustic song! It's AWESOME either way but refreshing to hear songs played in different ways sometimes.
That was pretty awkward between songs lol
So good. Love it...
You guys are my hubby's fave and today is his bday. This is such a treat! Glad to see you on stage!
Rami is killing it. Its a true shame he doesn't usually get to shine on the regular live shows
Love the tank top, Taylor ! 86 45!!!!!
A worthy cause for sure!! Without music venues our world will be a very quiet , sad place.  Love the Foo!! Rock on 🤟❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😁🇨🇦
Pat fought Tom Waits? Hell yeah
Ahh man I got here late 😭😭 Nvm I found the times 🙏🥳
The best
INCREÍBLE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The one and the only one
WE LOVE YOU DAVE!!!!
This is freakin awesome!! ❤️❤️❤️
Manaus - Am, Brasil I LOVE YOU Foo fighters✌✌
Playing perfectly as usual!! Thanks for a better evening, nice to hear your  stories about Troubadour. Just keep rockin'
This Is A True Attempt At This Pandemic & I'm Inspire. Deepest Best Wishes & Salute To The Performer's ❤ LOVE
Skin and Bones: 1:51 My Hero: 10:22 These Days: 17:48 Times Like These: 23:03 Everlong: 29:08
Wow. My Hero ✌🏼❤️🌟👏🏼
Só não foi melhor pq acabou rápido
foo figthers Brasil 😎
Awesome all the best from down under
Amazing concert...perfect Song!!
dou
Donated
Banda de rock atual? Não tem melhor que FF🤘👍 Sou músico por causa deles 🙏
Am I the only one who finds it ironic that a live-streamed concert (which can get tens or hundreds of times more views than a live concert) is being held to save venues which won’t be allowed to re-open due to both COVID concerns and audience discomfort with arenas which are enclosed?  The fact is, life is different now. Most movie theaters, concert halls, restaurants... all facing closure in the next few months. Benefit concerts and donations won’t prevent these closures. People going back to work and facing the fact that COVID won’t meaningfully affect 99% of all Americans (only the most ill face significant risk) is what needs to be accepted first.
Brasil 🇧🇷 . .. ... .... Não leia meu nome!
Acoustic Foo Fighters!!? Count me IN!
😍😍😍❤
Muito obrigado por manterem o Rock vivo. E por comporem "Everlong". Uma das músicas mais fantásticas da história do Rock. Valeu, FOO FIGHTERS.
So good. The best version of Times Like These ever and obviously so timely. Thank you.
Playlist:  Skin and Bones: 4:39 My Hero: 13:07 These Days: 20:33 Times Like These: 25:45 Everlong: 31:54  Thank you Foo Fighters!
