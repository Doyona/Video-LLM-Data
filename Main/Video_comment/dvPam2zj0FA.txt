Congratulations on the accomplishments you've made here on YouTube! I would think that 99% of those who have come so far have at least three full time employees behind them.  Incidentally! That snow is just incredible! It must be so much fun having snow like that every year! I can't believe it gets so deep! What fun!
Anna should get a ride in the tractor you are over a million subscribers
why backwards ?
❤❤❤
I love your content 😂😂
Congratulations on 1,003,000 subscribers you need 10,000,000 subscribers 😂😂😂❤❤❤
😂😂😂😂
So glad you got that🎉
can anyone explain all the trophies and medals in the workshop? he has loads :D
zack forgot to say but i hope you get 2m and keep the hard work going
i wonder how fbn evolved. im sure its they make some good profit from farmers
I watch because I find farming cool and interesting i also watch because you are a goofball i you make me laugh
An Aussie speaking here. I have spent the last 3 months catching up on your posts. I love your very dry sense of humor, love dogs and congrats on your Goldie.
Thank you for sharing your accomplishment. with us. You certainly deserve the recognition.
I can't wait to see Ana in a tractor!
Maybe you should look into getting a front pto tractor or have one added to one of them
Im glad i have front pto and can run my blower on the front
Omg
BZ! 🎉 Job well done. My own farming experience had nothing to do with corn or beans. Grandpa grew wheat rapeseed and grass (for the beef), in Saskatchewan. But, I can relate to the Snow!
Danke! you should try to get an 8r  410 with the new eAutoPowr to test. 😎
Why does every farmer in Minnesota who has a YouTube channel  Have to produce multiple videos of snow and removing snow!   OK we get it - it snows there Minnesota
Congrats on the 1 million🎉🎉,  hope the snow melts quickly and you can get out there planting soon.  Looking forward to seeing more videos
Can the dog ride in the tractor now?
Hey zach on that 9570r tractor FUEL TANK VENT FILTERS. Unscrew the black filter in look down the pipe and u should see lots of NICE dirt in there. lol
Congratulations well deserved from the UK
So happy for you guys I've been watching for a long time now and is my go to channel🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦
Are you getting hit by any of these storms rolling thru???
Do you come to Niagara area in Canada to race
Can you do a show on cover crops versus cash crops show people how you put the soil back to richness
Larson Farms, Miinesota is a great channel as well.
What a accomplishment on the gold button but there’s know doubt you will hit 2 million, it’s been sweet watching you for I believe 10 years now
time for a certain someone to get that cab ride now!!
Way to go!  Congrats!
Just when you thought you were done with winter, next storm coming through with 15"-25" inches here in Fargo
Dogs get to ride in the tractors
Here we call them…..power tailgates….
Congrats. Do they salt the parking lot of is that much traffic
Congrats on 1MM subs!  Thanks for introducing me to FBN!  Incredible value and outstanding service.
🐰
Great video!
Well done .congrats Zack!
1 million subscribers.  Your making some serious YouTube money now! That's a big fat check you get from them monthly! Nice.
don't feel bad we still have snow us to
Congratulations on 1 Million Subscribers, Zach! Well deserved. The bench & pegboard sure look great in your race shop.
Congrats there green-tractor-daily-farm-life inspiration!
Congrats on 1,000,000  (wow that’s a lot of zeros) subscribers. Great job from your entire cast of family actors. Love the content. Very informative. Enjoy greatly please continue with outstanding educational farming videos 😊
👍
congrats on the 1 mil Subs and the Playbutton Keep going the best youtuber ever keep doing the good job
Farmers with modern tools are very good, in my country farmers use simple tools
How much snow did you get on April fools day?
Tell us more about the church near your home
Congrats for 1M
Congratulations from the Netherlands
And even MORE snow coming mid-week, from what I hear!
Congrats on the Mill !!
I live in South dakota
Yeah I think it's going to be 2 to 3 weeks later this year getting into the fields lots of snow to melt then you got to get the fields to dry out
Your welcome Zach 😊😊.... Y'ALL ARE POWERFUL CREATORS 😊
Why don’t you drink tap water instead of purchasing water bottles?
Definitely one of the more deserving channels! This channel and the Ivers farms channels are HANDS DOWN the best farming channels on YouTube! Congrats!🎉🍾🎊🎈
Don't apologizes for spending time with family and living life. Snow videos are fine, help me feel cool during the Aussie summer :D
Question… did the ranger come with jump seats.  If it did would you be willing to sell them?
How was the desert racing?
I listen to the podcast and love it. I haven't seen any new episodes (on Spotify) since the one title we're back. Are you still doing the podcast?
Thank You
Was here when you hit 100,000 subs Zach... that seemed like a crazy high accomplishment for a guy just drivin' a tractor and plantin' corn 🌽..haha.. but here the Johnson family is at 1 Million Subs. God bless ya and Congratulations! 👍
I love rural America where the local farmers keep the church parking lot cleared.
glad your family got to take a vacation.  hard to travel the next few months!
it is a shame that i cant put a secod like, becasue you deserve it.
Congrats I watched for years commented many times finally subscribed when you got to 1M   lovin’ your videos from Krapramento, California the Krapital/Krapitol I love (& defended, submarines) my country but fear my government!
Why do u not use auto-guidance on the snowblower tractor, Jst plot the drive & let the tractor do the driving
Awesome news my friend
Congrats on the 1m subscribers! Keep up the great videos. Looking forward to SPRING!
False and Misleading informatiion.  Global Warming which will kill everyone in Five Years cannot allow there to be SNOW.  Ask any Greemoe, Only deniers will claim there to be Ice or Snow.  Polar Bears are dying and misinformation like this is still being promoted as a "truth".  🤣
greetings from poland!
Congrats on that Gold Play Button.
Can't wait to see you race again with Cleetus!
We need more jokes!
#41 on trending. And about time you made the million! Can't wait to see the coming improvements and test equipment.
Living in countryside and still you need to buy water for drinking. I ques groundwater are so poisoned with all ag chemical that you can't drink it
Keep the Faith and pretty soon the snow will be gone. Also keep plugging along until it is time to go back to work. I really like your videos.
nice one mate been watching for some years , thank you for cheering me up, and as allways all the best to your family and workers.
You work so hard with everything you do! Only 7 or so years to reach 1mm is incredible!!
Buy Bottled water? Ya millennial
To make it easier for u and for us to see ur POV can u use a head cam.
The content on this Youtube channel has become really BORING
I was out in CA they are going full speed.  I kept telling myself.  “2 feet of snow, front in the ground…relax”
Do you guys you use mostly generic chemical or anything basf or helena or syengenta??
Good job millennial farmer For hidden 1m Subs
Cant wait for the racin to start
Red and Black?  Them's CaseIH colors.  I thought you were a John Deere farm! 😆
Anna trying to remind you that at 1M viewers that she gets to ride in the cab!
Just cant watch anymore  toot toot
Fantastic job on the play button can’t wait for 2M
❤😊
"Just an idiot with a camera" LOL, Great idea for a MF shirt :-D
It was for the dog bro.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🤴🤴🤴🤴🤴🤴
That’s global warming for you!
GOLDEN PLAY BUTTON WOOOTS!!!!
Congratulations on 1M subscribers .  Enjoy your videos.
THUNDERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR     =)
Congratulations, you deserve and earned it, love your videos, keep it up, 2million is only 1 mill away.
You know Susan resigned as CEO. LOL
Holy sh!t!  It's a Ford Fackin Ranger!
Congratulations  🎉 Zach on reaching 1m . Love the videos
Cool.  Congrats.  That's pretty darn good for a Minnesota dirt farmer, doncha know.
Congratulations on one million subscribers, now your on your way to two million which I'm sure will happen.
Will you guys be making any more podcasts?
03:45 - That's what she said!!
Well done on the channel and the play button 🎉
1MM demands an expansion of scope if y’all wanna get to 2MM… but is it worth it to go into areas wherein it may be popular content but it’s not genuinely authentic-aka you’re not doing it b/c it resonates with you…. I’m thinking that you’ll be keeping it genuine 👍🏻👏
It starts with a red and black tool bench. Then what? Hoodies? Implements? ...Tractors? Also, can you use the gold button as a doorbell?
Congratulations indeed. 👍👍👍🇬🇧🇺🇸
Congrats on your 1 million subscribers awesome love the channel keep them coming
Congratulations on that big gold 1 million subscribers plaque. You've definitely earned it with a channel that's well produced and seriously interesting.  Most likely those lines between stacks in that wharehouse deliniate orders for specific customers pre-picked waiting to be picked up by customers or awaiting delivery dates. Lots of distributors are doing that now. Most wharehouse distributors move stock on a 24 hours in stock and gone system to help control costs. Home Depot was the ones to develope that system.  Now it's common.
Great channel as always, but I have a question: Will you be doing anymore "Off The Husk"?
We are trading cultivators through Madison. Luckily the one we are getting is in the back of the lot but the salesman said nothing can leave the lot until the insurance company inspects it. Makes it tougher since we are up by grand forks
Well done on the big 1m - greetings from 🇮🇪
loved the video, you're really appreciative and the world needs more of you! Love watching your farm life progress and its neat to watch as the kids slowly get older and learn machinery!
Could you do a video of the inside of the church at some point? Thanks.
Just an idiot with a camera ( and a million subscribers ) ... Me with my Millennial Farmer tumbler ..
GReetings from Greece, i am planting Corn in 2 days  !!!
Dang!! I've got a 98 ford ranger xlt 4x4 that looks just like that!! 😂 Much worse shape cosmetic wise.. I'm down for a straight trade and you can use mine to beat up more. That ranger you got is mint. Lol
nice no trespassing sign in the back.... why cant people.....nevermind
Congratulations on the million subscribers
Need a degelman on the 4 wheel drive.
Congrats on the 1million subs!! Hope you have a good day!
You're a good farmer, doing great videos and reached the milion subscribers weeks ago. So no, you're not an idiot with a camera.
Congratulations on the new award. Glad to be following your family’s adventures.
Gotta get them tractor lines straight before planting season…hmmm wait we’re millenials, we got autosteer😎😎😂
Congrats on hitting a million definitely well deserved
Brian should have been wearing a Larson Farms hoodie just to raz ya. I'm sure you gave him a new hoodie as his was looking properly used. Congrats on the mil subscribers. Also, might as well get the snowmobile back out, another snowstorm is coming.  The winter that won't end. I am thinking Canada is pissed at us - all turning their fans on at the same time laughing every Friday it seems.
Watching this from south east Louisiana thinking it’s 80 degrees I was told winter is over lol
👍👍
It's in the 50's here in Michigan.  The warm weather is coming
1 Million subs is not easy to achieve Well done to the whole team.
поздравляю с кнопкой ютуб,так держать 👍👍👍
Ain’t gonna catch me spending $1000 on water bottles
I will rub salt in an open cut....its gonna be a high of 71 today and 80 tomorrow. Perks of living in the south I guess :)
Congratulations on a well deserved play button Johnsons!! Lets hope the sheds and bins get to stay upright this spring, love your videos, keep up the good work! Best regards from Norway
When will u get another podcast out?
That work bench went through our manufacturing shop
Congratulations. I never see dogs get any treats. They need treats please 🙂
Waiting for spring up here too... my seed drill is buried in snow, should be working on it now! Hoping for warm weather soon! Congrats on the 1M!
Congratulations!
Couple more days of precip incoming, today and Tuesday… in the Winter that won’t leave.
Do Not Stop :)
Would be so much faster to plow   and then blow piles
I go past northern chill well and bottling plant 2 times a day.
Congrats on the 1M achievement. Certainly well deserved.
A big congrats to you all.
Love this channel, & been with you since '18. Well done Zak and Family.  Disappointed on your support for single use plastics in all those water bottles, shame there's no option for reusable water bottle decanted from larger reusable containers, especially as you try to push with best practice in your farming
Autosteer for the 6r
Comments                                                          just saying
Don’t thank us your a fantastic actor and your family are brilliant to 😂👍
Congratulations it is well deserved. As a local Minnesota guy you are representing our state well. With all the garbage on social media these days it is nice to have something family friendly and down to earth. Keep up the good work.
Congrats on 1M Zach. I know Anna was so excited too.
Congrats on the 1 mill Zack. Wondering if you could help with some info? Been trying to buy one of those FBN  canvas heavy winter jackets you're wearing in latest vid but no luck. Emailed them & just directed to their merch line which doesn't have said jacket.  Where did you get yours from? Winter is on its way  here in Oz & need a warm jacket.
Congratulations on your new combine I’m just wondering what kind of Combine is that I know it is a John Deere combine but I want to know the numbers of the Combine. I was wondering what grows faster Corn or Wheat I was just wondering. Please let me know when you get a chance to read my  comment.
Don't  you guys use snow  fences to stop the drifting in the road glad see you are OK can't wait til summer your race videos
That was a neat award!
1M subscribers represents all of us who enjoy your channel and appreciate all the work which goes in.  Thank you.
Congratulations Zach 🎉
Great watching  again  we all have  busy  lifestyle  👍  zac  nice video  again  ...lots of snow ❄️
You deserve that play Button so much , hope you continue to give us more amazing content 😊 keep going 😄
That's ok zac we forgive you  for lack of content  larson farms and walkers kept us going  😂
I’m so glad we don’t get snow in Australia
Busy day. For a farmer.   Sometimes I wonder  are you running a farm ,our is the farm running you.   Later.
Hey I have a ford ranger but idk if I want to race it because it has a manual transmission and 4wd very few know how to drive lol 😂
Congratulations on your  gold play button. Your content is always entertaining, informative, and educational.  Lastly my prayers go out to everyone affected by the fire at Midwest.  I  saw it on the news. My first thought was oh boy,  this is going to hurt a lot of folks.
Well done! keep up with the good work 🇬🇧 🇺🇲
Genuine question why don’t you just get a heated driveway so you don’t have to worry about it?
1L bottles!? thats honestly the first time i witnessed an american using the metric system 😂
Nice job on the play button can’t wait for 2M and how is there so much snow in april
I like the Case IH colors you decided to go with on your toolbox! Hopefully some of that Red equipment finds this way to your farm!
Congratulations and well done to the Millennial Farming Family 🎉🥳
A question from a foreign land,  you talk bottled water  can you not drink the water from your well or similar.
You cant beat a Ford F*cking Ranger!
I heard the city of Madison and surrounding businesses are stepping up and helping the JD dealership to get back on their feet, and support the local farmers there!🇺🇸
Well done, that gold play button doesn't get handed out for nothing. Friken hard to work and film at the same time .
AWESOME TO SEE YOU !
Zach, Congrats on the 1Mil subs! Well deserved. Now put a pillow in the tractor for that 'puppy'!
Ana in the tractor yet??  Congratulations!
Congratulations Mr & Mrs Millennial Farmer on 1M Subs!!!

Congrats on a million,  are you going to start back the off the husk podcast?
Well you do have a life outside of youtube so I understand. Congrats on 1m subs
Love your videos
Good to see . Always loved your channel since day 1
You should come down a week early and go to the XR series race at Volunteer Speedway about 45 mins from Bristol for the 100k super late model race. They are racing modified s too!
Ditch wats a tractor ride
No auto-steer on your snow blower?
Congratulations Zack And Becky and family! you guys work so hard for this channel and no one truly knows how much it takes. praying for a Good Harvest this year!
Congratulations Zack and family, it's a pleasure to watch you in you endeavors! Thanks to all!
I watch your channel Larsen farms channel and welker farms channel I've learned a lot from all three channels about farming from a guy that works on tugboats in Alaska plus Zach I also watch between the rows channel and I'm always happy to get my notice that there's a video so keep up the good work
Congratulations on your You Tube success! Proud to be a subscriber to such a great channel. Keep up the great work.
Congratulations to 1miljon subscribers🫡
Gets the gold play button and immediately starts shilling bottled water.  Back to normal for the MF channel 😂😂
We want CATDOG
The only thing I don't like about your show. Everything is green. A little red please.
Enjoyed this video and I really liked the work bench. Do you have a link for that and how long did your “special order “ take before delivery? Love the engraving on it. Thanks for the nice video.
Banning those plastic bottles in summit county colorado.
Congratulations!  That Gold Button Looks fantastic!  You have definitely earned it and I can't wait for you to hit 2 million subs!  Until your next video ~~~Stay safe, healthy, warm and happy!  🚜
The Mr. Might be the face, but the Mrs. does a lot of the work to make him look good. Thank you as well to a Mrs. Millenial Farmer
You may call it a stupid little hobby . I totally disagree it is a very informative  channel . Love watching
Congratulations!! Keep up the great work!!
Well water from the tap is god enough for me 😅
Global headquarters for Willowood Crop Sciences is located in Kolkata,India.   Thank you for NOT SUPPORTING USA .
That's awesome Zack
Well that seems a bit like a couple of commercials.
That’s a ford ranger!!
Ex CEO that's a relic now! 🎉
You need to have a line set with you sateilite for blowing a straight line. I use to work out of that same FBN warehouse space for Coinmach in the early 2000's. I remember what was in the corner when you came in the back door where we unloaded our coins. A vault.
More content about building the cars and stuff over at between the rows please!
Congratulations on the play button
Congratulations. That is awesome.  Good to have your videos back. Between  you, the Welkers, Larson Farms, How Farms Work, and Just a Few Acres , the best farming videos on YouTube. And you all don't  beg for money. I am impressed with how you and Welkers raised money to donate to someone else.
Awesome award! Checking on Cat Dog still around??
Snow "on this hill here". I have to say that's not my definition of "hill"... Congrats on the gold 🤩
1M🤯🤟🤟🤟
Congratulations on your gold play button 👍by the way, I live in Washington state and was wondering if you ship the Northern Chill this far?
watched your vid about 4 years ago the planter was working great. What happened that last year you were thinking about  the neighbours RED planter and a wee bit frustrated with green sensors?
Congrats on gold, how long till diamond.
Congratulations to all! That’s a remarkable achievement!
Congratulations. Love watching your videos.
Congratulations on the 1 million subscribers that is huge accomplishment for your channel
So like hey, when does the dog get to ride in the tractor?
Congratulations
YOU anmd the family have a life also so no apologies needed
Congrats on the award. I'm a retired farm boy / agronomist enjoying arm chair agriculture a few hundred miles north of Welkers its called Alberta.
I'd have loved to trade my Ranger for the one you're tearing apart, it's basically a brand new version of mine, and mine's a rusted out leaky pile. Congrats on the 1M, well deserved.
So happy about 1M! You deserve it! Now lets get those podcast episodes rolling! 😉
I'm guessing Jim's reaction to the play button would be along the lines of "what the hell is this thing?"
hollywood
Millennial Farmer Congrats on 1 million subs bud. Well earned by you all on your channel.
Congratulations again on the 2m. You deserve it you and Becky have done a great job
Zach love watching your video's you also need time aways from the camera. Spring is just around the corner.
onna is soo cuttteeeee
Great job Zach. Great channel
I don't understand this trend in buying water in plastic bottles when it is free out of any faucet in your house. Plus the added use of plastic that is already gotten out of control, since most plastic is not recycled. Keep a jug in each machine, or carry it with you and fill as needed. Same container lasts for years. Use our oil for running equipment, not making useless plastic. Otherwise, always interesting seeing what is going on in the farm country of Minnesota.
I would like to thank Jim and Anna for helping to get you to a Million Subs. Didge and cat as well.
Congrats, thanks for the behind the scenes on how everything works
Congratulations on the award Zach!  Every now then you need to take a day off and just look at the ceiling think of the possibilities.
Thank God I live in Oklahoma it's going to be almost 80 sunday
congratulations on getting it
Can you please make more podcasts
Congrats on 1M subscribers. A well deserved reward.
You get snow early or we get it late it never fails
Can't wait for 2M! Awesome job!
Thanks for the update, I just herd that it was Midwest machinery and didn’t know if it was your local dealer or not. Congratulations on the 1 million subs, working on my channel seeing if it would grow. At 125 now.
Thanks for another great video.   It was  interesting and enjoyable.   Thanks for the update on the race shop. Looks like an interesting year for you and onyx. Looking forward to that.   Congratulations on the Gold Award you received. Very good. Most deserving!!!!!  Lots of snow up your way that is for sure. Wow. Keeps the blower busy.   Thanks for the interview with farmer Brian and taking delivery of his chemical products. Busy time of the year for all that stuff.   Spring will be here before you know it Zach and time to get equipment ready for planting and field work.   Thanks for everything Zach. Looking forward to the next video.  Take care and be safe.  The Iowa Farm Boy.
We're here to tell you about snow blindness in cats. It's affecting more and more cats each year, and it scares the livin' shit out of us.
Congratulations one million 🤟
Congratulations 👌
Congratulations Zach, Family and Team on 1M!!!   👍🏼😁
What is company name of that toolbox?
CONGRATULATIONS, Zach and Team. It's good to see you ALL after my short hiatus from your channel. Nothing personal, just got ridiculously busy and had to take a break !! Hopefully, everyone is doing well as we look forward to seeing more of you and your operation !!
It sounds like we have more coming here again tonight & tomorrow. They are talking another batch of snow the middle of next week. Spring can't come soon enough.
I would hate to guess the expense of moving snow all winter but thanks for doing all that you do
Congrats!
$1000 dollars for water!?
never snowed in ct
SUPER JOB
Snow lol yeah you still up there lol 😆😆💺💺🧈🧈⛱️
Congrats! Is there going to be anymore Off The Husk episodes?
Congratulations on the million subscribers Zach. Well done.🎉🎉
You call yourself an "idiot with a camera"?    NO WAY!!!!!!
So awesome to get the gold button.Were proud of yall.
Now Ana gets a ride!
Congratulations on hitting 1 Million
Hard to believe that many are now watching such a wonderful actor...oh wait I meant farmer.
Congrats man. You and your team do a great job, especially Becky.
I love the colors of your toolbox & pegboard. Ps GO DAWGS ❤️🖤!!
Congratulations! 1 million is awesome, keep it up!
congrats on the play button. Couldn't be happier for you.
It was great to meet you out in greenbay congratulations on 1 million
Anna needs a ride now 😊
Zach ....... Congrats on the Gold Button.  Your videos are awesome to watch, even Between the Rows.  The JD Dealership that was impacted in MInnesota, is that the same one you go to? Glad to hear everyone was safe and no one hurt.
Is red and black allowed? I thought all your stuff had to be green?😂
Zach - It would be interesting to hear your take on why farmers are/aren't socialists. From Co-ops to government subsidies, portions of the business model of a farm is based on socialism. Would love to hear your first-hand take.
Congratulations lad
Congrats on the "Gold Standard". I think when I started watching, you had over 100K, I joined anyway. Always entertaining!  Keep at it!
where is the podcast?
This time of the year, you can get 12 inches of partly cloudy pretty easy!!! Ha
Would you want to sponsor 2 wissota midwest modifieds this year?
congrats on the million good job I love the farm videos
Congratulations on this milestone for your channel! Well done!
What about the Greens stuff.
If anyone deserves this , it’s you (and your wife)
Where is the cat?
👍👍
I'm glad that you were able to get away and have family time - yes, it's nice to have you posting here, but your family comes first always! The Gold Button looks pretty nice - I think it speaks highly of the reach that you are having in getting the word out to us.
Hi there . What a great videos again for the BEST farmer... We are getting the biggest snow coming tonight. 2 feet of wet Snow in the Upper Michigan of Eacanaba.. You do a Great job your self at your Farm . I would love to have a Hat or Huddy I met be spelling this wrong but it has your name on it . Well take care of yourself and your family God Bless and Remember that GOD LOVES YOU ALL
I remember in the past when snow fence was always used to prevent drifting onto roads. It was put up about 50 feet away from the roads.
Congrats on the play button. I'm sure you are tired of winter. That is still cold. Northeast Indiana trying to be springish, taking its time this year. Thanks for sharing
I live in Canada and the sun to snow is very annoying congrats on 1 million
Yup, crops won't grow in the snow. Enough already is right. Congratulations on your 1 millionth subscriber award.
congratulations on the 1 million but let's take a better look at that sweet Victory Vegas !!!!!!
I’m glad you and the family got away … I look forward to your posts a lot … your life is important to me… love you Zach
Miss your videos..how come we do not see Anna in the tractor, lol😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Proud for you.  Glad you didn't stick to the retirement you announced from the combine @ 100k. Keep on keeping on buddy!
Just checking in on cat dog
What ABOUT ANNA! The wolf hound needs more rides
Just install a heated driveway, problem solved!
You and Becky and the rest of the family earned that gold play button. Congratulations! On to 2 million...
Warmer days are just around the corner Zach I know ur itchin to go play in the dirt pretty sure ur not alone man lol
Why don’t they sell northern chill water in the gas station?
😎😎😎🙊🙉🙈
a couple of hundred miles, eh?
Congratulations on the 1M.
Congratulations on the 1 million subscriber plaque. You definitely earned it.
Congratulations on a million subscribers. I am one of the million.
Congratulations on the 1 million play button and when is there going to be more off the husk
"You're going to wear the shirt of the band you're going to go see?  Don't bee that guy!"
Family time is always good
Congratulations enjoy your content.
I like how he said said his "hobby".  Take some pride in feeding America Zach.  There is no other deserving channel on YouTube that deserves a gold play button.  You and Becky absolutely deserve it.
A big congratulations to you and Becky for reaching 1 M subscribers on your channel. You both deserve the accolades. Blessings to you all.
Congrats on the play button. You have done great and don't feel bad about not putting out content. You have a family and a farm. And you deserve all the vacations and family time in the world!!!
Zach I live in lower Michigan all i can say is feel for you people in Minesota. You guys were buried.
Zack I know it's a different topic and project. However how is the new project/ range going. Would love to hear about all the goings on.
What happened to the off the Husk podcast?  Keep up the good work!
Are done with off the husk? Sure miss them!!!
Congratulations on hitting 1 million subscribers and getting your gold play button. Spring has come to Western Kentucky. The trees and bushes started budding out a few weeks ago. We had a cold snap with temperatures down in the mid 20s for a few days but it didn’t kill the new buds on the trees and bushes. We will mostly be in the high 60s and 70s from here. The farmers will start planting corn here in a week or two.
Congrats on the Gold Play Button. At 2M subscribers, Anna gets to drive the planter.
Love that yellow Victory!
Congratulations on your 1 million subscribers
Congratulations Zac, Becky and family.  1M subscribers. Who the thought!
Congrats on becoming a millionaire.
Where's the cat Zac?
Awesome job keep up the good work Zach
I watch because of your dry wit.   It’s a black hole of fun.   🎉
It’s crazy how you started a farm so big from a YouTube channel!!!
You better put Anna’s picture with that. Since she was the driver.  More tractor rides for her.  She loves it and don’t forget Didge.
i thought the snow was bad in alberta but apparently not 🤣   congats on the play button i love your videos and channel
What does the sign on your driveway say?
So when does the dog get his tractor ride?
Congrats on the 1million subs....BUT anna still gets a ride once a week!
Congratulations on hitting your goal.
Talking about unreliable weather forecasts...NWS said that here we were going to have a really dry winter with La Nina going in the Pacific.  WRONG!!!!!!!!!!  Not the La Nina part...just the dry weather part.  Half way thru the winter, they were STILL predicting that it would dry out.  It never really did.  Last summer really seemed colder than normal, particularly at night.  I don't think we had any really warm overnights.  Usually there are nights during the summer when the AC never stops running...didn't have ANY of those last summer.  This winter we actually had MORE rain than average...I think like double the average....that was supposed to be dry.  It makes it kind of difficult to work on the farm here with all the rain.
Zach, good on ya’, Becky, Da Kids,Dad, Mom, Jim, everybody! I remember how long ago I started watch and at that point, well, you weren’t close to 100K! You are just too blessed. Also, people don’t know how much the Lutheran churches in the USA have changed. Nothin’ like they used to be. Nevertheless, I appreciate your work for the church. It’s definitely generational(from 1865-present. My family in MN attended Lincoln Church and, as I’ve said too many times, are buried in Barrett, MN Cemetary. The Setne’s(Sethney’s) homesteaded in Elk Grove Twsp. One day I will visit there—-don’t worry, I wouldn’t think of bothering your farm or family. You’re just a great family.
Hope it warms up for you. Where you have yours in snow we have had it in rain. I'm in west central Indiana. Got water still 2 ft. deep in the back of my little patch. It's going down and we have another round on the way tonight. 3-30-23
Hope you enjoyed some time away.
Congrats on the 1 mil. I for some reason thought you had that a long time ago.
Glad you got that button keep up the good work🎉
Congrats on the gold! Love watching your vids! Thanks for all the hard work you do to keep us entertained and educated! And thank you for all your hard work behind the scenes too, Becky!

Jim did a great job getting 1 million subscribers, congratulations Jim keep up the good work.
Congratulations on the play button.
No guest appearance from cat-dog? 😭😭😭
I'm getting motion sick baaaad when the snow is flying around the cab when blowing snow, anyone else?
Congratulation! You deserve it!😊
weather looks like finland!
If I remember correctly you guys were having problems with your planter. Any plans for replacing it this year?
Congratulations on the play button
Congrats Zack, you definitely earned it. I've been watching these videos for so many years!
Great job it is amazing How much you have come in almost 7 years keep up the great work
welp..you probably should have call them home becuase by the time lunch comes around no eatable provided food by the . No offense
The older daughter is definitely game to go cart race
Cops Arrest Loser TRUMP  at His Mom's House
And you have the 1 million follower dog haha
Zach, I think you need to address the sign in the driveway, I don't remember it in previous videos and if it is a problem you should mention it.
I grew up in Shako...
Farm supplies have the same naming conventions as new medications.
Congrats on the button. I hope you had a great time on the vacation.
Congrats on 1 mil thanks for sharing farm life I miss being a part of it as a kid you give me a little slice to keep the memories
Our winter has been pretty mild but I’m am totally ready for it to be over
Congrats!!! Can you believe that Utah has received 400 inches ofsnow this winter.
Don’t worry about where to put the snow, Zach.  April will take care of it.  This advice is from a former snowbound Buffalo area resident now living in the South.
Glad to see you guys back. And congratulations on the Play button 😊. I missed ya. Stay safe and warm. God bless.
CONGRATULATIONS ON ACHIEVING THE GOLD PLAY BUTTON!  Maybe when you reach 2.5 million, Digi can get a ride in a tractor.
Good video can't wait to see more. How much snow have you all gotten this year
Nice.  #!!!   😊😊😊
New work bench should have been Deere Green.  I'll see my way to the door.
In Germany we had a lot of rain in the last two months. No work outside is possible, except wood. Last year i had my spring barley, spring wheat and oats in the ground at this time. About so much moisture, it is not possible to spread lime or manure on  the pasture. I dont wonder, when flippers grow instead of hoofs by my sheep. 🤡
Congratulations on the million subscribers Becky n Zach! Just wait we're going to be dumped on this weekend (3\31-4/2) again! Oh also next week too so don't put that snowblower away. Seen a pic of a combine, combining snow into a dump truck, you might have to do that! LOL
"Nearby" = "couple hundred mile" out in farmland.  Wow.  Here in suburbia, "nearby" = "under 5 miles".  Softies.
Great gold play button you did a great job and earned it you gave a good video can't wait for next video Zack and Becky congrats
Spring in MN usually moves north about 50 miles a week.  You should see it start about the second week of April.  Where I live it will be near May this year.
Soon youtube will make your more money then farming, and then farming will be the hobby. =)
I have learned so much about modern farming from your channel. You give me hope for the younger generation when all you hear on the news is so negative. Also I like the fact you are raising your kids right. Good Americans. Keep you sense of humor and keep on racing.
Little more on the Midwest Machinery, it was deemed a total lose, cause is unknown as far as I know and it was in Madison Minnesota. There was also from what I heard a main gas line the either broke or was leaking.
You don't have to apologize for anything.. You also need your time with family without  us in the middle of it. God bless you and your family. Enjoy the videos when they come out.
Congratulations on 1,000,000 subscribers and all the hard work it takes to run a farm and YT channel. Thank you Becky, the "editor and chief production officer " and all the actors (lol) who make great content for us to watch. Without MF "city folk" would have no idea where our food comes from, well some do like myself.  BTW, the gold button does look bigger than the silver one. Make a nice place for that little trophy😂
I want to be more like you. You're a really good dude.
Some real bad people are burning down food processing plants and farm machinery plants, (they) are trying to starve us out for a "Great Reset" AIN'T HAPPENING PATRIOTS!!!
Good to see new videos, I liked the Midwestern Hoof one too, keep them coming! No pressure …. Oh and Congratulations!
Congratulations on reaching 1 million subscribers.  The snow won’t last forever.
I hope you realize, most of us only watch because of Anna.. 😅 🐕 😅 ❤ y'all!!
You finally got you're one millionth plaque, congratulations.
Nice the danger ranger!!!!  Cant wait to see!
It  must be the global warming causing all that snow.
nice video
Whats with the Victory? I had a 2012 High Ball.
Congrats Zach and family... a well deserved reward.
congrats on the gold button,well deserved
Congratulations on hitting the 1M
Yup, the last week its getting warmer and the days longer...the cats are going nuts Spring is in the air! Good effort on the Mill subs - outstanding and well deserved Congratulations!
Darn no catDog must be hanging out in the house.
Awesome Zach and Family. What a Great Team you have Zach. Would a Snow Fence help you Driveway? Zach next time your Grain Cart can’t move install sheet metal Screws to help with Traction  just like studs in snow tires?   Take Care
Congratulations on the award. I watch " POW Ponder  " on you tube. He explains the weather of the whole northern hemisphere. Check him out. You have alot more weather coming.
I guess if they sent gold dishes for the dogs then they'd have to send pink ones for the girls and where does it end? A Burlap one for Grandad? :p Grats again!
Congratulations !!!
Thanks for the Video Zach!!👍👍
You soon might have to repaint those carts pink or whatever the girls' favorite colors are.
That’s rich man’s water , I buy from Walmart lol 😂
I don't know how much you do business in Hoffman but they lost their elevator, my home town
Good video! Algorithm comment
Nice job on the one million! Outstanding job Becky and everyone else involved behind the scene production! Doing it yourself at this level is remarkable! God Bless you and your Family Zach! Let’s see about helping Brian Brown and the Welker’s grow and catch a million now okay everyone?? Thanks ❤😊🖖🏼🇺🇸
well done on gold award you deserve it as dus becky
Can’t wait for the better weather to arrive so we all can get back on the land planting crops. Keep smiling buddy. Rob from the 🇬🇧🍺
Can you guys fix my water pump on my Ford Ranger
If that Ranger has the 4 L v 6 it’s a rocket ship! I had one it’s fast for a small motor 😏❤️🖖🏼🇺🇸
Really glad that more videos are coming and congrats on the 1,0000 subscribers
Congratulations on the Mil🥇
Thanks for sharing congratulations on the 1m YouTube button
You were borne for this page of yours. Congratulations on the million thing.
Congratulations on the Gold, And the update on the Midwest dealership fire. I was wondering about that situation and your farm.
Congratulations so great to see you get gold. You deserve it. Great channels.
thanks for the update on the Madison MN Midwest Machinery---hope they can rebuild
Ohmmmgeee your a millennial and your not clearing your drive way with GPS tracks like you use in your field work? Im....im shocked Zach. Lol
congrats on 1 Million
What are you doing with all that money??
Must really suck driving  backwards to blow snow
Do you have to move snow every day when it snows or do you just move it when you need to do something? Watching from England 👍
Congrats zach great job happy for you there's alot of work that goes into it for sure hope for many more years cheer's. 🎉
Typical actors have to have their vacation time, lol😅😅
Congratulations on the 1 million..... Next stop 10 million....😊
Maybe I'm biased after watching the crown vic races, but that Danger Ranger looks FAAR to nice for any sort of freedom factory affiliated event.
I read an article about 40 years ago about a dairy farm that built a holding pond and an area to dump snow. He also had a sprayer head to spray water in the air. He would build a mountain of snow and ice he captured the ice water and used it to cool his dairy barn and shop the water went into the holding pond. Then in winter he used the pond water to make another ice mountain.  That's recycling!
Would you consider posting videos to rumble? I know that your views wouldn’t be accepted here on yt. Think it would be cool to see a more unfiltered Zach.
well dun on getting your gold button
Congrats on one million. Anna needs another ride!
Congratulations 👏🎊🎉👏🎊🎉🍻🍻🍻 Zach and to all involved, keep the vids coming mate love from  South Wales U.K  🍻🍻
Wait do u own a yellow victory?
HEY, NO WORRIES about not producing content.  Ole Chet the "other millennial farmer in Minnesota at LARSON FARMS produces vids every day, LOL.  Thanks Zac for making vids, I did miss your content. yes, it snowed last night her in Finger Lakes region of NYS, uhgggg.
One day you will have so many gold play buttons you wont know where to put them all
Zach, I honestly believe that people can see that you're real (the good and the bad) you're honest and you're funny--I've learned so much about soybeans and corn crops from you and tons of stuff not to do with equipment (kidding--remember the demo 9rx and the muddy ground?). The strip till videos have been entertaining as hell--but your brand is authentic and real--sorely needed in this day and age!
Congrats
Congratulations on the golden button😊
We're about the same up here in Southern Saskatchewan for snow and the forecasts.
Congratulations.
One million subscribers doesn't mean anything when you're getting less than half that in views.  I have over three hundred contacts in my phone but only ever call five people.
Makin more on YouTube than farming🤙😎🤙      congrats....Very hard work on both accounts.  God bless you guys
I buy the 20 oz.
Congrats on the million!
Congratulations on 1,000,000 subscibers.  You've done a great job on the channel. Kudos to you to Becky.
Hey young feller I pray to God that he blesses you from clean the snow out of the church parking lot thank you
congratulations on the 1 million subs., love your videos and you can keep the snow, we had enough here and  now the mud season is here in southern Iowa, go figure
Congrats on the plaque. Been a subscriber since the early days. Keep on keeping it between the rows and hope for a million more subscribers
Congratulations love the channel
We’ve missed you!!
Great job congratulations
Love the channel Sir, I'm not a farmer, but I play one on Giants. Congratulations on the Gold Play Button. Your channel is the best on YT. Keep up the great work, you and your family do on a daily basis.
Nice stuff. I've enjoyed this channel more then almost all the rest combined. Good work folks.
Enough with winter, lets get back to work!!!! LOL!!!! Truer words couldn’t be spoke in this just stupid weather in Minnesota!!!!
You still have 4 more  weeks of winter 😂😂
Zach, obviously, brother, you've been blessed. Congrats on the gold play button. Thank you for taking care of that church parking lot, brother. Good looking out. Stay blessed y'all
One of the greatest cover photos ever. No, it is the greatest cover photo ever.
that's what she said!!! ... And Congrats
That is a very good bench on my want list
I think the gold button should be prominently displayed in Ana's dog house.  Couldn't have done it without her.
How does Millennial Farmer afford all of these expensive equipments
YouTube is shutting down a lot of YouTubers. It’s unbelievable.
They should add your freedom water for delivery.  Helps pay fuel.  Deliver full trailers, let them ship with farmers orders as another order stocked product.  The team in WI will thank you.
Congratulations play button hit 1M SUBSCRIBERS🎊🎉⛄💎
😀😂😀😂😀👏👏👏👏👏
Congratulations on the GOOOOOOOOOLD!!
Congrats on the Play Button
Oh, I feel you with the sun and snow thing... in germany we dont have very much snow, however I still know this pain... and whats also bad is, when you have a white concrete ground and the sun is shining bright but its cloudy... same effect...
We love you guys  keep up the good work
1 million congratulations!! You deserve it !! Keep up all the hard work!! Many Thanks
Congrats Zack, it has been awesome watching your content and so much fun to see you hit 1MM Subs.  Really appreciate what you do for the farming community.  Thank you for sharing your farm and family with us.
😀😀😀😀😀👍👍👍👍👍👍
100% feel your pain on the snow we got more today yup global warming 😅 definitely not here in new Brunswick canada
thank you
Congrats on your 1Million milestone.
Looking from Sweden 🇸🇪 from  Charles A Lindbergs farm in Skåne 🚜💪
What tracks do you plan on having Onyx race the MWM at?
Zac and everyone else, congratulations on the million subscribers!!    And as for content, your time away from the camera is just as important as your time on camera. And your family, I think would take precedence over everything else. IMO, there's no need to apologize for lack of content. Be well and safe travels.
You were the first Person I thought of when I heard the News of the John Deere Center burning. Well earned on the Gold Plaque Becky and Zach !!!
Glad that you got to 1 million and got the gold play button
I was 99% sure it wasn't your local dealer, just from how the roads looked around it.
Congratulations to you and your amazing family and friends Zac. Team work makes the dream work.
Lots of hard work to get one million. Thanks 😅.
Gratz on the 1 mil followers, yea the winter is brutal. Remember 2018? It's kinda like that.
You HAVE to get a snowblower where you can drive forwards, and much faster. That backing-up snowblower looks so extremely slow, boring and uncomfortable.
This "spring" has been ridiculous.
Well at least you don't have to care about FBN Australia anymore they went under here.
Shaping up to be a very tight planting season this year. But before that we get the muddy season, after it snows again this weekend, the first of April. Lol
16 minutes and you have 6,200 views....youve come a long way since I started following you at about 100K followers
Can't wait for 20 million subscribers!
Congrats! You guys deserve it!
Congratulations  on your success.  To you and  Becky "6" and the girls. I wish you mote success in the future
I was with you since 600k subs and we made, what a accomplishment congrats!
Yeah I hate the winter this winter was horrible but good we needed the Mostiture And stuff so be careful out there
That ranger looks like it just came off the showroom floor. At least on camera it does. Lol
We know the routine, y'all will wait until two days before planting then rush to get everything ready to go, lol.
Forecasts are nothing but educated guesses.
Congrats to ALL!!!!  You guys do a great job!  TY for sharing!!
Congratulations on getting your gold play button! I've been around the channel for a while, really impressed with how the channel has grown and the quality of content you can put out. Keep up the great work and excited for planting 2023!
Congratulations to you guys for one million subscribers!!!! Love your videos looking forward to seeing you reach two million!!!
Congratulations on the MILLION!!!!
Awesome video thanks guys
Luckely our tap water in the house is the same quality as the botteled water you get by a pallet load.. lol  And thats for about 2 dollars a 1000 liters.. lol
Thanks Zac! Where is cat dog? Always loved seeing the cat dog!
Endless winter ❄️❄️ thanks for the video Zach congrats on the Gold play button.

You guys got a lot more snow up there than we have down here in southwest MN.  Except for the snow mountains, pretty much everything else has melted!
6:48, 😂😂😂 I'm Dead 😂🤣
Around since 120,000 subs. Great job!
how bad is your tap water if your buying a pallet of water i dont get that about the usa most powerful country on earth most money the best tech the best stuff dog shit infrastructure why cant you drink your tap water at home ??? and not get a pallet of water
Where's the 4K?

Thanks again hope to see you hit 2M soon.
Congratulations on the 1M subs !!!! When are you going to give the puppy a ride in the tractor..........you said you would give her a ride once you got to 1M ..............we are looking forward to it. Thanks
Congratulations
So glad the Production Team & Family are back at it and hopefully had a GREAT well deserved vacation! Spring has gotta be coming!
Question how many hours did you put on the 6r this winter
I think at least 200,000 are here to watch Jim.
You should try out fs22
You should see if they can make the same farm as yours on the video game on fs22 .
Congratulations on the gold play button
Thanks for all your time and effort to keep us entertained!  Now let's get a tractor stuck!
