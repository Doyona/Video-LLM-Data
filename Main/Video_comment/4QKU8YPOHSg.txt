I post my most authentic videos on my 2nd channel - https://youtube.com/c/TheFrankMichaelSmithShow
Is that Ronaldo in in FCB jersey? :0
He will come back now ig
Don't cry don't cry 😢😭
xavi at least has been doing amazing with Barca right now he was able to bring in a ton of world class players like lewandoski kessie and richarlison for only 150 million euros
Man i thought at first that he divorced his wife😂
People can say all things.. But Messi did cost 500 mil in 5years to Barcelona before he left
This video is really informative you should do more soccer vids
Back when MSN was happening in Barca is when I fell in love with soccer/football and when Neymar left I lost almost all Interest but now that Neymar Messi and mbappe are together I can’t wait.
I was so sad
I want more soccer, boxing and ufc vids they’ll be amazing
Had me crying seeing him leave barca after many years of awards and good matches
oh shit. so I'm glad to know waht messi left gracefully and with full dignity
All it proves is he went for the money could of signed last year and tried to force a move now looks what happened. He would never make it In the Premier league
Funny, Bill Belichick signed his resignation from the Jets on a napkin, but nobody has it
It's so sad 😔😔
Is that a fact or not. Messi is so understanding and show his love for barca. He is still ok with 50pc to stayed in the club. Yea. The club do have a reason.
WHO CARES,  BUNCH OF LAWN FAIRYS
Yo this dude is lowkey my favorite Tic-Toker
Cant believe how sad people are getting about this stuff. Was about time that la Liga punished barca for their bad money Management. In the german legaues teams get punished for much smaller things. Mallorca has been relegated a league for beeing 50-80 Millionen in debt. meanwhile barca sitting there with 1 Billion in dept. Should have been punished a long time Ago.
Damn it’s a whole different relationship between American players and ownership and European soccer players and ownership… americas Are used to that good old slavery system.. and the European ownership it’s just like we love you man sorry we can’t keep up with you bro…Completely different dynamic interesting 🧐
Yo Frank Can you do cricket videos please You do all other sports which are less known by 2.2 billion people in the world or around that Plus can you do famous cricketers Cricket leagues Especially ipl and psl Ipl is the second biggest sports league in the world Psl is highly growing league with only being started in 2016
Excited to see him play
Not that I'm doubting you but I thought that one of the reasons they could not sign messi was that they were pushing for the super league so they took money
Soccer sucks
Barca is better of messi
What is the total value of the Barcelona team, compared to their debt to that player?  Note how the Pittsburgh Penguins Ice Hockey team had to pay their star, Mario Lemieux.  They gave him the team, lock, stock, and barrels, and walked away with nothing.
You 8-2 see him go
and corruption
I don't know anything about soccer, so this is a genuine question (s)...  How long has Barcelona led the league in revenue?  Has it been for quite a while?  A billion dollars of organizational debt is a *lot* ... more than most people can even conceptualize, literally.  Are they brutally mismanaged, or riddled with corruption?
I use to buy they jerseys because the looks nice but never in my life I watch a game of soccer
I knew this but ill give u a follow 🙃
When you give one player 650 million dollars 4 year contract, these things are bound to happen. By the way, Leo Messi's 50% salary is over $70M annually which is near double of a normal contract.
Plzzzz do more videos on football ( soccer 🙄)  Because I don't really find other sports interesting
Why does this man looks like steven gerrard???
Better than oh my goal lol
Messi just wants money he can stop with the crocodile tears
We will remember the legend
Leo Messi woooooooooooow fucking love him he is the best
Eyy I liked that you covered this (:
Now my Messi shirt is useless 😣
Hi
PSG is about to blow up with the greatest team . They took Neymar before, and they're getting Messi now.
I swear I thought this was about Kanye and Kim k or something 😅
More football vids please ⚽️⚽️
This is the only time I liked cuz I actually knew this
Mr bartomeu, there is special spot in hell reserved just for you
If messi cared so much for Barcelona he would’ve took the pay cut
Cool
Bartomeu threw
Imagine being told a corporation could no longer afford you 0.o
Messi, truly a king👑
Yeah, he'd take a 50% wage cut to stay with Barca, what people don't know is, his contract was 4 YEARS $674 MILLION DOLLARS
When I heard the first phrase I just knew it had to be about messi.
Why did Spain move out of the outhouse because the Italians were making too much noise downstairs.
So messi in psg, France 🇫🇷. 💪💪💪
MESSI is the 🐐!!!!
Didn’t he try to take bigger than 50% they just don’t allow that?
Finally he talks about something I know about
But now Barça can focus on the true goat
Should of come to the prem to see how walking every match works there
A like !
You shall have neither. Quit askin
When an american is talking about football, and then asking for a like at the end of the video, that is an automatic thumbs down.

When you sign players for RIDICULOUS amounts then give them RIDICULOUS contracts this is what you get..
Just 1 billion dolars ? Nah barca debt is 1350 million euros like 1.6 billion
That's what it is money messi was a dollar sign to them glad messi left he deserves better but someone would say he did it all for the money no 13 he wasn't thinking money he was a kid having fun until he became a man😎
poor aguero
im not a big barce fan but that last day of messi being at camp nou did make me tear up
By the way the reason he did 50 percent was because in Spain it’s illegal to cut somebody’s salary by more than that
cant wait till ppl see football gone itll be the best day
Rip barca, they would probably lose like 75% of their money cuz they still pay sergio aguero even tho hes not playing
You got a lot of things wrong. Messi decided to take a pay cut of 50% but wanted more years in his contract so the contract would’ve effectively remained the same. An American company was willing to inject 2 billion in the league which could’ve helped Barca keep Messi but Barca refused as if they accept that money, there would be no Super League. So effectively Barcelona chose Super League over Messi
Pronounced Barka
That 50% pay cut is still more then what I make in 10 years.
South Africa 2.0 🤣🤣
That's what happens when you pay over 200mill for griezman and dembele
is all started from bartomeu
Yawn, this is boring, I don't care for this, such a boring recommendation. Disliked. Could care less about these people.
This guy goes from NFL to NBA to MBL to ESPN and to football with out a problem. WHAT A LEGEND
Who knows what the background beat/song is from?
That shit hurted
He helped bankrupt the club with his outlandish salary, cried in a press conference, and left for Paris hours later.
Oh no, how will they ever survive with a pay cap of 180 million euros? That's hardly enough for 6 180ft yachts.  Im kidding and i have a lot of respect for athletes
so that’s what’s going on with messi. i keep hearing about him but didn’t know what happened
I love this Channel and this guy always goes straight to the point with accurate info...keep it up bro
Its so sad to see him leave after being with the club for over a decade i was huge messi and barca fan i will continue to support messi but it just want feel the same seeing him wearing a psg jersey🥲
This is like united aswell cause of the glazers
Half ur “facts” were fiction. & btw we don’t deal in dollars 😏
Do more football (soccer) video’s bro 👌🏻
You should come clean with your gf/wife if you're having an affair
I don't think Messi is the greatest. He gets plenty of goals in La Liga and probably in France because those leagues aren't that competitive. He never really impressed on international level. Ronaldo on the other hand has proven he can be great in the toughest league and he's won trophies at international level.
GOD BLESS
I actually new this one unlike all the others he soes
Good to see lots of different sports especially football 😄
Oh no he's ONLY making 180 million now. How will he survive?
F MESSI WE LOVE HIM
Barca 07
How about a dislike instead
More football related content please
But now he’s back with neymar so yay
It’s so crazy how messi is so overpayed
Funny, how the entire country of Mexico is the same as this team lol at the end of the day, only the people at the top get what they want, and fvck everyone else right.
How did a person eating a bat that lead to a pandemic come to this🥺
And I would Settle For a Dislike as I knew it and still u asked for it in a cringy style
The staff of barca is a scandal and does the work poorly. They should get a new one. Not every staff but finacel
Thank you 🙏🏽
Too Easy🔥🐊
Messi got too big for the club and they couldn't afford to pay him €500,000 a week anymore. Nothing shocking.
What sucks about Barca and the super league is that they probably don’t want it but their debts are really giving them hell
lol million/billion aires making less millions ohhh noo who gives a shit
Spanish business is just wild
Channel called Tifo does an excellent job explaining the politics of socios in la Liga :)
Half the people who will watch this are American so they barley know the name to the face
Barca without Messi is like peanut butter jelly sandwich without jelly :(. I hope he does well in Paris, ik he's already changing Paris 🐐🧔👑
It's those damn wages if nothing else. They have only themselves to blame. The mismanagement at barca has been a thing for far too many years
I thought messi onely wanted money but its because off laliga rules he can only cut off 50% off his money he was earning in he last season
Ik that messi signed with PSG
Oh my god stop I've cried enough jeez
mesi
I have no idea what he’s talking about yet he’s entertaining
When you think about it, they bought all those players because of Messi, to build around him and it just didn’t work as many of them turned out flops. It’s not just Bartomeu’s fault, they gave crazy money for unmotivated players who can’t deliver now. I’m a Real Madrid fam but I wish he stayed. For the first time in years, El Clasico is gonna suck.. also, Barca wasn’t one of the last to pull out of Super league, Real, Barca and Juve are still officially in for the project
AFTER messi left for psg barca  kit sales  dropped  over 80%
Messi’s got most of the one billion. Perhaps he could help out?
Any club signs Messi will be in debt
As fan of Fcb this sad for we lost Messi but we young team and the future well be the best team trust
They're all drastically overpaid anyways.
Came here just to point out the terribly worded caption "would have loved to see Messi go out like Kobe"..... think about what you just said
It was more of a gradual decline. Bad leadership (Bartomeu as president, terrible manager choices after Enrique quit), bad contracts (Griezmann, Dembélé, COUTINHO), and an over dependence on Messi brought down the club. Now Agüero is out on an injury, but Griezmann is slowly returning to his Atleti form and Fati is coming back, and they have Depay. Hopefully they can come back to their former state with their GOAT gone.
Messi even tried to leave Barca in their best interest with a hefty transfer fee. Yet Josep Maria Bartomeu. Some how effed that up. By forcing him to leave on a free because the club couldn't pay even half his wages.
What the fk  do you know about  football  stick to stocks  and shares
John 3:16 "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life."  Have a blessed day, brothers and sisters in Christ! : )
love hip hop . are you ok ?
No es el primero ni el ultimo que se queda sin trabajo el wey ese es cualquier cagada
i think he'll come back, he signed a 2 year contract only
Barça was deeply affected by Bartomeu. The crazy thing is that la liga and UEFA scrutinize Barcelona, but PSG can pretty much do whatever they want, zero finacial fairplay.

LOL what a joke
Pep Guardiola isn't a fan (at least publicy) of the superleague. In Spain Barca only have regular competition from Real Madrid (and maybe Atletico once a decade). Not sure why they want the superleague - they don't need it - and they wouldn't win as much. Their revenue would increase though...
Jesus loves you
I mostly see videos about basketball but It feels good to hear this from you bro❤️
I feel bad for Messi
Don’t make me sad even tho I know he wanted to stay :(
Pls follow f1
I didn’t know this thank you very much
You failed to mention that Messi has a lot to do with their debt in the first place
I’m from Europe and the day I heard that, was a sad day.. my brothers fav player!! No longer on his fav team!
Whats a super league?
money money money and fuckin money..
They got aguero for free so I guess that's a win
This news broke most of soccer/football fans
They just dont wanna win Barca anymore🤣
They were 1 billion in debt partially due to making messi happy and paying off his enormous contract
Steven Gerrard is that you??
Where La masia, just where.
People with so much money they have to find something to complain about
Man I feel like they should be the richest with all the gold they stole from the natives of central South Americans as well as the tainos
messi
Fact is, Messi wanted to leave the year before, he said so himself. Barce made plans to survive without him, then he wanted to stay. The salary cap was lowered and because Barce had tied down others the year before, Messi had to go. Really, if he loved his club that much, he should have suggested a 75%+ paycut (because he is on way more than everyone else). It's not like he needed the money but he went to PSG, he'll be on more money now but the tax in France is a lot higher.
Still depressing that messi left😔😔
No wonder most clubs joined Super League. I’m still glad it was cancelled tho
Dont you forget lord bartomeu and his board's mismanagement. Over paying for avg players and running campaigns to stigmatize club legends to save his own face.
end of an era Barca will be a shambles without the best player of all time
Frank when you're going to tell us inside stories of IPL ??😂
My dude doesn't change clothes 🤭🤯
Ben stokes vid?
1.4 billion in debt actually from being the first club to have 1 billion on revenue
Song credit - Patient by Post Fucking Malone
Should have included the past presidents horrible financial decisions in the things that lead to our teams downfall atm
🥺
First time u are doing soccer!!
Don’t really care about Soccer,what is this in NBA terms?
Mate do u need a new hoodie, lmao 😂
Idk why but I always cringe so hard when you’re saying your outro. The smiles, what you say, fuckin everything
Bartomeu and Laporta should be in jail right now. FRICK THEM
Soccer is a demonic sport much like most of the sports. But this sport was popular during the Myan era , after they killed the ppl they sacrificed,  they would kick the head around and soccer was born from that
It’s heartbreaking as a Barcelona fan, but he deserves better.
Laliga doesn't realize now that most of their fans has drop because their all messi fans
Funny how Elon musk could pay their debt off and his bank would barely take a dent
imagine sense psg took messi barça takes neymar it sound dumb but thats just a imagination
Damn. So Messi has no choice to leave the team?
I think that since ronaldo went to juventus la liga started to fall down to this point
The goat has left
I never thought of it like that
The country or the club?
Ronaldo still better
Barcelona and messi is my shit that's my goat my idol and I see messi really happy in PSG
Oof
I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me Philippians 4 13
Nice
Unheard of what Man City and PSG are doing while extremely well-run clubs like Bayern can not compete with them financially... Absolute disgrace
Why are they digging themselves so deep. Debt is no joke.
Real Madrid have the highest revenue in La Liga.
Yes some football videos more pls
Its not that simple, bartomeu the former barca president left the club in ruins after financially ruining them and wasting hundreds of millions because he wanted to. He left the club destroyed from the inside out wth no structure whatsoever and on top of that a 2 billion euro debt
Almost brought a tear to my eye hearing the news of this transfer. Leo is my favorite player and Barça has been my favorite team since right around when I graduated high school in 2005. Being a French speaker, I do like PSG, but the football world will forever be changed after Messi's departure from Barcelona and La Liga.
It's  Bar ca
Messi shoudlve went to arsonal
Its not the fact you watch almost every sport, but the accuracy in your “documentaries”.  Anyways, as a fellow Malaysian, I’d appreciate it if you could make a vid on Lee Chong Wei.
Messi can go to psg but I'll always be barca💙❤ Visca barca y visca catalunya
This is why I love Frank, he talks about all of the sports, hopefully one day he'll make a gaa video 🙏🙏
Pain
I post my most authentic videos on my 2nd channel - https://youtube.com/c/TheFrankMichaelSmithShow
What tf is Barca?
😭😭 MESSI WILL ALWAYS BE THE GOAT 🐐 💙❤
the reason is: Spanish teams are only allowed to put 70% of there revenue into salary’s. Even if messi played for free, Barca‘s salary expenses would still be at 95%. Even the players they signed this summer cannot be registered.
I think you can have a better outro... Your content is good enough that you don't need to beg for likes and follows
Sad to see a legend go
You need to make a video on the GAA
That's actually kinda sad
They could've just sold the deadwood called Umtiti, Coutinho, Pjanic. Their performances aren't matching their contracts.
Always to the point 👌
They bought bunch of failure players  since pandemic started and sold so shit manager
JESUS LOVES YOU
Finely we get a football video ⚽❤️
Tooo easyyyyyyyyyy
They are all corrupt little rats
Soooo.... do you follow every sport? I’m impressed
