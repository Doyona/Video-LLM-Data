GOD BLESS YOU ALL!  ✝️🙏🏻❤️
It was a good save Ben but you must admit you were NOT on the goal line... You got away with one there bud
What an icon he is, proud the figure like this played for United
You are all class mate, seriously all class.
Has to be said, he stepped off the line before the pen was struck so really it should of been retaken.
Stay foz, im not one to beg but your so welcome, stay, what a bloke 👏👏👏
I seem it what a save your a good kepper
As an American, I'm already looking forward to season 2 of Welcome to Wrexham.
Was a great save but Foz is really milking it big time. Probably going to do a world tour.
The reg in last UCL match between bayern and man city, the ref tried to make it about him.
Legend
You moved off your line and dived
Sick save. But you came off your line early and players encroached into box before ball was kicked.
Well Ben you’ve been the perfect signing, not just your skill but your enthusiasm and all round positivity, nice one mate 👍 Man U Salford
I mean it's part of the hollywood script?  The writings on the wall ! Love ya podcast and attitude to life  !  Shoutout from Australia :)
Step 1 - Stand a yard off your line
Tbf, the penalty shouldn't have been given because there was a blatant foul in the box in the build up, guy with arms all the way round literally hugging with all his might tryna stop the Wrexham defender stepping out to close down the wide player. Mind, wouldn't have got this incredible drama at the end if that had been spotted.
Brill…but Ole Gunnar Solskjar might disagree with the last statement Benno😉👍
Love listening to Ben break it down like that. As a neutral I will be following the Wrexham story a lot more closely because of him.
It's nozza, did you murder them Ben!
Can't get this to your box so I'm trying this option. (Sorry). Any chance you can get Del Morgan on podcast to discuss her saves especially the one in last couple minutes to allow women to win promotion??
Milking the penalty
Good save Ben mate we should’ve put our striker on it instead
Buzzing for fozzy🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
Elephant in the room. You were off your line by a country mile. 😉
Hope you resign for another year in league 2. Than consider a girl keeping coach role.  Close to home, close to family and friends, and giving back to the club and community.
where’s the go pro angle
You were off the line Ben.
Not showing go pro cam of that save is criminal. Police this guy here
Definitely off the line Ben for this! Should’ve been retaken! I’m not taking any glory from you but you definitely cheated the system there lad!
It was a handball but what about the judo throw on the Wrexham player trying to get out to block the cross 😂  Karma wins in the end, fair play Ben! Only a few to play now
Good save but you did come off your goal line. Keepers have it hard enough though.
Love love love access to content like this Ben!!
You were literally a yard off your line when he took the pen, great save but come on should be retaken
That moment was a product of dreams. Retired, then returns to the club that he pretty much started his career at to help them get promoted, and then pulls off a penalty save against their rivals. Pure dramatic poetry.
Love what Ben has done for us football fans, getting immediate and genuine reactions from people we adore love this so much!
That penalty save will go down in Wrexham FC folklore
Great clip.  Fozzy will be dining out on that save for years😂
Why has there been no release of the go pro clip!!! How much have Disney paid for the clip?
SUPER BEN FOSTER IN GOOOOALLLL
Ben's vast experience of being a GK really comes out in this episode, the amount of different things he thinks of to make it as hard as possible for his opponent to score. Quality guy and a top shelf GK!
I have enjoyed football for a long time, mostly CONCACAF and World Cup, a little MLS, and passing attention to Europe, but I caught a little fire with Wrexham and watched last season and now this.  But Ben Foster, you legend.. You made me fall absolutely in love with this sport.  Your Fozcast, your attitude, the way you treat people, the way you talk about the sport.  You're an absolute gem, an incredible ambassador for the sport.  Thank you!
I haven't watched a game like this for years, so good. If VAR was there Wrexham would have had the advantage (just) but i think it was the best advert for getting rid of VAR xxx
So happy for Ben, he's thriving and his gratitude is on show. Goalies are just a different breed of footballer, the best kind. ❤
To be fair X 100
U stepped of the line on the pen.
Is that other guy the Tom who Jaackmate used to do a podcast with
By stepping off the line before the ball was kicked maybe ? ..lol
Great times at Wrexham. Even better times to come.
3:05 they (wrex) would have been level at 101 pts with one gave in hand
Watched the game in North Dakota, both loving the game and hating it because it was my blood pressure up! I have super low blood pressure! It takes a lot to raise it. I have fallen in love with team. Thanks for saving that PK.❤
Ben is an absolute legend 💪🏼 Wouldn't want anyone else in goal..!!  Wrexham is starting to turn in to a fairytale story.. Ben sign up for another year..!! 👍🏼
Get that new contract signed! 2023-2024, here we come.
Would have thought the GoPro would do the opposite, I’d think you were going to dive to where the GoPro is to capture the save on camera?
What a great insight 👏
Well done buzzing for ya Ben good stuff 👍
Fluke
Your a master of the dark arts fozzy I saw you were miles off your line as the penalty was taken wouldn’t of gotten away with it in the prem 😂
So many good insights on goalkeeping specially on saving a penalty. What a banger Ben.
Absolute tosh. A draw wouldn’t have done anything for us? Only 3 points would’ve made a difference.
I love that after the save the guy twatted the ball out of the stadium😂
Notts fan here. Thanks for being honest Foz. Thought the ref had a decent game in what was a massive pressure atmosphere. Think the title is yours now but it would be so good if we get promotion too to top off a wonderful story. And we'd get another 2 games against you next season! 😃
I think the wrong words got capitalised in the title
It was a hurried poor penalty taken by someone who hasn't taken a penalty all season. That's why you saved it Ben. You super Hero You
"I know its on tele, but it's not about you"... 😭🤣🤣
So Wrexham moves up to league 2….will you play the season?
Great discussion all and filmed in my nans front room 😂😂👍👍
Love the detail in this story
I watched the Wrexham game for Ben, as a united fan i he’s taken over joe rogan for me as my favourite podcast, and I was landed when he saved that pen 96 mins buzzing for him and what a game it was !
One of the best soccer moments I’ve ever seen.
Genuinely think Ben would make a great pundit, would give a more realistic insight into players and the games instead of all the bullshit other pundits say for views
excellent stuff ben excellent.
Ben must live there is no var in that league.   Otherwise him taking a step over the line would have been a retake
Ben should play for Notts County next season.
thought you said the analysis said to your left but the way he shaped up meant he had to go to your right?
The referee was horrendous though and their was a clear bias against Wrexham.
I am a beginner YouTuber and would really appreciate any advice on how I can improve my videos.
Imma hooked now mate,Epic save!! Wrexham shirt here we come
I hope you play next season to help with another promotion.
That was really great insight to his approach and what he was feeling in that moment. He's played at the highest level in football with and against the best in the world and still has such passion for a game at non-league. What a legend.
A lesson for you penalty takers, either stand wide of the ball of jog wide on the run up else you’ll give away your direction.
great game foz but u left the line before the kick so lucky no VAR :-)
With both your feet off the line.
I mean, you were off your line before he took it, so that must play some part...
I am a goalkeeper myself I couldn’t do that my self
Legend
Dead pool 3 cameo incoming
Haven't seen the GoPro in the goal footage yet 👀
So as a Man Utd fan, the last time I screamed my head off at a footballing moment, was when a certain Norwegian bloke scored a 93rd minute winner in a Champions League final!  Your save, simply one of those moments that you will never forget if you were watching live! Now please, please consider staying next season.. :)
Wasn't every detail of the save tho was it...
Where’s the football fill in
FOZZY NEEDS TO STAY ON ONE MORE YEAR AS A PLAYER/GOALKEEPING COACH IF HES UP FOR IT  Genuinely one of the most entertaining games I've ever watched, and literally the biggest non league game in the history of football. Buzzing for Fozzy!!
Listened to the full podcast, one word; amazing. Thanks Ben. Special mention to Tom too, class👍
I found myself crying as I saw the highlights... What a beautiful story this is!
Did you not come off your line before the penalty was taken Benjamin?
I'm a goalkeeper myself, I've faced a couple penalty's, saved 1 out of 3, it's harder than it looks.
I Could Murder A Fozcast
A not so long ago PL GK saves a pen in non league football. Shock horror
Will you still play for them in league Two
Ben doesn't usually celebrate saves because Roy Keane probably told him that it's his job when he first joined Man Utd. 😂
Great save Ben. What a moment lad.
Buzzin Ben Foster
Them two need their money back from whomever did their tattoos I know that
Jesus Christ, proper milking this for all it's worth aren't you! So now there will be only two things you'll be remembered for, putting a camera in the goal and a penalty save
It's crazy how Wrexham have overtaken Salford as the outside team after the Class off '92 and the BBC documentary. But the whole Hollywood and now Fozzy but that save damn!! Unreal football drama.
Ben that save topped off a brilliant match was buzzing for you and your teammates
The go pro theory is legit. That’s why when I coach my goalkeepers I tell them to leave their towels and bottles in the centre of the net behind the goal.
3:17 would only 1 point not 3 in the table
FANTASTIC CLIP!
You were just thinking before you saved that penalty "Think of the content."
Hey Ben, just spoke to Jim and he told me to say hi to you. Are we allowed to announce your contract extension yet officially? We are all so pleased youve decided to stay for another season. Come on you dragons! 💪💪💪
No one going to mention that he’s off his line for the pen? 🤣
Up the fozcast another banger 🔥
Greatest of all time
Great save was delighted for you 👏👏👏👏
As soon as the pen was given I said “Foster saves this”. Was actually shocked to be right 😂
how? you went to the right side.
F*cking Epic! Dont think ive ever been privy to a game saving goal breakdown like this. Pure Victory! Seen alot of soccer, across all levels, this game will go down as an all timer. Excited to see the w2w version of this on Hulu.
You guessed a way and dived Not much too it Ben 🤣
I think Wrexham signing ben has given them the spot light in the football World there getting more views than the top prem teams and the football world is totally invested in Wrexham its crazy its all people talk about from grass roots up I do hope they win the league best business Wrexham has done its the stuff people makes films out of
Where was the second half footage from the GoPro? And is there no TFFI this week?
Brilliant
Fozy! Congrats on the massive save! These are the moments every professional, semi-professional or amateur footballer can only dream of. Really poetic for you considering the circumstances of you joining Wrexham.  Going to be supporting your team and you for the rest of the season from Thailand.
Foz, I hope you gave the lads in the wall a right good bollocking! If the the wall would have jumped Bostock wouldn't have scored. Also, the defending for NCs 2nd was shocking. Amazing win for us but we made it hard for ourselves. Command the back line Foz ffs. Other than that your are now a Wrexham legend.
Glad to your still playing big man ⚽️ not bad for a recycling advisor😏
Ben's the ledge ....  what a guy
Another £1 million question, why is there no video about the disaster at halifax
Awesome episode. If anyone here hasnt given the full podcast a go, please do. Was an incredibly enjoyable hour spent
When I hear fozzie talk about Wrexham, he always sounds like he’s not part of the team and is just helping out. “I’d have felt awful for the lads” etc. I wonder if he feels like that
I heard the wrexham commentator when the plays jumped on fozzy celebrating and the commentator said "oh dont do that to him hes 40 and very fragile" made me Lmao 😂👍
Love it!
was a wild moment.
This moment has gone straight into football folklore. Right up there with the Deeney goal, the Jimmy Glass goal, the Aguero goal.. goosebumps. Go on Ben!
If Notts win all their games and wrexham lose 1. Notts can win the league. Wrexham must still win all their games.
Don't agree it's easier to go their bottom right If they right footed because u don't wanna go across yaself even thonya saved it 🙈🤣🤣🤣
I Love how Ben riding this wave til the wheels fall off😂😂 probably the only guy I can l2 speak about the same moment for a week straight.. If it was anyone else I could never.. But this guy is sucha genuine guy you actually want to see the different takes
i think this is a perfect finish to the career if he decides not to sign for another year!
As a goalie myself, saving a penalty is ecstasy. I couldn't imagine what it's like saving a 96 min one🫣
How he saved the penalty. Figured which was he was going from pure experience.
The coach said in his vlog that he said left anyway lol
I wish I had this sort of content when I was a young keeper. Absolutely buzzing for you Ben and love that the next generation can look up to you for advice and tips.
What a save the timing of it all, the mass of the game, world class that, on a side note quality from the ref though, stick to the decision firm but fair response, that's also world class.
What a game. Am not a wrexham fan, but i been following the team since watching the documentary. I was at my local team watching them frighting for going up aswell and watching the game. Ben, what a save. Super Ben froster in goal.
Who would have thought that one of Ben's greatest football moments would come months after retiring? Buzzing for you mate, legend!
I would obviously love to see more GoPro in goal but would love to see Ben live life or coach one day. HECK OF A SAVE OVER THE WEEKEND FOZZY!!!!!!!
Hopefully we get a football fill in soon! Great seeing you back Ben!
Spoiler* he dived the right way
Yeah fair play to the ref, stood by his guns and wasn't swayed.
Hope he mentions the fact that he rage quit the go pro at half time lol. His other video was just a highlight video we could watch in 3 mins
Bro is humble I would have been milking that moment heavy 🤣🤣🤣
Agent goldbridge been leaking some stores recently😂
I think Ben will continue his stay with Wrexham for another season, be it a player or goalie coach.
Are you signing another contract for next season one more season with the go pro will be class 💯👍
i never thought i would be watching a non league game with this much intent.
Jumped the right way. 😝😝😝
Yes fozzy lad go on what a double save absolute og!
went straight onto Spotify and listened to my first Fozcast episode after this 🔥👍
Big deal ffs, shit league. Thinks he is a decent keeper now hahahaha
This man loves himself. Also who refers to themselves as Foz. What a knob
Who is that other guy?
What a Game !!
You was off your line 😂 cheat
always got to show the good and the bad ben, life aint perfect for anyone. Release the halifax vlog
A bit gutted he didn´t mention the fact he was about 4 inches out of the line with both feet when the opponent kicked the ball, as he must have watched that when analyzing the game
Stoked for you Ben. Could not have happened to a better guy
watched the game from Poland! I told my brother you were gonna save the pen and you did. we were celebrating as it was my team winning!
By being off your line when it was hit???
10k views within minutes, congrats ben, you’re a fun guy to watch!
Haha he can't wear other clubs footy shirts any more
Ben foster should never buy a pint every again. If you see Ben in a pub as a Wrexham fan you better buy this man a pint.
Ben did you know if var was involved you would have to save again because you were off your line. But I am so pleased for you
Long story short you jumped to your right and saved a football 😂😂😂😂😂this is the most overblown story this year IT WASNT EVEN A TOUGH SAVE 🤷🤣
Ben Foster is the best gk in the World. 😂,  absolutely love the guy.
HOLY CRAP !!!   WHAT A SAVE!!!   YOU ARE THE MAN!!! GO WREXHAM, STAY FOCUSED, KEEP YOUR FOOT ON THE GAS AND WIN OUT THE SEASON AND BRING HOME THE LEAGUE CHANPIONSHIP IN STYLE !!!
big up ICMAP
The player kicked a baw and I threw myself in that direction
Think of the pressure the lad had , now think of sakas euro pen pressure
Best game I’ve watched this year
That was magic Ben !! Massive kudos to you !!!!
Roy Keane: "That's your job!"
aawesome dude
Milking this save much?
Penalty should have been retaken because you were off your line before he hit it
The big $1M question is , will you Ben be signing another contract for Wrexham for the 2023-24 season ?
The ref was shocking all game to be fair even if that was a pen.
Low penalties and more difficult to save. What a save
If the answer's not "with my hands" I'm gonna be a little surprised
Golden gloves
Where’s the GoPro footage of the save Fozy?
What Ben said about the PK is the perfect attitude: The pressure is all on the kicker there. When you hold that in your head, it loosens you up and allows you to do amazing things. But still... What a save! Incredible!
“I jumped to the right and the ball hit me”
It was destiny! Fozzy i’m back to Wrexham from retirement and 18 years to the day saved a penalty, if that’s not destiny I don’t know what is
Where is the gopro footage
what a legend
WWWWWWWWW
best save of the season 🙌
Love ya fozzy !!! Come on reds much love from Florida!!!
I LIKE IT I LIKE IT I LIKE IT I LIKE IT HERE WE GOOO OHHH SUPER BEN FOSTER IN GOAL
Cheers Ben loved it.
You were a beast, Fozzie!!!
Any vlog in halifax?
