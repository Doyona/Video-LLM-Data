I haven't watched this guy in years...
I don't know about you but I was laughing the hole video
wait how did she arrive at the exact same time he mentioned at 1:24
yOOOO U WERE LITERALLY MY CHILDHOOD
I used to be subscribed to joe  but he has getting low views and he needs to quit YouTube and he has been on it for a long time now, he has become less popular.
Animals: Have a specific mating session Some Humans: Imma cry if you reject Others: Hey baby Some more: here are tons of gifts The point: Human mating sessions are all over the place
imy
He hasn’t posted in months :(
NOT THE NANG BEING CALLED A WW2 BOMB
Where did it all go wrong mr joe? Haha 🤣
The fact you didn’t give a warning before showing the damn spider... lmao... the things nightmares are made of... truly.
EW WHAT IS THIS
After realising you’re an INFP I like your videos even more. You’re so confident and you seem like a very mentally healthy INFP, or at least you act like it 😅 Or you just want to keep it to yourself. But your confidence when you’re in the spotlight is admireable, so I’ll keep hanging around as a fellow INFP.
I think lockdown is getting to y’a 😂
Thsi is the best video I have ever seen
This has to be one of the funniest videos for a long time. Tx❤️
Pensando solo norman , music from paraguay, support new artists please......
3:46 me when i get a christmas present, dont like it, but dont want to be rude
dead af
I’m crying at the singing and hand flapping 😂😂 why are you the cutest couple?!
Dianne is so sweet omg
I haven’t watched you in years lol
Hahahahahahahaha. The singing in bed part 😂
Yo, Dianne is amazing in the morning. You wake me up at 1am to a mating ritual, you bout to be beaten😂
oh bless him he doesn’t know what a noss canister is. protect this man at all costs
Hi
The noss canister 🤣
Who's here from the wheel
My question is how many times was Dianne actually in the mood that full week 😂😂
I leant that nudging a girls arse with my nose doesn’t get you layed but instead just gets you a restraining order
Why did u stop YT?!!!! We need entertainment!!! 😭😭😭 u better be married now at least unlike freya and josh
I haven't laughed so much at a ThatcherJoe vid in such a long time
hi joe i really love your videos i always watch you when I'm feeling down as you are always the one to cheer me up
dis guuurl is the one joooooe
Anyone who disliked this video deserve to go to hell
I’ve never laughed so much than watching this video
Hey i think it would be really cool if u attempted ti speak scotish
I think the bear grylls shower would have sealed the deal 😂😂😂
Wow nice bro
Thats the type of things i want to do to a future partner, always thought animals mating calls were awesome, want a second part of it
this is literally the best video ever i’m dying 🤣
He didn't lose fans. They just grew up
So the spider definitely knew what it was doing with the care package.the Kiwi was a real shot in the dark,the Penguin got the ball rolling then the Pufferfish topped it off. 🕷️📦+🥝+🐧+🐡=🥰?🧐
She probably dumped him a few days later
8:39 no caption needed 😂😭💀
i haven't watch Joe for a while and coming back to this was so so sweet my heart is so full now, thank you
But where the fxcking ?
Me screaming no as joe gets ready to spit up on his woman
I still remember that time when i got my first phone u was the first YouTube I subscribed to and i reminded watching ur videos so much that i would stay awake fr thank you for making my days better  Btw love from Pakistan
"i'll treasure it forever" brb just crying.... JOE MARRY HER
I couldn't love you more!!💙 But I would have killed you if you wake me up at midnight doing that weird thing 😂😂
LORD JESUS IS COMING SOON  One TRUE GOD came as human being and died for our sins. He offers everlasting life in Paradise as a free Gift. Titus 2:23 while we wait for the blessed hope--the appearing of the glory of our great GOD and SAVIOUR JESUS CHRIST. Pray this prayer to get saved Lord Jesus I know I am a sinner. I believe you died for me on the cross so that I might be saved. Right now I ask You to forgive me of all my sins. ... Thank you, Jesus, for forgiving all my sins, and giving me eternal life. Amen
Ниче не понятно, но очень интересно!

2:14 David Brent expression 😂
“A ww2 bomb” me: it’s a nos canister
Please do more GTA episodes 🤩🤍

What’s the song that you play in the end surprise??
Sings to her at 12am and get the words wrong but she still laughs and sings along....it’s amazing
"World war 2 bomb" thats a nos canister😭
she is too good for this world
I love this sooo much!! 😅 Such a cutie you two!! 🌎
Bruh this literally had me dieing
“an old world war two bomb” okay joe... that’s what it is...
who else thinks Joe should go on I Am A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here
Bruh it's been like 5 yrs since I seen his vids
the title alone had me laughing for a hot minute oml ahh
He don’t get no clout anymore
This was the funniest thing I've seen in ages 😂 😂 😂 😂 Now get to it and pop the damn question, because if Dianne can sing a long with you at midnight instead of punching you in the face, she's definitely a keeper ♥
Bro the kiwi one got me😂😂 the little flaps of the wing and she joined in 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 success
Bruh 😂😂😂 these are hilarious
my new favourite video🤣🤣🤣🤣🥰
10:59 😭🥰🥰🥰 they so cuteee
The relationship ends immediately 😂
The fact that she took the bread and old yogurt and thanked you...
Anyone else miss old joe sugg? I do before he got into dancing
IT'S ROUMERED THAT YOUR ON I'M A CELEBRITY GET ME OUT OF HERE IS IT TRUE???? I HOPE IT IS BECAUSE YOUR MY FAVOURITE YOUTUBER
She’s probably the only person who would be happy with a pebble lmao
I couldn’t stop creasing at the one at midnight
Have you quit YouTube
I came back after I think one year or more idk wht to tell abt his video ideas,loved the ones with Casper and Oli
First things first JOE what you smoking bro ? not sure if this would improve the bedroom antics or be the invention of a new birth control, best advice i can give is ask your dad about the birds and the bee s . That lady has a wacky sence of humour but would look better with a ring on her finger to make the perfect picture.
he sounds a bit like lando norris
The thumbnail and title alone makes me laugh so hard, I can't breatheeee
Hes actually halarious tho
Ong wtf did i just watch
Who else wants joe and Dianne to play among us
I swear I saw you today joe at burgess hill golf course Saturday 17 October let me know if I was
Now this is a good video idea
Just watched the episode where you passed out on bake off 😂
OMG the mushroom soup, I nearly wet myself laughing!
Joe were u playing golf today
I love how she sang along at midnight 😂
WORLD WAR TWO BOMB OMG LMAO
Please do another one of these
joe found a nang at the beach
All this work to get some 🙈😂😂 hope it worked joe 😅
"whered you find the cushions"  *the sofa sitting there with no cushions on*
My favourite quotes from this video: 'Look at the bone floor. don't forget the bone floor.'  'I'm a frickin' bower bird'  'A beautifully wrapped exo-skeleton' *Joe proceeds to vomit on Dianne* 'It means I love you!' 'He nudges her rear end with his nose to encourage her to urinate.'  'Next on my list, we've got the pufferfish. Oh god.' 'I feel like I'm at, like, the Joe Sugg Inn.'
JOE THERE IS GOING TO BE A NEW WALKING DEAD EPISODES CALLED CLEMENTINE LIVES OR CLEMENTINE RETURNS I CANT EAIT 😊😊😊
Bhai Jane ya do is do kgs cm Ms dl Ms hark d5eitstsudsoyduzr
IM STILL CRYING WITH LAUGHTER AT THIS
bro, if i had woken up to my boyfriend standing on bed, singing, I'd think he's possessed and i would run like sonic
It’s going too fast! Definitely not using a tutorial
throwback to when joe would make pranks with on roommates we've come a long way LOL
This is iconic. Also when Joe was getting into position for the kiwi duet and then bursted out singing. Was so funny and fabulous.
I love this so much
Daz Black's David Attenbrough Voice is better but Im not hating. Im subscribed and love ur vids.
Puts “girlfriend” in title ........................  100k likes
...First I’m watching you...are you trying to impregnate her? At this point...
This is the most I've laughed at a YouTube video in a while- thanks joseph
How many times we guessing they actually “mated” this week. My guess was way more than we expected
Hey Joe can u bring back Dare Sugg?
we all know she got absolutely railed after this
this was so cute
Joe is amazing, he makes me laugh so much!!
Aww they're so cute I love how she goes along with everything... PERFECT!
This is probably the best youtube video I've seen for the last 5 years !
Okay but did he get laid in the end?
World war 2 bomb 😂😂 don’t think it’s that
14:31 "Subscribe to the channel and hit that little bell" ok Mr. Uploads Like Twice Every 6 months

Oh my gosh this video had me creasing with laughter this was hilarious 🤣 well done Joe!!
An old ww2 bomb😅😅
An excuse video just to have sex😅
my cheeks hurt so much from smiling and laughing! 😂😂 man ive missed this
Wouldn't each one of these be considered a fail unless it ended with you two mating? lol
I needed this in my life
Hi
Is this whole video just him saying he really wants to get busy with Diane?
I know 100000% that I’m going to save this video forever
She’s so lovely when he gives her such simple gifts 🥰
Dude this was my childhood crush I would countlessly watch his impressions and prank videos and music videos ahh
SHE IS AN ANGEL! Better put a ring on it ASAP
The two animals joe liked the best at first turned out to be the worst
Omg you two I love you guys 😂❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love how trusting Dianne is. The way she closed her eyes and held her hands out to him after being spat at in the face
14:35 of cuteness of a fun, loving relationship
The midnight duet had me screaming
This was so funny haha
It’s not a WWII grenade, it’s a gas canister
ok but this video is actually so adorable tf 🥺
😂😂 This was hilarious
Joe, do you have baby fever? 🙊😍😂
This is the best yet - hilarious!  And Dianne is such a good sport.....
U forgot to mate with her while un wrapping
129 dislikes... how?! This is the best thing I’ve seen in a long time  🤣
Hey joe could you randomly yell BEANS in your next video
Hes back😁       But for how long😔
Ww2 bomb and orange juice😂
OMG YASSS I miss the pranks  lol
I ended up waking my baby up while watching this video coz i couldnt hold my laugh in 😂 specially when u started singing at midnight 😂😂
I loved the dancing at midnight ritual 🤣
can’t remember the last time i watched a video that actually made me laugh out loud😂😂
I MISSSED THESE MAIN CHANNEL VIDEOS 😭🙏 THANK YOU JOE !!
I Love this 😂😂😂
We’re all missing the fact that all he’s doing is trying to mate.... I see you 👍
Yaaay! Joe's back!
ww2 bomb lol thats a party drug where you put ballons on the end of that metal thing lol
I love this
I love Dianne so much, she was the sweetest in this video 🥺 She liked everything Joe gave her and even sang with him at midnight. Literally the cutest girlfriend
What did I just watch😂 and why did I love it
The singing is the cutest thing 😍😍
Bro come on... you don't just cut to a close up of a spider
Loved this 😂
Did udo her favourite animal?
When I saw this I was like wtf
UR ALIVE O MAW GAAAWH
9:57 it's a drug capsule joe 😂😂
His content is crap now it’s just his girlfriend he never posts bye bye
7:07 i cant LOL
This in honestly one of joes best videos it’s hilarious
Anyone else wish he’d done this with Caspar?
The one with the red chest Fucking sent me
Omg Thursday 🤭😂😂😂😂
this made my day, thanks
ImAllex’s piss at 9:47 & Memeulous is the 1 who drinks it
Although this was the strangest idea ever it was a genius. So funny Joe and bless Dianne over the moon with the smaller things in life you have a keeper.
This is how easy it is to make a girl happy
You forgot to mate with her while she opened the present lol. Was expecting the peanut butter to be empty like the spiders haha
I am crying with laughter, you guys crack me up
Oh How i missed watching your videos. I thoroughly enjoyed this video, it could’ve been one of my own ideas. As I love doing weird stuff like this.
Why was Diane so okay about being woken up 😭
if my boyfriend got up in the middle of the night to do mating calls I would be confused and think he'd lost it but eventually I would join in lol
Omg the soup made me laugh so much lol great vid joe as always
You're a genius
why didn't he just wear his inflatable red suit he used to dance on the bed in one of his past videos?
I laughed so hard at this! Man it was great.
An old ww2 bomb 😂😂 a canister it’s uk ini 😂😭
JOE JUST MARRY HER ALREADY MATE!  P.S LOVE YOU
Ooommmg lmao you are hilarious   Also I died a little every time you said “ain’t no valley high” hahaha
a WW2 bomb 😂😂, if yk yk 😂😂
Is this Joe’s way of saying he wants a baby? 🧐
I love how she joins in at 12 they were made for eachother 🤣
my guys definitely ran out of ideas
Only Dianne would love a pebble
I have not laughed so much in ages xD
Aka a week of Joe trying to get LAIDDDDDD
LOL love this
I was just learning about them balloon chest birds at school today
hahaha omg you are the best couple ever
I love how he thought that laughing gas canister was a bomb haha
😂😂😂
The mushroom soup - I've never laughed so hard! 🤣🤣🤣💖Xx
Laughed the whole way through this, I feel like these would work on my fiancé, the spider one for sure 😂
*the love between them both is so pure wtf🥺*
Everything changes, except for Joe's wrapping technique
I’m Dying
I missed this
Omg singing over the bed omg I’m crying
that's it guys, we have lost him. he's gone, he's gone insane.
This is the best video I've seen in a very long time
I have not laughed this hard in such a long time🤣, Joe, man that is some funny stuff that bloody singing on the bed one got me literally holding in my wee 😅
It's the vomit for me 🤣
Joe, you had me laughing so flipp'in hard!!  I thought what the heck kind of video is this, thank you for making my day!!
My favourite part about this video is how confused and almost concerned Dianne is by some of the stuff Joe’s doing 😂 like a part of her is getting a bit worried he’s genuinely lost it 😂
i miss the jasper era so damn much
wtf
he really found someone exactly on his level didn’t he, how absolutely beautiful
I'm so glad you and Dianne are the same kind of weird or this relationship would be over after this video.  Edit: ...and then you threw up on her pretty much.
I don’t think I’ve ever laughed so hard whilst watching YouTube 😂✨
I am cryingggggg this is SOOOO funny
‘WWII bomb’ 😂
This is the best video I’ve seen this month🤣
Actually cracking up at these!!!! Xx
Made me cry laugh. Thank you
I can’t believe she put up with joe spitting that in her face 🤣🤒
This is just hilarious , Joe is just so funny, think they are the cutest couple 🌸❤️😘🌹🌺
we all wanted Joe to meet someone who accepted his weirdness or who was as weird as him. I think Dianne's reaction at 5:48 confirms she's the one.
funniest video i’ve watched in a while☺️
i think i have never laughed so much at a youtube video
Next video he’s announcing he’s going to be a father
He needs to marry her like she is defo the one
when dianne started singing along i died 💀😂 😂😂
The beginning cracked me up😆 Edit: this whole video has got me crying because I've been laughing so hard😂😂
This had me laughing out loud so much 🤣🤣
Love this, my fav one ever!
Honestly mate, she didn’t kill you for the barf in the mouth then I don’t think there is much you can do to scare her away. She is a keeper
8:39 joe is older than josh wtff
Love the fact that go is just a professional piss taker lmao 🤣🤣😂
Um you might wanna check what that bomb was you saw on the beach and take it out of your vid
Honestly dianne is so happy and greatful for everything 😂🥺!!!!
an old world war 2 bomb ?! nah mate thats a nang
I can't believe you live in London and don't know that those 'world war two bombs' are nitrous oxide containers. It's just drugs XD
I missed him so much havent laughed like this in forever
OMG AN OLD SCHOOL SUGG SUNDAY VIDEO YAAASSS
A mean its very tiny........ I bet it is
This video was weird yet surprisingly educational
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 this is so priceless! 😂
An 'old world war 2 bomb' 😂
I cannot believe u spat that at her lmfao I laughed so hard my cat sitting on me asleep woke up n ran away lol..amazing ahahahah
bout to graduate high school and I feel like I learnt more from this video than my 13 years of education
You and me baby, ain't nothing but mammals
THIS = 😂😂😂
This is so funny I love it
Hey Joe That was a CO2 canister. People use them to get high. Ask your girlfriend about ripping nangs (trust me she’ll understand)
Omg I am dying 😂😂 that parrot one was hilarious
Okay but this video is so cute albeit weird and shows how perfect you and Dianne are for each other :)
its the spitting in her mouth for me
Brilliant, just what we all needed to brighten our days
It's the best video ever
I knew the penguin one from a show on Netflix called atypical
👍🙏
“An old WW2 bomb” lol - Joe that’s a nang!!
I am halfway through and this is too funny. Looool Joe, you are a fucking legend
!! JOE SUGG !!  You are nice, Dianne is also nice, GL & HF <3 (Glad my Bro linked me to this, it's a super-fun vid, Thank you :)
Oh my goodness this is so funny. She is so sweet and he is just hilarious (and sweet too). So cute.
Omfg just fell off my bed laughing and dropped my phone ......Joe ur a legend u certainly know how to make these tough times bearable 😄 ur hilarious and I'm sure I speak for everyone when I say thank u ....... btw Dianne bless u xx
Joseph, you're such a weirdo! God help you Dianne! 😂
THE SINGING AT NIGHT ONE WAS SO FUNNY IM CRYING.
I love the videos but I was so scared of the spiders
I’m done 😂😂😂😂
i don't know why but joe gives me draco malfoy vibes 😭
😂😂😂
"I'm pretty sure I've got a mate who does that"   *_that's most of the male population, Joseph_*
is this joes way of telling Dianne he wants kids????
I am crying 😂😭😭😭😭
Literally cried laughing 😂😂😂 welcome back to the game Joe
Not laughed this much at a video for a while, wish we could have seen her reaction when you told her what you’d been up to that week 😂
I love how appreciative Dianne is of everything 😫❤️❤️ xxx
I can’t believe he spat that on her face. I would be so mad if someone did that to me. Although Dianne did look pretty mad.
That was flipping hilarious 😆
dianne is so precious 🥺
He has found a pure gold video series! 🤣🤣
Dianne ruined everything. You were better before.
It was like watching one of your old videos. So fun and loved every second of it. Love love love
OMG! Please have a spider warning next time, i died and now i cant relax 😩😩😩😩damn u joe 💜
I love how she appreciated the pebble 🥺❤️
It looked like joe threw up on her 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Time to resub I guess...also why have you lost so much weight??
I absolutely loved when Dianne started singing along
absolute non sense
I love who chill and grateful Di is.
I can't move from laughing 😂😂😂
Just hilarious 🤣
I saw the thumbnail and immediately thought it was a paranormal video lol
If Joe stood on a bed and sung to me at midnight I’d piss myself 🤣🤣🤣😭💗
She’s so sweet and pure 😂🥰
7:06 got me in tears! Soooo good to have you back Joe :)
This was so stinking funny and just made my day! Ya'll literally have the cutest relationship. This light-hearted content is what I enjoy the most!
the kiwi one had me howling
Diane is so easy to please😅
Somehow can’t believe that Joe doesn’t know what a nos canister is
only joe could think of something like this
Looollllll 😂😂😂 xxx
Hahaha the bit where Joe's standing on the bed and singing hahaha 😂😂😂😂😂
The nos can
I haven't watched joe's videos in so long idk why! i missed thiis
The singing together was sooo cute
Dianne is so cuuuute 💖
bloody hell could've put a spider warning 😅🥴
I haven't laughed this hard in months! Actual tears in my eyes 😂
so weird... but that sums up joe 😂
Oh my god I died laughing.  5:29
i want someone to love me the way joe loves dianne
Hey Joe, could you please do a grand prank on Caspar or just the entire squad =)
imagine his search history
failed no simp September
Imagine the animals did this:  Giraffe: they think we are weird? Let's look at them then  So first, you need to go up to a girl and shout, 'ayo fam' hmm seems a bit perculiar but oh well...  'come down maccies yeah and we'll start things of init'   Interesting, humans are strange, but let's carry on...  'in the case that the female does not accept you gesture, scream at her and say 'oi shut up you Sket get lost you freak'  Hmm
WW2 bomb 😂😂😂😂😂9:55
I thought this only promised Joes wonderful weirdness, but so much ended up adorable! Why is Dianne so sweet?!?!?!?!? I would’ve killed my husband if he woke me up at midnight 🤣 and the regurgitation 😂🤮
I’m crying at the midnight duet 😂😂
Dear person reading this,Don't worry. You will find love soon. You will find success. You will find happiness. And you will find peace. Be patient , whatever you do Don't run back to what broke you. Love from a unknown person
This is 100% the best video on the internet right now!!! Thanks Joe!
Awesome vid. But I NEED to see Diane’s reaction when you tell her why you were doing these crazy things!
Are you two pregers??
This is so fvcking weird but we love it 😂
I’m literally crying with laughter! Omg 😂
If my husband woke me up at midnight singing to me, I would melt...and join
I had a smile and I laughed the whole video.. This is so funny. I love them❤
My new favorite video on YouTube. Haven't laughed like this in ages!
How do you come up with these ideas? 😂
socialblade says this is your avrage subs p/day:-1K oof
Me... sees title me *CLICK*
Nobody is safe living with joe
I think that “WWII” bomb is a nang joe...
The spitting of the mushroom soup into her mouth reminded me of PrankvsPrank
missed this
A WW2 bomb 🤣🤣
always bringing something new to youtube :)
They should prescribe these on the NHS.
He didn't  mate so task not done
Does someone have the onlyfans link to the giraffe one?
Omg I'm dying of laughter 😂😂
Hilarious and adorable! The Thatcher Joe brand!!😂😂👌
WW2 bomb nooo 💀
SPIDER WARNINGS ARE IMPORTANT 😂😭
I watched this in bed and woke my husband up because I was laughing so hard. Thanks Joe!! 🤣🤣🤣
I LOVE THIS😂😂😂😂
Dianne's reactions made this video even more funny LOL, she was so grateful for everything, bless her! x x x
Hats off to Dianne for bearing all of this with a smile on her face 😂 Please bring Sugg Sunday back 😁😁😁
I smiled the whole way through this video! THIS. WAS. HILARIOUUUUUS!!!!😂😂🤣😂😂
Never laughed so much 😂
This is my favourite video on the Internet ever ngl
Awww I love dianne! Her response to the stone was everything 💖
You need to make another one with other animals 🤣
This is so silly but honestly, so bloody hilarious 🤣  you are both so suited to one another xxx
"I'll cherish it for life"🥺 Never let go of her Joe
Why is Diane the cutest person ever like she's literally so happy to be given a pebble or given a tupperware with her favourite foods in it like 😭😭❤
Haha that, “world war two” bomb was a can of Dinitrogen monoxide (laughter gas/nos/hippy crack) people put the gas into balloons and inhale it to get high.
This is the sweetest an weirdest video I've ever seen:)
Wednesday was the best one I died of laughter 🤣🤣🤣
When he pushes the nest down, i didn’t think Dianne was still in it 🤣🤣🤣
Can’t wait to see u both next year WOOOOO
this might be the best video i’ve ever watched, thanks joe! 😂😂😂
Bloody great video!
Thanks for doing this video Joe. I wasn't sure at first but I'm glad I watched it. I found it really interesting and loved seeing Diannes reactions lol. I just wish she had bursted the red balloons by bumping chests haha. Great towel art! Joe & Dianne Towel Art Kit for 2021? Lol! XX
You already have the lady so the mating techniques won't work
This is amazing
y'all are my favvvourite!!!
poor dianne is all i was thinking ahhahaaaaaaaa the imagination on joe is just another thing...its like everyday is a new thing with this guy 😂😂😂😂😂
9 months later Baby Sugg is born
I haven't laughed this much in ages! 🤣
So... you want to have kids?
How did she react when you told her what u were doing in the end?
I felt special when he talked about the kiwi haha🇳🇿
sunday was also cute
saturday was cute.
Thursadys attempt made me feel sick. so gross
Dianne is sooooooooo patient.
Aww i was hoping Joe would tell Dianne what he was doing the whole week at the end to see her reaction
When your partner doesn't murder you for spitting choccy milk in their mouth/on their face.... you know theyre the one 😂😂
I'm dead. This was the best video yet Joe
How do you even think of a video like this?? 😂 this was hilarious and so wholesome at the same time, absolutely iconic
This dude is actually asleep at midnight, he actually has a decent sleeping schedule.
You two are too funny 😂
Ummm why 🤣🤣
did any of them really work Joe
The laughs I needed on a rank Monday morning! Thank you- one of your best!
This is one oF the weirdest and funniest videos of yours ever!!! XD
Have missed your silly videos xxx
I wasn’t sure what to expect from this but it made me smile before work on a Monday morning so I think that’s a win 😂😂😂
Omg amazing 😂😂
Wow I love 3am videos lol / pranks 🤣🤣👍
They are couple goals
Wow, Dianne is literally the sweetest person lol, I don't know anyone else that would react so nicely to being handed a rock
If this isn't my future boyfriend I don't want him
Seriously funny, loved Dianne’s face at all Joe’s antics 🤣😂🤣
The fact he’s 29 and still doing this... I love it and no sponsor so we know he actually wanted to make the video
So..... Joe is singing in midnight and she starts singing too...    They are perfect for each other 🥴🥴🥴
no one else gunna mention the orbs flying around the bedroom on wednesdays clip?
Who else thought this was gonna end in a proposal?
You have a lot of ghosts in your house
Oh my fking GOD I don’t know if it’s just because it’s 5am and I’m on night shift and haven’t slept but this IS THE FUNNIEST THING IVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE IM CHOKING 😂😂😂😂
If this isn't 100% peak quarantine I don't know what is
I have watch this about 5 times today, its so funny 🤣
so im watching this in my study period and laughing so hard... i kinda feel sorry for those who are actually studying
Trust Joe to come up with most hilarious and creative videos 🤣
OMFGGGGG
Love the fun, creative, and educational video. The world needs more of this kind of content.
This is like something he’d make in 2016 to caspar
Marry her. Gets woken up at midnight, sings along. Is given a pebble, cherishes it forever. Presented with Swan towels, couldn't be happier.
This was totally random & I didn't know what to expect. A lot of these were just so cute! The penquin one I knew of but, seeing your versions of these was just to funny Joe! Dianne's reactions were priceless! XD Would love to know if you told her why for all of this after & her reaction to that.
I cried laughing at the "vomitting" soup into Dianne's mouth 🤣
Simp                       Its a joke love ur vids
This is so good! Lmao
the kiwi one thats the best
No ads! What a treat! Thanks Joe
main thing we need to know did you get a shag
part 2 ??
You back!!!!!😃😃😃 Finally!!!!!!
I literally have no words
I laughed so incredibly hard at this..
the thumbnail gave me a flashback of the alarm clock prank on caspar
This is seriously funny as hellllll
Every time he said Kiwi pair or Kiwi partner I kept thinking like human Kiwis, as in people from NZ
This might be my favorite video
@2:57 if Joey Tribbiani we’re a animal lol 🕷
joe: i'm 29 years old.. ffs  me: nah he's still good. super junior are in their mid 30s and still are crazy
bout to have my annual season joe sugg binge
woah. after all these years, joe hasn't changed. a good lad and still insane 😂
I want David Attenborough to do a reaction to this video!
100% my favourite video of 2020.
Oh come on, that Kiwi one was great haha, definately saving it for when I find my special someone (someone who'd actually be random enough to join in that is) :')
When Dianne sees this video she probably gonna be like oh wow now that’s what has been happening all this time😂
🤣🤣🤣
Thumbnail + Title = this is not going to end well 😬  Dianne is a supremely good sport.
LMAO what an idea
Loved this video! Reminded me of your videos back in the day!
Jeeeeeesss finaly a video!!!!!!! I could cry
This video killed me with laughter!!! So funny and poor Diane when she thought she was going in for a kiss!!!
Hahahahahahaha midnight serenade
The Im 29 years old killed me!! 😂🤣😂
Wow that old ww2 bomb sure did look dangerous. Do you no where I could find one? Asking for a friend.
Dianne is sooo sweet, she's so happy to receive anything, and that was so funny when she sang along to Joe's midnight singing.
Didn’t even know I needed this content in my life until now 😂
Dianne is so freaking sweet for singing along with joe after being woken up in the middle of the night by joe standing on the bed 😂😂💖 I love y’alls relationship. ♥️
Omg she’s adorable
7:07 is the funniest ever😂
Giraffes really be showing that commitment tho 😂
The parrot one had me cracking up. I loved the nocturnal serenade and Dianne joining in, but did you see the orbs flying around?  Two of them floated above Dianne and in front of Joe . Watch it again and see. Brilliant!
Omg cried laughing entire video
Oh my goodness I love you guys 😂 i seriously enjoyed this video so much lol
The orbs while in the clip with night vision 😬😂
Dianne is so cute and such a good sport
Not the content we were expecting but it’s absolutely the content we need😂
dianne is so adorable 🥺 keep her forever
Now I think of Reaction Time a whole different way 👀                                    👄
Ahhh the old joe is back
Plz do a part 2
I loved this video so much 😂😂 This is the kind of content I signed up for
Honestly? My fave video on the internet!
The parrot one had me in tears.
I got this in my recommendations and I was about to keep scrolling cuz I was like “wtf is this idiot doing” and realized it was just Joe. Hi Joe.
Dianne is literal gf goals 😂
Im not subscirbed ..and i saw the title i was like wtf ...i subscribed im 1 minuet in 🤣
Joes pjs at midnight made it look like he has escaped from a mental asiglm
Just going to put this out there this is one of my favourite video
lmao.. hahaha the Giraffe had me laugh with tears before he finished reading it.
You should get a paint marker and write the date on the rock
Weirdest but cutest thing ever 😂 dianne is the cutest. Also, just a mark of how Well you two are paired that she didn’t boot you out the bed at midnight for singing at her 🤣🤣
Ah, I wasn’t expecting that one.
Found a bottle that looks like piss
Find someone who is willing to be woken up at midnight at random by you belting out a song and starts singing with you. That’s true love people! 😂
Dianne is the best at pretending to like presents
Diane was so good when Joe woke her up in the middle of the night. I would push him off the bed 🤣
Watching this at 23:18pm is not the best idea.. forgot everyone’s asleep, absolutely died at the soup moment 😂
Hold on, Sugg........ SUNDAY?!?!?!
Such a great idea for a video, gave me a good laugh. I think my favorite was the one that you did in the middle of the night. LOL
11:19 “it’s London innit” 😂😭
Diane after seeing the video: so that’s why he was being such a freak this week
He called a canister a bomb 😂😂😂😂
Ye but like now I have unrealistic expectations of a relationship because I'm never gonna find anyone who wants to dance on the bed with me and sing at midnight
Love this 😭😭
Omg 🤣🤣😭
“Does that do anything for ya?” 😂😂
Watching this again because I’m not sure what I just watched 😂😂
Diane is just soo confused the whole time i loved it...diane at midnight aswel she's just like tf, i acc cried laughing
The way he starts flappin his hands and singing ain’t no mountain high enough got me screamin 😂😂
Why have I just spent 14 minutes watching joe trying to "mate" like animals?
I've been a fan of Joe for a while and I- i this is the most questionable video i have seen of his 🤚😂❤❤
Well of all things can it be really? Yes! No! Ho! Hi! Oh, my eye! My mind may be wandering, but I confess I believe  it's a Sugg Sunday!
I was crying with laughter xx ❤️❤️❤️💖💖💖
I wonder if he ever fully explained to Dianne what he was doing lol 😂💖💖💖❤️❤️❤️
The 'ww2 bomb' is a laughing gas canister. I absolutely loved this video though, it was hilarious 🤣
the fact that dianne starts singing with him at midnight and isn’t mad at him is true love
Joe trying to get laid for 14mins straight
this is 100% the best video i have ever watched
As a kiwi (the person) I got mildly confused when you talked about the kiwis mating ritual, I was like um no, we have a drinking and rooting culture. Then it was birds. I was ashamed.
This was so fucking funny
I absolutely loved this video 🤣 Please promise you’ll get Dianne a proper present after she’s been such a good sport ❤️
Joe this video was probably one of ur best. Well done lol.
Ok but nobody's talking about 7:02-7:08 😭❤️🥺🥺✨
AHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHA
I don't understand this content at all 😂😂😂  It's so weird 😂😂
The title gave me flashbacks of him reacting to animals giving birth. I honestly learnt alot from that video. More than what i learnt in 14 years of school skskdjd. Gonna go give it a watch for old times sake lol
When she joined in the song omg 😊😂😂
He’s back
Bloody brilliant Joe 🤣🤣🤣
Diane is such a trooper 😂😂
Actually interesting video. No idea how you thought of this, watching wild life documentaries i'm guessing. Random but a good watch
My mum actually spat her tea back in her mug laughing at this 🙈😂 i thunk she was secretly trying to recreate the parrot move 😭😂
Ouch my jaw hurts from smiling amd laughing to much 😂❤️
They're so wholesome.  I feel more single more I watch the video.
I've watched this 3 times now and I still can't help laughing,only Joe would think of something like this,it's so original and different,well done Joe I loved it xxxx also you had a lot of orbs floating around in your bedroom XXXXXX
Joe’s youtube videos like this makes me realize how o have grown up. I used to wait weeks on end for sugg sunday specials. And now with uni and life I don’t even have time for youtube. And i was scrolling through yt today and i saw this on my recommendation. Watching for old times sake. He hasn’t lost his spark on pranking. That’s the joe i have known to love and grow up with.
This is the best thing I’ve ever seen 😂😂😂
Let me just finish crying from laughter 😂 well done Joe!
I haven't laughed this much in a long time
Great video!      I also make videos!!
Hilarious!! I also make videos!!
So freaking cute! 😄
Lol that was like the quickest Joe Sugg video ending😂😂🙃
Joe this is actually the best video you have ever made I didn’t stop laughing the whole way through
this is the most joe video ever 😂  the arm flapping when he was singing hahaha
Is anyone going to tell him what the ‘old world war 2’ bomb is or?? 😂😂
I can not with this video. 😂 awe poor diane. This is something you would think about for a while.
HAH the kiwi one leoahe f auqgecsbaj wtf
The soup ended me 😂
he was right when he said we wouldn’t guess the video 😂 only joe sugg
She is the most adorable and cute girl I have ever seen
Im crying 😂😂😂😂
I love joe a bit wierd and quirky I guess he kinda is like that giraffe
Brilliant Joe...need more vloggs like this loved it x
The fact that Di just goes along with it and actually loves it/the gifts😂🥰🤷🏼‍♀️
This is such a crazy weird video but I find it so adorable and sweet that Dianne finds a few of the things cute like the pebble and the little nest and the singing and the swans even though it's super weird and she's just like 'what are you doing and why?'
How did you come up with this video idea?!!!😭😂
I don’t normally comment but I had to, I haven’t laughed this hard in a long time! This was hilarious!! 😂
I haven’t laughed so much until I watched the one where Joe was dancing on the bed singing 😂😂
Just the title of this video makes me slightly worried for Joe😂😅
are u still together?!
Really enjoyed that video! It was a great idea :)
only joe sugg would make this video
My god, i didn’t realize how much I had missed Sugg Sundays 🥺👋🏻
Love that Dianne just joined in with the singing 😂
the only thing worse than being joe's roomate it's being his gf
Omg amazing😂😂 part 2?
Loved it 👍👍
so...... where is the mating?
i read this title and my face literally twisted in confusion
I love this video and its so awesome to see Joe 1) happy and 2) making great videos again❤️
This video was weird but it made me laugh sm😂😂😂
I don’t think that’s orange juice
I actually went on Joe's old video marathon today and he uploaded this. Love your videos man!❤️
I can’t stop laughing wtf
This gotta be the funniest video on this whole platform in a while! I was crying for a moment, brilliant!
this video is proof they are soulmates
😂😂
Omg it's been so long since I laughed like this 😂😂 this was the kind of content why I even started watching your videos many years before. Love you Joe ❤
I love it tho x
I saw the title and just cracked I was like this is gonna be so weird 😂😂
Joe 3 am funniest thing I ever did see my misses would of punched me rolled over and gone back to sleep....... Me kicked out to the sofa!
Loved this xD
This gave me so joe and Casper prank wars vibe 😂😂💕
Dianne was being so sweet and innocent about it. I would have been more freaked out
Idk if this was cute or just weird but it was hilarious, random and I loved it!!! 😂💙
Poor Dianne. Thats all I have to say 😂😂
Wednesday midnight singing was adorable, especially considering Dianne actually sang the right words lol But Thursday's beverage spitting kiss was so funny I'm still laughing 😂😂😂😂
Best video I’ve seen on YouTube in a long time😂😂👍
I love how you subtly included both of your Strictly Glitter Ball Trophies in your shot at 1:39 😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤️❤️❤️❤️👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Dianne getting excited for wrapped packages of opened foods and a simple pebble is perfect. I can only imagine that one of her major love languages is receiving gifts. It's the most misunderstood language, but simple gestures like that can easily make us melt.
I would definitely NOT sing along If someone wakes me up in the middle of the night singing
Definitely one of my fav videos ever
That was hilarious🤣🤣
The orbs 😮
If Dianne Buswell isn’t the most patient woman in Britain
I loved this with all my heart I couldn’t stop laughing the whole time 😂😂😂😂💕
this is such a ThatcherJoe video, so weird but so so funny i love it😂
I wish i had a girlfriend that appreciated things like a pebble and not just want LV uno
Not gonna lie this is probably the weirdest videos that I’ve ever watched but because it’s a thatcher joe vlog I know I’d love it before watching it
Where has this guy went
Whats happened to his accent
**Giraffes**  “Yeah, I’m pretty sure I’ve got a mate who does that..”  Who? Jack?😂
This the best thing ive watched this whole year!!!
I'm so glad Joe's back with his funny and creative content! I'm telling you, this video came out of absolutely nowhere and I love it!
🤣🤣🤣 Poor Dianne was def quite scared sometimes, but you nailed the final try, Joe 👍👍
Well, If Dianne get’s pregnant any time soon we know why😂
I can’t wait for them to have children ❤️❤️❤️
Aww it's actually kind of sweet that he's done little things like this to make her happy
Poppet that's a small canister of laughing gas people inhale them for the high and daft shit like that. Car park near me is littered with them constantly.
I feel sorry for Dianne!! She was probably like have you started to take medication or something??? 😂😂😂😂😂 Such a cute and funny video though
Oh god I'm only just over half way through and I am fully sobbing with laughter omg Joe
That was so funny 🤣😂 loved it such a sweet couple 💟
Is this just a week of Joe trying to get laid?
Wednesdays one had me dead though 😂
Thank you Joe from the bottom of my heart for this video, I laughed so much ❤️😂 you should do another of these
Bring Back PRANKS
Really great video. First video on YouTube that's made me laugh out loud in ages! X
I’m crying 😂🤣🤣
Best. Vlog. Ever . I was crying with laughter. Oh my gosh. I honestly haven't laughed so much all lockdown. Thankyou for this😂
Penguins are still the cutest ever!
Omg that was great, but how did Dianne not kick you out yet hahah. 🤣🤣
I laughed so much I have a sore throat now, brilliant .
😂
Fam Joe no where near look like a 29 year old m8. Wat the duck.
5:20 had me dead 🤣🤣💀  I was WHEEZING  My mum shouted "Ellanor are you okay"  💀🤣  WhAt
The one at midnight made me laugh so hard! I think this video just killed me!😂😂
This had me laughing so hard! Loved it! 😂😂
Dianne is so sweet if someone woke me up in the middle of the night I wouldn’t sing back lol 😂
🤣🤣🤣
Trigger warning emetaphobia x
The funniest video I have sent in a file lol especially the parrot vomit one 😂😂😂😂😂
Joe watching some of these are making me die of 2nd hand embarrassment
As soon as I saw “Wednesday (midnight)” I started laughing didn’t stop until “thank god for that”
the way she starting singing along with you 😭😭😭
Joe how exactly did you come up with this idea? It’s brilliant, brilliant but strange😂 also it reminds me of og thatcherjoe videos and I love it♥️
love this
But...why??
😂😂😂😂😂😂🤦‍♀️ Brilliant
So is no one going to point out we kinda got a joanna kiss tho
SPIDER CLIP... I'M DEAD FROM FEAR, love the red balloon, pissing myself, my bf is like "You fucking nerd."
I'M CRACKING UP at the midnight song
After a long & tiring week of uni this was THE BEST thing to watch! Joe Sugg you never fail to make me laugh I literally burst into tears🤦🏻‍♀️😂 this was creative adorable and hilarious all at once, thank you! Lots of love xx
honestly Joe you're lucky she's still with you after 7:06 lmao
He is still the same 😂. I love it!
Don't remember the last time I laughed his much at a YouTube video. Not even the little exhale like proper uncontrollable laughing 😂🤣
Hi Joe that was so funny and Dianne is so accepting go along with it all. Well done you are so creative. 😂😂😂👏👏💓
This is too funny
Im dying at the spitting soup in her mouth hahaha
This is so funny 😂
There is not enough attention on him spitting mushroom soup in her mouth, couldnt stop laughing 🤣
This is the cutest video I've ever seen!
i’m cry laughing this is the weirdest funniest video i love it, going to watch it again and again😂😂
OMG Dianne is really too nice. Bless her
I love how i learn how the animals mate, butttt ..  poor Dianne 😂😂😂
Nice
The ideas Joe comes up with doesn’t  surprise me anymore😂
Omg I cry laughed and gagged at the same time with the vegetable thing when u spat it in her mouth and spat it down I
Dianne must really love you to still be with you after this video 😂😂😂
That world war 2 bomb on the beach was definitely a tampon applicator & the human remains was a tampon 😂😂
have you hit your head or something i’m concerned weirdest video 😂😭
I'm 2:30 mins in and this is already the greatest video on YouTube in YouTube history.
Honestly, things were getting so weird that I thought he was gonna attempt the giraffe one 🤣 I never laughed so hard when he stood on the bed singing flapping his hands, then she just joined in no questions asked haha
okay its official, their relationship is over  jk
Nah this was actually hilarious so well thought out, I can appreciate the creativity and joy that came with this. Dianne's reactions were so cute to such small yet sentimental things. Keep up this Joe, missed ya lots on here!!
My favorite video ever 😂😂😍
When joe returned for a second week so must I- from a very very old thatcherjoe fan 😊
5:48 - Dianne just casually joining in is sending me 😂
I swear I broke a rib laughing at the sick one wow that was awesome
One hour ago
Belly laughing through the whole thing ahaha
so i definitely misread the title - thought it said animal crossing 👁👄👁
WTF did I just watch? 😂😂😂 but then it’s joe so I’m not surprised anymore hahaha! Love it!
I've learned a lot about animals thanks to you XD
I MAKE THE LIKES GO FROM 3k TO 3.1k OMG
People saying this is the weirdest ThatcherJoe video.... Hello, have you been here before😂😂😂😂😂💗💗💗
Oh my life I’m buzzing for this 😭😂
OMG this was crazy but so hilarious!
I didn't know I needed this video, but I've spent the past 14 minutes crying tears of laughter! Thank you for brightening my day!
🤣 Classic 🤣
Okay but did he explain why he was acting this way all week? What did she think? I’ve got questions...
BYE i actually have no words 😂😂
get yourself a partner that will join in with you when you woke them up singing ain’t no mountain high enough standing over them in bed at midnight HAHAHAH this is my new fave video
Awww this was strange and cute at the same time lol... love u guys xx
This channel is making a return which I love and this video is so weird but I love it so much❤❤❤
Me: reading the title and seeing the thumbnail  Me: I’m concerned but also excited 😂😂😂
this was such a random video but it had me in stitches, the waking Dianne up at midnight and singing had me in stitches 😂
im sat here crying with laughter oh my 🤣🤣
Omg that is true old Joe Sugg 😂
That towel art was actually pretty good
Absolutely brilliant. My other half just came in to see what I'm laughing at and asked why I have tears rolling down my cheeks 😂😂😂😂👍
This is the only youtube video i have ever cry laughed at! This is one of my faves!
Alternate title: 15 minutes of Dianne asking joe "what the hell are you doing?"
Cried from laughter.  Dianne's reactions are priceless and I think I can speak for everyone..: We're happy you vetoed the giraffe one.
one of my favorities poor dianne confused
so cute
i really wonder where he got this video idea from i mean i loved it but i didn’t know it’d be THIS weird😭😭😭
Probably one of the best/weirdest videos I've watched but it was still worth it 😂
i lost it at the giraffe one
Mum just walked through asking what I’m laughing at and I actually don’t know how to explain 😭😂
Dianne is so appreciative and easily pleased, i love it 🥰
I just wanna say that when I had no reason to go on in life. Monday updates of you always made me feel happy. And I am so thankful you are uploading videos again. You, Oli and Casp were my happy pill in 2015 and onwards.  It's monday 1:00 am in the Philippines. It's sunday night in UK, i think?
ive watched this three times already and cant stop crying :)))))
It would be great if Joe Sugg did what the giraffes did I am dying to see Joe Sugg doing what the giraffes do! LOL!
😂😂😂
Hi Joe & Di.  I just wanted to say. "I LOVE THIS VIDEO!!!!".I was eating my pizza and just when you drank that container from the ice box. and then kissed Di.  My pizza spit out everywhere.  LOL.   Can't I ask are you ever going to do anything with the ole boyz.  Oil, Mike, and the others.?                                                                                   vid/fl/usa
Omg I’m dying the duettttt 😂😂😂
Crying 😂😂😂😭
Those first few seconds reminded me about the time when I had to watch a 40 minute David Attenborough documentary at school...never wanted to hear his voice again after that 😂
when you said you were coming back this wasn’t quite what i had in mind but yk😃
i don’t know how dianne puts up with you 😭i would’ve gone mad !
Singing at midnight ❤🤣🤣🤣
This has to be the strangest yet most entertaining vlog of ThatcherJoe and I absolutely love it!!! Definitely wouldn't have guessed this vlog in a million years 😂
I loved this so much 😂 loving the editing x
Watching this at nearly 2am and debating if I should jump up on the bed and start singing to my fella 🤣 I think i'd get hurt if I did 🤣
i don’t know what i just watched
Omg Dianne was so cute getting the pebble she was proper excited
ngl i was a bit scared when i saw the title...but i loved the video 😂
that spider made me cry other than that i absolutely loved it 😂😂
see if my boyfriend woke me up singing at midnight  i think i’d cry hahahhaha - i absolutely love this, sooo funny 💞💕
When I find myself a boyfriend I expect him do to at least one of the nice ones for me!! 😂
I have never been more confused and concerned in my life but overall i love it haha
Dianne's tolerance levels are off the scale !! this cracked me up big time
I  can't believe she joined in with the midnight singing, I would have strangled my other half if he woke me up doing that 😂
well i definitely didnt guess this from the picture
Wonder if my husband would sing at midnight with me 🤔 Might try it 🤣🤣
Im sorry i like you joe but this content is awful
I'm literally howling! this video was HILARIOUS
Changed the title from mating to courting real quick
Now I know what he meant when he said this video was gonna be “different” 😂 Loved it though, I was laughing the whole time and it was definitely something I hadn’t seen before. Love how Joe’s trying to come up with new creative ideas even if they’re a bit weird like this one haha!! Keep it up, looking forward to the next innovative ideas & videos! :)
i’m unsure of what the fuck just happened but i think i loved it 😭
did you have an allergic reaction after the balloons?
I lost it when Dianne came home and saw Joe with the bird mask and red balloons in his "nest"
you both have the exact same sense of humour, it’s so cute to see <3
why is the most joe sugg thing ever🤣
I think Joes gone a bit insane in lockdown 😂😂
i’ve not laughed this much in a long time, u always seem to come up with such creative ideas! this will definitely be a video i come back to every single day😭
Dianne is such a good sport and also beautiful,Joe is lucky to have someone who loves and supports him so much.
this is the weirdest video ever but it’s so on brand
David Attenborough would be proud pahaha. You cone up with the craziest ideas I love it 😂😂
the fact that you came up with this i love it😭 such a funny video
Luv u man
Aww 🥺 haha😂
what did I just watch joe
Great video Joe loved this idea so funny x
NOOO INNTRROOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!! FFS JOE BRING IT BACK.
Omds 😂😂 this is too funny I love this 🤣😭
the fact he keeps flopping his arms when singing 😂😂
Only Joe Sugg would do this and that is why he's the best!
3 Am mating ritual challenge on gf -and bf- (gone wrong) (gone messy) (gone artistic) (extreme gyrating action)      estrus = in heat/ hot and bothered and ready and fertile and seeking a mate
Not what i was expecting but I mean you always do come up with the most amazing ideas and always turn them into something AMAZING!! Also loving the little rebrand 🤍🤍
The midnight one got me crying 😂 might try this with my boyfriend OH WAIT don’t have one
The fact that Dianne would only say "What are you doing?" when her boyfriend wakes her up at midnight by singing while mine would be something like "If you don't shut up right this second this relationship won't be the only think that's broken." is probably the reason why I don't have a boyfriend...
I've never seen a more 'ThatcherJoe' video 🤣 You weren't lying when you said it's a weird one 😭  Probs to Dianne for not whacking you in the head with a slipper when you started singing like a bird on the bed 👍
now this is what I call original content !!!!!
I thought maybe joe had grown up from this weird crap and thats why he didnt upload for like a year but nah
I'm with your girlfriend,  "what you doing?😄 .  The pebble was the best, after its washed Lol. Omg the giraffe one Lmao.
Oh, SURE. When Joe does it, it's "cute" and Dianne joins in singing, but when _I_ do it, I'm "obnoxious" and "need to leave the bar right now!"
oh wow a sugg sunday
The fact she didn’t kill you when you woke her up and instead started singing with you just goes to show how perfect you two are together 😂😂
I mean it was an original idea I guess u can have that one sugg😭but I wanna know where you got the idea from 😭😭
Next video we get is gonna be a break up video 😂😂 nice one Joe 👍
This has old school jaspar pranks vibes
Only them two would wake up in the middle of the night and do duet
I wish someone had warned me about the “human remains” by the Thames before I went to uni. I discovered a bunch of bones and freaked out 😂
Dianne seriously considered breaking up with him for sure
Omg I laughed so much at this! How much do you bet they had a huge argument after Joe spat the soup at Dianne?? I know I would’ve killed my boyfriend if he did that to me! 😂
This is so creative. I love this
hey joe that was really funny when you did the bird joe and loveing the singing too lots off love xxxxx
Why is this one of  the best videos ever 🤣🤣❤
david attenborough watching this like 👁👄👁
But did you get lucky though 😆
Girls: All guys are dumb  they don't do anything productive Guys:
Loved this video so much. Don’t think I’ve laughed so much in such a long time... thank you Joe. I love the way Dianne just joined in with the singing even though she didn’t really have a clue what was going on! You two weirdos (and I mean that in the nicest possible way) are made for each other (as most of us have been thinking for nearly two years! 😊 x
I did not see this coming but im glad it came
OMG this was so frigging funny xxxxx
Starting to wonder whether joe is okay or not
you and dianne remind me so much of jake and amy from b99
I know we wanted a thatcher joe come back but this is certainly something absolutely nobody expected 😂😂
I saw this title and got very confused. I’m in the video and still very confused 😂but ngl is enjoying it 😂
this is what i call creativity. haha you always got the best, weirdest most interesting ideas, joe.
Who else has been watching Joe's videos since 2014?
Me: **reads title**  I-
what have i just watched
This gave me a much needed laugh.
This is hilarious 🤣
Joe before reading about giraffes: This one's a bit of me... Joe after reading: this one's not a bit of me anymore 😂
Brilliant! 😍😂😍😂
who else think joe is the best youtuber ever
Wow. That video was something. You were right we definitely didn’t guess what the video was. It was great, so funny. It made me laugh. I now can not stop laughing-what have you done Joe.?? Thank you Joe. 😂😂😂
quarantine really is getting to you
This was incredibly entertaining👏
What made you think of this video 😂😂 I loved it and it was so cute how Dianne actually enjoyed most of them
I PEED MYSELF A BIT WHEN YOU STARTED SINGING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT 😭😭
Their relationship is so cute, if my future boyfriend doesn’t do that I don’t want him😂
How is everyone doing?
Oh my god joe 😂😂I was crying with laughter thank you for cheering my day up
this might actually be my new fave thatcherjoe video🤣❤️
loved it joe just u being joe
SHUT UP, THIS VIDEO WAS FAR TOO FUNNY
This was hilarious 😂 absolutely loved it
That was great haha thanks for that
This is a serious question is it worth joining to become a member?
THE MIDNIGHT ONE HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
*Hahahahhahahaha* I almost peed my pants from laughing watching this video!!!!
😂😂❤️
This is the best thing I’ve watched in a long time 🤣 could not stop laughing
was honestly dying of laughter the stranger the funnier with joe and its honestly to cute how you both have the same sense of humour (: <3
How did she react so well to joe singing to her at 12am😂 Is this just a normal thing?
I love that she laughs even at being woken up in the night and is a good sport. She seems really sweet
I kill my old man if he started sing to me at midnight
Joe that was amazing you made my day, brilliant x
Well this was the weirdest YouTube notification I've had in a while 😂
Wait this is so funny
Simultaneously the cutest and weirdest thing I’ve ever seen 😂
this was everything 😂😂
the title defintley confused me-
Dianne joining in with Joe's midnight singing 😂 - these two are made for each other XXX
*hmm, interesting..*
Joe still makes me laugh even though I started watching him when I was 12 (now 18)
A ww2 bomb🤣🤣
Lockdown really gone to joes head.
Only joe
This is why we stan joe sugg 😂
My girlfriend and I give each other pebbles all the time! Can confirm it is always very cute
this video was very questionable but somehow also enjoyable??
Loved it 🥰 thank god you skipped the Giraffe one 😖
Ok, this is really sweet and hilarious! 😊🤣 But a spider, Joe?! Really? 🙈🕷
Only Joseph Sugg would have this idea and i'm not entirely sure why i have decided to click on it but here i am.
When Dianne started singing along with Joe I knew for sure they gonna last
This was the weirdest but funniest video I think I've ever watched😭
The way Dianne joined In with the duet at midnight cracked me up😂😂
If I say I started screeching when he got up at midnight it would not be an understatement—my brother actually rushed in to see if I was, thankfully, being murdered.  *SPOILER ALERT: I wasn't.*
Absolutely died at the Kiwi one 😂
quite possibly the weirdest, yet funniest thing I’ve just watched 😂😂❤️
Next video: How I Lost My Girlfriend
I loved that video it was so cute I learnt so much thanks Joe for the educational videos 💕
Didn't know this was something that I needed to see. But here I am 😂
The first one is to keep the aliens 👽 out
earlyyyy
officially the most unusual titled video of 2020
Joe this is one of your best videos hands down
The first  proper kiss joes posted and its a funny cute and didcusting one🤣🥺❤️
joe sugg is now my new science teacher :)
loved this ! definitely worth the wait
Awhh the fact Joanne loved the stone was so cute 😂❤️🥺
I ngl I think joe has lost the plot 😂😂
What the hell is this 🤣🤣
I learned lots today
So good and funny video
This video was very ... how do I put it.   Out of the ordinary?
Loving the video so far !!! 🤩 thank you for the great content your such an inspiration 🥰🥰
Your bloody crazy but I love it haha 😂
I've never laughed so hard at any vlog 😂😂😂 Safe to say never use the White fronted parrot technique to attract your girlfriend 🤢😂😂
Omg laughed way to hard at the kiwi bird
The giraffe one got me 😂
10:10 Hi Nike!
is anyone else having flashbacks to him reacting to the seahorse giving birth?
I love this, it’s hilarious
how do ideas like these come into your head 😂 not complaining at all though. bloody love you 😂❤️
Joes back❤️❤️❤️❤️
I CANNOT BREATHE 😭😭
This is the weirdest video but I’m actually crying 😂😂
We almost got a Joanne kiss💋😭😂
Joe what was going through your head when you thought of this?
id love to know how joe got this idea in the first place 😂😭 officially lost the plot
I was terrified of this title but it’s hilarious
I saw the title and I was like oh shit okay here we go
If you did that to me at 3am, you would be SO dead... 🤣🤣🤣 Also... @DianneBuswell: i think Joe is trying to tell you something...
Im laughing so hard lol
I cant believe he pulled off the vomit one im crying hahahaahah
He actually got up at midnight to do this....... What a mad lad
I literally cannot stop laughing what even is this 😭😭😂😂
7:07
if i was dianne i would’ve been SO annoyed that i was woken up but she lived for the duet and honestly that video is now gonna live in my mind rent free💀
Only Dianne would sing with him at 12am after being woken up for a mating singing session
There’s going to be some weird news articles this week
Ok u need a sponsor from David Attenborough 😄😄🤣
THE SINGING OF AINT NO MOUNTAIN HIGH ENOUGH SENT ME😭😂😂😂😂 the hand gestures as well, Joe is still the funniest
The singing I SCREAMED😂😂😂😂
If my boyfriend did stuff to me like this all week I would think he's gone mental haha 🤣
*Joe pushes nest on Dianne* Dianne: --🤚--
The part where he started singing at midnight had me crying 😭😭
It’s not... could it be? I don’t believe it... is this a sugg Sunday? 😮
already know this is going be be one of the weirdest videos ever 😂
I'm half way through and already cry laughinggg😂😭
This is the earliest I’ve been in years
I was just rewatching the It’s All about You(tube) video then I got this notification. Can’t believe it was so long ago but Joe is so good that we are all still subscribed x
I just wanna know how the hell you came up with this idea 🤣🤣
Wow this is so interesting joe thank you
I already know I am gonna love this video
Content that nobody asked for, because we didn’t know we needed it
I just know Joe was watching one of those David documentaries when he thought of this video idea
I just already know this would be funny! 🤣😂
I havnt even started the video but i know it will be a banger, joe never disappoints❤️😂
No one Dianne:where did you find the cushions Joe:the sofa  Only dianne could say that😂😂
YouTube let’s notify the m two minutes late
and i was thinking you were scaring here 💀the fawk
haven’t watched joe in like 4 years what have I come back to :|
I love the start 😂😂😂
this is gonna be hilarious
Omg this is gonna be amazing, I know it!
animal mating rituals wasnt what i thought this video was gonna be but i love it all the same 😂😂
Yessss first post in monthhsss
This is gonna be weirdddd but I’m so here for it 😂😂
I already know that this video is gonna be one for the ages 😂😂
I actually love this idea wtf you’re so random 😂
This is not joe such content
Won't lie I forgot Joe existed for like 2 years
I haven’t even watched, but the title tells me that this is going to be weird😂
What a great video to watch when you're sleep deprived makes it even better than it already is
Im in the middle of rewatching hello neighbour 🤣🤣💖💖
no one:  absolutely no one:  joe: super sturdy! *crashes
Who owns that much tinfoil
Gets notification that Joe uploaded: alright I’ll wait until I’ve finished my homework  Reads title: Um this might be an interesting one, *sets homework aside*
this is the weirdest video title ever.
David Attenborough is quaking
Maranda sings who????????
does this mean sugg sunday is back????
Questionable
I am already confused, slightly worried.. but I'm intrigued!!
very scared as to the fact that im doing this sorta thing in science right now 😂😂😳
nothing about "Testing out 'Animal Mating Rituals' on my girlfriend for a week" suggests running out of video ideas, 100%
Can safely say this got him less action
Unusual but not surprised as it's Joe.
well this title wasn’t what i was expecting when i looked at your story earlier 😂
Possibly one of the weirdest titles I've seen on my notifications 😭😂
Omf best notification to pop up on my screen, glad to have you back joe 🙌🏻🥰
This wasn’t the video title I was excepting tbh😂
David Attenborough is 94 now   Wow
Of all titles we get this! 🤣😂
I’ve only watched 5 secs I’m laughing already 😂
ThatcherJoe is slowly making a return and I’m not complaining❤️
i guess you were right when you said you didn’t think we’d guess the video...
I did not expect this 😂
This was the last thing I was expecting 😂😂😂😂😂
Thank u for always making me smile!!
haven't even watched the video yet but joes david attenborough impression is on point!!
The title I-
Joseph. What the hell.
I love this so much,, so funny😂❤️
I know from the title this is going to be very interesting to say the least 😂
well when you said it’s never been done before, you were right 😭
Interesting
This is the weirdest shit ever but it’s 2020 why not😂👁👄👁
Omg he posted!!!!!!!
😂😂😂
you said weird.. i didnt think it was THIS weird
This is the kind of content I love 😂😭
Never thought I’d see this
Nobody: Joe: MAKING OUR QUARANTINES A BILLION TIMES BETTER!!  (I also started a channel of my own and any support would mean the world to me!! Thank you so much for your time <3)
oh how i’ve missed these main channel videos
e x c u s e    m e
joe took being fan of david attenborough to another level...
Early
I think he's seen too many David attenborough documentaries
my reaction when I saw the title:   WHAT THE HELL JOE  seriously though, this is weird even for you
Hello

im so excited for this 😂
I love you both joe xx
The weirdest title I’ve ever seen... only joe
well this is going to be interesting 😂😂
This looks hilarious 😂
😂😂 this is the content I live for
I already know this is gonna be one of the weirdest thatcher joe videos ever but I know I’ll love it 😂
I am deeply concerned for their sanity
😂😂

Can’t wait ❤️😆

hello joe! how was your day?
But does he reply to YouTube comments?
Sooo excited to watch this !!

I’m not sure if joe is okay at this point
