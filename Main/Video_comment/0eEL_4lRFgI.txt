And he is ready togo liverpool.Everytime its the same thing 😢
Our levi ackerman
Any poshton over here
Konate in Pashto language  means "Ass".
Il joue comme Yaya toure , il est tres bon !
Pocketed ronaldo 😆🔥
5-0
Thankyou Leipzig. This guy just destroyed Man Utd YNWA
Konate  destroyed Manchester United 😂🤣
Dcx
Worst league 🇩🇪 to best league in the world 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Looked so good vs Man United today.
ความเร็วมี ทักษะพอมีจับมาเล่นcdmได้ไม่
is he replacement of gini ?
another leipzeg join liverpool
A welcome addition to the team, excited with what I've seen already.
me too
Damn what a centenrback
The goal he scored was masterclass.
Its hard to defeat a tall deffender like Konate  Welcome to LFC
My favorite moment? when he signed
This boy reminds me with yaya toure ,, I think he got too.much room for improving , good for liverpool to have such a talent
he sucks lol
Is he predominantly a right-sided CB? Like how VvD is predominantly a LCB although right-footed, would he play RCB while Upamecano played LCB?
spero venga al Milan!!
Fantastic konate
Yes LFC know what they are doing!!!! Welcome to the Great scouse wall!!!
I think liverpool already found wignaldum replacement.
I truly believe Liverpool just got a monster deal this guy will be a massive talent and Liverpool for me have best back 5 in world football
Fan fact: 90% of people here are Liverpool fans
YNWA
An amazing prospect 👍
As there any pakhtun here ??🤣🤣
Robbo - van Dijk - Konate - Trent. What a defense line up.
welcome to the red
YNWA..YOU ARE WELCOME
this dude is big af. welcome to livepool big guy
Can't lie I wanted Ramos as a Liverpool fan.
We Africans love bro You will never walk alone
The Rock. Reminds me of Lilian Thuram
Fewer goals against liverpool next season. Defence scored up
welcome to the REDs
A great passer, good in the air, tackling not his strongest suit.. Welcome to Premier League.. Let's see how well you adapt..
A young version of Koulibaly
Van dijk and konate will be the dream
my mate david liked the one bit earlier when he went through and scored at goal. #YNWA
Favourite moment still to come. At Anfield for Liverpool!!
Lest see how he does in EPL, he looks strong but slow in some aspects!
Top tier players, Always welcome at Anfield, gl konate, ur going to fit in here perfectly mate 👌
One more Great signing from klopp
VVd, Matip, Gomez ,Konate at CB,  Robbo, TAA at the side, Thor at the GK seriously this is world best defense
This guy remind of sakho. Technically good defender
Can't really compare to Premier league it will be Phillips starting this season and vvd
0:36 even Sadio Mane can't complete those one-two's and end up scoring. He is good.
Welcome. To Liverpool
I can't wait for Nat phillips and Konate partnership .
got to be honest as a LFC fan, a lot of those challenges would have been a penalty in the prem LOL
Penalties he'll give away penalties 😂😂😂😂
He looks so calm like VVD
Wait, he is copying van Dijk
Liverpool bout to make front 3s cry
I’m a Liverpool fans but we need to admit that we afraid that konate gonna be Matip 2.0
Welcome to the Liverpool back 3: Konate, VVD and Gomez.
Alisson Trent Konate Van Dijk Robertson Fabinho  The best back 6 in world football
Basically we are getting a defender who's willing to lick grasses and get dirty in the mud to keep opponents from scoring against us. We have very good defenders, but none of them do this 2:12 risking his balls from being stamped on. A monster defender.
Unfortunately I reckon some of those challenges would be given against him in the prem. Gone bloody soft
Can’t wait for him to com to Liverpool
Alisson wont have any work to do next season. Man should just sit on the bench
Wow so impressive
Smartest signing in 2021 Liverpool will be solid in defence IK&VVD this could be awsome enough to win the league nest season Klopp quietly working away in the background all the focus has been off him hes still creating team Kĺopp is goìng to be awsome i cant wait
Welcome to Liverpool!
This isnt Ibrahim sange
Sorry guys his a good player but I really hope he flops at Liverpool sorry
Him VVD and Gomez as a back 3, in a 343
Liverpool ♥️♥️ welcome
Van dyk in making ❤️
Welcome to Liverpool konate 🦏🦏🦏
This guy on Fifa Mobile is crazy. (And In real life 😂)
composure
Conate is good. Power, strength, pace  tackles  passes,running  with ball and goals He's got everything.  Klopp will go back 3 for Liverpool and TAA will do more attacking, crosses, and runs without the worry for defending
Another Black VVD
i hope Konate can adapt quickly.. it is not easy in EPL 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
2:10 i'm missing something? how is that a good tackle?
Welcome to Liverpool.❤️🔥
He's gonna learn soooooo much from Klopp and Virgil. Such raw talent waiting to be extended further.  Imagine the level this guy will be at in 4 yrs time... 🤯
Plays like Matip
Daaaamn hes good.. pairing with vvd will be awesome
Konate looks amazing but they forgot to mention his frequent injuries, just like Liverpool’s other CBs...
Him VVD and Gomez in a back 3 with Trent and Robbo flying up and down the wings will be unstoppable
Vip
He is really good but is injury prone
Welcome to melwood
Wow...could be a most important signing! Go Konate!👍
Dithers criminally but times it perfectly 🤔
According to YouTube subtitles, his name is Ibrahimovic Konate 😅
2:28 exactly like Van Dijk throwing the attackers out of the way every time! A steady back four with VVD-Konate, a hardworking midfield , and then Robbo and Trent will keep bombing forward. After that our attackers can wreak havoc now that Jota has already shown what he can do in a red shirt (for both Liv and Portugal) 😎
Collosus
2:28 Lewan please sit down       no disrespect Lewandowski is one of my fav striker
Dayum! Imagine having Konate and Virgil Van djik together. Liverpool's defense will be a fortress
Liverpool should be winning the league back next season
Welcome , he’ll have a prem winners medal this time next year
ozan kabak
Kote!!!
🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳
Thanks bundesliga channel from a liverpool fan
Me: Konate is a defender I am only interested in his defensive skills.  Me: Remembers Alisons season saving header.  Me:
Konate + virgil
He is better than Upamecano, way underrated.
He looks clumsy
YNWA
Hmmm, I'm not sure. We'll see.
Welcome to Liverpool, karate, now lets get some Bruce Lee moves working, like the 1 inch block.
What a goal he scored
@t   @/dvd   @/vhs @/tv  @/vcr  @/toys
Konate is only 11 years old
Hello my Liverpool lads, we're gathered here today by YouTube algorithm
You will never walk alone
Looks like new Phil Babb
U can't tell much from vids like this in Premier league u need to stand up and not go to ground otherwise ur likely to give away free kicks and penalties  His been a bit injury prone hope that's just temporary as Liverpool already have three very good central defenders  but two of them in Joe and Joel very injury prone
he is good. Maybe a bit too good for being benched by Van Dijk and Nathaniel ´Natdini´ Phillips
i think kabak is as good as konate liverpool should keep kabak at only 18m bargain
The wall of China: Actual wall The wall of Liverpool: VVD and Konate
He looks class ❤️😍  Welcome to LFC, Ibra! ❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍
2:11 that looks like a penalty via VAR
My favourite moment being transferred this man to Liverpool
Tackles a bit like zouma
Sche*ße Premier League!
Arsenal misses out
Great signing by the Reds,but come on fsg sign up salah to a new deal ASAP that will be the best bit of business you can do this year
Waiting for that last Haaland vid 😬
Like matip
Great to get Konate, such an early transfer job done. Shame about letting Kabak go with Matip/Gómez injury prone
YNWA
Yaya
Is this guy actually good?
Neneng Matip kedua
Welcome to Liverpool my brother. I’m so excited I signed you to my fifa 21 career mode alongside VVD and use are unstoppable on the game for far! I can’t wait! YOU WILL NEVER WALK ALONE 🔥🔥🔥
Just saying the likelihood of injuring your other knee when you come back from an ACL is pretty high... so let's look forward to konate + phillips next season and be realistic, otherwise just fk off
Not sure if i understand the amount of centre backs that liverpool are buying at the moment... if van diyk and gomez are back next season, plus phillips, williams, davies, kabak who's gone and whoever else is in the youth squad... why get another one...
Очень умный защитник, Эдакая вторая версия Ван Дейка, только черная ) вполне годный трансфер для Ливерпуля, теперь защита будет наводить настоящий страх в европе
Or the possibility interazione
في الريدز الموسم المقبل اللي جاي يشوف بعد معرفت انتقاله إلى الرتدز يجي جانبي
Bundesliga when a player is about to leave: *MoNtAgE TiMe*
Kabak Or konate, who is better? I see many lfc fans upset bcz they didn't sign kabak..
This guy is also playing quielty and confidently like Van Dijk. Welcome to the Red Family, Ibrahima!
My favourite moment was how he took the ball and stopped the ball from being a corner kick
Hopefully konate will show his magical skills, tackes and goals for Liverpool
we need a striker and a midfielder now
Why is everyone forgetting about joe Gomez :(
A lot of people maybe don't appreciate how having Konate would allow liverpool to play with 3 at the back, more options
Best of luck to him at Liverpool❤️
Welcome... Welcome. 🔥🔥♥️♥️♥️👍👍👍👍👍👍
Seems like a very similar player to Zouma.
“The Great Wall of Liverpool” era has begun!
This bloke is a right unit, can't wait to see him with VVD! YNWA.
Konate + Virgil = Great Wall of LFC
Welcome to the best Club man 💯❤️
Yo bisa yok juara lagi
LFC! We never walk alone....the Klopmeister will come back with the boys stronger than ever
Best moment is that he's going to play at Liverpool next season
Can liverpool play 3 cb now? 343
2:27 🙄🤭Lewandoski
Same absolutely incredible konate welcome to the club star
I don't think other official League channels have understood YouTube as well as the Bundesliga. Moments after LFC sign Konate, they bring out these 'special skills' video, which will fetch them hits!
wow, i can feel the attempts and efforts making this video. definitely the top sport.
00:24 I could've sworn Liverpool bought a defender not a striker
Ko pas d persib ga gtu si :(
Konate, Virgil Van Dijk, Joe Gomez, Joel matip, Kabak, Phillips, ben davies, Tmisikas, Billy, Trent and Andy Robertson Liverpool defense is crazy Also, they could sign Aymeric Laporte from Man city
Last time Bundesliga made a video on Timo Werner, he seem to be literally scoring every single chance he got.
super right legged..
Reflection of Yaya Toure.
2:37 "alhamdullilah"
2:10 this was exqusite🔥🔥 Wlcm to liverpool 🔥🔥❤
Good job Liverpool ! Good job Klopp! You need to know fotball to have this knowledge to buy this kind of players that most of people don t see the potential ! Liverpool strikes again !!! <3
That tackle
Another amateur defender for Liverpool  I hope their rivals don't make a meal out of him
Plz don't get injured in your first season 😅
MY BOTHA, WELCOME TO LIVERPOOL
Next: Welcome to Roma Sabitzer
next neuhas ?
He’s a beast
ถ้าเล่นได้ตามนี้จริง ก็คือสายแทงค์งานดี แต่กลัวแบบคนก่อน ตอนเป็นศัตรูโคตเก่ง พอเอามาเป็นพวกคือกากลง
At least if the front three gets injured we can put this young fella up front am looking forward to the the season all ready and that’s just one player in all ready let’s see what happens I hope kloop gets is first choice targets because we are going to be some well oiled machine next season bring it on city
Some of his tackles were sure penalty as he didn't touch the ball first. If the player were clever enough and had the intention to dive, then a penalty might be awarded. He might need to be adjusted himself as if the players dive, then he might concede too many penalties.
Welcome to Liverpool Ibrahima, from here on out you'll never walk alone!
Move to Liverpool 👍
Ah so all this while he's been playing fr leipzig🤦‍♂️
Think klopp could use him as a cm
His first goal fr the club
Ynwa
He’s like a magical unicorn.
I feel The English referees would have robbed him of that unreal tackle at 2:00
What a player ma sha allah
Konate + VVD = 5 Goal conceded 2021/22 epl season.
Him and van dijk up front
is he a ball playing defender like van dijk, bonucci, or a simple thick wall like koulibaly?
A steal compared to Maguire
dope guy... pls come to my team.... his hands are so funny while running... like those huge baloon dolls
Him and Van Djik will be unstoppable next season 😍💪
Can any Leipzig fans elaborate on his injury record? I heard that some of his injuries were due to Lepizig staff mismanaging him and rushing him back too early, is this true?
May Not be the best league... But definitely the coolest
Did he just bully Lewandoski?? I think he's gonna do just fine in the Premier League!
My favorite moment when he signed that damn agreement with Liverpool
Welcome to Liverpool YNWA ❤️
Gomez is quicker Konate and Gomez in my opinion are equally good. Konate for head clearances would be better than Gomez. I think Gomez before injury had a very good season. Look forward to having him at Liverpool. YNWA
Magnifique
Just another Sakho😳  French Center Backs don't succeed at Liverpool
Can’t wait for Martin Tyler to butcher his name
Kon-a-TAY ❤️🔴🔴🔴 YNWA
just hope he can still fix...too many miss games bcause of injured..
VVD , robbo, konate and TAA omg 🔥ali won’t have anything to do 😅🤣. Welcome to the family . YNWA
The Best Football League Chamnel out there. Kudos to d Admin♥️
Better than upamecano
I wonder why there aren't many clips of him. Then realized he's only 22 few days ago
Konate and VVD 🔥
Ibrahima Konaté welcome to Anfield. #YNWA
Better than upamecano
Looks big and strong but his stats aren't that good. Worth a gamble at the price - but he is a gamble imo.
After naby Keita..Im scared to expect much from Bundesliga players in Liverpool
Welcome to the family, YNWA
Welcome Konate!! YNWA
He has just two long foot. He hadn't nothing
I can see him being like Fofana
Welcome Liverpool
If these are his highlights then city has ntn to worry about...a fluups shot and score and about 6 goal line clearance and preventing corners from conceded😂😂😂this is a joke
ポテンシャルの高さは半端ないなー 心配なのは怪我だけだ
Liverpool fans weren't sure if he is Good enough and then Bundesliga decided to show them what he is all about and now everyone is happy.
well good luck in the prem ibrahima you're welcome to the bundesliga any time you want (probably in the future)
He's 6ft  4 he's like a door, konate ,konate. ..could be the next song on the kop.....
I’m so exited 😻😻😻🤩🤩🤩🔴🔴🔴
#YNWA ♥️
Good player Liverpool fan
Welcome to Liverpool 🤩
He is absolute beast.... Strong, agile and very good with the ball in his feet....
That’s why lfc signed him
excited for this signing! hopefully he can add some mass towards his lower calves. too many broken leg injuries have stemmed from weak skinny calves/shins.
One last video before joining Liverpool
Welcome to Anfield the home of the Redmen YNWA
Ynwa looks like we signed a beauty
Good signing
put this man in the mid field jesus christ
Vandijk Konate = 🧱
Liverpool line up next year : Well how i would like it to be.                Konate.      VVD Joe.                                           Robbo             Fab.             Thiago                      TAA     MO.                             MANE/ OX               BOBBY/JOTA
That 'dither' looked more like great awareness to me. Let it come across his body because it would be out of the attacking player's path.
Looks cumbersome, gangly and uncoordinated. Reminds me of Mammadou Sakho 😂😂
Could be  the next viera
Welcome to Liverpool ibrahima konote wish you the best
Only thing stopping me being excited about him is his injury record over 400 days out over the last 3 seasons
If he can remain fit he is going to be vital for Liverpool. Looks like a good buy, let's hope he turns out to be a great one.
Welcome to Liverpool FC OUR new no 5.
This account is smart ✌🏾👀
I always thought he was better than Upamecano..great signing for Liverpool..Good luck for next season from a Gooner.
Name a better love story than bundesliga and liverpool fans.they literally predict what we want
I'm as excited as most but everyone just assuming he's going to walk into starting XI must have just started supporting us and don't know Klopp very well. Matip was instrumental in our Champions winning campaign. Just awesome. And Gomez was an ever present when we walked the league last season. If everyone stats fit then then Konate definitely has his work cut out to become a first team regular.
I feel sorry for RB leipzig  ,they loose many of good players.
Legend.
Leipzig in the process of getting raided by all teams just like Ajax a few years back
Maybe turn him into defensive midfielder still young, might be wasted at the back looks like he has some really good attributes, think toure, vieira.
We should have the following in our squad in order of - Virgil, Gomez, Konate,  Natt, Matip, Williams. We shouldn't sell CBs. The lack of replacement of Lovren cost us this season.
Liverpool fans said that also with ozan kabak
konate + vvd = very great wall
Gomez will start over him?
Van Dijk and Konate are gonna be a menace during corners.
This guy is about to be one of the best defenders to grace the planet 🌏
Looks class, but do we really need another CB I think Phillips has earned his spot. Under Klopp Phillips will become an all round better player: he’s a monster in the air, he’s no nonsense. I think 34m could’ve gone towards either another back up for the front 3 or a world class replacement for wijnaldum. Just my opinion (Liverpool fan)
Bundesliga uploaded this in perfect timing
To be fair he is so similar to VVD
Two big men in the middle , 👍🏽👍🏽
Not sure after signing naby keita for 60m from this team and league and seeing Werner for Chelski can not take videos of him seriously
Bundesliga have great talents in every team👍👍👍
And he is to blossom more with the guidance of a coach like klopp and players like vvd
kabak cries on corner side of bed
Is everyone going to pretend like Upamayecano was not their first option
New version of Terry.
If this guy can stop lewa then he cant stop any player in this world for sure,good luck in liverpool konate👍👍👍
bundeslliga knows who the big audience is hahahha
His nik  name is ibo
After his signing I can say that RB Leipzig is the new 2014 Southampton FC for Liverpool.. 😂😂.
Welcome To Liverpool
Against bayern and big team every defender then go to ghost mode and no one can stop bayern from scoring
The robotic brother of Upamecano
Not a fan of any Bundesliga team but for sure going to watch it next season
Liverpool love a strong defence
Leipzig always recruiting great younger talent and selling each one with great benefits
Like koulibaly
https://youtu.be/P02Cp-OwM8U
Him and Van Dijk together would be a disaster for others🙄
Welcome to Anfield, Konate!
YNWA
Colossus
Liverpool with the back 3 shift 🔥
Konate and Virgil 😭😭🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Sad thing is Virgil will never be at the level he was at before his acl injury
Two agile quick monsters at the back for Liverpool next year. Going to a be unit, Trent and Andy licking their lips knowing they don’t have to run back 😂😂😂
ozan>konate
now we need to buy medfielder with a magic touch and winger then forward.
To be honest, not much aware about him, looks promising in the vedios. I thought that we could have purchased kabak for 18 for he was awesome in some games. Still we trust our transfer committee headed by Michael Edwards. #ynwa welcome lad.
Fav moment 🙄 When he signed for LFC . We'll take good care of him RB
Looks like poor man's Kurt Zouma!
Welcome my bro to Liverpool
Liverpool telling the world therre serious about winning not like arsenal
What a player. Great signing Reds.
Welcome to Liverpool!!!
How tf ManU didn't battle for this amazing defender . Good at tackling, passing , press resistance, heading clearance, speed everything what defender supposed to be .  May B ManU board was searching for Overrated English defender for 150 million . And it's good for KONATE he will not be racially abused at Liverpool  tho.
That first goal was like prime Yaya Toure!
The Bundesliga have one of the best highlights channels. Welcome to LFC Ibrahima!
Video: which was your favorite moment? Literally everyone: WELCOME TO LIVERPOOL
welcome to the #Anfield Konate  🧡🧡
His pace is lethal hopefully no serious injury in future
Welcome to Liverpool.💯
I hope Konate shines at Liverpool
good signings for liverpool 🔥
Liverpool missed such long legs this season due to injuries... Hope we all are back strong and in form. You will not walk alone 👍
admin wants to farm the lfc views. im here for you buddy 👍🏻
Massive respect and love for Nat Phillips as a Liverpool fan but he is not at the level yet which we need him to be. Konate is the guy for Liverpool.
Welcome to LFC
Nat Phillips is better
Welcome to the Best team in the World. #YNWA. ❤️🔴
How to get high views 101. Post the highlight of the player after getting a hype transfer.
BALLER
What a signing for Liverpool!
Happy 😃 Days YNWA lad see you next season
Can’t believe that vvd and konate’ will play together
Any Leipzig fans here. What are his qualities, strengths and weaknesses??
Welcome to Dover Athletic
Must say. Nice pick up for Liverpool. As I am a Manchester United fan but nice one from them.
kONATE is a penalty waiting to happen
Looks a bit clumsy. Good luck to him all the same
#YNWA...Ready Made Partner for Virgil...Welcome to Liverpool
We will definitely turn him into The Next Blanc
With such slow gameplay he will flop miserably in the pl.
Welcome to Liverpool my G🔥
Welcome to Liverpool FC! #ynwa
We need a reliable free kick taker,remember when we used to have Coutihno and the free kick is outside the box,that was a sure bet
Me seeing the title:Oh he is going to be beast with VVD next season
Any other Liverpool fans here watching Konate after today's news?
Didnt liverpool learned from nabil keita ? He ll flop
Gald he not going bayan munich
Welcome to Liverpool ,have great partnership with vvd
Which foot he good at ? Left/right/both ?
Welcome maaaan, YNWA! 💪🔴
KONATE X NATHANIEL PHILLIPS X VVD X GOMEZ    Prem ain’t ready for a back 8
YNWA
They ll poach all the players from the Bundesliga and when Bayern win it they cry ohh it's  farmers league and other bs.
Welcome to anfield
Some of his tackles are Grand in the bundesliga but it the premier league they'll probably be red card offences
Welcome to Liverpool. #YNWA
Thanks Adminho....great video, explaining all Liverpool fans like me why we bought him!
Talented boy , I feel he should sign for Liverpool in the future
Liverpool fans And those who hate Liverpool should be here
Honestly I Konate believe we just signed him
Another matip so good defender but a  Lot of injuries
Welcome to the greatest club in the world 🔴. YNWA
Excellent signing. Klopp is about turn this guy into an absolute superstar 🤩🔴🔴
Imagine him and VVD pairing up in the defence line for Liverpool next season 😍
Great signing from Liverpool . - arsenal fan
Welcome to Liverpool! YNWA.
Another Leipzig player to epl hope he plays like turbo timo😀
Welcome Ibrahima Konate to Liverpool 🔴🔴🔴🔴 #YNWA
Welcome
Welcome to the biggest club in England 🙌❤️
Konata & van Dijk,gomez & philips! Liverpool!
Konate > Dias
Leipzig selling their best players again 🤦🏽‍♂🤦🏽‍♂
Konate is better than van dijk
Welcome to liverpool this is manu fan from republic of Somalia
Finally Liverpool can rely on a perfect VVD replacement
Can't wait debut at liverpool
Konate will need to work on his fitness. Under Jürgen Klopp, he will do wonders.  As for Leipzig, a big loss for them, but they'll surely swap two CB's from Salzburg right?
#WelcomeToLiverpool I know you all are here after his   move to Liverpool FC was made official.A huge step forward for his career coming to the Anfield . Fans are  gonna love you,Konate.
Welcome to Liverpool, Konate! 🔴
Time to celebrate🎉
You are welcome to Anfield Konate YNWA 💥💥💥
that first goal is class
Welcome to Liverpool 😎👍
Bundesliga is the super market for Permier league
Bundesliga, what have you done. Bayern have already gotten upamecano, because you posted it. Now someone will take Konate away from leipzig. How will they cope with the loss?
Welcome to Liverpool   Ynwa
the teamwork, skill movement and goal with his left foot was fabulous
Welcome to Liverpool ❤️🔥❤️
RB need some rebuilding at the back, they lost Upa and Konate. Big loss
WELCOME TO THE BEST CLUB IN THE WORLD 🔴 YNWA
Liverpool defenders : Van Dijk + Konaté = 🔥  Can’t wait to see Konaté plays with Van Dijk
Welcome lad this player is going to be special
Wait whuuttt? Konaté and Upamecano aren't the same person?!?!
RB Leipzig bros tell me is it a good transfer?
Bundesliga, most underrated league in Football and I am a Liverpool fan
Everyone’s talking about VVD & Konate but I’m thinking long term, if they stay injury free Konate+Gomez can be one of the best centre back pairings for the next 8+ years.
Kingkong😅😄😃
Last time Liverpool signed a Leipzig player, it didn't go too well Hope Konate turns out to be a good signing for Liverpool
Adhminho is better than Him🤟
talented and a player with a lot of potential
In liverpool.. Good job
Another flop at LFC. Trust me. come here again after half of the next season. im from future tho
Welcome to Liverpool konate YNWA
WELCOME TO THE BEST CLUB IN THE WORLD 🔴 YNWA
Bundesliga Produces World Class players🔥🔥🔥  Other league fans should stop calling Bundesliga "farmer's league". They aren't Farmers league but Most Underrated League in Football👍👍

Konate/virgil😍 can’t wait
The bundesliga likes the young French defenders😅
Welcome to liverpool chief
YOU NEVER WALK ALONE
Farewell to 🐐 defender ever but he will join another club next season  btw Good Luck Konate🔥
I seriously hope my club was as efficient at making transfers as are our rival clubs are.
Konate is a beast defender 💪💪💪

Hello adminho
Yo Bundesliga!
